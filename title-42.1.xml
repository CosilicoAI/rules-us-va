OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Qualifications of librarians.  The term librarian historically appears to be a term of art referring to what now is understood to be the library director or library administ rator. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 69 (11/4/04). This section and § 42.1-52 require that librarians in local or regional libraries, in the position of director, and other persons holding full-time professiona l positions deemed by the local or regional library to require American Library Association-equivalent training, shall meet the qualification standards established by the Library Board. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chai rman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 69 (11/4/04). No Virginia statute requires the Library Board to offer a dual-track certification if the Board deems an American Library Association-based certification to be su fficient; if the Board elects to implement a certification process that is not approved by the Association, however, legislation or regulations may be necessary to authorize the Board to provide standards and guidance for such alternative credentialing, including express authorization to grandfather librarians who obtained their Library of Virginia certification for life prior to repeal of the State Board for the Certification of Librarians. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E . Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 69 (11/4/04). The intent of the librarian certification statute is to encourage that all public libraries have at least one credentialed director/librarian available to that li brary system, as well as an American Library Association-credentialed librarian, or a similarly credentialed professional, for positions deemed by the local bodies to require such specialized training; it is incumbent on each local or regional library bo ard to determine whether any particular position constitutes a full-time professional librarian position as described in this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va. A G LEXIS 69 (11/4/04). The Library Board is not authorized to grandfather librarians serving before 1988, who do not meet current qualifications. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Peter E. Broadbent, Jr., Chairman, The Library Board, 04-067, 2004 Va.
