The Commonwealth cannot abridge such rights except as a reasonable exercise of its police powers when (i) it is clearly found that such abridgment is necessary for the protection or preservation of the he alth, safety, and welfare of the public and (ii) any such abridgment is no greater than necessary to protect or preserve the public health, safety, and welfare. No regulation shall be imposed upon any profession or occupation except for the exclusive purpose of protecting the public interest when: 1. The u nregulated practice of the profession or occupation can harm or endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, and the potential for harm is recognizable and not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument; 2. The practice of the profession or occupation has inherent qualities peculiar to it that distinguish it from ordinary work and labor; 3. The practice of the profession or occupation requires specialized skill or training and the public needs, and will benefit by, assurances of initial and continuing professional and occ upational ability; and 4. The public is not effectively protected by other means.No regulation of a profession or occupation shall conflict with the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Virgin ia, the laws of the United States, or the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Periodically and at least annually, all agencies regulating a profession or occupation shall review such regulations to ensure that no conflict exists.

House Joint Resolution No. 32 of the 1984 Acts of Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to make a study of Title 54 and report its findings in the form o f a recodification of the title to the Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia. In January 1988, its report, containing a proposed revision of Title 54, was sent to the Governor and the General Assembly. The report was published as House Document N o. 23 of the 1988 Session and served as the basis for Title 54.1, which was enacted by Acts 1988, c. 765, effective January 1, 1989. Acts 1988, c. 765, cl. 2 through 5 provide: 2. That whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section, article or chapter of Title 54 or any other title of this Code as such titles existed prior to July 1, 1988 are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section, article or chapter of this title or any other title of this Code and whenever any such former section, a rticle or chapter is given a new number in this or any other title, all references to any such former section, article or chapter of Title 54 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article or c hapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, contents or portions thereof. 3. That the regulations of the Department of Commerce and the Department of Health Regulatory Boards and the regulatory boards within the Departments in effec t on the effective date of this act shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated under this act. 4. That this recodification of Title 54 as Title 54.1 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any member of a board, council, co mmittee, or other appointed body referred to in Title 54.1, and each such officer and member shall continue to serve the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 54. 5. That this act shall be deemed to have been enacted prior to any other act enacted in the 1988 regular session of the General Assembly, and any act purporti ng to amend and reenact any law contained in Title 54 or Title 54.1 of the Code of Virginia is deemed to be added to, amendatory of, or a repealer of, as the case may be, any corresponding law contained in this act; provided, that effect shall be given t o such other or subsequent act only to the extent of any apparent changes in the law as it existed prior to the commencement of such session. Many of the cases cited in the notes under provisions of this title were decided under former Title 54 or prior law.

CASE NOTES Extent of requirem ent to have real estate license.  The requirement that those who act as a real estate broker in Virginia be licensed in Virginia extends not only to those who enter into a compensation contract wi th a seller or a purchaser but also to those who contract with each other to share commissions earned by the performance of such acts.

Non-professional corporation not permitted to practice medicine.  In a suit to enforce a non-compete covenant, § 54.1-2902 barred a non-professional corporation from practicing medicine since it was unlicensed; the corporatio n was therefore not permitted to engage in a competing medical practice with a physician, had no legitimate business interest in enforcing its non-compete covenant with the physician, and judgment for the corporation was error. Parikh v. Family Care Ctr. , Inc., 273 Va. 284, 641 S.E.2d 98, 2007 Va. LEXIS 37 (2007). Wrongful termination claim.  Although regulations of the state Board for Opticians prohibited opticians from engaging in false advertising, an optician failed to establish that he was wrongfu lly terminated for refusing to participate in his former employers sales scheme, which the employee contended was false and fraudulent, and which he further alleged would have subjected him to revocation of his opticians license, because the regu lations regarding this matter, 18 VAC 100-20-110 A 5, concerned publishing or causing to be published a false advertisement, and the employee was not involved in creating or publishing the allegedly false advertisements.

CASE NOTES Admini strative procedure met due process requirements.  Circuit court erred in suspending the revocation of a real estate agents license because the Real Estate Board of the Commonwealth of Virginia did not violate d the agents procedural due process rights when a reasonable reading of the initial notice clearly indicated that the agents prior criminal record would be before the Board and that it was actually required to consider it; the initial notice set forth the agents rights pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act, subsection A of § 2.2-4019, the grounds for disciplinary actions under 18 VAC 135-20-155, the actual language of § 54.1-204, and the fact that the Board was required t o consider the provisions of § 54.1-204 in making its determination. Commonwealth v. DeLapp, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 405 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2010).

The Board shall regulate only to the degree necessary to fulfill the need for regulation and only upon approval by the General Assembly. 1. Priva te civil actions and criminal prosecutions.  Whenever existing common law and statutory causes of civil action or criminal prohibitions are not sufficient to eradicate existing harm or prevent potential harm, the Board may first consider the recommen dation of statutory change to provide more strict causes for civil action and criminal prosecution. 2. Inspection and injunction.  Whenever current inspection and injunction procedures are not sufficient to eradicate existing harm, the Board may promulgate regulations consistent wit h the intent of this chapter to provide more adequate inspection procedures and to specify procedures whereby the appropriate regulatory board may enjoin an activity which is detrimental to the public well-being. The Board may recommend to the appropriat e agency of the Commonwealth that such procedures be strengthened or it may recommend statutory changes in order to grant to the appropriate state agency the power to provide sufficient inspection and injunction procedures. 3. Registration.  Whenever it is necessary to determine the impact of the operation of a profession or occupation on the public, the Board may implement a system of registration. 4. Certification.  When the public requires a substantial basis for relying on the professional services of a practitioner, the Board may implement a system of certification. 5. Licensing.  Whenever adequate regulation cannot be achieved by means other than licensing, the Board may establish licensing procedures for any particular profession or occupation. B. In determin ing the proper degree of regulation, if any, the Board shall determine the following: 1. Wheth er the practitioner, if unregulated, performs a service for individuals involving a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare. 2. The opinion of a substantial portion of the people who do not practice the particular profession, trade or occupation on the need for regulation. 3. The number of states which have regulatory provisions similar to those proposed. 4. Whether there is sufficient demand for the service for which there is no regulated substitute and this service is required by a substantial portion of the population. 5. Whether the profession or occupation requires high standards of public responsibility, character and performance of each individual engaged in the profession or occupation, as evidence d by established and published codes of ethics. 6. Whether the profession or occupation requires such skill that the public generally is not qualified to select a competent practitioner without some assurance that he has met minimum qu alifications. 7. Whether the professional or occupational associations do not adequately protect the public from incompetent, unscrupulous or irresponsible members of the profession or occupation. 8. Whether current laws which pertain to public health, safety and welfare generally are ineffective or inadequate. 9. Whether the characteristics of the profession or occupation make it impractical or impossible to prohibit those practices of the profession or occupation which are detrimental to the p ublic health, safety and welfare. 10. Whether the practitioner performs a service for others which may have a detrimental effect on third parties relying on the expert knowledge of the practitioner.

By Contractor. B. By Innocent Party. I.General Consideration. Editors note.  Most of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. This chapter is constitutional. F.S. Bowen Elec. Co. v. Foley, 194 Va. 92, 72 S.E.2d 388, 1952 Va. LEXIS 210 (1952); City of Portsmouth v. Fred C. Gardner Co., 215 Va. 491, 211 S.E.2d 259, 1975 Va. LEXIS 177 (1975). As a valid exercise of the police power.  Necessity of regulating the business of contractors is now widely recognized, and such regulations are a valid exercise of the police power of the State. F.S. Bow en Elec. Co. v. Foley, 194 Va. 92, 72 S.E.2d 388, 1952 Va. LEXIS 210 (1952). This chapter, designed to protect the public from inexperienced, unscrupulous, irresponsible, and incompetent contractors, is a valid exercise of the police power of the State. Bacigalupo v. Fleming, 199 Va. 827, 102 S.E.2d 321, 1958 Va. LEXIS 130 (1958). And is designed for protection of the public.  This chapter is designed to protect the public from inexperienced, unscrupulous, irresponsible, or incompetent contractors; to effectuate this purpose, it require s a demonstration of ability, character, and financial responsibility, as well as a good record of past performance. F.S. Bowen Elec. Co. v. Foley, 194 Va. 92, 72 S.E.2d 388, 1952 Va. LEXIS 210 (1952); City of Portsmouth v. Fred C. Gardner Co., 215 Va. 4 91, 211 S.E.2d 259, 1975 Va. LEXIS 177 (1975). Purpose of requiring registration of certain contractors is to protect the public from inexperienced, unscrupulous, irresponsible, or incompetent contractors, and in particular those who would enter into certain contracts with such contractors. Sutton Co. v. Wise Contracting Co., 197 Va. 705, 90 S.E.2d 805, 1956 Va. LEXIS 142 (1956). Ch apter must be strictly construed.  This chapter was enacted in the exercise of the States police power; though it has remedial features, it imposes restrictions upon a common trade or occupatio n, and being in derogation of the common law, it must be strictly construed. Sellers v. Bles, 198 Va. 49, 92 S.E.2d 486, 1956 Va. LEXIS 174 (1956). Regula tory character of chapter.  This chapter is regulatory in character, as distinguished from Title 58.1 which deals with revenue. City of Portsmouth v. Fred C. Gardner Co., 215 Va. 491, 211 S. E.2d 259, 1975 Va. LEXIS 177 (1975). Compliance with this chapter as well as revenue statutes required.  One who engages in a regulated business or profession must comply with both regulatory and revenue statutes. City of Portsmouth v. Fred C. Gardner Co., 215 Va. 49 1, 211 S.E.2d 259, 1975 Va. LEXIS 177 (1975). Substantial construction contracts not forbidden by chapter.  There is nothing immoral or contrary to public policy in a construction contract involving $30,000 or more, and this chapter does not expressly or impliedly forbi d such a contract; it merely prohibits unqualified persons, that is, those who have not registered or taken out the required license, from entering into such a contract.

No. 1-808 Complaint  Breach of a Construction Contract, etc. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 12A M.J. Licenses, § 23. CASE NOTES Legislative purpose.  The succession of statutory changes to this section demonstrates a legislative purpose to protect the public by penalizing contractors who are aware that the law applies to the business they are contemplating, but who nevertheless elect to ignore it. The legislative history and the case law together evidence an intention to strike a balance: To penalize those whose violations of the statutory scheme are knowing, but to excuse those who perform in good faith and whose violations are inadvertent. J.W. Woolard Mech. &amp; Plumbing, Inc. v. Jones Dev. Corp., 235 Va. 333, 367 S.E.2d 501, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2513, 1988 Va. LEXIS 48 (1988) (decided under former § 54-142). Unlicensed contractors who act in good faith may recover payment.  Pursuant to subsection C of § 54.1-1115, creditors who performed unlicensed contracting services were permitted to assert their claims against a debtors ba nkruptcy estate because evidence showing: (1) that one creditor was licensed in Maryland and worked on only one residence in Virginia; (2) that the other creditor was a handyman who was unaware of Virginias licensing requirements; and (3) that the cr editors were informed that they would be working under a general contractors license established that the creditors acted in good faith and without knowledge of Virginias licensing requirements. In re Anderson, 349 Bankr. 448, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 62582 (E.D. Va. 2006). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Defense to suit.  Construction companies were entitled to assert the alleged subcontractors lack of a license as a defense to alleged subcontractors interference with a con tract since the alleged subcontractor had not substantially performed the contract. Bowers Family Enters., L.L.C. v. Davis Bros. Const. Co., 55 Va. Cir. 11, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 230 (Richmond Feb. 8, 2001). Because there was no evidence that a contractor had actual knowledge of the statutory requirement for licensure, the contractors recovery on the contractor s claims for the provision of flooring services to an apartment complex was not barred by the statutory prohibition on a party engaging in, or offering to engage in, contracting work without holding a contractors license. Skipper v. Landmark Prop . Servs., 97 Va. Cir. 1, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 321 (Chesterfield County Feb. 17, 2017). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Definition of contractor.  The terms of the home service contract dictate whether a home service contract provider is considered to be a contractor. Should a provider be considered to be a contractor, he must be licensed as a contractor pursuant to Chapter 11 of Title 54.1. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Christopher K. Peace, Member, House of Delegates, Senate of Virginia, 10-027, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 29 (5/20/10). § 54.1-1115.01. Responsibility for contracting with persons lacking the proper credential. Text Any contractor that directly employs or otherwise contracts with a person who is not credentialed by the Board for work requiring a credential under this chapter shall be solely responsible for any monetary penalty or other sanction resulting from the act of employing or contracting with a person who lacks the proper credential based upon such persons failure to obtain or maintain the required credential.

CASE NOTES Claimant.  Claimant one and claimant two were not separate claimants under subsection A of § 54.1-1120 of the Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act, § § 54.1-1118 through 54.1-1127, and could not recover two claims from the Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Fund as the two claims filed by claimant one and claimant two involved one contract, one unpaid judgment, and a single transaction; claim ant ones reliance on subsection A of § 54.1-1123 was misplaced, and focused too narrowly on one portion of a subsection that limited claims against the Fund. McCatty v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2008). Improper or dishonest conduct.  By use of the disjunctive or in the language of this section, the legislature evidenced its intention to hold a regulant liable under the Virginia Contrac tor Transaction Recovery Act for conduct including but not limited to fraud. Surprenant v. Board for Contractors, 30 Va. App. 165, 516 S.E.2d 220, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 421 (1999). Award of compensatory damages proper.  Trial court did not err in reversing the decision of the Commonwealth of Virginia Board of Contractors to deny a property owners claim to satisfy a judgment h e recovered against a contractor under the Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act, §§ 54.1-1118 through 54.1-1127, and in awarding the owner compensatory damages and attorneys fees because in his complaint against the contractor, the owne r alleged facts only in the nature of actual monetary loss arising from the contractors alleged improper or dishonest conduct in relation to a residential construction contract, as contemplated by the act; based on those allegations, the trial court s award of compensatory damages to the owner was presumptively limited to an award for actual monetary loss, i.e., an award substantially in accord with the case asserted in the owners pleadings, and the trial court found that the owners dama ges arose from the kind of improper conduct the act was designed to redress. Commonwealth v. Gavigan, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 22, 2011). Judicial review.  It was an abuse of discretion, when reviewing the denial of a claimants claim for reimbursement from the Contractor Transaction Recovery Fund, for a trial cou rt to consider evidence that was not submitted to the Commonwealth of Virginias Board for Contractors, which denied the claim, because the evidence did not show the Board either decided the case arbitrarily or in bad faith or denied the claimant a fa ir and impartial review, since the Board offered the claimant an opportunity to properly submit the evidence to the Board, which the claimant declined, knowing that the only evidence before the Board was that the contractor against whom the claimant obta ined a judgment owned a van of unknown value, and that the claimant did not take all legally available actions to apply the contractors disclosed assets to the claimants judgment, as § 54.1-1120 required.

Initial payments may be incorporated in any application fee payment and transferred to the Fund by the Director within thirty days.All assessments, except initial assessments, for the Fund shall be deposited within three work days after their receipt by the Director, in one or more federally insured banks, savings and loan associations or savings banks located in the Commonwea lth. Funds deposited in banks, savings institutions or savings banks, to the extent in excess of insurance afforded by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other federal insurance agency, shall be secured under the Virginia Security for Public De posits Act (§ 2.2-4400 et seq.). The deposit of these funds in federally insured banks, savings and loan associations or savings banks located in the Commonwealth shall not be considered investment of such funds for purposes of this section. Funds mai ntained by the Director may be invested in securities that are legal investments for fiduciaries under the provisions of § 64.2-1502. B. The minimum balance of the Fund shall be $400,000. Whenever the Director determines that the balance of the Fund is or will be less than this minimum balance, the Director shall immediately inform the Board, which shall assess each regulant at the time of his licen se renewal a sum sufficient to bring the balance of the Fund to an amount of not less than $400,000, when combined with similar assessments of other regulants.

C. If any regu lant fails to remit the required assessment mailed in accordance with subsection B within forty-five days of such mailing, the Director shall notify such regulant by first-class mail at the latest address of record filed with the Board. If no payment has been received by the Director within thirty days after mailing the second notice, the license of the regulant shall be automatically suspended and shall be restored only upon the actual receipt by the Director of the delinquent assessment.Interest earne d on the deposits constituting the Fund shall be used for administering the Fund. The remainder of this interest may be used for the purposes of providing educational programs about the Uniform Statewide Building Code (§ 36-97 et seq.), for providing education on subjects of benefit to licensees or members of the public relating to contracting, or shall accrue to the Fund.

CASE NOTES Claimants were not separate.  Claimant one and claimant two were not separate claimants under subsection A of § 54.1-1120 of the Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act, § § 54.1-1118 through 54.1-1127, and could not recover two claims from the Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Fund as the two claims filed by claimant one and claimant two involved one contract, one unpaid judgment, and a single transaction; claim ant ones reliance on subsection A of § 54.1-1123 was misplaced, and focused too narrowly on one portion of a subsection that limited claims against the Fund. McCatty v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2008). Claim of subcontractor is barred.  The phrase vendor of connotes a linkage between one who sells and one who buys; thus, one who sells building materials to a building contractor is a vendo r of the contractor, and the plain meaning of this section bars a subcontractors claim.

Failure to pur sue contractors disclosed assets.  It was an abuse of discretion, when reviewing the denial of a claimants claim for reimbursement from the Contractor Transaction Recovery Fund, for a trial cou rt to consider evidence that was not submitted to the Commonwealth of Virginias Board for Contractors, which denied the claim, because the evidence did not show the Board either decided the case arbitrarily or in bad faith or denied the claimant a fa ir and impartial review, since the Board offered the claimant an opportunity to properly submit the evidence to the Board, which the claimant declined, knowing that the only evidence before the Board was that the contractor against whom the claimant obta ined a judgment owned a van of unknown value, and that the claimant did not take all legally available actions to apply the contractors disclosed assets to the claimants judgment, as subdivision A 6 c. of § 54.1-1120 required.

Commonwealth v. Gavigan, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 22, 2011).

The maximum claim of one claimant against the Fund based upon an unpaid judgment arising out of the improper or dishonest conduct of one regulant in connection with a single transaction involving contracting is limited to $20,000, including any amount paid from a c ontractors surety bond under § 54.1-1120.1, regardless of the amount of the unpaid judgment of the claimant. B. The aggrega te of claims against the Fund based upon unpaid judgments arising out of the improper or dishonest conduct of any one regulant involving contracting, is limited by the Board to $40,000 during any biennium. If a claim has been made against the Fund, and t he Board has reason to believe there may be additional claims against the Fund from other transactions involving the same regulant, the Board may withhold any payment(s) from the Fund involving such regulant for a period of not more than one year from th e date on which the claimant is awarded in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth the final judgment on which his claim against the Fund is based. After this one-year period, if the aggregate of claims against the regulant exceeds $40,000, during a biennium, $40,000 shall be prorated by the Board among the claimants and paid from the Fund, less the amount of any applicable contractors bond, in proportion to the amounts of their judgments against the regulant remaining unpaid.

CASE NOTES Payment on claimants u nsatisfied judgment.  Because under the Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act, subsection C of § 54.1-1123, the legislature provided for payment constituting actual monetary loss to the claimants, the payment on a claimants unsatisfied judgment is viewed as compensation for the claimants reliance interest, which is his or her interest in being reimbursed for loss caused by reliance on the contract with the regulant, i.e., the contractor, by being put in as good a position as he or she would have been in had the contract not been made; as such, this does not include reimbursement for the claimants expectation interest, meaning his or her interest in receiving the benefit of his bargain by being put in as good a position as he or she would have been in had the contract been performed. Commonwealth v. Gavigan, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 22, 2011).

CASE NOTES Appraiser as expert.  Court rejected defendants argument that expert was not qualified to give opinion about value of property interests in coal because he was not a licensed real estate appraiser because: (1) after decision cited by defendants, Virginia adopted a statutory amendment that specifically preserved the discretion of a trial judge regarding who might qualify as an expert in real property evaluation; and (2) Virginia la w regarding admission of expert testimony was not binding on a federal district court sitting in diversity.

Chapter is valid.  This chapter is a valid exercise of the police power, and has been sustained as against the contention that it contravened the Constitution of the United States b y impairing the obligation of a contract and denying due process of law. Massie v. Dudley, 173 Va. 42, 3 S.E.2d 176, 1939 Va. LEXIS 175 (1939). And is designed to protect the public.  This chapter, regulating the real estate business, and requiring brokers and salesmen to procure a license before acting as such, is designed to protect the publi c from the fraud, misrepresentation and imposition of dishonest and incompetent persons. Massie v. Dudley, 173 Va. 42, 3 S.E.2d 176, 1939 Va. LEXIS 175 (1939). Purpose.  This chapter is designed to protect the public from the fraud, misrepresentation and imposition of dishonest and incompetent persons and is a legitimate exercise of the police power. Given this purpose, it is somewhat doubtful that the legislature would have intended the requirements of the statute to extend to a person acting as a middleman between businessmen who were considering the purchase and sale of an ent ire business; the parties can generally be considered quite competent to fend for themselves. CSB, Inc. v. Cradle of Democracy Broadcasting Co., 547 F. Supp. 106, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14592 (E.D. Va. 1982). Broker with limited authority.  One who had no authority to fix the price of property and could not, therefore, make or submit a binding offer, was nevertheless a broker with a qualified or limi ted authority, where he was authorized to secure a purchaser and to obtain and negotiate offers for the property, subject to the approval of the owner. Massie v. Dudley, 173 Va. 42, 3 S.E.2d 176, 1939 Va. LEXIS 175 (1939). Acts not constitutin g real estate transactions.  Where the original leases were already executed when the buyer and seller were brought together and where new or amended leases resulted from negotiations between buyer and seller and others, in which the person who brought the buyer and seller was not involved, that person was not acting as one who leases or offers to lease, or rents or offers for rent any real estate. CSB, Inc. v. Cradle of Democracy Broadcasti ng Co., 547 F. Supp. 106, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14592 (E.D. Va. 1982). Where a radio transmission tower by the terms of the towersite lease was the property of the lessee, being specifically removable by the lessee should its lease t o the site be terminated, and in all the transactions concerning the tower, including its sale as an asset of the radio station, the lessee maintained the tower was separate from the real estate on which it rested, and the towers character, in the le ssees view, clearly was personalty, the sale of the tower did not involve the sale of real estate, since parties by agreement may fix the character and control the disposition of property, which in the absence of such a contract, would be held to be a fixture. CSB, Inc. v. Cradle of Democracy Broadcasting Co., 547 F. Supp. 106, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14592 (E.D. Va. 1982). A broker who arranges the sale of a business as a going concern, which sale involves the transfer of leaseholds, is not a broker of real estate. CSB, Inc. v. Crad le of Democracy Broadcasting Co., 547 F. Supp. 106, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14592 (E.D. Va. 1982). What constitutes negotiation.  A broker negotiates just as much when he brings parties together in such frame of mind that they can by themselves evolve a plan of procedure, as when he himself carries on the discussion and personally induces an agreement to accept a specific provision. Massie v. Dudley, 173 Va. 42, 3 S.E.2d 176, 1939 Va. LEXIS 175 (1939). Appellant induced, brought about, arranged, and conducted the communications and conferences between the parties for the purpose of arranging a mutual agreement b etween them respecting the sale of a farm. In pursuance of his contract, he produced a purchaser for the farm, and pointed out its adaptability and advantages for the purposes desired by the prospective purchaser. It was held that the circumstances const ituted completely the elements of a negotiation within the meaning of the statute. Massie v. Dudley, 173 Va. 42, 3 S.E.2d 176, 1939 Va. LEXIS 175 (1939). Qualified intermediaries.  Simply put, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit believes the Virginia legislature would not have intended 26 U.S.C.S. § 1031 qualified in termediaries to be considered real estate brokers, as qualified intermediaries exist as a mechanism for qualifying taxpayers to defer the recognition of gains on investment properties and they serve a different, more specialized function than do real est ate brokers as the term is commonly understood. Terry v. Suntrust Banks, Inc., 493 Fed. Appx. 345, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 13632 (4th Cir. 2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Private cause of action.  Because no private cause of action exists under the Real Estate Brokers Act, plaintiffs could not plead a cause of action under the Act. Therefore, defendants demurrer was sustained without leave to amend as to the count of plaintiffs complaint alleging violation of the Act. Cudnohufsky v. Resh Realty, 95 Va. Cir. 244, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 42 (Virginia Beach Mar. 3, 2017). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Real Estate Broker.  A management company that manages short-term transient occupancy rentals of fewer than thirty days for a portion of the condominium units in a condominium complex must be licensed with the Virginia Real Estate Board and must employ a licensed real estate broker before renting or offering to rent those condominium units on behalf of the units owners.

Text Notwithstanding any rule of court to the contrary, any person licensed under this chapter may prepare written contracts for the sale, purchase, option, exchange, or ren tal of real estate, provided that the preparation of such contracts is incidental to a real estate transaction in which the licensee (i) is involved and (ii) does not charge a separate fee for preparing the contracts.

CASE NOTES Owner has ordinary legal meaning.  Nothing in the statutory language employed in this section displays any intent to ascribe to the word owner a meaning different from what it enjoys in ord inary legal contemplation. Grenco Real Estate Inv. Trust v. Nathaniel Greene Dev. Corp., 218 Va. 228, 237 S.E.2d 107, 1977 Va. LEXIS 183 (1977) (decided under prior law). Shareholder not owner of l and of corporation.  Within the meaning of this section, a shareholder is not an owner of land of the corporation in which the shares are held. Grenco Real Estate Inv. Trust v. Nathan iel Greene Dev. Corp., 218 Va. 228, 237 S.E.2d 107, 1977 Va. LEXIS 183 (1977) (decided under prior law). Even if, because of the licensing statutes penal nature, the court construes the word owner liberally in favor of an exemption, the court cannot concl ude that a shareholder is an owner of land of the corporation in which the shares are held. Such a construction not only would subvert the shareholders traditional status vis-a-vis the corporation but also would thwart the salutary purpose of the lic ensing requirement which is to protect the public from the fraud, misrepresentation and imposition of dishonest and incompetent persons. Grenco Real Estate Inv. Trust v. Nathaniel Greene Dev. Corp., 218 Va. 228, 237 S.E.2d 107, 1977 Va. LEXIS 183 (1977) (decided under prior law). Exemption did not apply to licensed broker who sold his own property.  Trial court erred in concluding that the owner exemption in former § 54-734 (1) precluded it from regulating licensed real estate broker when he sold h is own property; former § 54-734 (1) merely exempted from the licensing requirement property owners who in the course of dealing with their own property perform acts customarily performed by licensed agents or brokers; however, once an individual was licensed as an agent or broker, that person was subject to regulation by the board in any real estate transaction in which he or she participates.

If a single-family residential dwelling unit is foreclosed upon, and at the date of the foreclosure sale there is a real estate purchase contract to buy such property and such contract provides that the earnest money deposit held in escrow by a licensee shall be paid to a party to the contract in the event of a termination of the real estate purchase contract, the foreclosure shall be deemed a termination of the real estate purchase c ontract and the licensee or an agent of the licensee may, absent any default on the part of the purchaser, disburse the earnest money deposit to the purchaser pursuant to such provisions of the real estate purchase contract without further consent from, or notice to, the parties. 3.

Unless altered by the parties, the terms of the original property management agreement that existed between the landlord and the real estate licensee acting as a managing agent shall govern the agreement between the successor landlord and the real estate licensee acting as a managing agent.

The claiman t shall not himself be (i) a regulant, (ii) the personal representative of a regulant, (iii) the spouse or child of the regulant against whom the judgment was awarded or the personal representative of such spouse or child, or (iv) a lending or financial institution or any person whose business involves the construction or development of real property. B. Whenever an y person is awarded a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Virginia against any individual or entity for improper or dishonest conduct as defined in the act, and the improper or dishonest conduct occurred during a period when the individual or entity was a regulant and occurred in connection with a transaction involving the sale, lease, or management of real property by the regulant acting in the capacity of a real estate broker or real estate salesperson and not in the capacity of a principal, or on his own account, the person to whom such judgment was awarded may file a verified claim with the Director for a directive ordering payment from the fund of the amount unpaid upon the judgment, subject to the followin g conditions: 1. If an y action is instituted against a regulant by any person, such person shall serve a copy of the complaint upon the Board by certified mail or the equivalent. 2. A copy of any pleading or document filed subsequent to the initial service of process in the action against a regulant shall be provided to the Board. The claimant shall submit such co pies to the Board by certified mail, or the equivalent, upon his receipt of the pleading or document. 3. A verified claim shall be filed with the Director no later than 12 months after the date of entry of the final judgment from which no further right of appeal exists. 4. Prior to submitting a verified claim, the claimant shall: a. Conduct or make a reasonable attempt to conduct debtors interrogatories to determine whether the judgment debtor has any assets, including any listings held by the regulant and any commissions due thereby; and b. Take all legally available actions for the sale or application of any assets disclosed in the debtors interrogatories. 5. If the judgment debtor has filed bankruptcy, the claimant shall file a claim with the proper bankruptcy court. If no distribution is made, or the distribution ordered fails to satisfy the claim, the claimant may then file a claim with the Board. The verified claim shall be received by the Board within 12 months of the date of bankruptcy discharge or dismissal. In the event the judgment is silent as to the conduct of the regulant, the Board shall determine (i) whether the conduct of the regulant that gave rise to the claim was improper or dishonest as defined in § 54.1-2112 and (ii) what amount, if any, such claimant is entitled to recover from the Fund. C. The Departm ent shall promptly consider the verified claim. If it appears that a prima facie case has been made for payment of the claim, the Department shall provide the regulant with a notice offering the opportunity to be heard at an informal fact-finding confere nce pursuant to § 2.2-4019 of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). Such notice shall state that if the regulant does not request an informal fact-finding conference within 30 days, with three days added in instances where the notice is sent by mail, the Department shall present the claim to the Board with a recommendation to pay the verified claim. D. A claimant shall not be denied recovery from the Fund due to the fact that the order for judgment filed with the verified claim does not contain a specific finding of improper or dishonest conduct. Any language in the order that supports the conclusion that the cou rt found that the conduct of the regulant meets the definition of improper or dishonest conduct in § 54.1-2112 shall be used by the Board to determine eligibility for recovery from the Fund. To the extent the judgment order is silent as to the court s findings on the conduct of the regulant, the Board may determine whether the conduct of the regulant meets the definition of improper or dishonest conduct by substantial evidence in the verified claim. E. If the Boar d finds that there has been compliance with the statutory conditions to which reference is made in this section, the Board shall issue a directive ordering payment to the claimant from the fund the amount unpaid on the judgment, subject to the limitation s set forth in § 54.1-2116. The claimant shall be notified in writing of the findings of the Board. The Boards findings shall be considered a case decision and judicial review of these findings shall be in accordance with § 2.2-4025 of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board shall have the right to appeal a decision of any court which is contrary to any distribution recommended or authorized by it.

After such one-year period, if the aggregate of claims arising out of the same transaction exceeds $50,000, such $50,000 shall be prorated by the Board among the claimants and paid from the fund in proportion to the amounts of their judgments against the regulant remaining unpaid. B.

If a claim has been made against the fund, and the Board has reason to believe that there may be additional claims against the fund from other transa ctions involving the same regulant, the Board may withhold any payment(s) from the fund involving such regulant for a period of not more than one year. After the one-year period, if the aggregate of claims against the regulant exceeds $100,000, such $100 ,000 shall be prorated by the Board among the claimants and paid from the fund in proportion to the amounts of their judgments against the regulant remaining unpaid. D. Excluded fr om the amount of any unpaid judgment upon which a claim against the fund is based shall be any sums included in the judgment which represent interest, or punitive damages. The claim against the fund may include court costs and attorney fees. E. If, at any time, the amount of the fund is insufficient to satisfy any claims, claim, or portion thereof filed with the Board and authorized by the act, the Board shall, when the amount of the fund is sufficient to satisfy some or all of such claims, claim, or port ion thereof, pay the claimants in the order that such claims were filed with the Board. F. Failure of a claimant to comply with the provisions of subdivisions B 1 and 2 of § 54.1-2114 and the provisions of § 54.1-2117 shall not be a bar to recovery under this act if the claimant is otherwise entitled to such recovery.

For related discussion, see 3A M.J. Brokers, § 13. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Factual questions.  Trial court overruled the demurrer that the realtor filed claiming that the broker violated certain statutory duties allegedly owed to the realtor, as whether the re is a violation is a factual question that had to be resolved at trial. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P'ship v. Cash, 70 Va. Cir. 27, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 268 (Amherst County July 15, 2005). Material adverse fact.  Whether the subject propertys history of periodic flooding was a material adverse fact was an issue for the jury. Plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded breach of th e statutory duty to disclose material adverse facts as required by subsection B of § 54.1-2131. Walton v. Aguiliar, 90 Va. Cir. 482, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 327 (Charlottesville Oct. 28, 2010). No distinct cause of act ion created by statute.  Demurrer was granted to the real estate licensee and the agent for an asserted claim that the licensee and the agent violated §§ 54.1-2131 and 54.1-2132, be cause the statutes did not create a separate and distinct cause of action beyond the claims asserted for common-law negligence. Monica v. Hottel, 64 Va. Cir. 439, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 156 (Loudoun County May 24, 2004). Because no private cause of action exists under the Real Estate Brokers Act, plaintiffs could not plead a cause of action under the Act. Therefore, defendants demurrer was sustained without leave to amend as to the count of plaintiffs complaint alleging violation of the Act. Cudnohufsky v. Resh Realty, 95 Va. Cir. 244, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 42 (Virginia Beach Mar. 3, 2017). Examination of the contract revealed no duty imposed upon and allegedly breached by two defendants; the statute, while imposing duties upon real estate licensees, is a regulatory statute, and does not create a private cause of action, and thus the court sustained the demurrers of these two defendants. Pittman v. Walter, 100 Va. Cir. 57, 2018 Va. Cir.

Require that both of the following tests be met each fiscal year prior to allowing any distribution from the perpetual care trust fund to the cemetery company: (i) the fair market valu e of the perpetual care trust fund after the distribution will be greater than the aggregate of 80 percent of the fair market value of the perpetual care trust fund at the close of the preceding fiscal year plus the total contributions made to the trust principal from such date to the date that the method of distribution is elected and (ii) beginning with the third year of using a total return distribution method, a three-year analysis of investment returns and distribution practices indicates that such practices will result in sufficient protection of the trust principal. If either test is not met, distributions for that fiscal year shall be limited to the net income distribution method; 6. In the event that the taxes and fees paid by the perpetual care trust fund are greater than two and one-half percent of the fair market value of the trust at the close of the preceding fiscal year, reduce the distribution by the amount exceeding two and one-half percent; and 7. Maintain records documenting the fair market value of the assets held in the perpetual care trust fund at the end of the accounting period immediately prior to conversion to the total return distribution method. E. In addition to filing an annual perpetual care trust fund financial report with the Board pursuant to § 54.1-2324, a cemetery company that has elected a total return distribution method shall also file a copy of such financial report at the close of each fiscal year with the commissioner of accounts in a jurisdiction in the Commonwealth in which the cemetery company owns a cemetery. The commissioner of accounts shall review the financial report and forward his finalized accounting to the Board, with all reasona ble fees and costs for such filing and review borne by the cemetery company. A trustee shall not make any distribution from a perpetual care trust fund under a total return distribution method until the review by the commissioner of accounts has been fin alized. A review shall be deemed finalized if the commissioner of accounts has not responded or communicated any deficiencies within 60 days of the submission of the financial report. F. The Board s hall review all notices of conversion or reversion of perpetual care trust fund distribution method for compliance with this section. The Board may engage the services of a professional to review notices of conversion or reversion to a total return distr ibution method, with all reasonable costs of such review borne by the cemetery company that submitted such notice.The Board may limit or prohibit conversion from a net income distribution method to a total return distribution method if the trustee or any investment manager is not able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge and expertise regarding effective implementation of the total return distribution method. The Board may prohibit a reversion from the total return distribution method to the net income d istribution method if the trust principal is less than it was at the time the cemetery company converted to the total return distribution method, as adjusted for inflation.If a conversion to the total return distribution method has already been made, the Board may limit or prohibit distributions from the perpetual care trust fund if the trustee or any investment manager is not able to demonstrate sufficient knowledge and expertise regarding the distribution of trust income for the maintenance of the cem etery using the total return distribution method. In deciding whether a distribution should be limited or prohibited, the Board shall consider the presence and stated value of trust assets that do not have an active market and are not traded on a regular basis, the frequency of appraisals and evaluations of such assets, the asset allocation of the trust, and whether trust principal, as adjusted for inflation, is less than it was at the time the cemetery company converted to the total return distribution method.The Board may require a cemetery company to restore a distribution to the perpetual care trust fund if (i) the distribution and all other aspects of the trust were not in compliance with the requirements of this section at the time such distribut ion was made or (ii) the cemetery company has committed fraud against the trust. G. If a total return distribution method has been elected, the perpetual care trust fund may not be reverted to a net income distribution method absent approval by the Board. A failure by a cemetery company to file a perpetual care trust fund financial report annually with the Board as required by § 54.1-2324 shall automatically prohibit a conversion to or continuation of a total return distribution method pending further action by the Board. H. No portion of the perpetual care trust fund shall be used to pay any personal obligation or debt of any officer or owner of the cemetery or any tax obligation incurred by the cemetery or for any purpose other than that expressly described in this section. Nothing i n this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the perpetual care trust fund trustee from paying normal operating expenses and income taxes of the trust itself, the trust being a separate legal entity.

If the Boar d has reasonable cause to believe that a common interest community manager is unable to properly discharge its fiduciary responsibilities to an association to which it provides management services, the Board may submit an ex parte petition to the circuit court of the city or county wherein the common interest community manager maintains an office or is doing business for the issuance of an order authorizing the immediate inspection by and production to representatives of the petitioner of any records, d ocuments, and physical or other evidence belonging to the subject common interest community manager. The court may issue such order without notice to the common interest community manager if the petition, supported by affidavit of the petitioner and such other evidence as the court may require, shows reasonable cause to believe that such action is required to prevent immediate loss of property of one or more of the associations to which the subject common interest community manager provides management s ervices. The court may also temporarily enjoin further activity by the common interest community manager and take such further action as shall be necessary to conserve, protect, and disburse the funds involved, including the appointment of a receiver.

The petition may seek the following relief: (i) an injunction prohibiting the withdrawal of any bank deposits or the disposition of any oth er assets belonging to or subject to the control of the subject common interest community manager and (ii) the appointment of a receiver for all or part of the funds or property of the subject common interest community manager. The subject common interes t community manager shall be given notice of the time and place of the hearing on the petition and an opportunity to offer evidence. The court, in its discretion, may require a receiver appointed pursuant to this section to post bond, with or without sur ety. The papers filed with the court under this subsection shall be placed under seal until such time as the court grants an injunction or appoints a receiver. The court may issue an injunction, appoint a receiver, or provide such other relief as the cou rt may consider proper if, after a hearing, the court finds that such relief is necessary or appropriate to prevent loss of property of one or more of the associations to which the subject common interest community manager provides management services. D. In any proc eeding under subsection C, any person or entity known to the Board to be indebted to or having in his possession property, real or personal, belonging to or subject to the control of the subject common interest community managers business and which p roperty the Board reasonably believes may become part of the receivership assets shall be served with a copy of the petition and notice of the time and place of the hearing.

F. Upon the co urts approval of the receivers report referenced in subsection E, at a hearing after such notice as the court may require to creditors, the receiver shall distribute the assets of the common interest community manager and funds in the receivershi p first to clients whose funds were or ought to have been held in a fiduciary capacity by the subject common interest community manager, then to the receiver for fees, costs, and expenses awarded pursuant to subsection G, and thereafter to the creditors of the subject common interest community manager, and then to the subject common interest community manager or its successors in interest.

The Fund shall have a claim against the subje ct common interest community manager for the amount paid. H. The court m ay determine whether any assets under the receivers control should be returned to the subject common interest community manager. I. If the Boar d shall find that any common interest community manager is insolvent, that its merger into another common interest community manager is desirable for the protection of the associations to which such common interest community manager provides management s ervices, and that an emergency exists, and, if the board of directors of such insolvent common interest community manager shall approve a plan of merger of such common interest community manager into another common interest community manager, compliance with the requirements of § 13.1-718 shall be dispensed with as to such insolvent common interest community manager and the approval by the Board of such plan of merger shall be the equivalent of approval by the holders of more than two-thirds of the o utstanding shares of such insolvent common interest community manager for all purposes of Article 12 (§ 13.1-715.1 et seq.) of Chapter 9 of Title 13.1. If the Board finds that a common interest community manager is insolvent, that the acquisition of i ts assets by another common interest community manager is in the best interests of the associations to which such common interest community manager ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_54.1-2354"><akn:num>§ 54.1-2354</akn:num><akn:heading>Variation by agreement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Except as expressly provided in this article, provisions of this article may not be varied by agreement, and rights conferred by this article may not be waived.

To es tablish the qualifications for registration, certification, licensure, permit, or the issuance of a multistate licensure privilege in accordance with the applicable law which are necessary to ensure competence and integrity to engage in the regulated pro fessions. 2. To examine or cause to be examined applicants for certification, licensure, or registration. Unless otherwise required by law, examinations shall be administered in writing or shall be a demonstration of manual skills. 3. To register, certify, license, or issue a multistate licensure privilege to qualified applicants as practitioners of the particular profession or professions regulated by such board. 4. To establish schedules for renewals of registration, certification, licensure, permit, and the issuance of a multistate licensure privilege. 5. To levy and collect fees for application processing, examination, registration, certification, permitting, or licensure or the issuance of a multistate licensure privilege and renewal that are sufficient to cover all expenses for the administration and operation of the Department of Health Professions, the Board of Health Professions, and the health regulatory boards. 6.

Such regulations shall not conflict with the purposes a nd intent of this chapter or of Chapter 1 (§ 54.1-100 et seq.) and Chapter 25 (§ 54.1-2500 et seq.). 7. To revoke, suspend, restrict, or refuse to issue or renew a registration, certificate, license, permit, or multistate licensure privilege which such board has authority to issue for ca uses enumerated in applicable law and regulations. 8. To appoint designees from their membership or immediate staff to coordinate with the Director and the Health Practitioners Monitoring Program Committee and to implement, as is nece ssary, the provisions of Chapter 25.1 (§ 54.1-2515 et seq.). Each health regulatory board shall appoint one such designee. 9. To take appropriate disciplinary action for violations of applicable law and regulations, and to accept, in their discretion, the surrender of a license, certificate, registration, per mit, or multistate licensure privilege in lieu of disciplinary action. 10. To appoint a special conference committee, composed of not less than two members of a health regulatory board or, when required for special conference committees of the Board of Med icine, not less than two members of the Board and one member of the relevant advisory board, or, when required for special conference committees of the Board of Nursing, not less than one member of the Board and one member of the relevant advisory board, to act in accordance with § 2.2-4019 upon receipt of information that a practitioner or permit holder of the appropriate board may be subject to disciplinary action or to consider an application for a license, certification, registration, permit or m ultistate licensure privilege in nursing. The special conference committee may (i) exonerate; (ii) reinstate; (iii) place the practitioner or permit holder on probation with such terms as it may deem appropriate; (iv) reprimand; (v) modify a previous ord er; (vi) impose a monetary penalty pursuant to § 54.1-2401, (vii) deny or grant an application for licensure, certification, registration, permit, or multistate licensure privilege; and (viii) issue a restricted license, certification, registration, p ermit or multistate licensure privilege subject to terms and conditions. The order of the special conference committee shall become final 30 days after service of the order unless a written request to the board for a hearing is received within such time. If service of the decision to a party is accomplished by mail, three days shall be added to the 30-day period. Upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the board or a panel of the board shall then proceed with a hearing as provided in § 2.2-4020, and the action of the committee shall be vacated. This subdivision shall not be construed to limit the authority of a board to delegate to an appropriately qualified agency subordinate, as defined in § 2.2-4001, the authority to conduct inf ormal fact-finding proceedings in accordance with § 2.2-4019, upon receipt of information that a practitioner may be subject to a disciplinary action. The recommendation of such subordinate may be considered by a panel consisting of at least five boar d members, or, if a quorum of the board is less than five members, consisting of a quorum of the members, convened for the purpose of issuing a case decision. Criteria for the appointment of an agency subordinate shall be set forth in regulations adopted by the board. 11. To convene, at their discretion, a panel consisting of at least five board members or, if a quorum of the board is less than five members, consisting of a quorum of the members to c onduct formal proceedings pursuant to § 2.2-4020, decide the case, and issue a final agency case decision. Any decision rendered by majority vote of such panel shall have the same effect as if made by the full board and shall be subject to court revie w in accordance with the Administrative Process Act. No member who participates in an informal proceeding conducted in accordance with § 2.2-4019 shall serve on a panel conducting formal proceedings pursuant to § 2.2-4020 to consider the same matte r. 12. To issue inactive licenses or certificates and promulgate regulations to carry out such purpose. Such regulations shall include, but not be limited to, the qualifications, renewal f ees, and conditions for reactivation of licenses or certificates. 13. To meet by telephone conference call to consider settlement proposals in matters pending before special conference committees convened pursuant to this section, or matters referred for formal proceedings pursuant to § 2.2-4020 to a health regulatory board or a panel of the board or to consider modifications of previously issued board orders when such considerations have been requested by either of the parties. 14. To request and accept from a certified, registered, or licensed practitioner; a facility holding a license, certification, registration, or permit; or a person holding a multistate licensure privilege to practice nursing, in lieu of disciplinary action, a confidential consent agreement. A confidential consent agreement shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of § 54.1-2400.2 and shall not be disclosed by a practitione r or facility. A confidential consent agreement shall include findings of fact and may include an admission or a finding of a violation. A confidential consent agreement shall not be considered either a notice or order of any health regulatory board, but it may be considered by a board in future disciplinary proceedings. A confidential consent agreement shall be entered into only in cases involving minor misconduct where there is little or no injury to a patient or the public and little likelihood of re petition by the practitioner or facility. A board shall not enter into a confidential consent agreement if there is probable cause to believe the practitioner or facility has (i) demonstrated gross negligence or intentional misconduct in the care of pati ents or (ii) conducted his practice in such a manner as to be a danger to the health and welfare of his patients or the public. A certified, registered, or licensed practitioner, a facility holding a license, certification, registration, or permit, or a person holding a multistate licensure privilege to practice nursing who has entered into two confidential consent agreements involving a standard of care violation, within the 10-year period immediately preceding a boards receipt of the most recent r eport or complaint being considered, shall receive public discipline for any subsequent violation within the 10-year period unless the board finds there are sufficient facts and circumstances to rebut the presumption that the disciplinary action be made public. 15. When a board has probable cause to believe a practitioner is unable to practice with reasonable skill and safety to patients because of excessive use of alcohol or drugs or physical or mental illness, the board, after preliminary investigation by an informal fact-finding proceeding, may direct that the practitioner submit to a mental or physical examination.

CASE NOTES Action against medical license.  Substantial evidence, as required by § 2.2-4027, existed in a record compiled after the board conducted a formal hearing and listened to the testimony of numer ous witnesses, including expert testimony, supporting the revocation of the doctors medical license. The evidence was enough to support a rational factfinders conclusion that the doctors continued practice of medicine could be a substantial d anger to the public health and safety, pursuant to § 54.1-2408.1.Vuyyuru v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2008). § 54.1-2408.2. Minimum period for reinstatement after revocation. Text When the certificate, registration, permit, or license of any person certified, registered, permitted, or licensed by one of the health regulatory boards has been revok ed, the board may, after three years and upon the payment of a fee prescribed by the board, consider an application for reinstatement of a certificate, registration, permit, or license in the same manner as the original certificates, registrations, permi ts, or licenses are granted; however, if a license has been revoked pursuant to subdivision A 19 of § 54.1-2915, the board shall not consider an application for reinstatement until five years have passed since revocation. A board shall conduct an inve stigation and review an application for reinstatement after revocation to determine whether there are causes for denial of the application. The burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show by clear and convincing evidence that he is safe and compete nt to practice. The reinstatement of a certificate, registration, permit, or license shall require the affirmative vote of three-fourths of the members at the hearing. In the discretion of the board, such reinstatement may be granted without further exam ination. History History. 2003, cc. 753, 762; 2013, c. 365; 2014, cc. 11, 96; 2017, c. 423.

CASE NOTES Due process.  Former physician seeking reinstatement was not denied due process because (1) the former physician was represented by counsel and permitted to testify and present evidence, and (2) any error in not permitting the former physician to submit evidence under seal was cured by a reviewing trial courts consideration of the evidence. Garada v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 283 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 23, 2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Constitutionality.  This statute was not unconstitutional because it was not vague and overbroad due to a supposed lack of objectively discernible conduct and scienter standards as, on its face, the prohibited conduct was clear as anyone lacking the proper license, certificate, registration, permit, or license could not perform an invasive procedure; the term invasive procedure was not vague as, in common parlance, an invasi ve procedure was simply one that invaded the body via a breaking of the skin or the inserting of instruments into the body; and the court did not need to read a mens rea element into the statute because the purpose of the statute was clearly to criminali ze the performing of an invasive procedure if lacking an appropriate license.

CASE NOTES Convictions upheld.  There was no error in the circuit courts convictions for continuing to practice chiropractic medicine with a suspended license because the suspension order wa s not ambiguous, and defendants advice of counsel argument failed as the circuit court found his testimony incredible and almost farcical, the court could not say that the circuit court abused its discretion when it rejected his testimony, and defend ant produced no credible evidence to support an advice of counsel defense.

Therefore, subdivi sion A 12 [now subdivision 13] of § 54.1-2706 and § 54.1-2709.1 became effective sixty days after the effective date of these regulations. At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, in subdivision 13, subsection A of § 54.1-2711.1 was substituted for subdivision 5 of § 54.1- 2712 to conform to changes by Acts 2004, c. 754.

In addition, when the Board has probable cause to believe the licensee is unable to practice den tistry with reasonable skill and safety to patients because of excessive use of alcohol or drugs or physical or mental illness, the Board, after preliminary investigation by informal conference, may direct that the licensee submit to a mental or physical examination. Failure of the licensee to submit to the examination shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action. Any licensee affected by this subsection shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that he is competent to practice dentist ry or dental hygiene with reasonable skill and safety to patients. The 2005 amendments. The 2005 amendments by cc. 505 and 587 are identical, and rewrote former subdivision 10 as present subdivisions 10 and 11 and redesignated former subdivisions 11 through 14 as present subdivisions 12 through 15. CASE NOTES Former provision against advertising held constitutional.  Subdivision 7 of this section as it existed prior to the first 1978 amendment, prohibiting advertising, did not contravene either the federal or state Constitutio ns. Goe v. Gifford, 168 Va. 497, 191 S.E. 783, 1937 Va. LEXIS 247 (1937); State Dentists, Inc. v. Gifford, 168 Va. 508, 191 S.E. 787, 1937 Va. LEXIS 248 (1937) (both decided under prior law). Finding of deceptive billing practices not supported by substantial evidence.  Boards finding that the dentist engaged in deceptive billing practices in violation of § 2.2-4027 was not supported by substantial evidence as required by subdivision 4 of § 54.1-2706 and, thus, could not stand. The record showed that insurance companies required the dentist to state on bills the fee the dentist usually charged for uninsured patients despite the fact that the insurance companies were on ly paying the dentist a lower rate, which made it appear that the dentist was collecting the higher amount when the dentist was not doing so. Zurmati v. Va. Bd. of Dentistry, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (Va. Ct. App. June 17, 2008). Suffic ient evidence showing inadequate record keeping.  Because a dentist did not record any diagnosis for certain patients, the evidence was sufficient under § 54.1-2400 to prove that the dentist violated 18 VAC 60 -20-15 by keeping inadequate records regarding the diagnosis and treatment rendered to patients. Doe v. Va. Bd. of Dentistry, 52 Va. App. 166, 662 S.E.2d 99, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 411 (2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Suspension upheld.  Indefinite suspension of dentists license was proper where no evidence suggested that the members of the Virginia Board of Dentistry relied on or were inappro priately influenced by distributed copies of X-rays in evaluating the evidence of dental negligence and the evidence showed that the dentist failed to retain patient records for the requisite three years.

Clearly , the language of the sentence was intended as a saving clause in favor of such corporations, and not in derogation of their rights. State Dentists, Inc. v. Gifford, 168 Va. 508, 191 S.E. 787, 1937 Va. LEXIS 248 (1937) (decided under prior law). Permits change of name.  It will be observed that there is no requirement that the corporation shall use only the name formerly authorized. The permission granted is the conti nued use of the name of any corporation heretofore legally chartered, etc., and such a corporation does not forfeit its right to do business by securing an amendment to its charter changing its name.

LEXIS 220 (1948). Former sections not discriminatory.  Former §§ 54-217 through 54-260 were not discriminatory or unconstitutional because of the requirement of former § 54-244 that an applicant for examinati on to obtain a license as funeral director must have served as an assistant funeral director for two years.

The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Validity of former law.  There was nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in former §§ 54-217 through 54-260, regulating the business of embalming or funeral directing. The business is o ne of a quasi public nature and concerns the health, safety and general welfare of the community and, therefore, the chapter was well within the police power of the General Assembly to adopt. However, the fact that the chapter was valid would not permit the Board in administering it to discriminate between individuals or classes similarly situated. Vaughan v.

Practicing medicine without a certificate.  Accused announced to the public generally his ability to diagnose diseases and compound and furnish remedies, and admitted that he diagnosed cases, prescribed for the patients and compounded and supplied remedies for compensation, but alleged that he did these things, not as a doctor, but to advertise his medicines, and charged for the medicines and not for the examinations and advice. He had never been examined by the Board of Medical Examiners, held no certificate from them, and had no right to practice medicine in this State. This was held sufficient to sustain a conviction for practicing medicine without having obtained a certificate. Pinkard v. Commonwealth , 126 Va. 729, 100 S.E. 821, 1919 Va.

LEXIS 146 (1942) (decided under prior law).

Legislative intent regarding mandatory nature of clinical training.  In considering the nature, context and purpose of the act, the legislature intended that the word shall in the next-to-last sentence of this section be tr eated as a mandate and not as merely advisory or directory. Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Medicine, 14 Va. App. 906, 421 S.E.2d 201, 9 Va. Law Rep. 62, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 205 (1992). The use of the word shall imposes a mandatory requirement of approved clinical rotations, and the last sentence of this statute does not permit the Virgin ia State Board of Medicine, in deciding whether to admit one to licensure, to consider other factors of an applicants training once it determines that an applicants supervised clinical training is insufficient. Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Medicine, 14 Va. App. 906, 421 S.E.2d 201, 9 Va. Law Rep. 62, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 205 (1992). In reviewing the Boards decision, the court must consider the experience and special ized competence of the Board acting in its licensing capacity and also consider the purpose of the licensing statute under which the Board acted. Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Medicine, 14 Va. App. 906, 421 S.E.2d 201, 9 Va. Law Rep. 62, 1992 Va. App. LE XIS 205 (1992). Doctor was not denied equal protection under the law. The statute imposes a reasonable r equirement that supervised clinical training received as part of the curriculum of a foreign medical school shall be obtained in an approved hospital offering an approved residency program in the specialty area for the relevant clinical training. Subdivision 4 is reasonably related to the states need to ensure that applicants for medical licensure in Virginia who are graduates of foreign medical schools have received the minimum education and training necessary to practice medicine safely an d competently in the Commonwealth. This minimum educational requirement includes the completion of clinical training at a hospital with an approved residency program. Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Medicine, 14 Va.

Law to b e applied is that in effect at time of application.  Where doctor argued that the Board improperly applied statute retroactively because his undergraduate and clinical training was completed prior to the enactment o f the 1988 amendment to this section, the Board properly applied the regulation and the statutory law, including the amendment language, in effect at the time doctors application was completed in March 1990. Doctor conceded in his brief that the amen dment was in effect before his application for licensure. Last v. Virginia State Bd. of Medicine, 14 Va. App. 906, 421 S.E.2d 201, 9 Va.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Licensing.  Testimony of two podiatrists as to causation was excluded as the absence of the term diagnosis in the definition of the practice of podiatry in § 54.1- 2900 implicitly restricted a podiatrists ability to give expert testimony, and the difference in practice for podiatrists and medical doctors was underscored by the fact that there were separate licensing standards under § 54.1-2931; although the rule on chiropractors had been eliminated in § 8.01-401.2, it had not been eliminated for podiatrists. The ability to treat a physical condition did not necessarily include the skill and experience to link that physical condition to a specific cause. Hollingsworth v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 2008 Va. Cir.

As used in this section, clinical experience means the postgraduate delivery of health care directly to patients pursuant to a practice agreement with a patient care team physician. B. The Board o f Medicine and the Board of Nursing shall jointly prescribe the regulations governing the licensure of nurse practitioners. It is unlawful for a person to practice as a nurse practitioner in the Commonwealth unless he holds such a joint license. C. Every nurse practitioner other than a certified nurse midwife, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or clinical nurse specialist or a nurse practitioner who meets the requirements of subsection I shall maintain appropriate collaboration and consultation, as evid enced in a written or electronic practice agreement, with at least one patient care team physician. A nurse practitioner who meets the requirements of subsection I may practice without a written or electronic practice agreement. A certified nurse midwife shall practice pursuant to subsection H. A nurse practitioner who is licensed by the Boards of Medicine and Nursing as a clinical nurse specialist shall practice pursuant to subsection J. A certified registered nurse anesthetist shall practice under the supervision of a licensed doctor of medicine, osteopathy, podiatry, or dentistry. A nurse practitioner who is appointed as a medical examiner pursuant to § 32.1-282 shall practice in collaboration with a licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathic med icine who has been appointed to serve as a medical examiner pursuant to § 32.1-282. Collaboration and consultation among nurse practitioners and patient care team physicians may be provided through telemedicine as described in § 38.2-3418.16. Physicians on patient care teams may require that a nurse practitioner be covered by a professional liability insurance policy with limits equal to the current limitati on on damages set forth in § 8.01-581.15. Service on a patient care team by a patient care team member shall not, by the existence of such service alone, establish or create liability for the actions or inactio ns of other team members. D. The Boards of Medicine and Nursing shall jointly promulgate regulations specifying collaboration and consultation among physicians and nurse practitioners working as part of patient care teams that shall include the development of, and periodic review and revision of, a written or electronic practice agreement; guidelines for availability and ongoing communications that define consultation among the collaborating parties and the patient; and periodic joint evaluation of the services delivered. Practice agreements shall include provisions for (i) periodic review of health records, which may include visits to the site where health care is delivered, in the manner and at the frequency determined by the nurse practitioner and the patient care team physician and (ii) input from appropriate health care providers in complex clinical cases and patient emergencies and for referrals. Evidence of a practice agreement shall be maintained by a nurse practitioner and provided to the Boards upon request. For nurse practitioner s providing care to patients within a hospital or health care system, the practice agreement may be included as part of documents delineating the nurse practitioners clinical privileges or the electronic or written delineation of duties and responsib ilities in collaboration and consultation with a patient care team physician. E. The Boards of Medicine and Nursing may issue a license by endorsement to an applicant to practice as a nurse practitioner if the applicant has been licensed as a nurse practitioner under the laws of another state and, pursuant to regulations of the Boards, the appl icant meets the qualifications for licensure required of nurse practitioners in the Commonwealth. A nurse practitioner to whom a license is issued by endorsement may practice without a practice agreement with a patient care team physician pursuant to sub section I if such application provides an attestation to the Boards that the applicant has completed the equivalent of at least five years of full-time clinical experience, as determined by the Boards, in accordance with the laws of the state in which th e nurse practitioner was licensed. F. Pending the outcome of the next National Specialty Examination, the Boards may jointly grant temporary licensure to nurse practitioners. G. In the even t a physician who is serving as a patient care team physician dies, becomes disabled, retires from active practice, surrenders his license or has it suspended or revoked by the Board, or relocates his practice such that he is no longer able to serve, and a nurse practitioner is unable to enter into a new practice agreement with another patient care team physician, the nurse practitioner may continue to practice upon notification to the designee or his alternate of the Boards and receipt of such notifica tion. Such nurse practitioner may continue to treat patients without a patient care team physician for an initial period not to exceed 60 days, provided the nurse practitioner continues to prescribe only those drugs previously authorized by the practice agreement with such physician and to have access to appropriate input from appropriate health care providers in complex clinical cases and patient emergencies and for referrals. The designee or his alternate of the Boards shall grant permission for the n urse practitioner to continue practice under this subsection for another 60 days, provided the nurse practitioner provides evidence of efforts made to secure another patient care team physician and of access to physician input. H. Every certi fied nurse midwife shall practice in accordance with regulations adopted by the Boards and consistent with the Standards for the Practice of Midwifery set by the American College of Nurse-Midwives governing such practice. A certified nurse midwife who ha s practiced fewer than 1,000 hours shall practice in consultation with a certified nurse midwife who has practiced for at least two years prior to entering into the practice agreement or a licensed physician, in accordance with a practice agreement. Such practice agreement shall address the availability of the certified nurse midwife who has practiced for at least two years prior to entering into the practice agreement or the licensed physician for routine and urgent consultation on patient care. Eviden ce of the practice agreement shall be maintained by the certified nurse midwife and provided to the Boards upon request. A certified nurse midwife who has completed 1,000 hours of practice as a certified nurse midwife may practice without a practice agre ement upon receipt by the certified nurse midwife of an attestation from the certified nurse midwife who has practiced for at least two years prior to entering into the practice agreement or the licensed physician with whom the certified nurse midwife ha s entered into a practice agreement stating (i) that such certified nurse midwife or licensed physician has provided consultation to the certified nurse midwife pursuant to a practice agreement meeting the requirements of this section and (ii) the period of time for which such certified nurse midwife or licensed physician practiced in collaboration and consultation with the certified nurse midwife pursuant to the practice agreement. A certified nurse midwife authorized to practice without a practice agr eement shall consult and collaborate with and refer patients to such other health care providers as may be appropriate for the care of the patient. I. A nurse pra ctitioner, other than a nurse practitioner licensed by the Boards of Medicine and Nursing in the category of certified nurse midwife, certified registered nurse anesthetist, or clinical nurse specialist, who has completed the equivalent of at least five years of full-time clinical experience as a licensed nurse practitioner, as determined by the Boards, may practice in the practice category in which he is certified and licensed without a written or electronic practice agreement upon receipt by the nurse practitioner of an attestation from the patient care team physician stating (i) that the patient care team physician has served as a patient care team physician on a patient care team with the nurse practitioner pursuant to a practice agreement meeting the requirements of this section and § 54.1-2957.01; (ii) that while a party to such practice agreement, the patient care team physician routinely practiced with a patient population and in a practice area included within the category for which the nu rse practitioner was certified and licensed; and (iii) the period of time for which the patient care team physician practiced with the nurse practitioner under such a practice agreement. A copy of such attestation shall be submitted to the Boards togethe r with a fee established by the Boards. Upon receipt of such attestation and verification that a nurse practitioner satisfies the requirements of this subsection, the Boards shall issue to the nurse practitioner a new license that includes a designation indicating that the nurse practitioner is authorized to practice without a practice agreement. In the event that a nurse practitioner is unable to obtain the attestation required by this subsection, the Boards may accept other evidence demonstrating that the applicant has met the requirements of this subsection in accordance with regulations adopted by the Boards. A nurse practitioner authorized to practice without a practice agreement pursuant to this subsection shall (a) only practice within the scope of his clinical and profes sional training and limits of his knowledge and experience and consistent with the applicable standards of care, (b) consult and collaborate with other health care providers based on the clinical conditions of the patient to whom health care is provided, and (c) establish ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_54.1-2958"><akn:num>§ 54.1-2958</akn:num><akn:heading>Procedure for determining acceptability of foreign courses of study and educational institutions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The Board may promulgate regulations and guidelines for determining the acceptability of courses of study and educational institutions in foreign countries.

CASE NOTES No statutory physician-patient relationship between on-call attending physician and patient.  The General Assembly, in merely listing the conditions under which medical students, interns and residents may work in a hospital during the course of their educa tional programs, did not intend to create a statutory physician-patient relationship between an on-call attending physician in a teaching hospital and a patient that would give rise to a duty of care; an attending physician does not accept a pati ent so as to establish a physician-patient relationship, simply by being the on-call attending physician when the patient is treated. Prosise v. Foster, 261 Va. 417, 544 S.E.2d 331, 2001 Va. LEXIS 40 (2001). Effect of treating pat ient who was not bona fide.  In treating a patient who was not bona fide, for whatever practical or humanitarian motivations or reasons, intern lost the cloak of sovereign immunity because he was not permitted to practice medicine except in conformity with this section. He thus exceeded the scope of his authority. Leathers v. Serrell, 376 F. Supp. 983, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8599 (W.D. Va. 1974) (decided under prior law). Physician not entitled t o sovereign immunity.  The physicians function as attending physician in this case was related to patient care and the acts taken regarding patient care were within the professional medical judgment of the physician, and the states interest and degree of involvement were slight. Therefore, the physician was not entitled to sovereign immunity for the alleged negligent acts. Lee ex rel. Lee v. Bourgeois, 252 Va. 328, 477 S.E.2d 4 95, 1996 Va. LEXIS 115 (1996). Article 6.

When person deemed medically and legally dead; determination of death; nurses', licensed practical nurses', physician assistants' or nurse pract itioners' authority to pronounce death under certain circumstances. Text A. As used in this section, autonomous nurse practitioner means a nurse practitioner who is authorized to practice without a practice agreement pursuant to subsection I of § 54.1-2957. B. A person sh all be medically and legally dead if: 1. In th e opinion of a physician duly authorized to practice medicine in the Commonwealth or autonomous nurse practitioner, based on the ordinary standards of medical practice, there is the absence of spontaneous respiratory and spontaneous cardiac functions and , because of the disease or condition that directly or indirectly caused these functions to cease, or because of the passage of time since these functions ceased, attempts at resuscitation would not, in the opinion of such physician or autonomous nurse p ractitioner, be successful in restoring spontaneous life-sustaining functions, and, in such event, death shall be deemed to have occurred at the time these functions ceased; or 2. In the opinion of a physician, who shall be duly licensed to practice medicine in the Commonwealth and board-eligible or board-certified in the field of neurology, neurosurgery, or cri tical care medicine, when based on the ordinary standards of medical practice, there is irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, and, in the opinion of such physician, based on the ordinary standards of medic al practice and considering the irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem, and the patients medical record, further attempts at resuscitation or continued supportive maintenance would not be successful in r estoring such functions, and, in such event, death shall be deemed to have occurred at the time when all such functions have ceased. C. A registere d nurse, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who is not an autonomous nurse practitioner may pronounce death if the following criteria are satisfied: (i) the nurse is employed by or the physician assistant or nurse practitioner who is not an auton omous nurse practitioner works at (a) a home care organization as defined in § 32.1-162.7, (b) a hospice as defined in § 32.1-162.1, (c) a hospital or nursing home as defined in § 32.1-123, including state-operated hospitals for the purposes of this section, (d) the Department of Corrections, or (e) a continuing care retirement community registered with the State Corporation Commission pursuant to Chapter 49 (§ 38.2-4900 et seq.) of Title 38.2; (ii) the nurse, physician assistant, or nurse p ractitioner who is not an autonomous nurse practitioner is directly involved in the care of the patient; (iii) the patients death has occurred; (iv) the patient is under the care of a physician or autonomous nurse practitioner when his death occurs; (v) the patients death has been anticipated; and (vi) the physician or autonomous nurse practitioner is unable to be present within a reasonable period of time to determine death. A licensed practical nurse may pronounce death for a patient in hospic e pursuant to a valid Do Not Resuscitate Order issued in accordance with § 54.1-2987.1. The nurse, licensed practical nurse, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who is not an autonomous nurse practitioner shall inform the patients attendin g and consulting physician or autonomous nurse practitioner of the patients death as soon as practicable. The nurse, licensed practical nurse, or physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who is not an autonomous nurse practitioner shall have the authority to pronounce dea th in accordance with such procedural regulations, if any, as may be promulgated by the Board of Medicine; however, if the circumstances of the death are not anticipated or the death requires an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, such nurse, licensed practical nurse, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner shall notify the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the death and the body shall not be released to the funeral director. This subsection shall not authorize a nurse, licensed practical nurse, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who is not an autonomous nurse practitioner to determ ine the cause of death. Determination of cause of death shall continue to be the responsibility of the attending physician or autonomous nurse practitioner, except as provided in § 32.1-263. Further, this subsection shall not be construed to impose an y obligation to carry out the functions of this subsection. This subsection shall not relieve any registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner who is not an autonomous nurse practitione r from any civil or criminal liability that might otherwise be incurred for failure to follow statutes or Board of Nursing or Board of Medicine regulations. D. The alterna tive definitions of death provided in subdivisions B 1 and 2 may be utilized for all purposes in the Commonwealth, including the trial of civil and criminal cases. History History.

Law Review. For survey on evidence in Virginia for 1989, see 23 U. Rich. L. Rev. 647 (1989). CASE NOTES Failure to obtain written consent not negligence per se.  Failure of a physician to give a particular warning under the doctrine of informed consent does not establish negligence per se, but rather becomes a factor of pr oximate cause. Therefore, the language of this section, in conjunction with the general principles of negligence applicable in Virginia, indicate that the defendants failure to obtain written consent did not constitute negligence per se. Pettengill v . United States, 867 F. Supp. 380, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16068 (E.D. Va. 1994). Steril ized patient not meant to be benefitted by statute.  The language and existing interpretations of the purpose of this section favor treating the statute as benefitting physicians. Because sterilized patient did not belong to the class for whom the statute was intended to benefit, physicians failure to obtain written consent before the procedure did not amount to negligence per se.

My agent shall be guided by my medical diagnosis and prognosis and any information provided by my physicians as to the intrusiveness, pain, risks, and side effects associated with treatment or nontreatment. My agent shall not make any decision regarding my health care which he knows, or upon reasonable inquiry ought to know, is contrary to my religious beliefs or my basic values, whether expressed orally or in writing. If my agent cannot determine what health care choice I would have made on my own beh alf, then my agent shall make a choice for me based upon what he believes to be in my best interests. OPTION II: POWERS OF MY AGENT (CROSS THROUGH ANY LANGUAGE YOU DO NOT WANT AND ADD ANY LANGUAGE YOU DO WANT.) The powers of my agent shall include the fo llowing: A. To consent to or refuse or withdraw consent to any type of health care, treatment, surgical procedure, diagnostic procedure, medication and the use of mechanical or other procedures that affect any bodily function, including, but not limited to, artificial respiration, artificially administered nutrition and hydration, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This authorization specifically includes the power to consent to the administration of dosages of pain-relieving medication in excess of rec ommended dosages in an amount sufficient to relieve pain, even if such medication carries the risk of addiction or of inadvertently hastening my death; B. To request, receive, and review any information, verbal or written, regarding my physical or mental health, including but not limited to, medical and hospital records, and to consent to the disclosure of this information; C. To employ and discharge my health care providers; D.

If I have authorized admission to a health care facility for treatment of mental illness, that authority is stated elsewhere in this advance direct ive; E. To authorize my admission to a health care facility for the treatment of mental illness for no more than 10 calendar days provided I do not protest the admission and a physician on the staff of or designated by the proposed admitting facility exa mines me and states in writing that I have a mental illness and I am incapable of making an informed decision about my admission, and that I need treatment in the facility; and to authorize my discharge (including transfer to another facility) from the f acility; F. To authorize my admission to a health care facility for the treatment of mental illness for no more than 10 calendar days, even over my protest, if a physician on the staff of or designated by the proposed admitting facility examines me and s tates in writing that I have a mental illness and I am incapable of making an informed decision about my admission, and that I need treatment in the facility; and to authorize my discharge (including transfer to another facility) from the facility. [My p hysician or licensed clinical psychologist hereby attests that I am capable of making an informed decision and that I understand the consequences of this provision of my advance directive: ]; G. To authorize the specific types of health care identified i n this advance directive [specify cross-reference to other sections of directive] even over my protest. [My physician or licensed clinical psychologist hereby attests that I am capable of making an informed decision and that I understand the consequences of this provision of my advance directive: ]; H. To continue to serve as my agent even in the event that I protest the agents authority after I have been determined to be incapable of making an informed decision; I. To authorize my participation in any health care study approved by an institutional review board or research review committee according to applicable federal or state law that offers the prospect of direct therapeutic benefit to me; J.

I specifically direct that I receive the following health care if it is medically appropriate under the circumstan ces as determined by my attending physician: . B. I specifically direct that the following health care not be provided to me under the following circumstances (you may specify that certain health care not be provided under any circumstances): . OPTION IV : END OF LIFE INSTRUCTIONS (CROSS THROUGH THIS OPTION IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO GIVE INSTRUCTIONS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH CARE IF YOU HAVE A TERMINAL CONDITION.) If at any time my attending physician should determine that I have a terminal condition where the appl ication of life-prolonging procedures  including artificial respiration, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, artificially administered nutrition, and artificially administered hydration  would serve only to artificially prolong the dying process, I di rect that such procedures be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally with only the administration of medication or the performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary to provide me with comfort care or to alleviate pain. OPT ION: LIFE-PROLONGING PROCEDURES DURING PREGNANCY. (If you wish to provide additional instructions or modifications to instructions you have already given regarding life-prolonging procedures that will apply if you are pregnant at the time your attending physician determines that you have a terminal condition, you may do so here.)

In the event of the revocation of the designation of an agent, subsequent decisions about health care shall be made consistent with the provisions of this article. Any such revocation shall be effective when communicated to the attending phy sician. No civil or criminal liability shall be imposed upon any person for a failure to act upon a revocation unless that person has actual knowledge of such revocation. B. If an advan ce directive has been submitted to the Advance Health Care Directive Registry pursuant to Article 9 (§ 54.1-2994 et seq.) of this chapter, any revocation of such directive shall also be notarized before being submitted to the Department of Health for removal from the registry.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Transfer ordered.  Per Va. Code Ann. § 54.1-2987, a hospital and applicable health care providers were ordered to cooperate and make a reasonable effort to transfer a COVID patie nt to the physician designated by the husband where the patient had an advance medical directive, and as the patients health care agent, the husband and health care providers disagreed as to the use of Ivermectin to treat the patient. The hospital s argument that it could not admit the designated physician because he lacked hospital privileges was rejected where the legislature would have qualified such a requirement into the Code if intended as a prerequisite, the Code defined both attending physician and physician and did not limit the transfer to and attending physician, and facilities and providers enjoyed statutory immunity from liability for following the Health Care Decisions Act of Virginia.

As used in this section:Health care provider includes, but is not limited to, qualified emergency medical se rvices personnel.Person authorized to consent on the patients behalf means any person authori zed by law to consent on behalf of the patient incapable of making an informed decision or, in the case of a minor child, the parent or parents having custody of the child or the childs legal guardian or as otherwise provided by law. B. A Durable D o Not Resuscitate Order may be issued by a physician for his patient with whom he has a bona fide physician/patient relationship as defined in the guidelines of the Board of Medicine, and only with the consent of the patient or, if the patient is a minor or is otherwise incapable of making an informed decision regarding consent for such an order, upon the request of and with the consent of the person authorized to consent on the patients behalf. C. A Durable D o Not Resuscitate Order or other order regarding life-prolonging procedures executed in accordance with the laws of another state in which such order was executed shall be deemed to be valid for purposes of this article and shall be given effect as provi ded in this article. D. If a patien t is able to, and does, express to a health care provider or practitioner the desire to be resuscitated in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest, such expression shall revoke the providers or practitioners authority to follow a Durable Do No t Resuscitate Order. In no case shall any person other than the patient have authority to revoke a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order executed upon the request of and with the consent of the patient himself.If the patient is a minor or is otherwise incapab le of making an informed decision and the Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order was issued upon the request of and with the consent of the person authorized to consent on the patients behalf, then the expression by said authorized person to a health care provider or practitioner of the desire that the patient be resuscitated shall so revoke the providers or practitioners authority to follow a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order.When a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order has been revoked as provided in this section, a new Order may be issued upon consent of the patient or the person authorized to consent on the patients behalf. E. Durable Do Not Resuscitate Orders issued in accordance with this section or deemed valid in accordance with subsection C shall remain valid and in effect until revoked as provided in subsection D or until rescinded, in accordance with accepted medical practice, by the provider who issued the Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order. In accordance with this section and regulations promulgated by the Board of Health, (i) qualified emergency medical services personnel as defined in § 32.1-111.1; (ii) licensed health care practitioners in any facility, program or organization operated or licensed by the Board of Health, the Department of Social Services, or the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services or operated, licensed or owned by another state agenc y; and (iii) licensed health care practitioners at any continuing care retirement community registered with the State Corporation Commission pursuant to Chapter 49 (§ 38.2-4900 et seq.) of Title 38.2 are authorized to follow Durable Do Not Resuscitate Orders that are available to them in a form approved by the Board of Health or deemed valid in accordance with subsection C. F. The provisi ons of this section shall not authorize any qualified emergency medical services personnel or licensed health care provider or practitioner who is attending the patient at the time of cardiac or respiratory arrest to provide, continue, withhold or withdr aw health care if such provider or practitioner knows that taking such action is protested by the patient incapable of making an informed decision. No person shall authorize providing, continuing, withholding or withdrawing health care pursuant to this s ection that such person knows, or upon reasonable inquiry ought to know, is contrary to the religious beliefs or basic values of a patient incapable of making an informed decision or the wishes of such patient fairly expressed when the patient was capabl e of making an informed decision. Further, this section shall not authorize the withholding of other medical interventions, such as intravenous fluids, oxygen or other therapies deemed necessary to provide comfort care or to alleviate pain. G. This sectio n shall not prevent, prohibit or limit a physician from issuing a written order, other than a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order, not to resuscitate a patient in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest in accordance with accepted medical practice.

Text A. As used in this section:Health care provider has the same meaning as in § 8.01-581.1. Life-sustaining treatment means any ongoing health care that utilizes mechanical or other artificial means to sustai n, restore, or supplant a spontaneous vital function, including hydration, nutrition, maintenance medication, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. B. Nothing in this article shall be construed to require a physician to prescribe or render health care to a patient that the physician determines to be medically or ethically inappropriate. A determination of the medical or ethical inappropriateness of proposed healt h care shall be based solely on the patients medical condition and not on the patients age or other demographic status, disability, or diagnosis of persistent vegetative state.In cases in which a physicians determination that proposed health care, including life-sustaining treatment, is medically or ethically inappropriate is contrary to the request of the patient, the terms of a patients advance directive, the decision of an agent or person authorized to make decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986, or a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order, the physician or his designee shall document the physicians determination in the patients medical record, make a reasonable effort to inform the patient or the patients agent or person with de cision-making authority pursuant to § 54.1-2986 of such determination and the reasons therefor in writing, and provide a copy of the hospitals written policies regarding review of decisions regarding the medical or ethical appropriateness of propo sed health care established pursuant to subdivision B 21 of § 32.1-127.If the conflict remains unresolved, the physician shall make a reasonable effort to transfer the patient to another physician or facility that is willing to comply with the request of the patient, the terms of the advance directive, the decision of an agent or person authorized to make decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986, or a Durable Do Not Resuscitate Order and shall cooperate in transferring the patient to the physician or fac ility identified. The physician shall provide the patient or his agent or person with decision-making authority pursuant to § 54.1-2986 a reasonable time of not less than 14 days after the date on which the decision regarding the medical or ethical in appropriateness of the proposed treatment is documented in the patients medical record in accordance with the hospitals written policy developed pursuant to subdivision B 21 of § 32.1-127 to effect such transfer. During this period, (i) the ph ysician shall continue to provide any life-sustaining treatment to the patient that is reasonably available to such physician, as requested by the patient or his agent or person with decision-making authority pursuant to § 54.1-2986, and (ii) the hosp ital in which the patient is receiving life-sustaining treatment shall facilitate prompt access to the patients medical record pursuant to § 32.1-127.1:03.If, at the end of the 14-day period, the conflict remains unresolved despite compliance with the hospitals written policy established pursuant to subdivision B 21 of § 32.1-127 and the physician has been unable to identify another physician or facility willing to provide the care requested by the patient, the terms of the advance directi ve, or the decision of the agent or person authorized to make decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986 to which to transfer the patient despite reasonable efforts, the physician may cease to provide the treatment that the physician has determined to be medic ally or ethically inappropriate subject to the right of court review by any party. However, artificial nutrition and hydration may be withdrawn or withheld only if, on the basis of physicians reasonable medical judgment, providing such artificial nut rition and hydration would (a) hasten the patients death, (b) be medically ineffective in prolonging life, or (c) be contrary to the clearly documented wishes of the patient, the terms of the patients advance directive, or the decision of an agen t or person authorized to make decisions pursuant to § 54.1-2986 regarding the withholding of artificial nutrition or hydration. In all cases, care directed toward the patients pain and comfort shall be provided. C. Nothing in this section shall require the provision of health care that the physician is physically or legally unable to provide or health care that the physician is physically or legally unable to provide without thereby denying the same health care to another pat ient. D. Nothing in this article shall be construed to condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing or euthanasia or to permit any affirmative or deliberate act or omission to end life other than to permit the natural process of dying. E. Compliance with the requirements of this section shall not be admissible to prove a violation of or compliance with the standard of care as set forth in § 8.01-581.20.

CASE NOTES Comparable education requirements between RN and LPN.  Board of Nursing did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in requiring an applicant to present evidence that she received a practical nursing diploma and a compar able education required for practical nurse given the plain language of subdivision A 2 of § 54.1-3020 and 18 Va. Admin. Code 90-19-130(C)(1). Whether training as a registered nurse necessarily satisfies the lower educational requirements for a licens ed practical nurse is immaterial. Hyunsook Highland v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 265 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2019). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Negligence per se.  In a case in which a patient and his mother sued a healthcare provider and a nurse, alleging that the provider breached its duty to them by having incorrect and i nadequate supervision of the nurse, and the provider demurred, asserting that Virginia did not recognize a cause of action for negligent supervision, the patient and his mother, relying on § 54.1-3000 and 19 VAC 90-20-270, argued that the provider had a statutory and regulatory duty to supervise the nurse. However, they failed to plead all of the elements of a negligence per se claim. Gilbertson v. Purdham, 78 Va. Cir. 295, 2009 Va. Cir.

CASE NOTES Due process.  Circuit court did not err in affirming the decision of the Virginia Board of Nursing denying an applicants petition to be a Certified Nurse Aide because the a pplicant was afforded due process since she was given reasonable notice of the hearing regarding the charges of neglect and finding of misappropriation of patient property and a meaningful opportunity to be heard in the hearing; 18 VAC § 90-25-80 did not create an irrebuttable presumption that violated the applicants due process rights because the applicant had multiple findings of neglect and a finding of misappropriation of patient property on her record. Bamaiyi v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 2013). Equal protection rights.  Statues and regulations of the Virginia Board of Nursing did not violate an applicants due process and equal protection rights because they applied to all per sons seeking certification; the applicant, like everyone else seeking certification by endorsement, was subject to the Boards statutes and regulations. Bamaiyi v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 2013). Denial of certification.  Circuit court did not err in affirming the order of the Virginia Board of Nursing based on the evidence before it because the Boards denial of an applicant s petitions was predicated upon an order reprimanding the applicant for neglect and misappropriation of patient property; the findings of neglect and misappropriation of patient property precluded both certification by reinstatement and certification by endorsement. Bamaiyi v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 2013). Denial of certification by endorse ment.  Virginia Board of Nursing was well within its statutory authority to deny an applicant certification by endorsement application because its findings of neglect an d finding of misappropriation of patient property constituted a violation of §§ 54.1-3007 and 54.1-3024 and 18 VAC § 90-25-72. Bamaiyi v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 2013). Sufficient evidence to suppo rt suspension.  Indefinite suspension of the nurses nursing license for a period of not less than two years was supported by evidence that the nurse did not check patient A s vitals or perform the necessary assessments at the appointed times, the testimony of two witnesses that the nurse slept during his shift, and the nurses own admission to dozing off on occasion at work.

CASE NOTES Requirements for LPN.  Statutory language of subdivision A 2 of § 54.1-3020 is clear in requiring an applicant have received a diploma from an approved practical nursing program in o rder to obtain a license to practice as a practical nurse. Hyunsook Highland v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 265 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2019). Since the requirement that an applicant for a specific nursing license have received a diploma based on the specific standards to be applied under that license di d not produce an absurd result, any modification was for the General Assembly. Hyunsook Highland v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 265 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2019). Comparable education requirements between RN and LPN.  Board of Nursing did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in requiring an applicant to present evidence that she received a practical nursing diploma and a compar able education required for practical nurse given the plain language of subdivision A 2 of § 54.1-3020 and 18 Va. Admin. Code 90-19-130(C)(1). Whether training as a registered nurse necessarily satisfies the lower educational requirements for a licens ed practical nurse is immaterial. Hyunsook Highland v. Va.

History History. 1989, c. 278. Annotations CASE NOTES Equal protection and due process r ights.  Statues and regulations of the Virginia Board of Nursing did not violate an applicants due process and equal protection rights because they applied to all per sons seeking certification; the applicant, like everyone else seeking certification by endorsement, was subject to the Boards statutes and regulations. Bamaiyi v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 2013). Denial of certification.  Circuit court did not err in affirming the order of the Virginia Board of Nursing based on the evidence before it because the Boards denial of an applicant s petitions was predicated upon an order reprimanding the applicant for neglect and misappropriation of patient property; the findings of neglect and misappropriation of patient property precluded both certification by reinstatement and certification by endorsement. Bamaiyi v. Va. Bd. of Nursing, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 2013). Denial of certification by endorse ment.  Virginia Board of Nursing was well within its statutory authority to deny an applicant certification by endorsement application because its findings of neglect an d finding of misappropriation of patient property constituted a violation of §§ 54.1-3007 and 54.1-3024 and 18 VAC § 90-25-72.

The h ealth and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure laws; 2. Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public; 3. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced communication technologies as part of our nations health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation a mong states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation; 4. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex; 5. The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and 6. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits. B. The general purposes of this Compact are to: 1. Facil itate the states responsibility to protect the publics health and safety; 2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation; 3. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of nurse regulation, investigation, and adverse actions; 4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of nursing in each jurisdiction; 5.

Ritholz v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 339, 35 S.E.2d 210, 1945 Va. LEXIS 154 (1945) (decided under prior law). Proprietor s of store engaged in practice of optometry.  The proprietors of a store selling eyeglasses employed a licensed physician at a guaranteed net income and furnished him office space, etc., in the store. They ad vertised and directed prospective customers to the physician, who examined their eyes, wrote prescriptions, collected a fee of $2.00 each, and delivered the prescriptions to an employee of the proprietors. The physician himself at times participated in t he sales talk whereby the customer was induced to purchase glasses. The proprietors contended that they were not engaged in the practice of optometry, since the physician was an independent contractor. It was held that there was no merit in the contentio n as the physician was an employee of the proprietors and not an independent contractor, and therefore they were practicing optometry as defined in this section.

It shall be unlawful for any optometrist to practice his profession as a lessee of or in a commercial or mercantile establishment, or to advertise, either in person or through any commercial or mercantile establishment, that he is a licensed practitioner and is pra cticing or will practice optometry as a lessee of or in the commercial or mercantile establishment. B. No licensed optometrist shall practice optometry as an employee, directly or indirectly, of a commercial or mercantile establishment, unless such commercial or mercantile establishment was employing a full-time licensed optometrist in its established place of busin ess on June 21, 1938. C. For the pur poses of this section, the term commercial or mercantile establishment means a business enterprise engaged in the selling of commodities. D. For the pur poses of this section, an optometrist shall be deemed to be practicing in a commercial or mercantile establishment if he practices, whether directly or indirectly, as an officer, employee, lessee or agent of any person or entity in any location that prov ides direct access to or from a commercial or mercantile establishment. Direct access includes any entrance or exit, except an entrance or exit closed to the public and used solely for emergency egress pursuant to applicable state and local building and fire safety codes, that prohibits a person from exiting the building or structure occupied by such practice or establishment (i) onto an exterior sidewalk or public way or (ii) into a common area that is not under the control of either the optometry prac tice or the commercial or mercantile establishment, such as into the common areas of an enclosed shopping mall.

CASE NOTES Employment of registered optometrist by commercial or mercantile establishment.  Subsection D in effect gives the right to any registered optometrist to practice optometry as a full-time employee on the premises of any commercial or mercantile establishment while subsection B limits that right to a condition that such establishment was employing a full-time registered optometrist in its established place of business on June 21, 1938. The word employing in the quoted phrase has the meaning of making use of, a sense in which it is frequently used.

The words of the statute commercial or mercantile establishment refer to the establishment, whether operated by an individual, partnership or corporation, and the establishment does not lose its identity simply by a change in the members of a partnership which owns it. It was immaterial that the optometrist employed by the establishment on June 21, 1938, was a partner. Cowardin v. Burrage, 195 Va. 54, 77 S.E.2d 428, 1953 Va. LEXIS 175 (1953) (decided under prior law). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Commercial or mercantile establishment defined.  A business that engages in the sale of prescriptive eyeglasses and contact lenses and nonprescriptive ophthalmic products, including the business of a licensed op tician, constitutes a commercial or mercantile establishment within the meaning of the statute. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. John W. Hasty, Director, Department of Health Professions, 00-052, 2000 Va. AG LEXIS 45 (7/28/00) (prior to 200 5 amendments). Sale of prescriptive ophthalmic goods by ophthalmolog ist and optometrists does not constitute commercial or mercantile establishment.  The sale of prescriptive ophthalmic goods is incidental to the professional practice of ophthalmology and optometry, and neither ophthalmologists nor optometrists may be deemed to be a commercial or mercantile establishment. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. John W. Hasty, Director, Department of Health Professions, 00-052, 2000 Va. AG LEXIS 45 (7/28/00) (prior to 2005 amendments). Optometrist, whose practice is not controlled or infl uenced by any agent or employee of a commercial or mercantile establishment, may be employed by an independent ophthalmology practice that has direct access to a commercial or mercantile establishment and that sells eye glasses or contact lenses ancillary to its practice, provided that the majo rity of the beneficial ownership of the practice is owned by an ophthalmologic practice and/or one or more ophthalmologists.

A pharmacis t shall conduct a prospective drug review before each new prescription is dispensed or delivered to a patient or a person acting on behalf of the patient. Such review shall include screening for potential drug therapy problems due to therapeutic duplicat ion, drug-disease contraindications, drug-drug interactions, including serious interactions with nonprescription or over-the-counter drugs, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug-allergy interactions, and clinical abuse or misuse. A ph armacist may conduct a prospective drug review before refilling a prescription to the extent the pharmacist deems appropriate in his professional judgment. B. A pharmacis t shall offer to counsel any person who presents a new prescription for filling. The offer to counsel may be made in any manner the pharmacist deems appropriate in his professional judgment, and may include any one or a combination of the following: 1. Face- to-face communication with the pharmacist or the pharmacists designee; 2. A sign posted in such a manner that it can be seen by patients; 3. A notation affixed to or written on the bag in which the prescription is to be delivered; 4. A notation contained on the prescription container; or 5.

A pharmacist may offer to counsel a ny person who receives a refill of a prescription to the extent deemed appropriate by the pharmacist in his professional judgment. C. If the offe r to counsel is accepted, the pharmacist shall counsel the person presenting the prescription to the extent the pharmacist deems appropriate in his professional judgment. Such counseling shall be performed by the pharmacist himself and may, but need not, include the following: 1. The n ame and description of the medication; 2. The dosage form, dosage, route of administration, and duration of drug therapy; 3. Special directions and precautions for preparation, administration, and use by the patient; 4. Common adverse or severe side effects or interactions and therapeutic contraindications that may be encountered, including their avoidance, and the action required if they occur; 5. Techniques for self-monitoring drug therapy; 6. Proper storage and disposal; 7. Prescription refill information; and 8. Action to be taken in the event of a missed dose.Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a pharmacist to provide counseling when the person presenting the prescription fails to accept the pharmacists offer to counsel.

D. Reasonable efforts shall be made to obtain, record, and maintain the following patient information generated at the individual pharmacy: 1. Name, address, telephone number, date of birth or age, and gender; 2. Individual history where significant, including known allergies and drug reactions, and a comprehensive list of medications and relevant devices; and 3. Any additional comments relevant to the patients drug use, including any failure to accept the pharmacists offer to counsel.Such information may be recorded in the patients manual or electronic profile, or in the prescription signature log, or in any other system of records and may be considered by the pharmacist in the exercise of his professional judgment concerning both the offer to counsel and content of counseling. Th e absence of any record of a failure to accept the pharmacists offer to counsel shall be presumed to signify that such offer was accepted and that such counseling was provided. E. This sectio n shall not apply to any drug dispensed to an inpatient of a hospital or nursing home, except to the extent required by regulations promulgated by the federal Health Care Financing Administration implementing 42 U.S.C. § 1396r-8 (g)(2)(A).

CASE NOTES Sufficiency of evidence.  Trial court did not err in overruling defendants motion to strike where the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that a confidential informant did not have prescriptions for the drugs that defendant sold to him; because the informants prescription monitoring program report did not show that he had ever filled prescriptions for oxymorphone, clonazepam, methadone, or buprenorphine/naloxone, the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendanta licensed pharmacist who should have known the proper procedures for filling prescriptionssold the drugs to the informant without a valid prescription, and that inference was only further supported b y defendants suspicious behavior during the controlled drug purchases.

CASE NOTES Public policy.  Where a former employee allegedly was fired in retaliation for reporting illegal pharmacy practices, the employee sufficiently stated a claim that the employee s termination violated the public policy of Va. Code Ann. §§ 54.1-3310 and 54.1-3435 because the employee clearly described the circumstances of the employees refusal to engage in an act of criminal consequences. Weidman v.

Retaliatory termination.  Employee failed to raise a fact issue to preclude summary judgment on his Bowman claim as: (1) he did not show that an employer directed him to commit criminal acts under this section or that his firing was motivated by his refusal to engage in unlawful pharmacy pr actices; (2) he discovered purportedly illegal pharmaceutical dispensing and stockpiling practices and stopped them; (3) the evidence did not show that he was asked by a supervisor to engage in an illegal pharmaceutical laundering scheme; and (4) an exec utive who allegedly orchestrated a retaliatory scheme for 3 years had no input in the employees annual ranking, performance improvement process or termination, and he was terminated for legitimate, performance-based reasons.

Evidence sufficient to convict.  Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction of aiding and abetting prescription fraud in violation of § 18.2-258.1 where: (1) defendants g irlfriend falsely told the pharmacist that she had not had received the pain medication, including a Schedule II controlled substance under § 54.1-3448, and the pharmacist relied on the misrepresentation when she refilled them, which constituted presc ription fraud under clauses (i) and (iii) of subsection A of § 18.2-258.1; (2) defendant was present at the time, and incited, encouraged, advised, or assisted in the crime; (3) defendant was with his girlfriend on both occasions that the prescription s were filled, stood silently beside her when she lied about having not received them, and injected himself into the conversation in a belligerent and distracting manner when the pharmacist attempted to find out the truth; and (4) defendant said nothing when they were given a second set of medications, which they used to get high as soon as they got home. Comeau v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 342 (Va. Ct. App. June 17, 2003). Trial court did not err in overruling defendants motion to strike where the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that a confidential informant did not have prescriptions for the drugs that defendant sold to him; because the informants prescription monitoring program report did not show that he had ever filled prescriptions for oxymorphone, clonazepam, methadone, or buprenorphine/naloxone, the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant  a licensed pharmacist who should have known the proper procedures for filling prescriptions  sold the drugs to the informant without a valid prescription, and that inference was only further support ed by defendants suspicious behavior during the controlled drug purchases.

Evidence insufficient to convict.  Evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of possession of controlled paraphernalia because the Commonwealth adduced no evidence of circumstances reasonably indicating that defendant intended to use the syringe in his possession to illegally administer a controlled drug; he did not have any drugs in his possession when he was arrested, and a K-9 search of the area surrounding the arrest did not locate any dr ugs; the syringe, according to a deputy, was capped, clean, and appeared to be brand new; and the Commonwealth did not present any forensic evidence to indicate the presence of any drug residue in or on the syringe.

Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact. Text Article I. Purpose. Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the public through verification of education, training, and experience and ensure accountability for professi onal practice; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the day-to-day practice of telepsychology (i.e., the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technolog ies) by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority; and Whereas, this Compact is intended to authorize State Psychology Regulatory Authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Compact , to psychologists licensed in another state; and Whereas, this Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the publics health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologi sts and that such state regulation will best protect public health and safety; and Whereas, this Compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the Home and Receiving States; and Whereas, this Compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice, it does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.

Incre ase public access to professional psychological services by allowing for telepsychological practice across state lines, as well as temporary in-person, face-to-face services into a state in which the psychologist is not licensed to practice psychology; 2. Enhance the states ability to protect the publics health and safety, especially client/patient safety; 3. Encourage the cooperation of Compact States in the areas of psychology licensure and regulation; 4. Facilitate the exchange of information between Compact States regarding psychologist licensure, adverse actions, and disciplinary history; 5.

The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. This chapter was enacted to protect all the people of the State against inefficient veterinarians, and not for the purpose of giving special privileges and emoluments to any class of persons. Drummond v. Rowe, 155 Va. 725, 156 S.E. 422 (1930). And li censed veterinarians have no vested right therein.  The regulation of the practice of veterinary medicine is purely a statutory matter. Prior to May 1, 1896, there was no regulation on the subject. Anyone who desir ed to do so could engage in this practice. The legislature, at its next session, if it sees fit can repeal all of the statutes on the subject and leave this profession without any regulation, and licensed veterinarians have no vested right which would be affected by such repeal. Drummond v. Rowe, 155 Va. 725, 156 S.E. 442, 1931 Va. LEXIS 264 (1931). Practice in violat ion of chapter is not a nuisance.  While the legislature has provided that the practice of veterinary medicine without complying with the regulations of this chapter is a misdemeanor, punishable by criminal prosecution, it has not declared such practice a nuisance. Drummond v. Rowe, 155 Va. 725, 156 S.E. 442, 1931 Va. LEXIS 264 (1931). And equity has no jurisdiction there of.  The legislature has not extended the jurisdiction of a court of equity over the practice of veterinary medicine in violation of the regulations of this chapter. D rummond v. Rowe, 155 Va. 725, 156 S.E. 442, 1931 Va. LEXIS 264 (1931). Nor right to enjoin violation.  Complainants, licensed veterinary surgeons, filed a bill in the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond, the main purpose of which was to prevent one D., who they c laimed was illegally licensed, from engaging in the practice of veterinary medicine. The financial loss claimed by complainants was the possible diminution of their fees, in the event D. continued to practice. By their waiver of injunctive relief even th is slender claim of financial injury was waived, and if they had not waived it, the claim was untenable. Drummond v. Rowe, 155 Va. 725, 156 S.E. 442, 1931 Va.

Most of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. History of section.  For the evolution of this section and §§ 54.1-3903 and 54.1-3904, see Horne v. Bridwell, 193 Va. 381, 68 S.E.2d 535, 1952 Va. LEXIS 146 (1952). The right to practice law in Virginia is governed by statute as supplemented by the Rule s of the Supreme Court of Virginia. Brown v. Supreme Court of Virginia, 359 F. Supp. 549, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13352 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 414 U.S. 1034, 94 S. Ct. 534, 38 L. Ed. 2d 327, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 1459 (1973). Virginia has broad powers to regulate the practice of law within its borders. Brotherhoo d of R.R. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Va. State Bar, 377 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1113, 12 L. Ed. 2d 89, 27 Ohio Op. 2d 365, 94 Ohio Law Abs. 33, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 2241 (1964). But cannot ignore federal Constitu tion.  In regulating the practice of law a state cannot ignore the rights of individuals secured by the federal Constitution. Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Virginia ex rel. Va. State Bar, 377 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1113, 12 L. Ed. 2d 89, 27 Ohio Op. 2d 365, 94 Ohio Law Abs. 33, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 2241 (1964). Duty of federal court to investigate administration of admission standards.  The right of a state to establish and administer standards for admission to the bar is a field into which a federal court should be especially reluctant and slow to enter, but one in which there is a duty to investigate in appropriate cases. Brown v. Supreme Court of Virginia, 359 F. Supp. 549, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13352 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 414 U.S. 1034, 94 S. Ct. 534, 38 L. Ed. 2d 327, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 1459 (197 3). No federal district court has jurisdiction over applicants individual claims.  A federal district court does not have jurisdiction to consider an unsuccessful applicants challenge to the procedures and practices of the Board, in referenc e to that applicants particular bar examination. Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 454 F. Supp. 4, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17428 (E.D. Va. 1978), aff'd, 598 F.2d 1345, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 14439 (4th Cir. 1979). The fundamental concern of this section and §§ 54.1-3903 and 54.1-3904 since their origin has been that only persons who are qualified in fact shall practice law in this State. The procedure required by § 54.1-3903 is for the purpose of establishing that a person coming into a court to practice possesses the qualifications prescrib ed by this section. The qualification in court prescribed by § 54.1-3903 is secondary to the qualifications in fact required by this section. The procedure of § 54.1-3903 is the form required to establish the fact. Horne v. Bridwell, 193 Va. 381, 6 8 S.E.2d 535, 1952 Va. LEXIS 146 (1952). The provisions of this section and of § 54.1-3903 constitute conditions precedent to an attorneys exercise of the privilege and courtesy accorded him by Virginia law. These conditions are not matters of empty form. They are of the spirit of the rules adopted to guide the Virginia lawyer in his relation to his client. Horne v. Bridwel l, 193 Va. 381, 68 S.E.2d 535, 1952 Va. LEXIS 146 (1952). Power of Supreme Court to review Boards decisions.  The Supreme Court has no explicit statutory authority to review the Boards decisions or to reverse its evaluation of a particular candidate. Nonetheless, it i s well settled that that court retains such inherent power. Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 454 F. Supp. 4, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17428 (E.D.

CASE NOTES It is unimportant that this section does not define the practice of law. The phr ase has long had a sufficiently definite meaning to be given a place in statutory law without further definition. Richmond Ass'n of Credit Men v. Bar Ass'n, 167 Va. 327, 189 S.E. 153, 1937 Va. LEXIS 281 (1937) (decided under prior law). Credit a ssociation practicing in violation of section.  A credit association solicited the business of collecting liquidated commercial accounts and when it needed the services of a lawyer selected him, made contract w ith him and employed him as agent for the creditor. Employment was by form letter in which the claim was sent to the attorney, the creditor not even knowing the attorneys name. Charges were fixed in advance; all correspondence passed from the lawyer to the association, as did remittances. The association had the right to discharge the lawyer or supervise his conduct, and the total compensation paid was shared by the lawyer and the association. This was the practice of law by an unlicensed lay agency and was contrary to public policy and this section. Richmond Ass'n of Credit Men v. Bar Ass'n, 167 Va. 327, 189 S.E. 153, 1937 Va. LEXIS 281 (1937) (decided under prior law). See Bryce v. Gillespie, 160 Va. 137, 168 S.E. 653, 1933 Va. LEXIS 192 (1933) ( decided under prior law). Attorney on adminstrative suspension .  Just as there was no practical distinction between the ability of the unlicensed foreign attorney to practice law and the attorney on administrative suspension, t he court of appeals could find no rational basis to treat the pleadings filed by the former as invalid and those filed by the latter as valid; hence, because an attorney signed and filed a motion for judgment on behalf of his clients when he was not enti tled to practice law in the Commonwealth at the time he signed and filed the same, that pleading was invalid and had no legal effect, entitling the opposing party to judgment. Nerri v. Adu-Gyamfi, 270 Va. 28, 613 S.E.2d 429, 2005 Va. LEXIS 59 (2005). Basis of civil conspiracy allegation.  Chapter 7 trustee adequately pleaded claims of statutory and common-law civil conspiracy under Virginia law by alleging that defendants willfully conspired with n on-defendant board members and officers of debtor law firm to breach their fiduciary duties through the misappropriation of client funds and by alleging that defendants willfully conspired with non-defendant board members and officers of debtor to breach the fiduciary duties owed by the officers and directors by giving control of debtor to a non-lawyer, in violation of a state statute prohibiting practicing law without authority.

Notice of appeal deemed a nullity.  Because a wifes attorney was not authorized to practice law at the time that the attorney filed a notice of appeal of a dissolution order, the attorney was in violation of § 54.1-3904, the appeal had not been properly perfected, and the notice was a nullity; accordingly, the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction to consider it.

Liability of local attorney hired by foreign attorney.  When a foreign attorney hires a local attorney to perform services on an hourly basis, while remaining lead counsel in the action, and the local attorney has no d irect contact with the client, the local attorney nevertheless does not escape liability to the client for his negligence in the discharge of his assigned duties, since he has an implied obligation to act with reasonable care.

CASE NOTES Non-pecuniary damages not recoverable in legal malpractice claim.  Tort damages  including non-pecuniary damages such as mental anguish, emotional distress, and humiliation  are not recoverable for breach of contract; as that principle holds true for all non-pecuniary, non-economic injury caused by an attorneys malpractice, such loss is not recoverable as damages in a legal malpractice claim. A legal malpractice plaintiff may recover only pecuniary damages proximatel y caused by an attorneys breach of the contractually implied duties. Smith v. McLaughlin, 289 Va. 241, 769 S.E.2d 7, 2015 Va. LEXIS 23 (2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Professional corporation members liable for own malpractice.  Lawyer could be personally liable for legal malpractice, despite being a member of a professional corporation, because, statutorily, membership in a professional corporation did not bar a lawyers personal liability for his or her own professional negligence.

Most of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Interest of the states in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essen tial to the primary governmental function of administering justice and have historically been officers of the courts. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). The admission or exclusion of an attorney is not the exercise of a mere ministerial power. It is the exercise of judicial power and the admission of an attorney may, with propriety, be entrusted to the courts. Brown v. Supreme Court of Virginia, 359 F. Supp. 549, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13352 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 414 U.S. 1034, 94 S. Ct. 534, 38 L. Ed. 2d 327, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 1459 (1973). It is universally recognized that the highest court of the state may prescribe rules relating to admissions to the bar even in the absence of a statute. Brown v. Supreme Court of Virginia, 359 F. Supp. 549, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13352 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 414 U.S. 1034, 94 S. Ct. 534, 38 L. Ed. 2d 327, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 1459 (1973). Rules may authorize State Bar activities not enumerated.  The Supreme Court may adopt rules authorizing the State Bar to engage in activities not specifically enumerated in this article. Button v. Day, 204 Va. 547, 132 S .E.2d 292, 1963 Va. LEXIS 185 (1963). Such as continuing legal edu cation program.  Under rules adopted by the Supreme Court, the Council of the State Bar had authority to participate in a program of continuing legal education, which program tend s to advance the science of jurisprudence and to facilitate the administration of justice. Button v. Day, 204 Va. 547, 132 S.E.2d 292, 1963 Va. LEXIS 185 (1963). This section provides no standards for the Virginia Court to follow in regulating attorneys; it is apparent that insofar as the substantive content of such a code is concerned, the State has vested in the court virtually its entire legislative or regulatory power over the legal profession. Supreme Court v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 100 S. Ct. 1967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 641, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 108 (1980). Ethical code direc ts noncontrol by fee schedules.  The Virginia Supreme Court has adopted ethical codes which deal in part with fees and far from exercising State power to authorize binding price fixing has explic itly directed lawyers not to be controlled by fee schedules. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). No diminution of S tate regulatory power intended.  In holding that certain anticompetitive conduct by lawyers is within the reach of the Sherman Act, the Supreme Court of the United States intended no diminution o f the authority of the State to regulate its professions. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). Circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to revoke attorney's license.  Commonwealths statutory scheme did not grant the circuit court the power to disbar attorneys, and the circuit court lacked authority to grant a citizen the re lief he desired, the revocation of a county Commonwealth attorneys license; Virginia law did not authorize the revocation or disbarment proceedings the citizen sought to pursue in any other form, nor did it provide for individual citizens to prosecut e disbarment or disciplinary proceedings against attorneys in circuit courts. Spanos v. Taylor, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 143 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2023). Lawyers price-fixing activities held violative of Sherman Antitrust Act.  See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). The Supreme Court of Virginia acted in a legislative capacity in adopting the disciplinary rules under this section. Hirschkop v. Virginia State Bar, 421 F. Supp. 1137, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13858 (E.D.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. In enacting disciplinary rules, the Supreme Court of Virginia is constituted a legislature. Supreme Court v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 100 S. Ct. 1967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 641, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 108 (1980). Immuni ty from suit while acting in legislative capacity.  The Supreme Court of Virginia is exercising the States entire legislative power with respect to regulating the bar and its members are the States legislat ors for the purpose of issuing the Bar Code, thus the Supreme Court of Virginia and its members are immune from suit when acting in their legislative capacity. Supreme Court v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 100 S. Ct. 1967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 641, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 108 (1980). Interest of the states in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essen tial to the primary governmental function of administering justice and have historically been officers of the courts. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). Circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to revoke attorney's license.  Commonwealths statutory scheme did not grant the circuit court the power to disbar attorneys, and the circuit court lacked authority to grant a citizen the re lief he desired, the revocation of a county Commonwealth attorneys license; Virginia law did not authorize the revocation or disbarment proceedings the citizen sought to pursue in any other form, nor did it provide for individual citizens to prosecut e disbarment or disciplinary proceedings against attorneys in circuit courts. Spanos v. Taylor, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 143 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2023). State bar is state agency by law. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). Granting of the Virginia State Bars motion to dismiss an attorneys complaint under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 was proper because the bar was an agency of the S upreme Court of Virginia and it was therefore protected by U.S. Const., Amend. XI. Hunter v. Va. State Bar, 786 F. Supp. 2d 1107, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49232 (E.D. Va. 2011). Attorneys failure to disclose in his application to qualify as an attorney for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia that he was publ icly reprimanded by the Virginia State Bar was grounds for denial, as it violated the duty of candor he owed to the bankruptcy court. His argument that the term any court in the application referred only to the Supreme Court of Virginia was a del iberate attempt to parse the language in the application to his own purposes in order to circumvent disclosure, and even if the state bar was not an administrative agency of the Supreme Court of Virginia, the term would nevertheless apply where it was pr esiding in its capacity as an adjudicative tribunal deciding ethical conduct matters. In re Fisher, No. 15-00301-KRH, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 4025 (Bankr. E.D. Va. May 11, 2015). But not an antitrust shield.  The fact that the State Bar is a state agency for some limited purposes does not create an antitrust shield that allows it to foster anticompetitive practices for the benefit of its members. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). And joining in anticompetitive activity is not beyond Sherman Act.  The State Bar, by providing that deviation from county bar minimum fees may lead to disciplinary action, has voluntarily joined in what is essentially a private a nticompetitive activity, and in that posture cannot claim it is beyond the reach of the Sherman Act. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). La wyers price-fixing activities violative of Sherman Act.  Activities which resulted in a rigid price floor for a lawyers service in doing a title search, from which petitioners, as consumers, could not escape if they wished to borrow money to buy a home, were violative of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). No diminution of S tate regulatory power intended.  In holding that certain anticompetitive conduct by lawyers is within the reach of the Sherman Act, the Supreme Court of the United States intended no diminution o f the authority of the State to regulate its professions. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 13 (1975). Powers of bar.  Composition of the board considering disciplinary violations against the attorney did not affect the jurisdiction of the bar pursuant to § 54.1-3910 to investi gate and report attorney violations. Thus, the attorney could not complain that the bar should not have been able to bring charges of misconduct against the attorney because the attorneys former attorney was on the subcommittee that certified the cha rges, as the attorney waived any irregularity by not timely objecting. Green v. Va. State Bar, 278 Va. 162, 677 S.E.2d 227, 2009 Va. LEXIS 67 (2009). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Activities aimed at promoting di versity.  Efforts of the Virginia State Bar to promote diversity in the legal profession represent a legitimate state interest, and promoting diversity is reasonably relate d to regulating the legal profession and improving the quality of legal services to the public. It would therefore be constitutionally permissible for the Virginia State Bar to fund the Diversity Conference using mandatory state bar dues. The Virginia State Bar is not required to create procedures by which members may challenge the use of dues for any bar activity to which they object, so long as its activities remain germane to the practice of law.

In re R yder, 263 F. Supp. 360, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11009 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 381 F.2d 713, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 5558 (4th Cir. 1967) (decided under prior law). The role of the State Bar is limited to the investigation of violations and the filing of appropriate complaints in the proper courts. Supreme Court v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 446 U.S. 719, 100 S. Ct. 1967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 641, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 108 (1980) (decided under prior law). Time limitation on demanding trial before a three-judge court does not conflict with § 54.1-3915.  Time limitation in former Va. Sup. Ct. R. pt. 6, § IV, R. 13(C)(6) for filing a demand for a trial before a three-judge court does not eliminate the jurisdicti on of the courts to deal with attorney discipline and does not deny an attorney a right to a trial of disciplinary charges before a three-judge court in violation of § 54.1-3915; the rule merely fills in a void in the statute regarding when and how a demand for a trial before a three-judge court must be made. Fails v. Va. State Bar, 265 Va. 3, 574 S.E.2d 530, 2003 Va. LEXIS 11 (2003). Rule deeming an answer to a certification of charges to be consent to the jurisidiction of the Virginia State Disciplinary Board does not conflict with § 54.1-3915.  Provision of former Va. Sup. Ct. R. pt. 6, § IV, R. 13(C)(6) that an attorneys filing of an answer to a certification of charges of misconduct shall be con clusively deemed to be a consent to the jurisdiction of the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Board does not conflict with the mandate of § 54.1-3915 that an attorney who demands to be tried for disciplinary charges before a court of competent jurisdict ion is to be tried before no other forum; nothing in § 54.1-3915 suggests that the right to be tried by a three-judge court cannot be waived, and an attorney who fails to file a timely demand for a trial before a three-judge court effectively waives t he right to demand such a forum for the charges against the attorney. Fails v. Va. State Bar, 265 Va. 3, 574 S.E.2d 530, 2003 Va. LEXIS 11 (2003). Term ination of authority of State Bar Disciplinary Board.  When an attorney timely demanded his alleged violations be tried before a three-judge court, the Virginia State Bar Disciplinary Boards authority terminated a nd it had no authority to enter its order suspending the attorneys license. Cilman v. Va. State Bar, 266 Va. 66, 580 S.E.2d 830, 2003 Va. LEXIS 63 (2003). Attorneys remanded appeal to a Disciplinary Board for reconsideration did not trigger any new right for him to then request a three-judge court under § 54. 1-3915 and former Va. Sup. Ct. R. pt. 6, § IV, R. 13(I)(1)(a)(1)(a). Green v. Va. State Bar ex rel. Seventh Dist. Comm., 274 Va. 775, 652 S.E.2d 118, 2007 Va. LEXIS 134 (2007). Circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to revoke attorney's license.  Commonwealths statutory scheme did not grant the circuit court the power to disbar attorneys, and the circuit court lacked authority to grant a citizen the re lief he desired, the revocation of a county Commonwealth attorneys license; the circuit court had only such subject-matter jurisdiction as was conferred by the Constitution or by statute, but the statute did not confer jurisdiction, and the circuit c ourt was without authority to redress the citizens claims. Spanos v. Taylor, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 143 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2023). Circuit court lacked jurisdiction to revoke an attorneys license to practice law in Virginia as Virginias statutory scheme did not provide a mechanism all owing citizens to file such actions. The statute the client relied on, Va. Code Ann. § 54.1-3915, required that the Supreme Court of Virginias rules, regulations, and modes of procedure governing legal ethics be consistent with the governing statu tes and did not confer a personal right on an individual to file an ethics complaint in a circuit court, rather than with the Bar.

The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Power of Supreme Court to review Boards decisions.  The Supreme Court has no explicit statutory authority to review the Boards decisions or to reverse its evaluation of a particular candidate. Nonetheless, it i s well settled that that Court retains such inherent power. Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 454 F. Supp. 4, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17428 (E.D. Va. 1978), aff'd, 598 F.2d 1345, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 14439 (4th Cir. 1979). The Supreme Court of Virginia has no explicit statutory authority to review the Boards decisions or to question judicially its evaluation of a particular cand idate, but the Supreme Court retains such inherent power. It is universally recognized that the highest court of the State may prescribe rules relating to admissions to the bar even in the absence of a statute. Rogers v. Supreme Court, 590 F. Supp. 102, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16096 (E.D. Va. 1984). Right of appeal from decision of Board not constitutionally required.  The right of an appeal from the decision of a trial court is not a constitutionally guaranteed right. If no constitutional deprivation be made out by a States refusal to allow appeal from a decision taking life, liberty, or property from a criminal defendant, assuredly the State is not constitutionally required to provide an appeal from a decision of its administrative arm, the Board of Bar Examiners. Rogers v. Supreme Court, 590 F. Supp. 102, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16096 (E.D. Va. 1984). Board performs judicial function on behalf of Supreme Court.  In judging the intellectual fitness of an applicant to practice law, the Board of Bar Examiners performs a judicial function on behalf of the Supreme Court of Vir ginia. Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 454 F. Supp. 4, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17428 (E.D. Va. 1978), aff'd, 598 F.2d 1345, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 14439 (4th Cir. 1979). No federal district court jurisdiction over applicants individual claims.  A federal district court does not have jurisdiction to consider an unsuccessful applicants challenge to the procedures and practices of the Board, in referenc e to that applicants particular bar examination. Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 454 F. Supp. 4, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17428 (E.D. Va. 1978), aff'd, 598 F.2d 1345, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 14439 (4th Cir. 1979). EEOC test guidelines inapplicable.  The test validation guidelines promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 do not govern profession al licensing examinations. Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 420 F. Supp. 211, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13319 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd, 598 F.2d 1345, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 14439 (4th Cir. 1979). Disc rimination claims improperly filed in federal court.  Since Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, by its own terms, does not apply to the bar examination, and since the Board of Bar Examiners is neither an e mployer, an employment agency, nor a labor organization within the meaning of the act, the federal district court properly dismissed discrimination claims filed by an applicant to the Virginia Bar who had failed the bar examination an d was denied admission therefore. The applicant must present his grievance to the Supreme Court of Virginia and, if it is decided adversely to him, may then petition the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari.

The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Virginia has created two classes of attorneys. The first encompasses those attorneys lic ensed by examination, and the second includes those licensed without examination. In re Brown, 213 Va. 282, 191 S.E.2d 812, 1972 Va. LEXIS 348 (1972). Those licensed by examination need not show intent to practice full time as member of Virginia Bar.  As to those attorneys licensed by examination, there is no requirement of a preadmission showing of intent to practice full time as a member of the Virginia Bar. In re Brown, 213 Va. 282, 191 S.E.2d 812, 1972 Va. LEXIS 348 (1972). Th ose licensed without examination must make such showing.  As to those attorneys licensed without examination, the requirement of a preadmission showing of intent to practice full time as a member of the Virginia Bar is i mposed. In re Brown, 213 Va. 282, 191 S.E.2d 812, 1972 Va. LEXIS 348 (1972). As to both classes, residency rules apply. In re Titus, 213 Va. 289, 191 S.E.2d 798, 1972 Va. LEXIS 349 (1972). Provisions of this section do not apply to foreign attorneys seeking admission by reciprocity. Brown v. Supreme Court of Virginia, 359 F. Supp. 549, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13352 (E.D.

Cohabi tation improper ground for denial of certificate.  Although a state may require high standards of qualifications, such as good moral character or proficiency in its law, before it admits an applicant to the bar, s uch qualifications, to pass constitutional muster, must have a rational connection with the applicants fitness or capacity to practice law. Thus, an applicant for the right to take the Virginia Bar Examination could not be denied a certificate of hon est demeanor or good moral character on the sole ground that she and a male to whom she was not married jointly owned and resided in the same dwelling, as this conduct bears no rational connection to her fitness to practice law. Cord v. Gibb, 219 Va. 101 9, 254 S.E.2d 71, 1979 Va. LEXIS 205 (1979). § 54.1-3925.1. Proof of character and fitness required of applicant; character and fitness committee; fees. Text A. Before issu ing to any applicant a license or certificate to practice law in Virginia, the Board shall have found from satisfactory evidence produced by the applicant in such form as the Board may require that the applicant is a person of honest demeanor and good mo ral character, is over the age of eighteen and possesses the requisite fitness to perform the obligations and responsibilities of a practicing attorney at law. B. In making s uch determinations, the Board shall conduct such further inquiries, interviews and hearings as the Board may deem necessary. At the request of the Board, the Supreme Court may appoint a separate character and fitness committee, some of the members of whi ch may be persons who are not licensed attorneys, to assist in reviewing character and fitness evidence and to make recommendations to the Board based upon standards adopted by the Board; however, no applicant shall be denied a license on character and f itness reasons except by action of a majority of the Board, after notice to the applicant and an opportunity for the applicant to be heard before the Board. C. The Board s hall from time to time set character and fitness application fees sufficient to cover the costs of the character and fitness process. History History. 1992, c. 734; 1998, c. 796.

CASE NOTES Licensing authorit y subject to Disabilities Act.  While the boards broad authority to set licensing qualifications is well established, such authority is subject to the requirements of the Americans with Disa bilities Act. Clark v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 880 F. Supp. 430, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2263 (E.D. Va. 1995). Mental health inquiry appropriate.  At some stage in the application proceeding, some form of mental health inquiry is appropriate. Clark v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 880 F. Supp. 430, 1995 U.S. D ist. LEXIS 2263 (E.D. Va. 1995). Question d iscriminates against disabled applicants.  Question 20(b) of the bar admission questionnaire, which asked Have you within the past five (5) years, been treated or counselled for a mental, emotional or nervous disorders? is a broadly worded mental health question which discriminates against disabled applicants by imposing additional eligibility criteria. While certain severe mental or emotional disorders may pose a direct threat to public safety, t he board has made no individualized finding that obtaining evidence of mental health counseling or treatment is effective in guarding against this threat. Accordingly, the Virginia Board of Bar Examiners is enjoined from requiring that future applicants answer the question. Clark v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 880 F. Supp. 430, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2263 (E.D. Va. 1995). § 54.1-3925.2. Access to criminal history records. Text The Board is authorized to obtain criminal history record information relating to an applicant from any state or federal law-enforcement agency. Any information so obt ained is for the exclusive use of the Board and the character and fitness committee and shall not be released to any other person or agency except in furtherance of the investigation of the applicant or with the authorization of the applicant or upon cou rt order.

Power of Supreme Court to review Boards decisions.  The Supreme Court has no explicit statutory authority to review the Boards decisions or to reverse its evaluation of a particular candidate. Nonetheless, it i s well settled that that Court retains such inherent power. Woodard v. Virginia Bd. of Bar Exmrs., 454 F. Supp. 4, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17428 (E.D.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. This section is applicable only where the clients claim is tort or contract, and the refore did not apply where the attorney was retained to seek a wifes dower interest in the estate of her deceased husband. Stevens v. Sparks, 205 Va. 128, 135 S.E.2d 140, 1964 Va. LEXIS 154 (1964). The lien comes into existence immediately upon the making of the contract of employment between the client and his attorneys. In re Funk, 2 F. Supp. 555, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1533 (D. Va. 1932), aff'd, 63 F.2d 170, 1933 U.S. App. LEXIS 3354 (4th Cir. 1933). But see Tignor v. Parkinson, 729 F.2d 977, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 24480 (4th Cir. 198 4). And clients bankruptcy more than four months thereafter does not affect lien.  A written contract of employment, made by plaintiff in an action for bodily and property injuries with his attorneys who had brought the action, provided that the attorneys should receive one third of the recovery. The plaintiff was adjudicated a bankrupt and the trustee claimed the proceeds of the recovery. Since the contract of employment was made more than four months before bankruptcy, the trustee did not hav e any right to the one third of the proceeds going to the attorneys. In re Funk, 2 F. Supp. 555, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1533 (D. Va. 1932), aff'd, 63 F.2d 170, 1933 U.S. App. LEXIS 3354 (4th Cir. 1933). But see Tignor v. Parkinson, 729 F.2d 977, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 24480 (4th Cir. 1984). An attorneys lien comes into existence on the making of the contract of employment b etween the client and attorney, but then remains inchoate until judgment or recovery is obtained. Montavon v. United States, 864 F. Supp. 519, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14723 (E.D. Va. 1994). The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 superseded the holding in Ruebush v. Funk, 63 F.2d 170 (4th Cir. 1933) and former 11 U.S.C. § 110(a)(5) that not all claims for injury to the person come into the bankrupt estate. Tignor v. Parkinson, 729 F.2d 977, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 24480 (4th Cir. 1984). Bankruptcy law recognizes the common-law lien provided for in this section.  Accordingly, the attorney for the bankrupt has a valid lien for compensation for work performed prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. When, however, the attorney has been discharged, the amount of such lien under Virginia law would be limited to quantum meruit compensation for work actually performed. Metro Mach. Corp. v. Berkley Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp. (In re Ward), 32 Bankr. 318, 1983 Bankr. LEXI S 5611 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983). A lien perfected prepetition under the Virginia attorney lien statute is valid in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy court will recognize attorney liens incurred postpeti tion if the statute was followed by the attorney. Military Circle Pet Ctr. #94, Inc. v. Docktor Pet Holdings, Ltd., 181 Bankr. 282, 1994 Bankr. LEXIS 2144 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1994). An attorney has a lien upon the cause of action as security for his fee under this section. Katopodis v. Liberian S/T Olympic Sun, 282 F. Supp. 369, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8214 (E.D. Va. 1968). Any attorney [employed] to prosecute [a claim sounding in tort or in contract] shall have a lien upon the cause of action as security for his fees for any ser vices rendered in relation to the cause of action or claim. This language is broad and permits no interpretation limiting the benefits of the statute to Virginia lawyers or to legal work performed in Virginia. Hughes v. Cole, 251 Va. 3, 465 S.E.2d 82 0, 1996 Va. LEXIS 16 (1996). The lien includes expenses. Katopodis v. Liberian S/T Olympic Sun, 282 F. Supp. 369, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8214 (E.D. Va. 1968). Lien mea sured by quantity and quality of work performed.  This section is not so broad as to mean that, once an attorney and his client have negotiated a contract, the attorney becomes entitled to claim a lien coextensiv e with the contractual fee. Rather, it measures the lien by the fees for any services rendered in relation to the cause of action or claim, i.e., compensation for the quantity and quality of the work performed. Heinzman v. Fine, Fine, Legum &amp; Fin e, 217 Va. 958, 234 S.E.2d 282, 1977 Va. LEXIS 266 (1977). The attorney becomes a party in interest to the litigation after plaintiffs action i s commenced. Katopodis v. Liberian S/T Olympic Sun, 282 F. Supp. 369, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8214 (E.D. Va. 1968). And may prosecute pr oceedings to recover his fee.  Where plaintiffs counsel has been made a party to proceedings, he may prosecute the same to recover his fee. Katopodis v. Liberian S/T Olympic Sun, 282 F. Sup p. 369, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8214 (E.D. Va. 1968). Recovery as percentage or on quantum meruit.  In cases where plaintiff and defendant, without the knowledge or consent of plaintiffs attorney, have settled their dispute and the attorney holds a contract for a contingent percentage of any recovery, the authorities differ as to whether the recovery is the percentage called for by the contract, or on a quantum meruit. Katopodis v. Liberian S/T Olympic Sun, 282 F. Supp. 369, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8214 (E.D. Va. 1968). Determining quantum meruit.  A quantum meruit determination looks to the reasonable value of the services rendered, not in benefit to the client, but in themselves. Heinzman v. Fine, Fine, Le gum &amp; Fine, 217 Va. 958, 234 S.E.2d 282, 1977 Va. LEXIS 266 (1977). In this copyright infringement action, plaintiffs former counsel was entitled to fees and costs; a 55% reduction in the 10,955 hours claimed by counsel was ap propriate to account for the flawed entries that impeded a fair and confident assessment of the quality of the services rendered. In re Outsidewall Tire Litig., 178 F. Supp. 3d 300, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47780 (E.D. Va. 2016), rev'd, 689 Fed.

S uch demand shall be made in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in Part Six, Section IV, Paragraph 13 of the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia. Upon receipt of a demand for a three-judge circuit court, the Virginia State Bar shall file a complaint in a circuit court where venue is proper and the chief judge of the circuit court shall issue a rule against the attorney to show cause why the attorney shall not be disciplined. At the time the rule is issued by the circuit court, the court sh all certify the fact of such issuance and the time and place of the hearing thereon to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who shall designate the three-judge circuit court, which shall consist of three circuit court judges of circuits other than the circuit in which the case is pending, to hear and decide the case.

I.General Consideration. Many of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Inherent power of courts expressly recognized.  By this section and former § 54-73, the legislature, far from undertaking to deprive the courts of their inherent power in disbarment cases, has expressly reco gnized it. Legal Club v. Light, 137 Va. 249, 119 S.E. 55, 1923 Va. LEXIS 152 (1923). Prosecution of disbarment proceedings.  General Assemblys 2017 revision to Va. Code Ann. § 54.1-3935 reveals that the legislature plainly did not intend that only circuit courts can hear discipli nary and disbarment matters. Under Virginia law, citizens are not empowered to prosecute disbarment proceedings in circuit courts. Citizens only have the power to make a complaint to the bar, which then prosecutes the matter.. Spanos v. Feinmel, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 155 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2023). Complaint by client not required before investigation of misconduct.  There is no provision in the statutes or rules relating to the discipline of attorneys which requires a complaint by a client before lawyer misconduct may be inve stigated. Delk v. Virginia State Bar, 233 Va. 187, 355 S.E.2d 558, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2256, 1987 Va. LEXIS 183 (1987). Purpose of a proceeding to discipline an attorney is not to punish him but to protect th e public. Seventh Dist. Comm. v. Gunter, 212 Va. 278, 183 S.E.2d 713, 1971 Va. LEXIS 348 (1971). Disbarment proceedings are summary and sui generis.  Disbarment proceedings are special proceedings, peculiar to themselves, sui generis, disciplinary in nature, and of a summary character. Maddy v. First Dist. Comm . of Va. State Bar, 205 Va. 652, 139 S.E.2d 56, 1964 Va. LEXIS 231 (1964). A proceeding to discipline an attorney is a special proceeding, civil and disciplinary in nature, and of a summary character. Seventh Dist. Comm. v. Gunter, 212 V a. 278, 183 S.E.2d 713, 1971 Va. LEXIS 348 (1971). A proceeding to discipline an attorney is not a lawsuit between parties litigant, but is rather in the nature of an inquest or inquiry as to the conduct of the respondent attorney. Maddy v. First Dist. Comm. of Va. State Bar, 205 Va. 652, 139 S.E.2d 56, 1964 Va. LEXIS 231 (1964). But is in the nature of an inquest or inquiry.  A proceeding to discipline an attorney is in the nature of an inquest or inquiry as to the conduct of the attorney. Seventh Dist. Comm. v. Gunter, 212 Va. 278, 18 3 S.E.2d 713, 1971 Va. LEXIS 348 (1971). A proceeding to discipline an attorney is not a criminal proceeding. Seventh Dist. Comm. v. Gunter, 212 Va. 278, 183 S.E.2d 713, 1971 Va. LEXIS 348 (1971). But is civil in nature.  A proceeding under this section is not criminal but is civil in its nature. Norfolk &amp; Portsmouth Bar Ass'n v. Drewry, 161 Va. 833, 172 S.E. 282, 1934 Va. LEXIS 30 7 (1934); Campbell v. Third Dist. Comm. of Va. State Bar, 179 Va. 244, 18 S.E.2d 883, 1942 Va.

Fact-finding.  Three-judge court properly found an attorney violated professional conduct rules because (1) the attorney directed an associate who had not taken the oath of fide lity to appear in court, (2) any fact-finding requirements were met, as every point of factual disagreement did not have to be addressed, and (3) the attorney did not inquire if the associate had taken the oath.

If Bar Coun sel has reasonable cause to believe that an attorney is engaging in any activity which is unlawful or violates the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct and which will result in loss of property of one or more of the attorneys clients or any other p erson, Bar Counsel may submit an ex parte petition to the circuit court of the city or county wherein the attorney who is the subject of the petition resides or is doing business for the issuance of an order authorizing the immediate inspection by and pr oduction to representatives of the petitioner of any records, documents, and physical or other evidence belonging to the subject attorney or any professional partnership, professional limited liability company, or professional corporation with which the subject attorney is associated. The court may issue such order without notice to the attorney if the petition, supported by affidavit of the petitioner and such other evidence as the court may require, shows reasonable cause to believe that such action i s required to prevent immediate loss of property of one or more of the subject attorneys clients or any other person. The papers filed with the court pursuant to this subsection shall be placed under seal. B. If Bar Coun sel has reasonable cause to believe that an attorney is engaging in any activity which is unlawful or in violation of the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct and which will result in loss of property of one or more of the attorneys clients or any other person, Bar Counsel may file a petition with the circuit court of the county or city wherein the subject attorney resides or is doing business. The petition may seek the following relief: (i) an injunction prohibiting the withdrawal of any bank dep osits or the disposition of any other assets belonging to or subject to the control of the subject attorney or any professional partnership, professional limited liability company, or professional corporation with which the subject attorney is associated ; and (ii) the appointment of a receiver for all or part of the funds or property of the subject attorneys law practice or of any professional partnership, professional limited liability company, or professional corporation with which the subject att orney is associated. The subject attorney shall be given notice of the time and place of the hearing on the petition and an opportunity to offer evidence. The court, in its discretion, may require a receiver appointed pursuant to this section to post bon d, with or without surety. The papers filed with the court under this subsection shall be placed under seal until such time as the court grants an injunction or appoints a receiver. The court may issue an injunction, appoint a receiver or provide such ot her relief as the court may consider proper if, after a hearing, the court finds that such relief is necessary or appropriate to prevent loss of property of one or more of the subject attorneys clients or any other person. C. In any proc eeding under subsection B, any professional partnership, professional limited liability company, or professional corporation with which the subject attorney is associated and any other person or entity known to Bar Counsel to be indebted to or having in his possession property, real or personal, belonging to or subject to the control of the subject attorneys law practice and which property Bar Counsel reasonably believes may become part of the receivership assets, shall be served with a copy of the petition and notice of the time and place of the hearing. D. The receive r shall, unless otherwise ordered by the court, (i) prepare and file with the Virginia State Bar an inventory of all case files under the subject attorneys control; (ii) notify in writing all of the subject attorneys clients of the appointment an d take whatever action the receiver deems appropriate to protect the interests of the clients until such time as the clients have had an opportunity to obtain successor counsel, and in the case of a deceased attorney, notify in writing the personal repre sentative, if any, of the deceased attorneys estate and the commissioner of accounts of the circuit court in which the deceased attorneys estate is being administered that the receiver may have a claim against the deceased attorneys estate fo r fees and costs of the receivership; (iii) identify and take control of all bank accounts, including without limitation trust and operating accounts, over which the subject attorney had signatory authority in connection with his law practice; (iv) prepa re and submit an accounting of receipts and disbursements and account balances of all funds under the receivers control for submission to the court within four months of the appointment and annually thereafter until the receivership is terminated by the court; (v) attempt to collect any accounts receivable related to the subject attorneys law practice; (vi) identify and attempt to recover any assets wrongfully diverted from the subject attorneys law practice, or assets acquired with funds wr ongfully diverted from the subject attorneys law practice; (vii) terminate the subject attorneys law practice; (viii) reduce to cash all of the assets of the subject attorneys law practice, and in the case of a deceased attorney notify in wri ting the personal representative, if any, of the deceased attorneys estate, and the commissioner of accounts of the circuit court in which the deceased attorneys estate is being administered of any proposed liquidations of assets; (ix) determine the nature and amount of all claims of creditors, including clients, of the subject attorneys law practice; and (x) prepare and file with the court a report of such assets and claims proposing a distribution to such creditors and, in the case of a de ceased attorney, notify in writing the personal representative, if any, of the deceased attorneys estate and the commissioner of accounts of the circuit court in which the deceased attorneys estate is being administered of the proposed distributi on of the receivership funds. Upon the courts approval of the receivers report, at a hearing after such notice as the court may require to creditors, the personal representative of the subject attorneys estate and the commissioner of accounts of the circuit court in which the deceased attorneys estate is being administered, the receiver shall distribute the assets of the subject attorneys law practice first to clients whose funds were or ought to have been held in trust by the subjec t attorney, then to the receiver for fees, costs, and expenses awarded pursuant to subsection E, and thereafter to the general creditors of the subject attorneys law practice, including clients whose funds were not required to have been held in trust by the subject attorney, and then to the subject attorney or the subject attorneys personal representative. E. A receiver appointed pursuant to this section shall be entitled, upon proper application to the court in which the appointment was made, to recover an award of reasonable fees, costs, and expenses. If there are not sufficient nontrust funds to pay the award, then t he shortfall shall be paid by the Virginia State Bar, to the extent that the Virginia State Bar has funds available. The Virginia State Bar shall have a claim against the subject attorney or the subject attorneys estate for the amount paid. F. The court m ay determine whether any assets under the receivers control should be returned to the subject attorney or the subject attorneys personal representative during the receivership. G. This statut e is declared to be remedial. Its purpose is to protect the interests of clients adversely affected by attorneys who have engaged in misconduct. It is to be liberally administered in order to protect those interests and thereby the publics interest i n the quality of legal services provided by Virginia attorneys.

CASE NOTES Distribution of fund s from client trust account.  Where a receiver is able to trace funds held in an attorneys client trust account to certain clients, those funds are to be paid to those clients to the exten t of their equitable interest. If all or part of a claimants ownership interest cannot be traced to specific funds in the trust account, the right to recovery is not lost but that right does not attach to funds identified as owned by another but runs to funds not traceable to a specific owner and a pro rata distribution of such funds would be appropriate.

CASE NOTES Notice of violations.  Virginia Board of Accountancy properly notified an individually licensed certified public accountant of the statutes and regulations he allegedly violated because , inter alia, the notice for an informal fact-finding conference specifically referenced a potential violation of one section, the investigative report, which was attached to the notice, specifically referenced all the sections, and the CPAs counsel specifically represented that he was prepared to address the allegations in the investigative report. Kim v. Va. Bd. of Accountancy, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 312 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2016). Penalties for failure to comply.  Board of Accountancy properly imposed a $10,000 penalty against a certified public accountant because the CPA failed to enroll his firm in a monitoring program, w hich he was required to do as the sole member of a firm providing an audit, the CPA conceded that he performed an audit without proper firm licensure, admitted to vast ignorance about his professional obligations, and knew about the requirement for a fir m to engage in peer review monitoring and simply disregarded the requirement.
