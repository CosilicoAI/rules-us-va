CASE NOTES Power over state-owned bottomlands.  Pursuant to governing law, the property owners rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the li ne of navigability was in the Commonwealth, to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could and did authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owners roof and second-story deck adde d to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commissions permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private piers placement for the limited purpose of accessing navi gable waters or vessels moored in those waters. Evelyn v. Commonwealth Marine Res. Comm'n, 46 Va. App. 618, 621 S.E.2d 130, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 428 (2005). State Marine Resourc es Commissions authority.  Commission did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it approved the owners after-the-fact permit to include an upper deck bar structure on the p ier that the owner rebuilt after a hurricane. The commission did not have any decision making formula intended to dictate the outcome of a permit application and, instead, was directed to permit reasonable uses of state-owned bottomland pursuant to § 28.2-1204, and permitting the bar structure was acceptable because the pier was open to the public for the publics use and enjoyment.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Power over state-owned bottomlands.  While Executive Orders 58 and 66 enabled individuals to reconstruct or build replacements for piers and other structures damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Isabel, nothing limited the authority of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) to grant permits to expand or enlarge upon those pre-September 18, 2003, uses. VMRC had authority to exercise jurisdiction over state-owned submerged lands, including to is sue permits for reasonable uses thereof pursuant to §§ 28.2-1204, 28.2-1205, and 28.2-101. Harrison v.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Virginia Marin e Resources Commissions authority.  It is within the scope of the Virginia Marine Resources Commissions authority to make reasonable determinations, based on the facts, concerning 1) whether an entitys facility is a commercial facility, and if so, 2) whether a particular service provided at the facility relates to the shipping of domestic or foreign cargo such that the facilitys owner would be exempt from the payment of royalties under subsection B of § 28.2-1206.

Living shorelines; development of general permit; guidance. Text A. As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning: Living shoreline means a shoreline management practice that provides erosion control a nd water quality benefits; protects, restores, or enhances natural shoreline habitat; and maintains coastal processes through the strategic placement of plants, stone, sand fill, and other structural and organic materials. When practicable, a living shor eline may enhance coastal resilience and attenuation of wave energy and storm surge. Other structural and organic materials means materials or features that provide added protection or stability for the natural shoreline habitat components of a living shoreline that attenuate wave energy and do not interfere with natural coastal processes or the natural continuity of the land-water interface. Other structural and orga nic materials may be composed of a variety of natural or man-made materials, including rock, concrete, wood fiber, oyster shells, and geotextiles; however, structural features shall be free from contaminants and shall be adequately secured to prevent full or partial dislodging or detachment due to wave action or other natural forces. B. The Commiss ion, in cooperation with the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Quality, and local wetlands boards, and with technical assistance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, shall establish and implement a gener al permit regulation that authorizes and encourages the use of living shorelines as the preferred alternative for stabilizing tidal shorelines in the Commonwealth. The regulation shall provide for an expedited permit review process for qualifying living shoreline projects requiring authorization under Chapters 12 (§ 28.2-1200 et seq.), 13 (§ 28.2-1300 et seq.), and 14 (§ 28.2-1400 et seq.). In developing the general permit, the Commission shall consult with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to e nsure the minimization of conflicts with federal law and regulation. C. The Commiss ion, in cooperation with the Department of Conservation and Recreation and with technical assistance from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, shall develop integrated guidance for the management of tidal shoreline systems to provide a technical bas is for the coordination of permit decisions required by any regulatory entity exercising authority over a shoreline management project. The guidance shall: 1. Commu nicate to stakeholders and regulatory authorities that it is the policy of the Commonwealth to support living shorelines as the preferred alternative for stabilizing tidal shorelines; 2. Identify preferred shoreline management approaches for the shoreline types found in the Commonwealth; 3. Explain the risks and benefits of protection provided by various shoreline system elements associated with each management option; and 4. Recommend procedures to achieve efficiency and effectiveness by the various regulatory entities exercising authority over a shoreline management project. D. The Commiss ion shall permit only living shoreline approaches to shoreline management unless the best available science shows that such approaches are not suitable. If the best available science shows that a living shoreline approach is not suitable, the Commission shall require the applicant to incorporate, to the maximum extent possible, elements of living shoreline approaches into permitted projects.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Inland waters.  An Indian who habitually resides on an Indian reservation or an Indian that is a member of a Virginia recognized tribe who resides in the Commonwealth is not req uired to obtain a license to fish in Virginias inland waters, or to hunt or trap in Virginia. Members of the Virginia tribes that were parties to the Treaty of 1677 with England are not required to obtain a license to fish or oyster in Virginias tidal waters provided the activity is limited to harvesting for sustenance. Virginia Indians are bound by the trapping, hunting and fishing laws and regulations of the Commonwealth regardless of whether they are on or off a reservation.

Burden of conservation may not be placed entirely on nonresidents without proper showing.  Virginia may not through its statutes place almost the entire burden of conservation on nonresidents, with no showing that they are the source of the evil.

Commerce clause does not rea ch this section.  Absent any restriction on commercial trade in crabs after they are harvested, and recognizing that residents of other states are not precluded in any way by Virgi nia from coming to Virginia as consumers of a natural resource, and also recognizing the want of any congressional preemption as to the blue crab fishery, the commerce clause (U.S. Const., Art.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 14A M.J. Oysters, § 9. CASE NOTES Substantial evidence suppo rted revocation.  Circuit court erred in finding that the Virginia Marine Resources Commissions (VMRC) decision to revoke fishers licenses and privileges was not supported by substantial evidence because there was substantial evidence to support VMRCs finding that both fishers had violated a provision within the Tidal Fisheries subtitle; evidence of the fishers convictions was presented to VMRC at the heari ng, and neither fisher disputed that they had been convicted. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n v. Insley, 64 Va. App. 569, 770 S.E.2d 209, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (2015). Circuit court erred in finding that the sanction imposed by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) was not substantially supported by the evidence becaus e the presumption of regularity was not rebutted by the evidence, and there was affirmative evidence that VMRC considered all three factors in fixing the duration of their punishment; fishers revocation period did not exceed the statutory maximum of two years. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n v. Insley, 64 Va. App. 569, 770 S.E.2d 209, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (2015). Commission did not r etroactively apply statute.  Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) did not retroactively apply the statute to a fisher because its decision to revoke his fishing license and privileges was based on a violation of the subtitle that occurred after the amendments became effective; no ex post facto concerns were implicated because the fishers license and fishing privileges were revoked pursuant to the statute based on conduct that occu rred after the amendments. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n v. Insley, 64 Va. App. 569, 770 S.E.2d 209, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (2015). Consideration of factors.  Statute does not require that Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) must affirmatively find evidence of any of the factors listed as a precondition to revok e an individuals fishing license and privileges and does not require that VMRC must affirmatively find evidence of one or any of the factors listed in fixing the duration of any revocation period. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n v. Insley, 64 Va. App. 569, 77 0 S.E.2d 209, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (2015). All that is required in fixing the duration of the revocation period is that Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) must consider evidence of those factors i n making its determination and cannot exclude any of the factors as insignificant; therefore, as long as VMRC considers the three factors listed in the statute in fixing the duration of the revocation period, VMRCs actions are not beyond its statutor y discretion.

The Commiss ion, when it makes a determination in writing that competitive bidding or competitive negotiation is not feasible or fiscally advantageous to the Commonwealth, may authorize other methods of purchasing and contracting for seed oysters, house shells, reef shells, shell bed turning, or other goods and services for oyster ground replenishment, including contracts with commercial fishermen for replenishment, research, and stock assessment activities as provided in subsection B, which are in the best interes t of the Commonwealth and which are fair and impartial to suppliers. It may establish pricing for its awards and purchases; use selection methods by lot; and open, close, and revise its purchases according to changing conditions of the natural resources, markets, and sources of supply.

It is at least a fair assumption that the Commission will, upon a showing of the required statutory conditions by the holder, grant him the right to remove the oysters he has planted. J.H. Miles &amp; Co. v. McLean Contracting Co., 180 F.2d 789, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2504 (4th Cir . 1950) (decided under prior law). It is a regulation designed to maintain the policies of the state.  On the one hand, its object is to discharge the trust created by Va. Const., Art. XI, § 3, as to natural oyster beds, rocks and shoals, so as to recover them p romptly for the public benefit if leased by mistake of the states own official. And on the other hand, its object is to encourage the planting and propagation of oysters by assuring the lessee that, if innocent, he may recover his planted oysters. Bl ake v. Marshall, 152 Va. 616, 148 S.E. 789 (1929), cited in Gloucester Seafood Workers Assn v. Houston, 35 F.2d 193, 1929 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1565 (E.D. Va. 1929); J.H. Miles &amp; Co. v. McLean Contracting Co., 180 F.2d 789, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2504 ( 4th Cir. 1950) (decided under prior law). It does not violate Va. Const., Art. XI, § 3.  This section does not discriminate, but merely restricts the use by the public of the public oyster grounds for a limited period for the purpose of removing the p roperty of the planter illegally but innocently placed there because of the mistake of the agent of the Commonwealth. This restriction is reasonable and is not contrary to Va. Const., Art. XI, § 3. Blake v. Marshall, 152 Va. 616, 148 S.E. 789, 1929 Va . LEXIS 196 (1929) (decided under prior law). Or the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.  This section, which empowers the Commission of Fisheries (now Marine Resources Commission) to exclude licensed tongers from the use of the natural oyster ground f or a limited period of time to enable a planter who, without default on his part and through the mistake of an officer of the state, has been led to place his private property on such land, is not a denial of due process or the equal protection of the la w, and is therefore not in conflict with those provisions of U.S. Const., amend.

And it gives the holder of natural oyster ground the right to remove planted oysters on certain conditions set out in the section. Thus, the ground (1) must have been assigned to him and included in the plat of assignment, (2) without his fault, and (3) by the fault of an officer of the state. Hurley v.

In any Virginia county or city where more than one-half acre of ground per waterfront tract has been assigned to a riparian owner, the ground in excess of one-half acre sha ll be ground held under a regular lease and assignment, and not a riparian assignment. For Northampton County, however, § 6 of Chapter 254 of the 1883-1884 Acts of Assembly, not this article, shall govern the quantity of land to be assigned to and held by riparian owners. Nothing in this article authorizes a rental of a lesser amount per acre than that provided by law for riparian owners in Northampton County of the land assigned them as such riparian owners. Nothing in the section which restores to riparian owners in Northampton County one-fourth of their waterfronts suitable for planting oysters, permits the owners of waterfronts to compel occupants of the fronts to remove their oysters from any fourth of the shores, if the residue of the shore is already in the landowners possession or is unoccupied. Riparian landowners may erect wharves, landings, or other structures as otherwise permitted by law. History History.

A lease under this section is made only for the purpose of planting and propagating oysters on the ground leased, and it is for this purpose alone that the planter is authorized to use and occupy such ground. While any citizen might have taken oysters therefrom before the lease, afterwards only the lessee may do so and all others are excluded from either planting or taking oysters from such ground during his term; this marks the limit of his right.

Lessee who was granted a lease under § 28.2-603 and related statutes assumed the risk that the waters surrounding the leased grounds would be insufficiently pu re to permit the direct harvest of shellfish from them. The limited rights the lessees acquired when leasing state-owned bottomlands doomed their takings claim. The city and sanitation district did not interfere with the limited property rights the lesse es had under the leases and, therefore, their takings claim failed as a matter of law. Johnson v.

Text The Commission shall, pursuant to its authority to regulate marine fisheries and commercial fishing, establish a general permit regulation authorizing the use of tempor ary protective enclosures to grow shellfish on grounds leased pursuant to § 28.2-603. In developing the general permit, the Commission shall consider those factors set forth in subsection A of § 28.2-1205. In addition to such other requirements as the Commission may prescribe for the protection of public safety, navigation, natural resources, and the environment, the general permit shall include the following provisions: 1. Lease holders shall comply with any Commission requirements pertaining to aquaculture licensing; 2. Enclosures shall be constructed of nontoxic materials; 3. Leaseholders shall not place enclosures (i) in or upon submerged aquatic vegetation, (ii) in any marked navigation channel or in any other area that would create a hazard, or (iii) in any area that would impede customary access to navigable waters from any riparian property, public or commercial landing, or marina facility; 4. The location of enclosures shall be clearly marked to alert boaters and to allow the leaseholder or other authorized persons to retrieve the enclosures if necessary. The general permit regulation shall specify acceptable means and devices for complying with this requirement; 5. Leaseholders shall maintain a list identifying those leases on which enclosures are placed during the term of the lease and provide, upon request, a current copy of the list to authori zed representatives of the Commission. Leaseholders shall also submit such list to be filed with any application for lease renewal made pursuant to § 28.2-613; 6. Leaseholders shall promptly remove any enclosure that is not actively in use for the planting and propagating of shellfish, and, upon expiration or termination of a lease or of the lea seholders aquaculture license, the leaseholder shall promptly remove all enclosures placed on the leasehold; and 7. At his discretion, the Commissioner may order the removal or relocation of any enclosure that interferes with navigation, creates a hazard, or otherwise fails to comply with the condit ions of the general permit.

D. When a muni cipal dredging project of the type described in subdivision B 5 proposes to impact grounds that are subject to beneficial use as oyster-planting ground, the following process shall apply: 1. The C ommissioner shall review any such proposed project to ensure that the project, in addition to meeting the considerations established in § 28.2-1205, avoids impacting grounds that are subject to beneficial use as oyster-planting ground to the maximum e xtent practicable. Upon determining that the project meets such standard, the Commissioner shall notify, by certified letter, the holder of any such lease within the footprint of the proposed navigation channel requesting a response within 60 days. 2. After the Commissioner sends such notice, the locality shall compensate the lessee for the use of the ground. If the lessee and the locality are able to agree on a compensation amount within 90 days from the date the Commissioners notice is sent, no additional action is necessary on the part of the locality. Otherwise, the locality shall offer in writing to enter with the lessee into mediation, as defined in § 8.01-581.21, at t he expense of the locality. If the lessee refuses such offer, or if the locality and the lessee reach no agreement within nine months of such offer, a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine and order fair compensation to the lessee. 3.

The process of transferring a lease as a result of the completion of the process established in this subsection shall not extend or otherwise affect any timeline established in this subsection.

Statute inapplicable to lakes.  This statute specifically enumerates the categories of bodies of water that are subject to its provisions and the precise words of the statute do not include  lakes within the listed categories. In accordance with the maxim which provides that the mention of a specific item in a statute implies that other omitted items were not intended to be included within the scope of the statute, this section does not apply to Smith Mountain Lake because the general assembly chose not to include lakes in its designation of bodies of water whose beds remain the property of the commonwealth in the absence of a special grant or compact. Smith Mt. Lake Yacht Club, Inc. v. Ramaker, 261 Va. 240, 542 S.E.2d 392, 2001 Va. LEXIS 35 (2001). Rights of riparian owner.  The riparian owner always had certain rights in the adjacent submerged land, such as to enjoy the natural advantage of his location; to use a right-of-way to and from the navigable water; to build a pier or wharf, subject to the regulation of the state; to have the benefit of accretions or alluvium, and to make reasonable use of the water as it flows past his land. However, the common-law rights of the owner of l and adjacent to tidal waters were never considered to include the right to remove substances from the soil under water. The common law is, however, subject to modification by statute. United States v. Smoot Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., 248 F.2d 822, 1957 U.S. Ap p. LEXIS 4787 (4th Cir. 1957) (decided under former § 62.1-1). Pursuant to governing law, the property owners rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the li ne of navigability was in the Commonwealth, to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could and did authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owners roof and second-story deck adde d to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commissions permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private piers placement for the limited purpose of accessing navi gable waters or vessels moored in those waters.

State Marine Resourc es Commissions authority.  Commission did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it approved the owners after-the-fact permit to include an upper deck bar structure on the p ier that the owner rebuilt after a hurricane. The commission did not have any decision making formula intended to dictate the outcome of a permit application and, instead, was directed to permit reasonable uses of state-owned bottomland pursuant to § 28.2-1204, and permitting the bar structure was acceptable because the pier was open to the public for the publics use and enjoyment.

Authority not limited by execu tive orders.  While Executive Orders 58 and 66 enabled individuals to reconstruct or build replacements for piers and other structures damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Isabel, nothing limited the authority of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) to grant permits to expand or enlarge upon those pre-September 18, 2003, uses. VMRC had authority to exercise jurisdiction over state-owned submerged lands, including to is sue permits for reasonable uses thereof pursuant to §§ 28.2-1204 and 28.2-1205. Harrison v. Va.

LEXIS 153 (1965) (decided under prior law). For history of this section, and related statutes, see Miller v. Commonwealth, 159 Va. 9 24, 166 S.E. 557, 1932 Va. LEXIS 231 (1932); Bradford v. Nature Conservancy, 224 Va. 181, 294 S.E.2d 866, 1982 Va. LEXIS 281 (1982) (decided under prior law). Intent.  This section is intended to give to every riparian owner the right to the water frontage belonging by nature to his land. Generally, this right includes, among ot hers, the right of access to the navigable part of the watercourse, and also the right to the soil under the water between the riparian owners land and the navigable line of the watercourse whereon he may erect wharves or piers for his own use, or th e use of the public, subject to such rules and regulations as governing authorities may deem proper to impose for the publics protection. Cordovana v. Vipond, 198 Va. 353, 94 S.E.2d 295, 1956 Va. LEXIS 214 (1956) (decided under prior law). Section only applicable where commonwealth owns bed of body of water.  This section defines the boundaries of privately owned land that is adjacent to a body of water whose bed remains the property of the commonwealth under the provi sions of § 28.2-1200; it is not relevant to a determination of property rights where the commonwealth is not the owner of the bed of the body of water. Smith Mt. Lake Yacht Club, Inc. v. Ramaker, 261 Va. 240, 542 S.E.2d 392, 2001 Va. LEXIS 35 (2001). The term low-water mark means ordinary low water, not spring tide or neap tide, but normal, natural, usual, customary or ordinary low water, uninfluenced by special seasons, winds or other circumstances. Scott v. Doughty, 124 Va. 358, 97 S.E. 802, 1919 Va. LEXIS 130 (1919) (decided under prior law). And fee simple title exten ds to low-water mark.  While at common law the title of the owner of land bounded by a tidal stream extended only to high-water mark, such owner has under this section a fee simple titl e to low-water mark. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 102 Va. 759, 47 S.E. 875, 1904 Va. LEXIS 123 (1904) (decided under prior law). It cannot be doubted that in Virginia the title of the landowner runs only to the low-water mark, and that title to the soil under tidal waters is in the state. T his is in accordance with the recognized common-law rule and is confirmed by declaratory statutes. United States v. Smoot Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., 248 F.2d 822, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4787 (4th Cir. 1957) (decided under prior law). Course of boundary at low-water mark.  The limits or boundaries of the lands being extended by the law down to low-water mark, it necessarily follows, in the absence of any direction in this section to the contrary, that they must be extended in the same direction that they reach ordinary high-water mark. To extend a limit or bound is to extend a line, and to extend a line is to carry it forward, to prolong it, and to prolong it means primarily to con tinue it in the same direction. Groner v. Foster, 94 Va. 650, 27 S.E. 493, 1897 Va. LEXIS 121 (1897); Whealton v. Doughty, 116 Va. 566, 82 S.E. 94, 1914 Va. LEXIS 62 (1914) (decided under prior law). Pursuant to governing law, the property owners rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the li ne of navigability was in the Commonwealth, to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could and did authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owners roof and second-story deck adde d to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commissions permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private piers placement for the limited purpose of accessing navi gable waters or vessels moored in those waters.

Shifting of boundary with low-wate r mark.  This section, in terms extends the rights of riparian owners of land on bays, rivers, creeks and shores of the sea to low-water mark. However this line may change either for the advantage or disadvantage of the riparian owner, due to accretion or recession, low-water mark remains his true boundary. The title of the Commonwealth to the public waters likewise shifts with the shifting sands. Steelman v. Field, 142 V a. 383, 128 S.E. 558, 1925 Va. LEXIS 344 (1925) (decided under prior law). Right to have boundaries defined.  A riparian owner is entitled, in conformity with his rights under this section, to have the extent of his enjoyment upon the line of navigability of the watercour se determined and marked, and his boundaries defined. The right is based upon the principles of equity and a court of chancery is the proper tribunal to make the apportionment and to determine the boundaries between coterminous owners. Cordovana v. Vipon d, 198 Va. 353, 94 S.E.2d 295, 1956 Va. LEXIS 214 (1956) (decided under prior law).

Where all riparian rights were reserved and severed from the land when the plat was recorded, whatever riparian rights defendants acquired were severed riparian r ights when acquired. Commonwealth v. Forbes, 214 Va. 109, 197 S.E.2d 195, 1973 Va. LEXIS 264 (1973) (decided under prior law). By grant or reservation.  Riparian rights may be separated from the ownership of the land to which they are appurtenant, either by a grant of such rights to another, or by a reservation th ereof in the conveyance of the land. Thurston v. City of Portsmouth, 205 Va. 909, 140 S.E.2d 678, 1965 Va. LEXIS 153 (1965) (decided under prior law). Which conveys property right.  There may be a conveyance of water or water rights separate and apart from the land thereunder, and such a conveyance is a conveyance of a property right. Thursto n v. City of Portsmouth, 205 Va. 909, 140 S.E.2d 678, 1965 Va. LEXIS 153 (1965) (decided under prior law).

In terstate Motels, Inc. v. Biers, 213 Va. 498, 193 S.E.2d 658, 1973 Va. LEXIS 173 (1973) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Land o wner does not own property below mean low-water mark.  In a condemnation proceeding condemning a permanent utility easement along the southern boundary of the triplex parcel owned by defendant, because the evidence co nclusively established that the gazebo and pier were located below the mean low-water mark, they were not within the boundaries of the triplex parcel as the property was held in public trust by the Commonwealth, and not within the area of any easement in defendants land; thus, the appellate court would not consider any potential loss of use of the gazebo and pier in calculating the value of the easement.

The commission did not have any decision making formula intended to dictate the outcome of a permit application and, instead, was directed to permit reasonable uses of state-owned bottomland pursuant to § 28.2-1204, and permitting the bar structure was acceptable because the pier was open to the public for the publics use and enjoyment.

In addition to other factors, the Commission shall also consider the public and private benefits of the proposed project and shall exercise its authority under this section consistent with the public trust doctrine as defined by the common law of the Commonwealth adopted pursuant to § 1-200 in order to protect and safeguard the public right to the use and enjoyment of the subaqueous lands of the Commonwealth held in trust by it for the benefit of the people as conferred by the public trust doctrine and the Constitution of Virginia. The Commiss ion shall also consider the projects effect on the following: 1. Other reasonable and permissible uses of state waters and state-owned bottomlands; 2. Marine and fisheries resources of the Commonwealth; 3. Tidal wetlands, except when this has or will be determined under the provisions of Chapter 13 of this title; 4. Adjacent or nearby properties; 5. Water quality; and 6. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). B. The Commiss ion shall consult with other state agencies, including the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, the State Water Control Board, the Virginia Department of Transportation, and the State Corporation Commission, whenever the Commissions decision on a pe rmit application relates to or affects the particular concerns or activities of those agencies. C. No permit f or a marina or boatyard for commercial use shall be granted until the owner or other applicant presents to the Commission a plan for sewage treatment or disposal facilities that has been approved by the State Department of Health. D. A permit is required and shall be issued by the Commission for placement of any private pier measuring 100 or more feet in length from the mean low-water mark, which is used for noncommercial purposes by an owner of the riparian land in the waters opposite the land , and that traverses commercially productive leased oyster or clam grounds, as defined in § 28.2-630, provided that the pier does not extend beyond the navigation line established by the Commission or the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The per mit may reasonably prescribe the design and location of the pier for the sole purpose of minimizing the adverse impact on such oyster or clam grounds or the harvesting or propagation of oysters or clams therefrom. The permit shall contain no other condit ions or requirements. Unless information or circumstances materially alter the conditions under which the permit would be issued, the Commission shall act within 90 days of receipt of a complete joint permit application to approve or deny the application . If the Commission fails to act within that time, the application shall be deemed approved and the applicant shall be notified of the deemed approval. E. All permits issued by the Commission for the use of state-owned bottomlands pursuant to § 28.2-1204, or to recover underwater historic property shall be in writing and specify the conditions and terms that the Commission determines are appropriate, and royalties unless prohibited under other provisions of this chapter. F. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Commission under this section is entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). However, any decision made by the Commission hereunder consistent wit h the public trust doctrine as defined by the common law of the Commonwealth adopted pursuant to § 1-200 shall not be deemed to have been made pursuant to the police power. No person shall reapply for the same or substantially similar use of the botto mlands within 12 months of the denial of a permit by the Commission. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to deprive a riparian landowner of such rights as he may have under common law. History History.

Standing of adjacent o r nearby property owners.  Circuit court erred in dismissing property owners appeal of a decision of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VRMC) to approve a marinas permit appl ication because the owners qualified as a person aggrieved under subsection F of § 28.2-1205 and were entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act, § 2.2-4000 et seq., when the owners produ ced sufficient evidence to establish standing; the owners asserted facts sufficient to support their claim that their right to enjoy the recreational and aesthetic advantages of their waterfront property as riparian landowners was adversely impacted by V MRCs decision to grant the marinas permit, and because subdivision A 4 of § 28.2-1205 required VMRC to consider the effect of a proposed project on adjacent or nearby properties, the owners had a direct and substantial interest in the litigati on simply by virtue of the fact that VMRC was required to consider the projects effect on their property prior to granting the permit. Biddison v. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n, 54 Va. App. 521, 680 S.E.2d 343, 2009 Va.

Riparian owners of (i) commercial facilities engaged in the business of ship construction or repair, (ii) commercial facilities providing services relating to the shipping of domestic or foreign cargo, and (iii) commercial facilities engaged in the business of selling or servicing watercraft shall be exempt from the payment of rents and royalties, except as provided in subsectio n C. C. When the ac tivity or project for which a permit is requested will involve the removal of bottom material, the application shall indicate this fact. If granted, the permit shall specify a royalty of not less than $0.40, nor more than $0.80, per cubic yard of bottom material removed. In fixing the amount of the royalty, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, the following: 1. The p rimary and secondary purposes for removing the bottom material; 2. Whether the material has any commercial value and whether it will be used for any commercial purpose; 3. The use to be made of the removed material and any public benefit or adverse effect upon the public that will result from the removal or disposal of the material; 4. The physical characteristics of the material to be removed; and 5. The expense of removing and disposing of the material. D. Where it ap pears that the project or facility for which a permit application is made has been completed or work thereon commenced at the time application is made, the Commission may impose additional assessments not to exceed an amount of three times the normal per mit fee and royalties, unless such royalties are prohibited by this chapter. E. Bottom mate rial removed attendant to maintenance dredging or directional drilling shall be exempt from any royalty. The Virginia Department of Transportation shall be exempt from all fees, rents and royalties otherwise assessable under this section.

G. Beginning J uly 1, 2020, and not more frequently than every three years thereafter, the Commission may increase or decrease fees for marine habitat applications, permits, leases, rents, and royalties that are authorized by this chapter, but such increase or decrease shall be no greater than the respective increase or decrease, expressed as a percentage, in the United States Average Consumer Price Index for all items, all urban consumers (CPI-U), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, since the date on which the fee was last set or adjusted.

The order shall specify the restoration necessary and establish a reasonable time for its completion. The order shall be issued only after a hearing with at least thirty days notice to the affected person of the hearings time, place and purpose and shall become effective immediately upon issuance by the Commission. The Commission shall require any scientific monitoring plan it believes is necessary to ensure the successful restoration of subaqueous bottoms protected by this chapter and may require that a prepaid contract acceptable to the Commission be in effect for the purpose of carrying out the scientific monitoring plan. The Commission may also require a reasonable bond or lette r of credit in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to it securing to the Commonwealth compliance with the conditions set forth in the restoration order. The appropriate court, upon petition by the Commission, may enforce any such restor ation order by injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate remedy.

The followi ng standards shall apply to the use and development of wetlands and shall be considered in the determination of whether any permit required by this chapter should be granted or denied: 1. Wetla nds of primary ecological significance shall not be altered so that the ecological systems in the wetlands are unreasonably disturbed; and 2. Development in Tidewater Virginia, to the maximum extent practical, shall be concentrated in wetlands of lesser ecological significance, in vegetated wetlands which have been irreversi bly disturbed before July 1, 1972, in nonvegetated wetlands which have been irreversibly disturbed prior to January 1, 1983, and in areas of Tidewater Virginia outside of wetlands. B. The provisi ons of guidelines and minimum standards promulgated by the Commission pursuant to § 28.2-1301 shall be considered in applying the standards listed in subsection A of this section. C. When any ac tivity authorized by a permit issued pursuant to this chapter is conditioned upon compensatory mitigation for adverse impacts to wetlands, the applicant may be permitted to satisfy all or part of such mitigation requirements by the purchase or use of cre dits from any wetlands mitigation bank, including any banks owned by the permit applicant, that has been approved and is operating in accordance with applicable federal and state guidance, laws, or regulations for the establishment, use and operation of mitigation banks as long as (i) the bank is in the same fourth order subbasin, as defined by the hydrologic unit boundaries of the National Watershed Boundary Dataset or by the hydrologic unit system or dataset utilized and depicted or described in the b anks approved mitigation banking instrument, as the impacted site, or in an adjacent subbasin within the same river watershed, as the impacted site, or it meets all the conditions found in clauses (a) through (d) and either clause (e) or (f) of this subsection; (ii) the bank is ecologically preferable to practicable on-site and off-site individual mitigation options, as defined by federal wetland regulations; and (iii) the banking instrument, if approved after July 1, 1996, has been approved by a pr ocess that included public review and comment. When the bank is not located in the same subbasin or adjacent subbasin within the same river watershed as the impacted site, the purchase or use of credits shall not be allowed unless the applicant demonstra tes to the satisfaction of the Commission that (a) the impacts will occur as a result of a Virginia Department of Transportation linear project or as the result of a locality project for a locality whose jurisdiction encompasses multiple river watersheds ; (b) there is no practical same river watershed mitigation alternative; (c) the impacts are less than one acre in a single and complete project within a subbasin; (d) there is no significant harm to water quality or fish and wildlife resources within th e river watershed of the impacted site; and either (e) impacts within the Chesapeake Bay watershed are mitigated within the Chesapeake Bay watershed as close as possible to the impacted site or (f) impacts within subbasins 02080108, 02080208, and 0301020 5, as defined by the National Watershed Boundary Dataset, are mitigated in-kind within those subbasins as close as possible to the impacted site. After July 1, 2002, the provisions of clause (f) shall apply only to impacts within subdivisions of the list ed subbasins where overlapping watersheds exist, as determined by the Department of Environmental Quality, provided the Department has made such a determination by that date. For the purposes of this subsection, the hydrologic unit boundaries of the Nati onal Watershed Boundary Dataset or other hydrologic unit system may be adjusted by the Department of Environmental Quality to reflect site-specific geographic or hydrologic information provided by the bank sponsor. D. Where an ag reed-upon permit condition requires the contribution of in-lieu fees to offset permitted wetland losses, the wetlands board shall credit the applicant for any in-lieu fee payments made to the Virginia Aquatic Resources Trust Fund or another dedicated wet lands restoration fund with reference to the same activity.For the purposes of this section, river watershed means the Potomac River Basin, Shenandoah River Basin, James River Basin, Rappahannock River Basin, Roanoke and Yadkin Rivers Basin, Chow an River Basin (including the Dismal Swamp and Albemarle Sound), Tennessee River Basin, Big Sandy River Basin, Chesapeake Bay and its Small Coastal Basins, Atlantic Ocean, York River Basin, and the New River Basin.

History History. 1980, c. 660, § 62.1-13.23; 1992, c. 836. Annotations CASE NOTES Granting of permit to develop land was consistent with requirements.  Where the Virginia Marine Resources Commission and the Virginia Beach Wetlands Board granted applications to two developers to construct three duplex residences a ffecting a coastal primary sand dune, such action was not arbitrary and capricious where they both found that the proposed construction plans with the imposed conditions met the requirements of § 28.2-1408 with respect to the landward dune, the dune d irectly impacted by the proposed construction, and addressed potentially harmful impacts by imposing conditions on the approval of the permits. City of Va. Beach v. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 244 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2003). § 28.2-1408.1. Expired. Annotations Editors note. This section, enacted by Acts 2002, c. 711, expired pursuant to the terms of Acts 2002, c. 711, cl. 2, effective January 1, 2006. § 28.2-1408.2. Exemptions. Text A. Notwithstan ding the requirements of § 28.2-1408 or any other provision of this Code, the Virginia Beach Wetlands Board shall make an ongoing determination in the Sandbridge Beach Subdivision to determine which structures or properties are in clear and imminent d anger from erosion and storm damage due to severe wave action or storm surge. The owners of such structures or properties shall not be prohibited from erecting and maintaining protective bulkheads or other equivalent structural improvements of the type, size, and configuration as approved by the Virginia Beach Wetlands Board. As used in this section, Sandbridge Beach Subdivision means the area that is bounded on the north by Dam Neck Naval Base, on the west by Sandpiper Road, and on the south by Little Island Park.The Virginia Beach Wetlands Board shall not impose arbitrary or unreasonable conditions upon its approval of any such bulkhead or other structural improvement. The Virginia Beach Wetlands Board shall maintain a continuing responsibili ty to ensure that each bulkhead or structural improvement constructed under the authority of this section is maintained in a condition that is safe, structurally sound, and otherwise in conformity with the conditions imposed by the Virginia Beach Wetland s Board.Upon submission of an application to the Virginia Beach Wetlands Board pursuant to this section, as a requirement for approval, the applicant must consent in writing to any subsequent construction approved by the Virginia Beach Wetlands Board whe reby an adjacent property owner desires to tie in a bulkhead at no additional cost with the bulkhead proposed by the applicant. Such consent shall constitute a waiver of property line defenses relating to the bulkhead line. B. 1. The Virginia Beach Wetlands Board may develop and adopt, after holding a public hear ing, a General Permit for Sand Management and Placement Profiles for properties in the Sandbridge Beach Subdivision. The Virginia Beach Wetlands Board shall publish notice of each hearing at least once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to such heari ng in a newspaper having general circulation in Virginia Beach. 2. The Norfolk Wetlands Board may develop and adopt, after holding a public hearing, a General Permit for Sand Management and Placement Profiles for properties in the City of Norfolk. The Norfolk Wetlands Board shall publish notice of each hearing at least once a week for two consecutive weeks prior to such hearing in a newspaper having general circulation in the City of Norfolk. C. Any General Permit for Sand Management and Placement Profiles adopted by a wetlands board pursuant to subsection B shall set forth sand management practices that require owners of real property in the permit area to undertake responsible, cost-effective sand manage ment practices that (i) protect and enhance the value and use of their property and (ii) preserve and protect coastal primary sand dunes and public beaches and prevent their despoliation and destruction. The General Permit for Sand Management and Placeme nt Profiles shall specify all permissible sand management practices, including the manner in which sand removed from these properties shall be transported to and placed upon an appropriate sand placement and spreading zone as may be designated in the Pla cement Profiles adopted by the wetlands board. The sand shall be in the condition of clean beach sand prior to such transport and placement. A wetlands board may from time to time revise such General Permit for Sand Management and Placement Profiles as a ppropriate, in accordance with this subsection and subsections B and D. D. Following a doption of the General Permit for Sand Management and Placement Profiles, the owner of real property in the permit area, or the designee of such owner, may apply for coverage under the applicable General Permit for Sand Management and Placement Profile b y submitting a registration statement to the local wetlands board on a form to be developed by the wetlands board requiring the following information: (i) owners name; (ii) owners address; (iii) owners telephone number and email address; (iv) address of property or properties; (v) designees name, if any; (vi) designees address; (vii) designees telephone number and email address; (viii) identification of the applicable Placement Profile for the property; (ix) signature of owner or designee; and (x) date of application. The wetlands board may impose a reasonable fee in connection with processing the registration statement.The wetlands board shall, within 30 days of receipt of a registration statement, notify the owner or his desig nee in writing whether the registration statement is approved or disapproved. The wetlands boards written notice of approval or disapproval may be delivered to the applicant via email at the email address stated in the registration statement or it ma y be delivered via United States mail at the address stated in the registration statement, or both. If the wetlands board fails to notify the applicant in writing within 30 days of receipt of a registration statement, then the registration statement is d eemed approved. If the registration statement is disapproved, the wetlands board shall provide in its notification to the applicant a complete statement of the reason for the disapproval. Notwithstanding the requirements of § 28.2-1408 or any other pr ovision of law, if the registration statement is approved, then the applicant is authorized to manage sand in accordance with the applicable General Permit for Sand Management for a period of three years from the date of the application. The approval or disapproval of a registration statement submitted by an applicant is a decision of the wetlands board that is reviewable pursuant to § 28.2-1411.

B. The Commiss ioner or board chairman may require such on-site inspections as he believes are reasonably necessary to determine whether the measures required by the permit are being properly performed, or whether the provisions of this chapter are being violated. Pri or to conducting such inspections, the Commissioner or board chairman shall provide notice to the resident owner, occupier, or operator, who shall be given an opportunity to accompany the site inspector. If it is determined that there is a failure to com ply with the permit, the Commissioner or board chairman shall serve notice upon the permittee at the address specified in his permit application or by delivery at the site of the permitted activities to the person supervising the activities and designate d in the permit to receive the notice. The notice shall describe the measures needed for compliance and the time within which these measures shall be completed. Failure of the person to comply within the specified period is a violation of this section. C. Upon receip t of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this chapter from the designated enforcement officer, the Commissioner or board chairman may, in conjunction with or subsequent to a notice to comply as specified in subsection B of this section, issue an order requiring all or part of the activities on the site to be stopped until the specified corrective measures have been taken.

Upon receip t of a sworn complaint of a substantial violation of this chapter from a designated enforcement officer, the Commission or a wetlands board may order that the affected site be restored to predevelopment conditions if the Commission or board finds that re storation is necessary to recover lost resources or to prevent further damage to resources. The order shall specify the restoration necessary and establish a reasonable time for its completion. The order shall be issued only after a hearing with at leas t thirty days notice to the affected person of the hearings time, place, and purpose, and shall become effective immediately upon issuance by the Commission or board.
