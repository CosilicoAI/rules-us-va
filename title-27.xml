Chapter 35 Limitation of Actions: Statute of Limitations; Immunities; Res Judicata and Collateral Est oppel. § 35.02 Immunities. Friend. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under former law. Statute exemption is not different from immunity by general law.  Exemption provided by the statute is not different from the immunity provided by general law; there is no legal difference between the terms exemption and immunit y; therefore, that the exemption provided owner of fire truck as an instrumentality of county was the equivalent of sovereign immunity to the extent of damages done incident to fighting fires. National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Catlett Volunteer Fi re Co., 241 Va. 402, 404 S.E.2d 216, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2232, 1991 Va. LEXIS 51 (1991). Exemption from suit is provided to fire-fighting companies and individual members.  Although this section does not in specific terms extend its exemption from suit to individual members of fire-fighting companies, if a contract exists between a f ire-fighting company and a county, this section makes the fire-fighting company an instrumentality of the contracting county and as such exempt from suit for damages done incident to fighting fires; to this extent, the company would be entitled t o the cloak of the countys sovereign immunity, and in turn, the cloak may be available to the companys members. National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Catlett Volunteer Fire Co., 241 Va. 402, 404 S.E.2d 216, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2232, 1991 Va. LEXIS 51 (1991 ). Dama ges resulting from operation of truck en route to fire.  The exemption from suit for damages done incident to fighting fires encompasses damages resulting from the operation of a fire truck en route to a fire. N ational R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Catlett Volunteer Fire Co., 241 Va. 402, 404 S.E.2d 216, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2232, 1991 Va. LEXIS 51 (1991). Implied contract existed between owner of fire truck and county.  Where there was no express contract between owner of fire truck and county, the district court correctly imposed an implied-in-fact contract between them; the dis trict judge surveyed the Virginia statutes concerning volunteer fire companies, reviewed the evidence supplied by owner of the fire truck concerning the ongoing close working relationship between owner of fire truck and county, and noted the requirement in Acts 1970, ch. 187, of which this section is a part, that the Act shall be liberally construed. National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Catlett Volunteer Fire Co., 241 Va. 402, 404 S.E.2d 216, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2232, 1991 Va. LEXIS 51 (1991). Volunteer firemans crossing railroad tracks without first stopping was a discretiona ry act to which sovereign immunity attached; therefore, volunteer fireman was entitled to invoke the defense of sovereign immunity and was liable only for gross negligence. National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Catlett Volunteer Fire Co., 241 Va. 402, 404 S.E .2d 216, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2232, 1991 Va. LEXIS 51 (1991). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Billing for emergency services.  Volunteer fire departments and rescue squads lack authority, either statutory or contractual, to bill home or automobile owners, or their insurance companies, for responding to a fire emergency. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clarence E. Bud Phillips, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 11-052, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 29 (5/13/11). § 27-6.02. Provision of firefighting services. Text A. Any county, city, or town may provide firefighting services to its citizens by (i) establishing a fire department as a department of government pursuant to § 27-6.1 or (ii) contracting with or providing for the provision of firefighting services by a fire compan y established pursuant to § 27-8. B. In cases in which a county, city, or town elects to contract with or provide for the provision of firefighting services by a fire company pursuant to clause (ii) of subsection A, the fire company shall be deemed to be an instrumentality of the county, city, or town and, as such, exempt from suit for damages done incident to fighting fires therein. The county, city, or town may elect to provide for the matters authorized in §§ 27-4 and 27-39.As used in this section, provide firefighting services inclu des travel while performing fire, rescue, or other emergency operations in emergency vehicles or fire apparatus as described in §§ 46.2-920 and 46.2-1023, respectively. History History. 2015, cc. 502, 503. Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Sovereign immunity.  Paramedic was not entitled to sovereign immunity because, in returning to an area where she would be in a position to prepare to provide emergency medical service s, she was not providing or performing emergency medical services and she was not exercising some degree of discretion beyond that required for ordinary driving situations at the moment of an accident with a hospital employee. Bosserman v. Hayes, 89 Va. Cir. 84, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 144 (Augusta County May 29, 2014). § 27-6.1. Establishment of fire department; chief, officers, and employees. Text The governing body of any county, city, or town may establish a fire department as a department of government and may designate it by any name consistent with the names of its other governmental units. The head of such fire department shall be known as the chief. As many other officers and employees may be employed in such fire department as the governing body may approve. History History. 1970, c. 187; 2001, c. 142; 2008, c. 410; 2015, cc. 502, 503. Annotations Editors note. Acts 1970, c. 187, which added or amended many of the sections in this article, provides, in cl. 3, that the act shall be liberally construed and is severable. The 2001 amendments. The 2001 amendment by c. 142 substituted fire/EMS for fire in two places. The 2008 amendments. The 2008 amendment by c. 410 inserted or the director  at the end of the second sentence. The 2015 amendments. The 2015 amendments by cc. 502 and 503 are identical and, in the first sentence, substituted any county, city, or town for any city, town or county,  and substituted may establish a fire department as a department of government and for may establish as a department of government a fire/EMS department and; deleted or the director following the chief in the secon d sentence; and substituted fire department for fire/EMS department in the last sentence. OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL County may require reimbursement of costs for emergency services.  As the provision of emergency services by a county is discretionary, requiring reimbursement from a user of such services for the reasonable costs associated with the use of emergency equipment owned and maintained by the county is appropriate. See opinion of Attorney General to Ms. Deanis L. Simmons, County Attorney for Tazewell County, 00-068 (11/29/00). § 27-6.2. Applicant preemployment information with fire departments. Text Applicants for employment with the fire department of any locality having a local ordinance adopted in accordance with § 19.2-389 may be required to submit to finger printing and to provide personal descriptive information to be forwarded along with the applicants fingerprints through the Central Criminal Records Exchange and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history record information regarding such applicant; however, such applicants shall, if required by local ordinance, pay the cost of the fingerprinting or criminal records check or both. The Central Criminal Records Exchange, upon receipt of an applicants record or notification that no record exists, shall make a report to the fire chief or his desi gnee, who must belong to a governmental entity. In determining whether a criminal conviction directly relates to a position, the locality shall consider the following criteria: (i) the nature and seriousness of the crime; (ii) the relationship of the cri me to the work to be performed in the position applied for; (iii) the extent to which the position applied for might offer an opportunity to engage in further criminal activity of the same type as that in which the person had been involved; (iv) the rela tionship of the crime to the ability, capacity or fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the position being sought; (v) the extent and nature of the persons past criminal activity; (vi) the age of the person at t he time of the commission of the crime; (vii) the amount of time that has elapsed since the persons last involvement in the commission of a crime; (viii) the conduct and work activity of the person prior to and following the criminal activity; and (i x) evidence of the persons rehabilitation or rehabilitative effort while incarcerated or following release. If an applicant is denied employment because of information appearing in his criminal history record, the locality shall provide a copy of the information obtained from the Central Criminal Records Exchange to the applicant. The information shall not be disseminated except as provided for in this section. History History. 2001, cc. 353, 373; 2003, c. 739; 2018, c. 834.

In the event of the creation of such zones or districts in any city or county, the city or county governing body may acquire, in the name of the city or county, real or personal property to be devoted to the uses aforesaid, and shall prescribe rules and regulations for the proper management, control, and conduct thereof. Such governing body shall also have authority to contract with, or secure the services of, any indi vidual corporation, organization, or municipal corporation, or any volunteer firefighters for such fire protection as may be required. To raise funds for the purposes aforesaid, the governing body of any city or county in which such zones or districts are established may levy annually a tax on the asse ssed value of all property real and personal within such zones or districts, subject to local taxation, which tax shall be extended and collected as other city or county taxes are extended and collected.

CASE NOTES No immunity if report made in bad fait h.  Insurer was incorrect that the Arson Reporting Immunity Act (ARIA), § 27-85.5, immunized it from liability without exception as the insured was alleging that t he insurers interaction with fire officials was without merit and in bad faith. In essence, the complaint was alleging that the insurer knew it did not have reason to report that the insured committed arson when it did so to arson investigators, in o rder to avoid its obligations under the insurance by having the insured criminally prosecuted  such conduct supported a claim of actual malice  the insureds allegations taken as true and in the light most favorable to him, stated a claim.

The Fire Prevention Code shall prescribe regulations to be complied with for the protection of life and property from the hazards of fire or explosion and for the handling, stora ge, sale and use of fireworks, explosives or blasting agents, and shall provide for the administration and enforcement of such regulations. The Fire Prevention Code shall require manufacturers of fireworks or explosives, as defined in the Code, to regist er and report information concerning their manufacturing facilities and methods of operation within the Commonwealth in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board. In addition to conducting criminal background checks pursuant to § 27-97.2, the B oard shall also establish regulations for obtaining permits for the manufacturing, storage, handling, use, or sales of fireworks or explosives. In the enforcement of such regulations, the enforcing agency may issue annual permits for such activities to a ny state regulated public utility. Such permits shall not apply to the storage, handling, or use of explosives or blasting agents pursuant to the provisions of Title 45.2. The Fire Prevention Code shall prohibit any person, firm, or corporation from transporting, manufacturing, storing, selling, offering for sale, exposing for sale, or bu ying, using, igniting, or exploding any fireworks except for those persons, firms, or corporations that manufacture, store, market and distribute fireworks for the sole purpose of fireworks displays permitted by an enforcement agency or by any locality. The Fire Prevention Code shall supersede fire prevention regulations heretofore adopted by local governments or other political subdivisions. Local governments are here by empowered to adopt fire prevention regulations that are more restrictive or more extensive in scope than the Fire Prevention Code provided such regulations do not affect the manner of construction, or materials to be used in the erection, alteration, repair, or use of a building or structure, including the voluntary installation of smoke alarms and regulation and inspections thereof in commercial buildings where such smoke alarms are not required under the provisions of the Code. The Fire Prevention Code shall prohibit any person not certified by the State Fire Marshals Office as a fireworks operator or pyrotechnician to design, set up, or conduct or supervise the design, setup, or conducting of any fireworks display, either inside a building or structure or outdoors and shall require that at least one person holding a valid certification is present at the site where the fireworks display is being conducted. Certification shall not be required for the design, storage, sale, use, conduct, transp ortation, and set up of permissible fireworks or the supervision thereof or in connection with any fireworks display conducted by a volunteer fire department provided one member of the volunteer fire department holds a valid certification. In formulating the Fire Prevention Code, the Board shall have due regard for generally accepted standards as recommended by nationally recognized organizations includin g, but not limited to, standards of the International Code Council, the National Fire Protection Association, and recognized organizations issuing standards for the protection of the public from the hazards of explosives and blasting agents. Such standar ds shall be based on the companion document to the model building code referenced by the Uniform Statewide Building Code. The Fire Prevention Code shall require that buildings constructed prior to 1973 be maintained in accordance with state fire and public building regulations in effect pr ior to March 31, 1986, and that any building which is (i) more than 75 feet or more than six stories high and (ii) used, in whole or in part, as a dormitory to house students by any public or private institution of higher education shall be required to c omply with the provisions of § 36-99.3. The Fire Prevention Code shall also require annual fire drills in all buildings having floors used for human occupancy located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access. The dril ls shall be conducted by building staff personnel or the owner of the building in accordance with a plan approved by the appropriate fire official and shall not affect other current occupants. The Board may modify, amend or repeal any Code provisions as the public interest requires. Any such Code changes shall be developed in cooperation with the Fire Services Board pursuant to procedures agreed to by the two Boards.

Such proposals shall have the goal of assisting in the provision of safety and security measures for the Commonwealths p ublic buildings for active shooter or hostile threats while maintaining compliance with basic accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq.). The review of the stakeholders shall include the examinatio n of (i) door locking devices, (ii) barricade devices, and (iii) other safety measures on doors and windows for the purpose of preventing both ingress and egress in the event of a threat to the physical security of persons in such buildings. Effective October 1, 2021, Title 45.2 was substituted for Title 45.1 to conform to the recodification of Title 45.1 by Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 387, at the direction of the Virginia Code Commission. The 2000 amendments.

Acts 2007, c. 741, additionally substituted 75 for seventy-five in the first and second sentences in the last paragraph. The 2010 amendments. The 2010 amendments by cc. 587 and 643 are identical, and added the last two sentences of the third paragraph. CASE NOTES Illegal storage of fireworks.  Under former § 59.1-142, proof of illegal storage of fireworks could not support a verdict in which the jury found defendant guilty of storing and offering for sale illegal fireworks. Burnette v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 455, 125 S.E.2d 171, 1962 Va. LEXIS 167 (1962). Sale of illegal fireworks.  Under former § 59.1-142, proof that illegal fireworks were stored in defendants place of business in boxes marked with the names of other merchandise was n ot proof beyond a reasonable doubt that they were displayed for sale where there was nothing to indicate to a prospective customer that the boxes contained illegal fireworks which were being offered for sale. Burnette v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 455, 125 S. E.2d 171, 1962 Va. LEXIS 167 (1962). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Locality may not selectively enforce open burning regulations on geographic basis.  A locality that chooses to enforce the Fire Prevention Code may not selectively enforce open burning regulations on a geographic basis. See opinion of Attorney Ge neral to The Honorable Emily Couric, Member, Senate of Virginia, 00-091 (11/18/00). Storage of spa rklers, fountains, and similar items.  The storage of items such as sparklers, fountains, and similar types of displays on private property is not prohibited by the Statewide Fire Prevention Code Act o r the Fire Prevention Code, unless a locality adopts more restrictive provisions, as authorized by §§ 27-97 and former 59.1-148. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Paul Clinton Harris Sr., Member, House of Delegates, 01-014 (2/16/01). Explosive materials.  Tannerite, like many other substances, is an explosive material within the meaning of § 182-85, but its use or possession is not illegal so long as the use or possession is for a lawful purpose such as the recreational use for which it is intended. Whether any particular use or possession of Tannerite is for an illegal purpose would be a question of fact. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Willi am W. Davenport, Commonwealths Attorney, Chesterfield County, No. 14-044, (10/1/14).

If a local governing body elects to enforce only those provisions of the Fire Prevention Code relating to open burning, it may do so in all or in any designated geographic areas of its jurisdiction. The St ate Fire Marshal shall also have the authority, in cooperation with any local governing body, to enforce the Code. The State Fire Marshal shall also have authority to enforce the Code in those jurisdictions in which the local governments do not enforce t he Code and may establish such procedures or requirements as may be necessary for the administration and enforcement of the Code in such jurisdictions. In addition, subject to the approval of the Board of Housing and Community Development, the State Fire Marshal may charge a fee to recover the actual cost of administering and enforcing the Code in jurisdictions for which he serves as the enforcement authority. No fee may be charged for the inspection of any school. The local governing body of any jurisd iction that enforces the Code may establish such procedures or requirements as may be necessary for the administration and enforcement of the Code. Appeals concerning the application of the Code by the local enforcing agency shall first lie to a local bo ard of appeals and then to the State Building Code Technical Review Board. Appeals from the application of the Code by the State Fire Marshal shall be made directly to the State Building Code Technical Review Board as provided in Article 2 (§ 36-108 e t seq.) of Chapter 6 of Title 36. Fees may be levied by the local governing body in order to defray the cost of such enforcement and appeals; however, for the City of Chesapeake no fee charged for the inspection of any place of religious worship designat ed as Assembly Group A-3 under the Fire Prevention Code shall exceed $50. For purposes of this section, defray the cost may include the fair and reasonable costs incurred for such enforcement during normal business hours, but shall not include ov ertime costs, unless conducted outside of the normal working hours established by the locality. A schedule of such costs shall be adopted by the local governing body in a local ordinance. A locality shall not charge an overtime rate for inspections condu cted during the normal business hours established by the locality. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a private entity from conducting such inspections, provided the private entity has been approved to perform such inspections in accordance wi th the written policy of the fire official for the locality. Any local fire code may provide for an appeal to a local board of appeals. If no local board of appeals exists, the State Building Code Technical Review Board shall hear appeals of any local fi re code violation.

History History. 1988, c. 549. § 27-98.2. Issuance of warrant. Text Search warrants for inspections or reinspection of buildings, structures, property, or premises subject to inspections pursuant to the Code, to determine compliance wit h regulations or standards set forth in the Code, shall be based upon a demonstration of probable cause and supported by affidavit. Such inspection warrants may be issued by any judge or magistrate having authority to issue criminal warrants whose territ orial jurisdiction encompasses the building, structure, property or premises to be inspected or entered, if he is satisfied from the affidavit that there is probable cause for the issuance of an inspection warrant. No inspection warrant shall be issued p ursuant to this chapter except upon probable cause, supported by affidavit, particularly describing the place, thing or property to be inspected, examined or tested and the purpose for which the inspection, examination, testing or collection of samples f or testing is to be made. Probable cause shall be deemed to exist if such inspection, examination, testing or collection of samples for testing are necessary to ensure compliance with the Fire Prevention Code for the protection of life and property from the hazards of fire or explosion. The supporting affidavit shall contain either a statement that consent to inspect, examine, test or collect samples for testing has been sought and refused or facts or circumstances reasonably justifying the failure to s eek such consent in order to enforce effectively the fire safety laws, regulations or standards of the Commonwealth which authorize such inspection, examination, testing or collection of samples for testing. In the case of an inspection warrant based upo n legislative or administrative standards for selecting buildings, structures, property or premises for inspections, the affidavit shall contain factual allegations sufficient to justify an independent determination by the judge or magistrate that the in spection program is based on reasonable standards and that the standards are being applied to a particular place in a neutral and fair manner. The issuing judge or magistrate may examine the affiant under oath or affirmation to verify the accuracy of any matter in the affidavit. After issuing the warrant, the judge or magistrate shall file the affidavit in the manner prescribed by § 19.2-54. History History. 1988, c. 549; 2014, c. 354. Annotations The 2014 amendments.
