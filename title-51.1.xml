In addition to the service credit that may be purchased under subdivision 1, any member in service may purchase up to four years of service credit for prior active duty military s ervice in the armed forces of the United States, provided that the discharge from a period of active duty status with the armed forces was not dishonorable. 3. The service credit to be credited to a member under this subsection shall be calculated at the ratio of one year, or portion thereof, of service credit to one year, or portion the reof, of service purchased, except for employment service purchased under clause (viii) of subdivision 1, which shall be calculated at the ratio of one month of service credit for each 173 hours of service as certified by the employer.For each year or po rtion thereof to be credited at the time of purchase under this subsection, the member shall pay the approximate normal cost of the retirement plan under which the member is covered at the time of such purchase, as determined by the Board in its sole dis cretion. If the member does not purchase, or enter into a purchase of service credit contract for, the service made available in this subsection within the first 24 months of the members active service following his first date of hire or the final da y of any applicable leave of absence, as applicable, then, for each year or portion thereof to be credited at the time of purchase, the member shall pay the actuarial equivalent cost. To the extent the member becomes inactive during the 24 months followi ng his first date of hire or the final day of any applicable leave of absence, such periods shall not be included in the 24 months of active service.Except as otherwise required by Chapter 1223 of Title 10 of the United States Code, as amended, no servic e credit may be purchased under this section if it is included in the calculation of any retirement allowance received or to be received by the member from this or another retirement system, or if there is a balance in a defined contribution account that serves as a primary retirement account related to such service.For purposes of this subsection, active duty military service means full-time service of at least 180 consecutive days in the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guar d, or reserve components thereof. B. Any member in service may purchase all prior service credit for creditable service lost from ceasing to be a member under this chapter, as provided in § 51.1-128, because of the wit hdrawal of his accumulated contributions. For each year or portion thereof to be credited at the time of purchase under this subsection, the member shall pay the withdrawn amount to be purchased plus interest accrued daily and compounded annually from th e date of withdrawal to the date of payment at the assumed rate of return established by the Board for the actuarial valuation of the retirement system that is in effect at the time of the purchase. The Board shall develop guidelines and procedures for a dministering this subsection. C. Any member in service may purchase service credit for accumulated sick leave on his effective date of retirement based upon such sums as the employer may provide as payment for any unu sed sick leave balances. The cost of service credit purchased under this subsection shall be the actuarial equivalent cost of such service. D.

Annotations Editors note. Acts 1980, c. 722, which amended this section, in cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall not apply to any member of the retirement system on March thirty-one, nineteen hundred eighty, or to any member whose be nefit is based on service rendered prior to that date, except that the provision setting forth that salary received by members of the General Assembly pursuant to §§ 14.1-17.1 and 14.1-18 [see now §§ 30-19.11 and 30-19.12] shall be deemed cre ditable compensation and shall apply to all such members on the effective date of this act [July 1, 1980]. Thus this section as in effect prior to the 1980 act remains in effect, but applies only to persons who were members of the retirement system on March 31, 1980, o r whose benefit is based on service rendered prior to that date.

Such increase in total creditable compensation shall be equal to the difference between five percent of an employees total creditable compensation and the percentage of the membe r contribution paid by the local member on January 1, 2012. If a county, city, town, local public school board, or other local employer elects to phase in the member contributions pursuant to subdivision F 3 or F 4 of § 51.1-144 of the Code of Virgini a, the increase in total creditable compensation may also be phased in at the same rate. Acts 2020, c. 1289, as amended by Acts 2021, Sp.

The contribution rates for each employer shall be determined after each valuation and shall remain in effect until a new valuation is made. All contribution ra tes shall be computed in accordance with recognized actuarial principles on the basis of methods and assumptions approved by the Board. B. The normal employer contribution for any period shall be determined as a percentage, equal to the normal contribution rate, of the total covered compensation of the members employed during the period. C. The normal contribution rate for any employer shall be determined as the percentage represented by the ratio of (i) the annual normal cost to provide the benefits of the retirement system with respect to members employed by the employer in excess of the members contributions to (ii) the total annual compensation of the members. D. The accrued liability contribution for any employer for any period shall be determined as a percentage, equal to the accrued liability contribution rate, of the total compensation of the members during the period. E. The accrued liability contribution rate for any employer shall be a percentage of the total annual compensation of the members, determined so that a continuation of annual contributions by the employer at the same percentage of total annual compensation over a peri od of 40 years will be sufficient to amortize the unfunded accrued liability with respect to the employer.

G. The supplem entary contribution for any employer for any period shall be determined as a percentage, equal to the supplementary contribution rate, of the total compensation of the members employed during the period. H. Until July 1, 1997, the supplementary contribution rate for any employer shall be determined as the percentage represented by the ratio of (i) the average annual amount of post-retirement supplements, as provided for in this chapter, which is anticipated to become payable during the period to which the rate will be applicable with respect to former members to (ii) the total annual compensation of the members. I. The Board s hall certify to each employer the applicable contribution rate and any changes in the rate. J. The employe r contribution for the year shall be increased to the extent necessary to overcome any insufficiency if the contributions for any employer, when combined with the amount of the retirement allowance account of the employer, are insufficient to provide the benefits payable during the year. K. The appropr iation bill which is submitted to the General Assembly by the Governor prior to each regular session that begins in an even-numbered year shall include the contributions which will become due and payable to the retirement allowance account from the state treasury during the following biennium.

L. In the case of all teachers whose compensation is paid exclusively out of funds derived from local revenues and appropriations from the general fund of the state treasury, the Commonwealth shall contribute to the extent specified in the appropriations ac t. In the case of any teacher whose compensation is paid out of funds derived in whole or in part from any special fund or from a contributor other than the Commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof, contributions shall be paid out of the special f und or by the other contributor in proportion to that part of the compensation derived therefrom. In the case of all state employees whose compensation is paid exclusively by the Commonwealth out of the general fund of the state treasury, the Commonwealt h shall be the sole contributor, and all contributions shall be paid out of the general fund. In the case of a state employee whose compensation is paid in whole or in part out of any special fund or by any contributor other than the Commonwealth, contri butions on behalf of the employee shall be paid out of the special fund or by the other contributor in proportion to that part of the employees compensation derived therefrom. The governing body of each political subdivision is hereby authorized to m ake appropriations from the funds of the political subdivision necessary to pay its proportionate share of contributions on behalf of every state employee whose compensation is paid in part by the political subdivision. In the case of each person who has elected to remain a member of a local retirement system, the Commonwealth shall reimburse the local employer an amount equal to the product of the compensation of the person and the employer contribution rate as used to determine the employer contributi on for state employees under this section. Each employer shall keep such records and periodically furnish such information as the Board may require and shall inform new employees of their duties and obligations in connection with the retirement system. M. The employe r contribution rate established for each employer may include the cost to administer any defined contribution plan administered by the Virginia Retirement System and available to the employer. The portion of such contribution designated to cover administ rative costs of the defined contribution plans shall not be deposited into the trust fund established for the defined benefit plans but shall be separately accounted for and used solely to defray the administrative costs associated with the various defin ed contributions plans.

Retirement allowance.  A member shall receive an annual retirement allowance, payable for life, as follows: 1. Norma l retirement.  The allowance shall equal 1.70 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the amount of his creditable service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a member who (i) is a person who becomes a member on or after July 1, 2010, or (ii) does not have at least 60 months of creditable service as of January 1, 2013, the allowance shall equal the sum of (a) 1.65 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the amount of his creditable service performed or purchased on or after January 1, 2013, and (b) 1.70 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the amount of all other creditable service. 2. Early retirement; applicable to teachers, state employees, and certain others.  The allowance shall be determined in the same manner as for normal retirement with creditable servic e and average final compensation being determined as of the date of actual retirement. If the member has less than 30 years of service at retirement, the amount of the retirement allowance shall be reduced on an actuarial equivalent basis for the period by which the actual retirement date precedes the earlier of (i) his normal retirement date or (ii) the first date on which he would have completed a total of 30 years of creditable service.

If the credita ble service of the member equals 30 or more years but the sum of his age at retirement plus his creditable service at retirement is less than 90, the amount of the retirement allowance shall be reduced on an actuarial equivalent basis for the period by w hich the actual retirement date precedes the earlier of (i) his normal retirement date or (ii) the first date on which the sum of his then attained age plus his then creditable service would have been equal to 90 or more had he remained in service until such date. If the member has less than 30 years of creditable service, the retirement allowance shall be reduced for the period by which the actual retirement date precedes the earlier of (i) his normal retirement date or (ii) the first date on which he would have completed a total of at least 30 years of creditable service and his then creditable service plus his then attained age would have been equal to 90 or more.The provisions of this subdivision shall apply to the employees of any political subdiv ision that participates in the retirement system and any other employees as provided by law.

D. The effecti ve date of retirement shall be after the members last day of service but shall not be more than ninety days prior to the filing of the notice of retirement. The Board may waive the ninety-day requirement upon a showing of good cause. E. After a med ical examination of the member or after reviewing pertinent medical records, the Medical Board shall certify that (i) the member is and has been continuously since the effective date of retirement if prior to filing of the notification, mentally or physi cally incapacitated for the further performance of duty, (ii) the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and (iii) the member should be retired. A member shall not be retired for disability for any condition which existed at the time of becoming a member unless medical evidence, convincing to the Board, supports the fact that the pre-existing condition has worsened substantially. F. In the even t the member is physically or mentally unable to submit written notification of his intention to retire, the members appointing authority may submit notification on his behalf. G. Any member who has been on leave of absence without pay for a period exceeding twenty-four months shall not be entitled to retire under the provisions of this section. This subsection shall not apply to any member who is disabled while on leave without pay while pe rforming active duty military service in the armed forces of the United States. H. For good ca use shown, the Board may waive the ninety-day notification periods set forth in subsections A and B. For purposes of this section, good cause shall exist and the Board shall waive such ninety-day notification periods if (i) the member would otherwise qua lify for disability retirement but for failing to comply with the requirements of subsection A or B and (ii) the Medical Board, acting solely in its own discretion after reviewing objective medical evidence of the disability and its cause, certifies that : (a) the disability and its cause existed on the date the members employment was terminated, (b) the member had no knowledge of the existence of the disability and its cause at any time within ninety days after the date the members employment wa s terminated, and (c) the member could not, with reasonable inquiry, have ascertained the existence of the disability and its cause within ninety days after the date the members employment was terminated.

CASE NOTES Final case decision.  An award of benefits by the Director of the Retirement System, which overrules the Medical Boards recommendation, is a final case decision. Avery v. Virginia Retirement Sys., 31 Va. App. 1, 520 S.E.2d 831, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 617 (1999), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 33 Va. App. 210, 532 S.E.2d 348, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 589 (2000). Error for failing to explain reason for denial of benefits was not harmless error.  Virginia Retirement System (VRS) committed a procedural error of law for failing to adequately comply with the explanatory requirements of clause (v) of subsectio n A of § 2.2-4019; that is, by failing to provide in writing the factual or procedural basis for an adverse decision. That failure required remand, pursuant to § 2.2-4027, because the error was not merely harmless error; the applicant could not hav e known which of three potential rationales for denial in subsection E of § 51.1-156 the VRS based its decision on when denying her benefits.

Relationship with social s ecurity benefits.  Fact that the claimant was awarded disability retirement through state retirement services, which was governed by Virginia law was not binding on the administrati ve law judge; the claimants inability to perform his past relevant work as an outreach counselor did not mean that he was disabled for the purposes of receiving disability benefits under the Social Security Act; if a plaintiff was found to be unable to perform past relevant work, the judge then considered whether the plaintiff could perform other work consistent with his residual functional capacity and vocational profile. In other words, an inability to perform past relevant work did not automatica lly translate to a finding of disabled under the Act and it was clear that the claimant was able to perform other, less stressful work. Koisch v. Astrue, 650 F. Supp. 2d 475, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73902 (E.D. Va. 2009). Evidence supported determination that claimants disability was not likely to be permanent where she suffered from some combination of fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and neuropathy, but none but one of the treating and/or examining physicians opined that her condition was likely to be permanent. F ifer v. Virginia Retirement Sys., 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 454 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 25, 1998). Substantial ev idence supported denial of benefits.  Denial of disability retirement benefits was supported by substantial evidence where: (1) the Medical Board examined the employees medical reports and records and testimony three separate times and recommended denial because the employee did not show he was physically or mentally incapacitated for further duty performance; (2) the Virginia Retirement System upheld the independent fact finders finding, mad e after the independent fact finder considered the Boards recommendations, the medical records and the employees testimony, that the employee did not meet the requirements under this section; and (3) the employees medical evidence did not com pel a different finding. Hedleston v. Va. Retirement Sys., 62 Va. App. 592, 751 S.E.2d 1, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 358 (2013). Circuit court erred in reversing the determination of the Virginia Retirement System (VRS), which denied a city employee disability retirement benefits, because t here was substantial evidence to support the decision; the VRS Medical Board concluded that the employees medical records and other evidence did not establish that he was permanently disabled, and the Medical Boards reports in its final case deci sion provided substantial evidence for VRSs ultimate determination. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Blair, 64 Va. App. 756, 772 S.E.2d 26, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 177 (2015). Although a claimant alleged disability due to Ramsay Hunt syndrome, the claimant was not entitled to disability retirement benefits because substantial evidence s upported the administrative finding that the claimant was not incapacitated for the further performance of the claimants duties as the claimant was able to return to work and obtain a new job while experiencing symptoms of the medical condition and n one of the treating physicians opined that the claimant was unable to work due to the condition prior to the claimants termination. Rhoades v. Va. Ret. Sys., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 350 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2018).

Allowance p ayable on retirement.  Upon retirement for disability, a member who has five or more years of creditable service shall receive an annual retirement allowance during his lifetime and continued disability equal to 1.70 percent of his average final comp ensation multiplied by the smaller of (i) twice the amount of his creditable service or (ii) the amount of creditable service he would have completed at age 60 if he had remained in service to that age. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for a member who (a) is a person who becomes a member on or after July 1, 2010, or (b) does not have at least 60 months of creditable service as of January 1, 2013, the allowance shall equal 1.65 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the smaller of (1) twi ce the amount of his creditable service or (2) the amount of creditable service he would have completed at age 60 if he had remained in service to that age. If a member has already attained age 60, the amount of creditable service at his date of retireme nt shall be used.For retirements between October 1, 1994, and December 31, 1998, any employee or local officer who is a member or beneficiary of a retirement system administered by the Board shall receive an additional retirement allowance equal to three percent of the disability retirement allowance payable under this section; provided that, for purposes of this additional retirement allowance, the term employee shall include only those employees of political subdivisions that have adopted a resolution providing for such an allowance under subsection B of § 51.1-130. Average final compensation attributable to service as Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, or member of the General Assembly shall not be included in computing this additio nal retirement allowance. B. Workers compensation guarantee.  If a member retires for disability from a cause which is compensable under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act (§ 65.2-100 et seq.), the amount of the annual retirement allowance shall equal 66 and two-thirds percen t of the members average final compensation if the member does not qualify for social security disability benefits under the provisions of the Social Security Act in effect on the date of his retirement. If the member qualifies for social security di sability benefits or has attained his normal retirement age under the provisions of the Social Security Act in effect on the date of his retirement, the allowance payable from the retirement system shall equal 50 percent of his average final compensation . A member shall be entitled to the larger of the retirement allowance as determined under the provisions of subsection A or under the provisions of this subsection. C. Reduction o f allowance.  Any allowance payable to a member who retires for disability from a cause compensable under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act shall be reduced by the amount of any payments under the provisions of the Act in effect on the date o f retirement of the member and the excess of the allowance shall be paid to the member. When the time for compensation payments under the Act has elapsed, the member shall receive the full amount of the allowance payable during his lifetime and continued disability. If the members payments under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act are adjusted or terminated for refusal to work or to comply with the requirements of § 65.2-603, his allowance shall be computed as if he were receiving the compe nsation to which he would otherwise be entitled. D. Special ret irement allowance guarantee.  Any member retired from a cause which is not compensable under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act shall be guaranteed an annual retirement allowance during his lifetime and continued disability which equals 50 per cent of the members average final compensation if the member does not qualify for social security disability benefits under the provisions of the Social Security Act in effect on the date of his retirement. If the member qualifies for social security disability benefits or has attained his normal retirement age under the provisions of the Social Security Act in effect on the date of retirement, the allowance payable from the retirement system shall equal 33 and one-third percent of his average final compensation. E. Determinati on of retirement allowance.  For the purposes of this section, the retirement allowance shall be determined on the assumption that the retirement allowance is payable to the member alone and that no optional retirement allowance is elected.

Acts 1980, c. 722, which amended this section, in cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall not apply to any member of the retirement system on March thirty-one, nineteen hundred eighty, or to any member whose be nefit is based on service rendered prior to that date, except that the provision setting forth that salary received by members of the General Assembly pursuant to §§ 14.1-17.1 and 14.1-18 [see now §§ 30-19.11 and 30-19.12] shall be deemed cre ditable compensation and shall apply to all such members on the effective date of this act [July 1, 1980]. Thus this section as in effect prior to the 1980 act remains in effect, but applies only to persons who were members of the retirement system on March 31, 1980, o r whose benefit is based on service rendered prior to that date. Acts 1994, 1st Sp. Sess., c. 5, cl. 3 provides: That the state share of the cost of the additional retirement allowances payable under this act through amendm ents to §§ 51.1-155, 51.1-157, 51.1-206, 51.1-306, and 51.1-308 shall be included initially in the 1996-98 budget bill submitted by the Governor. Acts 1994, 1st Sp.

The 2012 amendments by cc. 701 and 823 are nearly identical, and added the present second sentence of the first paragraph of subsection A, and made minor stylisti c changes throughout. Acts 2012, c. 823 added a clause (a) in subsection A and c. 701 made additional stylistic changes. The 2021 Sp. Sess. I amendments. The 2021 amendments by Sp. Sess. I, cc. 53 and 54, effective July 1, 2021, are identical, and in subsections B and D, substituted social security disability b enefits for primary social security benefits twice and inserted or has attained his normal retirement age. CASE NOTES Purpose of reduction in re tirement benefits.  The purpose of the provision stating that any allowance payable to a member who retires from a cause compensable under the worker compensation act shall be re duced by the amount of any payments under the act is to prevent double-dipping, or receiving payment from two state agencies for the same loss. Morris v. Virginia Retirement Sys., 28 Va. App. 799, 508 S.E.2d 799 (1999). No reduc tion for award of permanent loss of use benefits.  As applied to a member who receives an award of workers compensation benefit for the loss of use of some part of his or her body, this section is ambiguous an d is to be construed so as to permit a reduction in retirement benefits for wage loss or death benefits paid to or on behalf of the member but not for permanent loss of use benefits. Morris v. Virginia Retirement Sys., 28 Va. App. 799, 508 S.E.2d 799 (19 99).

The 2012 amendment by c. 696 substituted Chapter 1 (§ 51.1-124.1 et seq.), 2 (§ 51.1-200 et seq.), 2.1 (§ 51.1-211 et seq.), or 3 (§ 51.1-300 et s eq.) for this chapter in subdivision A 1; and in subsection C, in the first sentence, substituted § 51.1-126, 51.1-126.3, 51.1-126.5, or 51.1-126.6 for §§ 51.1-126, 51.1-126.5, or 51.1-126.6 and the balance of his accumulated contributions, as determined under subsection A for his accumulated contributions, as reduced by the amount of any retirement allowance previously received by him under any of the provisions of Chapters 1 (§ 51.1-124.1 et seq.), 2 (§ 51.1-200 et seq.), 2.1 (§ 51.1-211 et seq.), or 3 (§ 51.1-300 et seq.) of this title or the abolished system and added the exception at the end of the last sentence. CASE NOTES Immunity from process ceases when employee entitled to remove funds.  Once the employee is entitled to remove the funds from the system, by reason of his ceasing to be an employee, the refund may no longer be immune from process. Un der former section, once a member ceases to be an employee, otherwise than by death or retirement he is entitled to a refund of his contributions. However, the funds are no longer immune from creditors when they are withdrawn in such a manner. Vi rginia v. Haley, 41 Bankr. 44, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 5928 (Bankr. W.D.

If a member dies before retirement, and if no benefits are payable under subsection B, the amount of his accumulated contributions shall be paid to the designated beneficiary or to a surviving relative according to the order of precedence set forth in this section. This amount shall be reduced by the amount of any retirement allowance previously received by the member under this chapter or the abolished system. Each member shall designate who is to receive a refund of accumulated contributions credited to his acco unt in the event of the death of the member prior to retirement. The designation must be made in a manner prescribed by the Board.If no designation has been made, or the death of the designated person occurs prior to the death of the member and another d esignation has not been made, the proceeds shall be paid to the persons surviving at the death of the member in the following order of precedence:First, to the spouse of the member;Second, if no surviving spouse, to the children of the member and descend ants of deceased children, per stirpes;Third, if none of the above, to the parents of the member;Fourth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the member;Fifth, if none of the above, to other next of kin o f the member entitled under the laws of the domicile of the member at the time of his death. B. To the exte nt required by § 401(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended or renumbered, and the regulations thereunder applicable to governmental plans, if a member dies in service, including a member performing active duty military service in the armed f orces of the United States, and if no benefits are payable under subsection C of this section, a retirement allowance shall be paid to the person or persons designated as provided in subsection A of this section if the person is the members (i) survi ving spouse, (ii) minor child, or (iii) parent(s). If no designation has been made, or if the death of the designated person occurs prior to the death of the member and another designation has not been made, a retirement allowance shall be paid in the fo llowing order of precedence to the members (a) surviving spouse, (b) minor children, or (c) parent(s). The retirement allowance shall be paid to the first person qualifying in the orders of precedence set out in this subsection. If more than one mino r child survives the deceased member, the allowance shall be divided among them in a manner determined by the Board. If more than one parent survives the deceased member, the allowance shall be divided among them in a manner determined by the Board. The retirement allowance shall be continued during the lifetime of the person or in the case of a minor child until the child dies or attains the age of majority, whichever occurs first. The retirement allowance shall equal the decreased retirement allowance that would have been payable under the joint and survivor option so that the same amount would be continued to such person after the members death. If the member dies prior to his fifty-fifth birthday, then, for purposes of this subsection, the memb er shall be presumed to be age 55 on his date of death. However, if the member dies in service prior to his sixtieth birthday and is (1) a person who becomes a member on or after July 1, 2010, (2) a member who does not have at least 60 months of creditab le service as of January 1, 2013, or (3) a member of the hybrid retirement program described in § 51.1-169, then, for purposes of this subsection, the member shall be presumed to be age 60 on his date of death. When determining the allowance that woul d have been payable to the member had the member retired on the date of his death, the provisions of subdivision A 4 of § 51.1-155 shall not apply. If the person elects in writing, the amount of the members accumulated contributions or lump sum pa yment shall be paid to him exclusively, in lieu of any other benefits under this section. This amount shall be reduced by the amount of any retirement allowance previously received by the member under this chapter. C. If a member dies in service from a cause compensable under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act (§ 65.2-100 et seq.), a retirement allowance shall be paid to the members surviving spouse. If no compensation is finally awarded under the Virginia Workers  Compensation Act due to legal proceedings or otherwise resulting in settlement from the persons causing such death, the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission shall determine whether the members death was from a cause compensable under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act. If the member leaves no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse dies, any minor children of the deceased member shall be paid an allowance until the children die or attain the age of majority, whichever occurs fir st. If more than one minor child survives the deceased member, the allowance shall be divided in a manner determined by the Board. If the deceased member leaves neither surviving spouse nor minor child, the allowance, divided in a manner determined by th e Board, shall be paid to the members parents during their lives.The retirement allowance payable hereunder to a qualifying survivor shall be the annual amount which when added to the compensation payable under the Virginia Workers Compensation A ct for the death of the member equals 50 percent of the members average final compensation if the survivor does not qualify for death benefits under the provisions of the Social Security Act in effect on the date of the death of the member. If the su rvivor qualifies for death benefits under the provisions of the Social Security Act in effect on the date of the death of the member, the allowance payable from the retirement system when added to the compensation payable under the Virginia Workers C ompensation Act shall equal thirty-three and one-third percent of the members average final compensation.Any beneficiary entitled to the entire amount of a retirement allowance under the provisions of this subsection as a result of the death of a mem ber shall be entitled to waive his rights to the allowance by written notification to the Board within ninety days after the death of the member in order to make available a retirement allowance under the provisions of subsection B of this section.

Any member not taking 50/10 retirement as provided in § 51.1-153 or 51.1-216, in accordance with the retirement plan covering such member, may elect to have his retirement allowance payable under one of the options set forth in this subsection and receive the ac tuarial equivalent of the retirement allowance otherwise payable to him. The election of an optional benefit shall be subject to the approval of the Board. 1. Strai ght life option.  A member may elect to receive an increased retirement allowance in lieu of any death benefits. 2. Joint and last-survivor option.  A member may elect to receive a decreased retirement allowance during his lifetime in order that a fraction of such retirement allowance be continu ed to a contingent annuitant at the death of the member. The amount to be received by the contingent annuitant, in accordance with such election by the member, shall not exceed 100 percent of the amount to be received by the member during his lifetime no r shall it be less than 10 percent of such amount. In case of such an election, death benefits that might otherwise be provided shall not be payable upon the death of the member unless death of the member occurs prior to the effective date of retirement as set forth in subsection C of this section. This option may be elected if the contingent annuitant is the spouse of the member. If the contingent annuitant is not the spouse of the member, this option may be elected only if the actuarial present value of the payments expected to be made to the member is greater than one-half of the actuarial present value of the total payments expected to be made to the member and contingent annuitant. 3. Level income option.  If a member retires from service prior to his retirement age, as such term is defined under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 416 et seq., as now or her eafter amended), he may elect to receive an increased retirement allowance beginning on the members effective date of retirement and continuing until the member reaches age 62 or any whole age up to his normal retirement age, as such term is defined under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 416 et seq., as now or hereafter amended) and a decreased retirement allowance thereafter, thereby providing a more nearly level retirement allowance when such decreased retirement allowance is added to his a nticipated primary benefits under the federal Social Security Act. In determining the amount of such retirement allowance under this option before the electing retiree reaches his retirement age, as such term is defined under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 416 et seq., as now or hereafter amended), the Board may use an estimate of the members anticipated social security benefit for computing the amount of such retirement allowance. Any member electing to receive such an allowance shall not be entitled to a joint and last survivor benefit. The amount of the increased retirement allowance shall be determined actuarially, but the election of this option shall not result in more than a 50 percent reduction in the members benefit as provide d in § 51.1-155, 51.1-206, 51.1-217, or 51.1-306. B. Any member taking 50/10 retirement as provided in § 51.1-153 or 51.1-216, in accordance with the retirement plan covering such member, may elect to have his retirement allowance payable under the option set forth in this subsection and receive the actuarial equi valent of the retirement allowance otherwise payable to him. The election of this optional benefit shall be subject to the approval of the Board.50/10 retirement joint and last-survivor option.  A member may elect to receive a decreased retirement al lowance during his lifetime and have the retirement allowance continued after his death to a contingent annuitant during the lifetime of such person. The retirement allowance pursuant to this option shall be determined as provided in subdivision A 5 of § 51.1-155 or subsection A of § 51.1-217, in accordance with the retirement plan covering such member, except (i) the present value of future retirement benefits shall be calculated based on the life expectancies of both the member and the continge nt annuitant and (ii) the actuarially computed present value of the payments expected to be made under this option shall be actuarially equivalent to the actuarially computed present value of the payments expected to be made to the member as determined p ursuant to subdivision A 5 of § 51.1-155 or subsection A of § 51.1-217, in accordance with the retirement plan covering such member. C. 1. The election of any one of the options stated in this section shall be null and void if the member dies prior to the Board receiving written notification of the members effective date of retirement. The election of a joint and last-survivor option shall be null and void if the contingent annuitant dies before the members retirem ent. Except as provided in subdivision 2 of this subsection, in all cases where the death of the member occurs prior to the effective date of retirement but after the Board has received written notification of the members effective date of retirement , benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of § 51.1-163 and the requirement that the member be in service shall not apply. For purposes of this subdivision, retirement shall be deemed to commence on the effective date of a members service retirement or disability. 2. If (i) the death of the member occurs prior to the effective date of retirement but after the Board has received written notification of the members effective date of retirement; ( ii) the member died while in service; (iii) at the time of the members death the election for payment of the members retirement allowance was a joint and last-survivor optional retirement benefit; and (iv) the member named his spouse, minor child , or parent as the contingent annuitant under the joint and last-survivor optional benefit, then benefits shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of § 51.1-163. However, if such contingent annuitant or annuitants are the same person or persons who would receive a monthly benefit under subsection B of § 51.1-162 and the monthly benefit under such subsection would be greater than the benefit provided in accordance with the provisions of § 51.1-163, then retirement benefits shall be paid i n accordance with the provisions of subsection B of § 51.1-162.For purposes of this subdivision, retirement shall be deemed to commence on the effective date of a members service retirement or disability. D. A member wh o has elected any of the options stated in this section may revoke such an election by written notification to the Board any time prior to the later of the effective date of retirement or the date of written notification to the Board of retirement of the member. E. A retired m ember who has elected a joint and last-survivor option may, in a manner prescribed by the Board, revoke such election and elect to receive from time of notification either the retirement allowance to which he would have been entitled had no option been e lected initially or an allowance actuarially equivalent thereto under a joint and last-survivor option with a different contingent annuitant, if (i) the original contingent annuitant has died, (ii) a final decree of divorce of the retired member from the original contingent annuitant has been entered, or (iii) the written consent of the original contingent annuitant, together with evidence satisfactory to the Board of the good health of the original contingent annuitant, is submitted with the notificati on. If the provisions of this subsection are invoked by a retired member on the basis of the members having been divorced from his contingent annuitant and the marriage had been of a duration of 20 years or more, the provisions of this subsection sha ll not be applicable until the death or remarriage of the former spouse unless such spouse consents in writing to the revocation of the option prior to death or remarriage.If such an election is made as a result of the death or divorce of the contingent annuitant, the benefit payable to the retired member may be adjusted retroactively for a period of not more than 60 days from the date the Board first receives notification of the desire of the retired member to make such a change. F. Subject to the provisions of subsection E of this section, any member who retires on or after July 1, 1986, and returns to covered employment shall not be entitled to select a different optional benefit upon making application for retirement a second or subsequent time.

In addition to the allowances payable under this title, post-retirement supplements shall be payable to the recipients of such allowances.

The percentages shall be determined annually by reference to the increase in the United States Average Consumer Price Index for all items, all u rban consumers (CPI-U), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor. The percentages shall be based on monthly averages and shall be the difference between (i) the average for the calendar year just ended and ( ii) the average for the most recent calendar year used in the determination of the post-retirement supplements currently being paid. The annual increase, if any, in the CPI-U shall be considered only to the extent of the first two percent plus one-half o f the next two percent of any additional increase, or a maximum increase in the post-retirement supplement of three percent in any given year. However, for anyone who (a) is not a person who becomes a member on or after July 1, 2010, and (b) has at least 60 months of creditable service as of January 1, 2013, the applicable annual increase, if any, in the CPI-U shall be considered only to the extent of the first three percent plus one-half of the next four percent of any additional increase, or a maximum increase in the post-retirement supplement of five percent in any given year. If the difference in the percentages determined above is zero or less, the post-retirement supplements shall either not commence or shall continue unchanged until such time as an annual determination results in a difference in the percentages that are greater than zero. A participant in the hybrid retirement program described in § 51.1-169 shall be considered to be a person who becomes a member on or after July 1, 2010, fo r the purposes of this section.Contribution rates for all employers shall include an amount equal to 100 percent of the total annual amount necessary to fund all post-retirement supplements. All contribution rates shall be computed in accordance with rec ognized actuarial principles on the basis of methods and assumptions approved by the Board. C. There shall be no change in the amount of any post-retirement supplement between determination dates except as necessary to reflect changes in the amount of the allowance being supplemented. The post-retirement supplement shall remain a constant percentage of the r espective allowance being supplemented. No new post-retirement supplement shall be commenced except as of a determination date. The post-retirement supplement determined as of any determination dates shall become effective at the beginning of the fiscal year and shall be in lieu of any post-retirement supplements previously payable, which shall thereupon be terminated. D. 1. Any recipient of an allowance which initially commenced on or prior to January 1, 19 90, shall be entitled to post-retirement supplements effective July 1, 1991. 2.

If a member dies before retirement, and if no benefits are payable under subsection B, the amount of his accumulated contributions shall be paid to the designated beneficiary or to a surviving relative according to the same order of precedence as set forth in subse ction A of § 51.1-162. This amount shall be reduced by the amount of any retirement allowance previously received by the member under this chapter or the abolished system. Each member shall designate who is to receive a refund of accumulated contribut ions credited to his account in the event of the death of the member prior to retirement. The designation must be made on a form prepared by the Board, signed by the member, and filed with the Board. The designation may be changed by the member by the wr itten designation of some other person, signed and filed with the Board.If no designation has been made, or the death of the designated person occurs prior to the death of the member and another designation has not been made, the proceeds shall be paid t o the persons surviving at the death of the member in the same order of precedence as set forth in subsection A of § 51.1-162. B. To the exte nt required by § 401(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended or renumbered, and the regulations thereunder applicable to governmental plans, if a member dies in service, including a member performing active duty military service in the armed f orces of the United States, and if no benefits are payable under subsection C, a retirement allowance shall be paid to the person designated as provided in subsection A of this section if the person is the members (i) surviving spouse, (ii) minor chi ld, or (iii) parent(s). If no designation has been made, or if the death of the designated person occurs prior to the death of the member and another designation has not been made, a retirement allowance shall be paid in the same order of precedence as s et forth in subsection B of § 51.1-162. The retirement allowance shall be continued during the lifetime of the person or in the case of a minor child until the child dies or attains the age of majority, whichever occurs first. The retirement allowance shall equal the decreased retirement allowance that would have been payable under the joint and survivor option so that the same amount would be continued to such person after the members death. If the member dies prior to his fiftieth birthday, the n, for purposes of this subsection, the member shall be presumed to be age 50 on his date of death. When determining the allowance that would have been payable to the member had the member retired on the date of his death, the provisions of subsection B of § 51.1-217 shall not apply. If the person elects in writing, the amount of the members accumulated contributions shall be paid to the person exclusively, in lieu of any other benefits under this section. This amount shall be reduced by the amou nt of any retirement allowance previously received by the member. C. If a member dies in service from a cause compensable under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act (§ 65.2-100 et seq.), a retirement allowance shall be paid to the members surviving spouse. If no compensation is finally awarded under the Virginia Workers  Compensation Act due to legal proceedings or otherwise resulting in settlement from the persons causing such death, the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission shall determine whether the members death was from a cause compensable under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act. If the member leaves no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse dies, any minor children of the deceased member shall be paid an allowance until the children die or attain the age of majority, whichever occurs fir st. If more than one minor child survives the deceased member, the allowance shall be divided in a manner determined by the Board. If the deceased member leaves neither surviving spouse nor minor child, the allowance shall be paid to the members pare nts, divided in a manner determined by the Board, during the lives of the parents.The retirement allowance, payable hereunder to a qualifying survivor, shall be the annual amount which, when added to the compensation payable under the Virginia Workers  Compensation Act for the death of the member, shall equal 50 percent of the members average final compensation if the survivor does not qualify for death benefits under the provisions of the Social Security Act in effect on the date of the death of the member. If the survivor qualifies for death benefits under the provisions of the Social Security Act in effect on the date of the death of the member, the allowance payable from the Retirement System when added to the compensation payable under t he Virginia Workers Compensation Act shall equal thirty-three and one-third percent of the members average final compensation.Any beneficiary entitled to the entire amount of a retirement allowance under the provisions of this subsection as a res ult of the death of a member shall be entitled to waive his rights to the allowance by written notification to the Board within 90 days after the death of the member in order to make available a retirement allowance under the provisions of subsection B.

CASE NOTES The federal district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a suit to enjoin the removal of a general district court judge and his wife from the rolls of the Virginia Retirement System following his removal from office since such a suit would require a review of the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court removing the judge from offic e and a relitigation of federal questions decided in the state court.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Many of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 51-179. Challenge to constitutionality of retirement system properly dismissed.  Suit brought by four former Virginia judges for a declaration that certain provisions of the Commonwealths judicial retirement system covering them were uncon stitutional, both under the equal protection clause of Amendment Fourteen of the Federal Constitution and under the Virginia Constitution, held properly dismissed. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985). Section related to goal of making retired judges available for recall.  The decision to deny retirement benefits to retired judges who appear in Virginia courts and eschew all recall service is fairly and substantially related to the permissible goal of maintaining a pool of retired judges who are willing to serve if recalled. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984). Statutes distinction between retired judges who appear in court and those who do not appear bears a fair and substantial relation to the purpose of avoiding an appearance of impropriety or partiality. Statute was clearly designed, at least in part, to avoid an appearance of impropriety. The fact that a retired judge, between stint s on the bench, publicly represents a private party raises questions about his impartiality. This appearance of partisanship is diminished where the retired judge works anonymously and behind the scenes for his clients. An appearance in court makes publi c the potentially conflicting roles occupied by a retired judge who acts interchangeably as an interested advocate and a disinterested jurist. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984). Distinction between judicial and nonjudicial retirees reasonable.  It is an eminently reasonable distinction to allow nonjudicial retirees to litigate in courts of the Commonwealth without having to forego their pensions, while r etired judges who insist on litigating must do without. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985). It is entirely reasonable to provide sanctions to discourage retired judges from acting as litigators, whether or not they serve on a recall basis. Thompson v. Walker, 758 F.2d 1004, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 30568 (4th Cir. 1985). Statutes distinction between judges and other retired government attorneys bears a f air and substantial relation to the permissible governmental purpose of avoiding the appearance of impropriety for two reasons. First, unlike retired judges, other retired government attorneys are not subject to recall. Second, the roles of a judge and o f other types of government attorneys are obviously different. A government attorney other than a judge is an advocate. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984). Allowing only judges under 70 to defer retirement does not violate equal protection.  The legislatures decision to force retired judges to choose between receiving retirement benefits and making appearances in court is fairly and substantially related to permissible goals. That judges under age 70 are allowed to postpone this choice by deferring retirement is purely a matter of legislative grace. Because judges over 70 are not a suspect class and there is no fundamental right to deferred retir ement, the distinction satisfies equal protection since it has a rational basis. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984). Retired judge who both receives retirement benefits and appears in Virginia courts viola tes this section and Canon 8(C) of the Canons of Judicial Conduct [see now Canon 8(B)], which incorporates and interprets § 51-178 [now this section]. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984). Authority to discipline violator.  Because violations of former section bear a substantial relationship to an attorneys fitness to practice law, the Virginia State Bar has authority to discipli ne a violator. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984). Both the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission and the Virginia State Bar have authority to punish violations of this section. Violations of former section refle ct on the violators fitness to decide cases as a judge. The Commission has exclusive authority to determine how a violators fitness as a judge is affected and to sanction the violator in his capacity as a judge. But, in addition to its relevance to fitness to sit as judge, a violation of former section undoubtedly bears on the violators fitness to practice law. Thompson v. Walker, 583 F. Supp. 175, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19234 (E.D. Va. 1984). Inquiries of Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission and Virginia State Bar into alleged violations potentially overlap. Both entities must first determine whether a violation has in fact occurred. To avoid the potential for conflicting determination on whether a violation has in fact occurred, the State Bar might justifiably refer this issu e to the Commission.

CASE NOTES Child support.  Because subsection A of § 51.1-510 clearly exempted a decedents Virginia Retirement System group life insurance policy and any resulting proceeds from levy , garnishment, and other legal process, the trial court correctly declined to impose a constructive trust on the life insurance proceeds in favor of the children under the child support exception in subsection A of § 51.1-124.4.Crawford v.

Interpretation with augmente d estate laws.  Trial court properly held that a widow had no claim on benefits from a decedents retirement and life insurance, which named his sister and niece as beneficiar ies, as state laws which exempted such benefits from legal process, including §§ 51.1-124.4, 51.1-510, and 38.2-3339, existed as an exception to the augmented estate laws.

Every count y and city, and every town having a population of 5,000 or more, shall provide a retirement system for those officers and employees listed in subsection B either (i) by establishing and maintaining a local retirement system which provides a service retir ement allowance to each employee who retires at age sixty-five or older which equals or exceeds two-thirds of the service retirement allowance to which the employee would have been entitled had the allowance been computed under the provisions of the Virg inia Retirement System or (ii) by participating directly in the Virginia Retirement System. B. The followi ng persons shall be covered by a retirement system as provided in subsection A: 1. Offic ers and employees who are regularly employed full time on a salaried basis, whose tenure is not restricted to temporary or provisional employment. 2. Officers and employees who are regularly employed full time on a salaried basis, whose tenure is not restricted to temporary or provisional employment by an organization other than a p ublic school board that functions solely within the boundaries of a county, city, or town, unless the cost of the organizations operation is borne by (i) users of services, (ii) more than one county, city, or town, or (iii) an entity other than a cou nty, city, or town. 3. Clerks of the circuit court and deputies or employees of such officers. C. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit a county, city, or town from participating in the Virginia Retirement System and establishing a local retirement system. If a locality participates in the Virginia Retirement System and establishes a local reti rement system, pursuant to § 51.1-801, providing supplemental benefits to the state system, the local system shall not be required to satisfy the criterion established in clause A (i) of this section. D. A county, c ity, or town shall not be required to provide retirement benefits to an employee who enters into an agreement with the local government for inclusion in a deferred compensation plan when the agreement specifically prohibits inclusion in any other retirem ent system established by the county, city, or town.

CASE NOTES Definition of dependent.  Although this section and subsection A of § 15.2-1517 specifically authorize a local government to provide self-funded health benefit programs for its employee s and their dependents, neither statute defines the term dependent or refers to other statutory provisions that define the term for different purposes; the power of the local government to determine who is an employees dependent is, therefore , fairly and necessarily implied. Arlington County v. White, 259 Va. 708, 528 S.E.2d 706, 2000 Va. LEXIS 71 (2000). Domestic partners.  Although a countys power to determine who was an employees dependent for purposes of the countys self-funded benefit program was fairly and ne cessarily implied in the statute authorizing the establishment of such a program, the countys inclusion of domestic partners of employees was not a reasonable implementation of the countys authority and was an ultra vires act; it was clear that t he general assembly in leaving the definition of dependent to the local governing bodies which adopt self-funded health insurance benefit plans did not contemplate adoption of a definition that does not require some aspect of financial dependence rather than mere financial interdependence.

In addition to offsets equal to the amount of any benefits paid to a participating employee under the Act, supplemental disability benefit payments shall be offset by an amount equal to any sums payable to a participating employee from the following sources: 1. Durin g the first 12 months the employee receives disability benefits, an amount equal to the employees wages and salary from any employment multiplied by the income replacement percentage payable; 2. After the first 12 months the employee receives disability benefits, an amount equal to 70 percent of the employees wages and salary from any employment; 3. Disability payments from the Social Security Administration, local government disability benefits, federal civil service disability benefits, or other similar governmental disability p rogram benefits received by the employee or his family as a result of the qualifying disability; 4. Benefits received from any other group insurance contract provided to the participating employee by his employer for the purpose of income replacement; 5. Benefits paid under any compulsory benefits law; and 6. If the participating employee receives a settlement in lieu of periodic payments for a disability compensable under the Act, an amount determined by dividing the workers compensati on benefit, which such employee would have received had the lump-sum settlement not been consummated, into the settlement actually accepted by the employee.Notwithstanding the foregoing, supplemental disability benefit payments shall not be offset by mil itary disability benefits payable to a participating employee. B. If the plan administrator deems a participating employee to be eligible for benefits from any of the sources listed in subdivisions A 3, A 4, and A 5, the plan administrator may direct the participating employee to apply for those benefits and to pursue whatever ad ditional steps are necessary to obtain the benefits. If a participating employee fails or refuses to pursue the available benefits as directed by the plan administrator, supplemental disability benefit payments may be reduced by amounts from any of the s ources listed in subdivisions A 3, A 4, and A 5 for which a participating employee is deemed eligible by the plan administrator as if the employee received such amounts. However, if the employee has applied for such benefits, and has reapplied and appeal ed denials of the claim as requested by the administrator of the plan, and the claim is not approved, the employees supplemental disability payments shall not be reduced thereby. C. If a partic ipating employees disability benefit payments are reduced as the result of payments from sources listed in subdivisions A 3, A 4, and A 5 or pursuant to subsection B, the employees disability benefits shall not thereafter be further reduced on ac count of cost-of-living increases in payments from such sources. D. Participati ng employees shall be required to repay, with interest, to the Board or the employer any overpayments of supplemental disability benefits on account of the failure of the employee to provide the Board or its designee with information necessary to make an y of the reductions required to be made under this article. E. Any payment to a participating employee that is later determined by the Board or by the employer to have been procured on the basis of any false statement or falsification of any record knowingly made by or on behalf of the employee, or the employees failure to make any required report of change in disability status, may be recovered from the employee by the Board, with interest, either by way of a credit against future payments due the employee or by an action at law against the employee. F. If a partic ipating employees payments under the Act are adjusted or terminated for refusal to work or to comply with the requirements of § 65.2-603, his disability benefits shall be computed as if he were receiving the compensation to which he would otherwis e be entitled under the Act.
