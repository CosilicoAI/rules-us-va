The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Former general board of directors for state hospitals for the insane was a public corporation. Western State Hosp. v. General Bd. of State Hosps. for Insane, 112 Va. 230, 70 S.E. 505, 1911 Va. LEXIS 75 (1911). A state hospital for the insane is a public corporation governed and controlled by the S tate. Although, under its charter, it may sue and be sued, regard must be had to the objects for which it was established in order to determine its liability. Maia's Adm'r v. Eastern State Hosp., 97 Va. 507, 34 S.E. 617, 1899 Va. LEXIS 65 (1899) (holding that the Eastern State Hospital is such a corporation). When a hospital accepts a trust it stands on the same footing as any other trustee. The legislature may prohibit it from accepting the trust, but, when once accepted, the trust subject must be applied to the purpose to which it has been dedicated by the grantor. General Bd. of State Hosps. for Insane v. Robertson, 115 Va. 527, 79 S.E. 1064, 1913 Va. LEXIS 66 (1913). And private property donated by a testator to a well-defined valid trust cannot be diverted by the legislature to a distinctly different object. Hence, where land was devised to the Western State Hospital in trust for the benefit of its inmates, Acts 1906, p. 36, establishing an epileptic colony on such land, was invalid as being an unlawfu l diversion of trust funds. General Bd. of State Hosps. for Insane v. Robertson, 115 Va. 527, 79 S.E. 1064, 1913 Va. LEXIS 66 (1913). § 37.2-203.1. Licensed provider; statement to prospective employer. Text The Board of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services shall amend regulations governing licensed providers to require that every licensed provider provide a stateme nt regarding a current or past employee or other individual currently or previously associated with the provider in a capacity that requires a criminal history background check pursuant to § 37.2-416 or 37.2-506 to any other licensed provider with whi ch the current or past employee has applied for employment or to fill a role that requires a criminal history background check pursuant to § 37.2-416 or 37.2-506. The statement shall address the character, ability, and fitness for employment in or to otherwise fill the role for which the person has applied and shall be provided upon receipt of a request for such information from the other licensed provider and written consent to the disclosure of such information executed by the current or past emplo yee or other individual currently or previously associated with the provider in a capacity that requires a criminal history background check pursuant to § 37.2-416 or 37.2-506. Nothing in the amended regulations shall require disclosure of information subject to privilege or confidentiality pursuant to § 8.01-581.16, 8.01-581.17, or 32.1-127.1:03 or federal law.

CASE NOTES Exhaustion of state remedies before bringing action in federal court.  In a habeas corpus action, mentally retarded citizens of State Training Center are required to exhaust state remedies before bringing action in federal court for declaratory and injunctive relief requiring center to provide mentally retarded citizens with residential placements and social, educational and rehabilitative programs in their communities. Davis v. Buckley, 526 F. Supp. 985, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15891 (E.D. Va. 1981) (decided under prior law). Mentally retarded citizens of State Training Center are not required first to exhaust remedies before human rights committee at their institution before bringing action for declaratory and injunctive relief requiring center to provide them with residential placements and social, educational and rehabilitative programs in their communities. Davis v. Buckley, 526 F. Supp. 985, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15891 (E.D. Va. 1981) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Negligence per se.  Hospitals demurrer was overruled because a personal representatives allegations that his decedent was sexually abused by a hospital employee fell outside the scope of the Virginia Medical Malpractice Act where the alleged acts and omissions involved decisions related to the operation of the hospital, rather than to the care of any particular patient, the personal representatives claim under the Virgin ia Consumer Protection Act was alleged with adequate particularity, and the decedent was considered a member of the class of people for whose benefit the negligence per se statute was enacted, and suffered an injury of the type arguably against which the statute was designed to protect against.

B. Whenever th e Commissioner revokes, suspends, or denies a license, the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) shall apply. Any person aggrieved by the final decision of the Commissioner to refuse to issue a license or by his revocation or suspension of a license is entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act. C. If a licens e is revoked or refused as herein provided, a new application for license may be considered by the Commissioner when the conditions upon which the action was based have been corrected and satisfactory evidence of this fact has been furnished. In no event may an applicant reapply for a license after the Commissioner has refused or revoked a license until a period of six months from the effective date of that action has elapsed, unless the Commissioner in his sole discretion believes that there has been s uch a change in the conditions causing refusal of the prior application or revocation of the license as to justify considering the new application. When an appeal is taken by the applicant pursuant to this section, the six-month period shall be extended until a final decision has been rendered on appeal. A new license may then be granted after proper inspection has been made and all provisions of this article and applicable regulations made thereunder have been complied with and recommendations to that effect have been made to the Commissioner upon the basis of an inspection by any authorized inspector or agent of the Department. D. Suspension of a license shall in all cases be for an indefinite time and the suspension may be lifted and rights under the license fully or partially restored at such time as the Commissioner determines, based on an inspection, that the rights of the licensee appea r to so require and the interests of the public will not be jeopardized by resumption of operation.

F. The summary order of suspension shall take effect upon its issuance and shall be served on the licensee or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the licensee. The order shall state the time, date, and location of a hearing to determine whether the suspension is appropriate. Such hearing shall be held no later than three business days after the issuance of the summary order of suspension and shall be convened by t he Commissioner or his designee.After such hearing, the Commissioner may issue a final order of summary suspension or may find that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented. A final order of summary suspension sha ll include notice that the licensee may appeal the Commissioners decision to the appropriate circuit court no later than 10 days following issuance of the order. The sole issue before the court shall be whether the Commissioner had reasonable grounds to require the licensee to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. The concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary suspension.The willful and material failure to comply with the summary order of suspension or final order of summary suspension shall be punishable as a Class 2 misdemeanor.

Pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection B and in addition to the authority for other disciplinary actions provided in this chapter, the Commissioner may issue a summary order of suspension of the license of any group home or residential facility for adul ts, in conjunction with any proceeding for revocation, denial, or other action, when conditions or practices exist in the home or facility that pose an immediate and substantial threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the adults who are residents an d the Commissioner believes the operation of the home or facility should be suspended during the pendency of such proceeding. B. The summary order of suspension shall take effect upon its issuance and shall be served on the licensee or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service and certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the licensee. The order shall state the time, date, and location of a hearing to determine whether the suspension is appropriate. Such hearing shall be held no later than three business days after the issuance of the summary order of suspension and shall be convened by t he Commissioner or his designee.After such hearing, the Commissioner may issue a final order of summary suspension or may find that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented.

The sole issue before the court shall be whether the Commissioner had reasonable grounds to require the licensee to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. The concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary suspension.The willful and material failure to comply with the summary order of suspension or final order of summary suspension shall be punishable as a Class 2 misdemeanor. The Commissioner may require the cooperation of any other agency or subdivision of the Commonwealth in the relocation of adults who are residents of a home or facility whose license has been summarily suspended pursuant to this section and in any other actions necessary to reduce the risk of further harm to such resid ents.

Be re sponsible for coordinating the community services necessary to accomplish effective preadmission screening and discharge planning for persons referred to the community services board. When preadmission screening reports are required by the court on an em ergency basis pursuant to Article 5 (§ 37.2-814 et seq.) of Chapter 8, the community services board shall ensure the development of the report for the court. To accomplish this coordination, the community services board shall establish a structure and procedures involving staff from the community services board and, as appropriate, representatives from (i) the state hospital or training center serving the boards service area, (ii) the local department of social services, (iii) the health departme nt, (iv) the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services office in the boards service area, (v) the local school division, and (vi) other public and private human services agencies, including licensed hospitals. 2.

Upon initiation of discharge planning, the community services board that serves the city or county where the individual resided prior to admission shall inform the individual that he may choose to return to the county or city in which he resided prior to admission or to any other county or city in the Com monwealth. If the individual is unable to make informed decisions regarding his care, the community services board shall so inform his authorized representative, who may choose the county or city in which the individual shall reside upon discharge. In ei ther case and to the extent permitted by federal law, for individuals who choose to return to the county or city in which they resided prior to admission, the community services board shall make every reasonable effort to place the individuals in such co unty or city. The community services board serving the county or city in which he will reside following discharge shall be responsible for arranging transportation for the individual upon request following the discharge protocols developed by the Departm ent.The discharge plan shall be completed prior to the individuals discharge.

If the state hospital or training center disagrees with the community services board and the board refuses to de velop a discharge plan to accept the individual back into the community, the state hospital or training center or the community services board shall ask the Commissioner to review the state hospitals or training centers determination that the ind ividual is ready for discharge in accordance with procedures established by the Department in collaboration with state hospitals, training centers, and community services boards. If the Commissioner determines that the individual is ready for discharge, a discharge plan shall be developed by the Department to ensure the availability of adequate services for the individual and the protection of the community. The Commissioner also shall verify that sufficient state-controlled funds have been allocated to the community services board through the performance contract. If sufficient state-controlled funds have been allocated, the Commissioner may contract with a private provider, another community services board, or a behavioral health authority to deliver the services specified in the discharge plan and withhold allocated funds applicable to that individuals discharge plan from the community services board in accordance with subsections C and E of § 37.2-508. 4.

Whenever a person alleged to have intellectual disability is not capable of requesting admission to a training center pursuant to § 37.2-805, a parent or guardian of the person or another responsible person may initiate a proceeding to certify the persons el igibility for admission pursuant to this section. B. Prior to in itiating the proceeding, the parent or guardian or other responsible person seeking the persons admission shall first obtain (i) a preadmission screening report that recommends admission to a training center from the community services board or behav ioral health authority that serves the city or county where the person who is alleged to have intellectual disability resides and (ii) the approval of the training center to which it is proposed that the person be admitted. The Board shall adopt regulati ons establishing the procedure and standards for the issuance of such approval. These regulations may include provision for the observation and evaluation of the person in a training center for a period not to exceed 48 hours. No person alleged to have i ntellectual disability who is the subject of a proceeding under this section shall be detained on that account pending the hearing except for observation and evaluation pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. C. Upon the fi ling of a petition in any city or county alleging that the person has intellectual disability, is in need of training or habilitation, and has been approved for admission pursuant to subsection B, a proceeding to certify the persons eligibility for a dmission to the training center may be commenced. The petition shall be filed with any district court or special justice. A copy of the petition shall be personally served on the person named in the petition, his attorney, and his guardian or conservator . Prior to any hearing under this section, the judge or special justice shall appoint an attorney to represent the person. However, the person shall not be precluded from employing counsel of his choosing and at his expense. D. The person who is the subject of the hearing shall be allowed sufficient opportunity to prepare his defense, obtain independent evaluations and expert opinion at his own expense, and summons other witnesses. He shall be present at any hearing held under this sectio n, unless his attorney waives his right to be present and the judge or special justice is satisfied by a clear showing and after personal observation that the persons attendance would subject him to substantial risk of physical or emotional injury or would be so disruptive as to prevent the hearing from taking place. E. Notwithstan ding the above, the judge or special justice shall summons either a physician or a clinical psychologist who is licensed in Virginia and is qualified in the assessment of persons with intellectual disability or a person designated by the local community services board or behavioral health authority who meets the qualifications established by the Board. The physician, clinical psychologist, or community services board or behavioral health authority designee may be the one who assessed the person pursuant to subsection B. The judge or special justice also shall summons other witnesses when so requested by the person or his attorney. The physician, clinical psychologist, or community services board or behavioral health authority designee shall certify tha t he has personally assessed the person and has probable cause to believe that the person (i) does or does not have intellectual disability, (ii) is or is not eligible for a less restrictive service, and (iii) is or is not in need of training or habilita tion in a training center. The judge or special justice may accept written certification of a finding of a physician, clinical psychologist, or community services board or behavioral health authority designee, provided such assessment has been personally made within the preceding 30 days and there is no objection to the acceptance of the written certification by the person or his attorney. F. If the judg e or special justice, having observed the person and having obtained the necessary positive certification and other relevant evidence, specifically finds that (i) the person is not capable of requesting his own admission, (ii) the training center has app roved the proposed admission pursuant to subsection B, (iii) there is no less restrictive alternative to training center admission, consistent with the best interests of the person who is the subject of the proceeding, and (iv) the person has intellectua l disability and is in need of training or habilitation in a training center, the judge or special justice shall by written order certify that the person is eligible for admission to a training center. G. Certificati on of eligibility for admission hereunder shall not be construed as a judicial commitment for involuntary admission of the person but shall authorize the parent or guardian or other responsible person to admit the person to a training center and shall au thorize the training center to accept the person.

Any magistr ate shall issue, upon the sworn petition of any responsible person, treating physician, or upon his own motion, or a court may issue pursuant to § 19.2-271.6, an emergency custody order when he has probable cause to believe that any person (i) has a m ental illness and that there exists a substantial likelihood that, as a result of mental illness, the person will, in the near future, (a) cause serious physical harm to himself or others as evidenced by recent behavior causing, attempting, or threatenin g harm and other relevant information, if any, or (b) suffer serious harm due to his lack of capacity to protect himself from harm or to provide for his basic human needs, (ii) is in need of hospitalization or treatment, and (iii) is unwilling to volunte er or incapable of volunteering for hospitalization or treatment. Any emergency custody order entered pursuant to this section shall provide for the disclosure of medical records pursuant to § 37.2-804.2. This subsection shall not preclude any other d isclosures as required or permitted by law. When considering whether there is probable cause to issue an emergency custody order, the magistrate may, in addition to the petition, or the court may pursuant to § 19.2-271.6, consider (1) the recommendations of any treating or examining physician or psychologist licensed in Virginia, if available, (2) any past actions of the person, (3) any past mental health treatment of the person, (4) any relevant hearsay evid ence, (5) any medical records available, (6) any affidavits submitted, if the witness is unavailable and it so states in the affidavit, and (7) any other information available that the magistrate or the court considers relevant to the determination of wh ether probable cause exists to issue an emergency custody order. B. Any person for whom an emergency custody order is issued shall be taken into custody and transported to a convenient location to be evaluated to determine whether the person meets the criteria for temporary detention pursuant to § 37.2-809 and to assess the need for hospitalization or treatment. The evaluation shall be made by a person designated by the community services board who is skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness and who has completed a certification program approved by the Departmen t. C. The magistr ate or court issuing an emergency custody order shall specify the primary law-enforcement agency and jurisdiction to execute the emergency custody order and provide transportation.

When transportation is ordered to be provided by an alternative transportation provider, the magistrate or court shall order the specified primary law-enforcement agenc y to execute the order, to take the person into custody, and to transfer custody of the person to the alternative transportation provider identified in the order. In such cases, a copy of the emergency custody order shall accompany the person being trans ported pursuant to this section at all times and shall be delivered by the alternative transportation provider to the community services board or its designee responsible for conducting the evaluation. The community services board or its designee conduct ing the evaluation shall return a copy of the emergency custody order to the court designated by the magistrate or the court that issued the emergency custody order as soon as is practicable.

If the community services board serves more than one jurisdiction , the magistrate or court shall designate the primary law-enforcement agency from the particular jurisdiction within the community services boards service area where the person who is the subject of the emergency custody order was taken into custody or, if the person has not yet been taken into custody, the primary law-enforcement agency from the jurisdiction where the person is presently located to execute the order and provide transportation. E. The law-enf orcement agency or alternative transportation provider providing transportation pursuant to this section may transfer custody of the person to the facility or location to which the person is transported for the evaluation required in subsection B, G, or H if the facility or location (i) is licensed to provide the level of security necessary to protect both the person and others from harm, (ii) is actually capable of providing the level of security necessary to protect the person and others from harm, an d (iii) in cases in which transportation is provided by a law-enforcement agency, has entered into an agreement or memorandum of understanding with the law-enforcement agency setting forth the terms and conditions under which it will accept a transfer of custody, provided, however, that the facility or location may not require the law-enforcement agency to pay any fees or costs for the transfer of custody. F. A law-enfor cement officer may lawfully go or be sent beyond the territorial limits of the county, city, or town in which he serves to any point in the Commonwealth for the purpose of executing an emergency custody order pursuant to this section.

The period of custody shall not exceed eigh t hours from the time the law-enforcement officer takes the person into custody. I. Nothing her ein shall preclude a law-enforcement officer or alternative transportation provider from obtaining emergency medical treatment or further medical evaluation at any time for a person in his custody as provided in this section.

In cases in which the facility of temporary detention is changed following transfer of custody to an initial facility of temp orary custody, transportation of the person to the alternative facility of temporary detention shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of § 37.2-810. The initial facility of temporary detention shall be identified on the preadmission scree ning report and indicated on the temporary detention order; however, if an employee or designee of the local community services board designates an alternative facility, that employee or designee shall provide written notice forthwith, on a form develope d by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia, to the clerk of the issuing court of the name and address of the alternative facility. Subject to the provisions of § 37.2-809.1, if a facility of temporary detention cannot be identified by the time of the expiration of the period of emergency custody pursuant to § 37.2-808, the person shall be detained in a state facility for the treatment of persons with mental illness and such facility shall be indicated on the temporary detention order. Except as provided in § 37.2-811 for inmates requiring hospitalization in accordance with subdivision A 2 of § 19.2-169.6, the person shall not be detained in a jail or other place of confinement for persons charged with criminal offenses. E xcept as provided in § 37.2-811 for inmates requiring hospitalization in accordance with subdivision A 2 of § 19.2-169.6, the person shall remain in the custody of law enforcement until (i) the person is either detained within a secure facility or (ii) custody has been accepted by the appropriate personnel designated by either the initial facility of temporary detention identified in the temporary detention order or by the alternative facility of temporary detention designated by the employee or d esignee of the local community services board pursuant to this subsection. The person detained or in custody pursuant to this section shall be given a written summary of the temporary detention procedures and the statutory protections associated with tho se procedures. F. Any facilit y caring for a person placed with it pursuant to a temporary detention order is authorized to provide emergency medical and psychiatric services within its capabilities when the facility determines that the services are in the best interests of the perso n within its care. The costs incurred as a result of the hearings and by the facility in providing services during the period of temporary detention shall be paid and recovered pursuant to § 37.2-804. The maximum costs reimbursable by the Commonwealth pursuant to this section shall be established by the State Board of Medical Assistance Services based on reasonable criteria. The State Board of Medical Assistance Services shall, by regulation, establish a reasonable rate per day of inpatient care for temporary detention. G. The employe e or the designee of the local community services board who is conducting the evaluation pursuant to this section shall determine, prior to the issuance of the temporary detention order, the insurance status of the person. Where coverage by a third party payor exists, the facility seeking reimbursement under this section shall first seek reimbursement from the third party payor. The Commonwealth shall reimburse the facility only for the balance of costs remaining after the allowances covered by the thir d party payor have been received. H. The duratio n of temporary detention shall be sufficient to allow for completion of the examination required by § 37.2-815, preparation of the preadmission screening report required by § 37.2-816, and initiation of mental health treatment to stabilize the pers ons psychiatric condition to avoid involuntary commitment where possible, but shall not exceed 72 hours prior to a hearing. If the 72-hour period herein specified terminates on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or day on which the court is lawfully closed, the person may be detained, as herein provided, until the close of business on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or day on which the court is lawfully closed. The person may be released, pursuant to § 37.2-813, before the 72-hour period herein specified has run. I. If a tempor ary detention order is not executed within 24 hours of its issuance, or within a shorter period as is specified in the order, the order shall be void and shall be returned unexecuted to the office of the clerk of the issuing court or, if the office is no t open, to any magistrate serving the jurisdiction of the issuing court. Subsequent orders may be issued upon the original petition within 96 hours after the petition is filed. However, a magistrate must again obtain the advice of an employee or a design ee of the local community services board prior to issuing a subsequent order upon the original petition.

In specifyi ng the primary law-enforcement agency and jurisdiction for purposes of this section, the magistrate shall specify in the temporary detention order the law-enforcement agency of the jurisdiction in which the person resides, or any other willing law-enforc ement agency that has agreed to provide transportation, to execute the order and, in cases in which transportation is ordered to be provided by the primary law-enforcement agency, provide transportation. However, if the nearest boundary of the jurisdicti on in which the person resides is more than 50 miles from the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the person is located, the law-enforcement agency of the jurisdiction in which the person is located shall execute the order and provide transport ation. B. The magistr ate issuing the temporary detention order shall (i) specify the law-enforcement agency to execute the order and (ii) designate a transportation provider. In determining the transportation provider, the magistrate shall consider any request to authorize t ransportation by an alternative transportation provider in accordance with this section, whenever an alternative transportation provider is identified to the magistrate, which may be a person, facility, or agency, including a family member or friend of t he person who is the subject of the temporary detention order, a representative of the community services board, an employee of or person providing services pursuant to a contract with the Department, or other transportation provider with personnel train ed to provide transportation in a safe manner. Upon determining, following consideration of information provided by the petitioner; the community services board or its designee; the local law-enforcement agency, if any; the persons treating physician , if any; or other persons who are available and have knowledge of the person, and, when the magistrate deems appropriate, the proposed alternative transportation provider, either in person or via two-way electronic video and audio or telephone communica tion system, that an alternative transportation provider is available to provide transportation, willing to provide transportation, and able to provide transportation in a safe manner, the magistrate shall designate such alternative transportation provid er to provide transportation of the person. If no alternative transportation provider is available to provide transportation, willing to provide transportation, and able to provide transportation in a safe manner, the magistrate shall designate the prima ry law-enforcement agency and jurisdiction designated to execute the temporary detention order to provide transportation of the person. When transportation is ordered to be provided by an alternative transportation provider, the magistrate shall order the specified law-enforcement agency to execute the order, to take the person into custody, and to transfer custody of the person to the alternative transportation provider identified in the order. The primary law-enforcement agency may transfer custody of the person to the alternative transportation prov ider immediately upon execution of the temporary detention order based on the availability of alternative transportation providers. The alternative transportation provider shall maintain custody of the person from the time custody is transferred to the a lternative transportation provider by the primary law-enforcement agency until such time as custody of the person is transferred to the temporary detention facility, including during any period prior to the initiation of transportation of the person from the facility to which he was transported pursuant to § 37.2-808 and while transportation is being provided pursuant to this section. In such cases, a copy of the temporary detention order shall accompany the person being transported pursuant to this section at all times and shall be delivered by the alternative transportation provider to the temporary detention facility. The temporary detention facility shall return a copy of the temporary detention order to the court designated by the magistrate as soon as is practicable. Delivery of an order to a law-enforcement officer or alternative transportation provider and return of an order to the court may be accomplished electronically or by facsimile. The order may include transportation of the person to such other medical facility as may be necessary to obtain further medical evaluation or treatment prior to placeme nt as required by a physician at the admitting temporary detention facility. Nothing herein shall preclude a law-enforcement officer or alternative transportation provider from obtaining emergency medical treatment or further medical evaluation at any ti me for a person in his custody as provided in this section. Such medical evaluation or treatment shall be conducted immediately in accordance with state and federal law. C. If an alter native transportation provider providing transportation or maintaining custody of a person who is the subject of a temporary detention order becomes unable to continue providing transportation or maintaining custody of the person at any time after taking custody of the person, the primary law-enforcement agency for the jurisdiction in which the alternative transportation provider is located at the time he becomes unable to continue providing transportation or maintaining custody shall take custody of th e person and shall transport the person to the facility of temporary detention. In such cases, a copy of the temporary detention order shall accompany the person being transported and shall be delivered to and returned by the temporary detention facility in accordance with the provisions of subsection B. D. In cases in which an alternative facility of temporary detention is identified and the law-enforcement agency or alternative transportation provider identified to provide transportation in accordance with subsection B continues to have custody of the person, the lo cal law-enforcement agency or alternative transportation provider shall transport the person to the alternative facility of temporary detention identified by the employee or designee of the community services board. In cases in which an alternative facil ity of temporary detention is identified and custody of the person has been transferred from the law-enforcement agency or alternative transportation provider that provided transportation in accordance with subsection B to the initial facility of tempora ry detention, the employee or designee of the community services board shall request, and a magistrate may enter an order specifying, an alternative transportation provider or, if no alternative transportation provider is available, willing, and able to provide transportation in a safe manner, the local law-enforcement agency for the jurisdiction in which the person resides or, if the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the person resides is more than 50 miles from the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the person is located, the law-enforcement agency of the jurisdiction in which the person is located, to provide transportation. E. The magistr ate may change the transportation provider specified in a temporary detention order at any time prior to the initiation of transportation of a person who is the subject of a temporary detention order pursuant to this section. If the designated transporta tion provider is changed by the magistrate at any time after the temporary detention order has been executed but prior to the initiation of transportation, the transportation provider having custody of the person shall transfer custody of the person to t he transportation provider subsequently specified to provide transportation. For the purposes of this subsection, transportation provider includes both a law-enforcement agency and an alternative transportation provider. F. A law-enfor cement officer may lawfully go to or be sent beyond the territorial limits of the county, city, or town in which he serves to any point in the Commonwealth for the purpose of executing any temporary detention order pursuant to this section. Law-enforceme nt agencies may enter into agreements to facilitate the execution of temporary detention orders and provide transportation. G. No person w ho provides alternative transportation pursuant to this section shall be liable to the person being transported for any civil damages for ordinary negligence in acts or omissions that result from providing such alternative transportation. H. For purpose s of this section: Law-enforcement agency includes an auxiliary police force established pursuant to § 15.2-1731. Law-enforcement officer includes an auxiliary police officer appointed or provided for pursuant to §§ 15.2-1731 and 15.2-1733.

B. At the comm encement of the commitment hearing, the district court judge or special justice shall inform the person whose involuntary admission is being sought of his right to apply for voluntary admission for inpatient treatment as provided for in § 37.2-805 and shall afford the person an opportunity for voluntary admission. The district court judge or special justice shall advise the person whose involuntary admission is being sought that if the person chooses to be voluntarily admitted pursuant to § 37.2-8 05, such person will be prohibited from possessing, purchasing, or transporting a firearm pursuant to § 18.2-308.1:3. The judge or special justice shall ascertain if the person is then willing and capable of seeking voluntary admission for inpatient t reatment. In determining whether a person is capable of consenting to voluntary admission, the judge or special justice may consider evidence regarding the persons past compliance or noncompliance with treatment.

This section requires the presence of the person to be committed at the civil hearing. Ev ans v. Paderick, 443 F. Supp. 583, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12927 (E.D. Va. 1977). As does federal Constitution.  Even if Virginia law permitted the commitment hearing to be conducted without the presence of the person whose commitment is sought, the federal Constitution woul d require the presence of the person whose involuntary commitment is sought prior to an order of hospitalization being entered. The most elementary notions of due process require that an individual be permitted to be heard, and to hear the evidence adduc ed against him, before actions are taken by the State which substantially deprive him of his liberty. Evans v. Paderick, 443 F. Supp. 583, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12927 (E.D. Va. 1977). There is no exception to the commitment procedure when the person to be committed is a state prisoner. Evans v. Paderick, 443 F. Supp. 583, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12927 (E.D. Va. 1977). Transfer from a prison to a mental institution clearly implicates a liberty interest wit hin the meaning of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Evans v. Paderick, 443 F. Supp. 583, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12927 (E.D. Va. 1977). Since transfer of a state prison inmate from a prison to a mental institution is conditioned on proof of the prisoners need for treatment, state law provides a liberty interest sufficient to require a due process hearing under such circumstances. Evans v. Paderick, 443 F. Supp. 583, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12927 (E.D. Va. 1977). Placement in a mental institution constitutes a serious deprivation of liberty, and that deprivation is substantial even for a person already confined in a penal institution. Evans v. Paderick, 443 F. Supp. 583, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12927 (E.D. Va. 1977). Cust ody lawful where forms drafted to comply with section.  The director of Central State Hospital lawfully accepted custody of and detained the plaintiff, where the forms comprising the record of the plaintiffs civil commitment proceeding, at which he was found so seriously mentally ill as to be unable to care for himself, and at which alternatives to involuntary admission were found unsuitable, were drafted by the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Develop mental Services to comply with this section.

Any individual in a state hospital who is not a proper case for treatment within the purview of this chapter; or 3. Any individual in a training center who chooses to be discharged or, if the individual lacks the mental capacity to choose, whose legally authorized representative chooses for him to b e discharged. Pursuant to regulations of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and the Department of Medical Assistance Services, no individual at a training center who is enrolled in Medicaid shall be discharged if the individual or his legally a uthorized representative on his behalf chooses to continue receiving services in a training center.For all individuals discharged, the discharge plan shall be formulated in accordance with the provisions of § 37.2-505 by the community services board o r behavioral health authority that serves the city or county where the individual resided prior to admission or by the board or authority that serves the city or county where the individual or his legally authorized representative on his behalf chooses t o reside immediately following the discharge.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Virginias Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA) [see now § 37.2-900 et seq.], was affirmed because: (1) there were proper procedures and evidentiary safegu ards; (2) the SVPA satisfied the requirement that there be a finding of dangerousness either to ones self or to others; and (3) proof of dangerousness and lack of control was linked to the condition of the person. Furthermore, the SVPA was a non-puni tive, civil commitment statute and as such did not violate the guarantees against double jeopardy or ex post facto lawmaking. Shivaee v.

The Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, § 37.2-900 et seq., does not offend minimal standards of due process because an uncounseled decision by a prisoner to refuse to cooperate with the Commonwealths expert during the § 37.2-904 mental health examination will not serve as an absolute bar to his right to present expert evidence during the prisoners commitment trial and dispositional hearing. Rather, in cases where the Commonwealth seeks to prohibit a prisoner from presenting such evidence, the court will have the discretion to allow or bar such evidence based upon its inquiry into the circumstances under which the prisoner made a de cision at the time of the examination and whether the prisoner remains steadfast in the refusal to cooperate.

In a proceeding under the Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, § 37.2-900 et seq., a prisoner was denied procedural due process when he was barr ed from presenting expert testimony because the restrictions imposed by §§ 37.2-901 and 37.2-907 were discretionary and subsection A of § 37.2-907 did not mandate that the prisoner be prohibited from presenting any expert evidence based on the p risoners failure to cooperate with a mental health examination as required by § 37.2-904 where the prisoner did not have the opportunity to consult with counsel before deciding whether to cooperate with the mental health examination.

Du e process does not require appointment of defense expert.  Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide a sexually violent predator (SVP) with an expert; the SVP possesses a recognized but diminished liberty i nterest, the expert who issues the report is not selected by the entity responsible for prosecuting SVP cases but rather by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, and the SVP is afforded other due process protections, such as the right to counsel.

Sex of fender subject to supervision by the Commonwealth.  Sex offender was subject to supervision by the Commonwealth of Virginia because the offender was found to be a sexually violent predator under the Virginia Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act, § 37.2-900 et seq.  which was a civil, not a criminal, statutory scheme. Commonwealth v. Amerson, 281 Va. 414, 706 S.E.2d 879, 2011 Va. LEXIS 54 (2011). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Constitutionality.  Although eligibility for civil commitment under the Sexually Violent Predators Act, §§ 37.1-70.1 to 37.1-70.19 [now § 37.2-900 et seq.], is triggered by conviction of a sexually violent crime, civil commitment can be imposed only after testing, evaluation, a probable cause hearing, and a jury trial. No one can be civilly committed as a sexually violent predator unless the Commonwealth mee ts its burden of proof on a multitude of factors. Ames v. Johnson, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Roanoke Mar. 28, 2005). No duty to inform client of commitment process.  Attorney had no constitutional or professional duty to inform her client about the civil commitment process under the Sexually Violent Predators Act, §§ 37. 1-70.1 to 37.1-70.19 [now see § 37.2-900 et seq.]; therefore, her failure to do so did not fall below the standard of care for a criminal defense attorney representing her client in a forcible sodomy case.

CASE NOTES Must currently be incarcerated for a sexually violent offense.  Trial court erred in finding that the prisoner could be civilly committed pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predators Act, as the prisoner had already completed hi s sentence for a rape conviction and was only being held pursuant to convictions that were not for sexually violent offenses; since the clear and unambiguous language of §§ 37.1-70.4 and 37.1-70.5 [see now §§ 37.2-903 and 37.2-904], required that he be currently held for a sexually violent offense for him to be civilly committed and he was not being held for such an offense, he could not be civilly committed under the Act.

B.

If the prisoners or defendants name was forwarded to the CRC based upon an evaluation by a licensed psychiatr ist or licensed clinical psychologist, a different licensed psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist shall perform the examination for the CRC. The licensed psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist shall determine whether the prisoner or defe ndant is a sexually violent predator, as defined in § 37.2-900, and forward the results of this evaluation and any supporting documents to the CRC for its review.The CRC assessment may be based on:An actuarial evaluation, clinical evaluation, or any o ther information or evaluation determined by the CRC to be relevant, including but not limited to a review of (i) the prisoners or defendants institutional history and treatment record, if any; (ii) his criminal background; and (iii) any other fa ctor that is relevant to the determination of whether he is a sexually violent predator.

D. Pursuant to clause (ii) of subsection C, the CRC may recommend that a prisoner or defendant enter a conditional release program if it finds that (i) he does not need inpatient treatment, but needs outpatient treatment and monitoring to prevent his condition from de teriorating to a degree that he would need inpatient treatment; (ii) appropriate outpatient supervision and treatment are reasonably available; (iii) there is significant reason to believe that, if conditionally released, he would comply with the conditi ons specified; and (iv) conditional release will not present an undue risk to public safety.

Warring ton v. Commonwealth, 280 Va. 365, 699 S.E.2d 233, 2010 Va. LEXIS 238 (2010). Offender properly held beyon d release date.  Because the Virginia Attorney General timely filed a petition to civilly commit a convicted sex offender as a sexually violent predator when he was still incarcer ated for a sexually violent offense, and because the Commonwealth substantially complied with the Virginia Sexually Violent Predator Act, § 37.2-900 et seq., the trial court did not err by ordering the offender to be held beyond his release date until a final order was entered on the Attorney Generals petition. Warrington v. Commonwealth, 280 Va. 365, 699 S.E.2d 233, 2010 Va. LEXIS 238 (2010). Commonwealth not grossly negligent.  Commonwealth was not grossly negligent in initially relying on an opinion of a psychologist who was not qualified in treatment under subsection B of § 37.2-904 of the Virginia Sexually Violent Predator Act, § 37.2-900 et seq., because, on learning of his lack of qualifications, it immediately notified the court and the sex offender and sought a replacement expert. Thus, pursuant to § 37.2-905.1, the Comm onwealth was presumed to have substantially complied with §§ 37.2-903, 37.2-904, and 37.2-905, and the court did not err in denying the offenders motions to dismiss the Commonwealths civil commitment petition.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Burden of proof.  Where the Virginia Attorney General failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that an inmate was likely to commit sexually violent acts in the future becaus e of his mental abnormality or personality disorder, but merely offered evidence to support the proposition that, because of the inmates antisocial personality disorder, he was impulsive in his actions and decision making, such evidence was insuffici ent to satisfy the explicit requirements of § 37.1-70.1 [see now § 37.2-900]; thus the Attorney Generals petition to have the inmate civilly committed was denied. Kilgore ex rel. Commonwealth v. Hurst, 64 Va. Cir. 376, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 178 ( Norfolk Apr. 20, 2004) (decided under prior law). § 37.2-905.1. Substantial compliance. Text The provisions of §§ 37.2-903, 37.2-904, and 37.2-905 are procedural and not substantive or jurisdictional. Absent a showing of failure to follow these provisions as a result of gross negligence or willful misconduct, it shall be presumed that there has been substantial compliance with these provisions. History History. 2007, c. 876; 2009, c. 740. Annotations The 2009 amendments. The 2009 amendment by c. 740 inserted 37.2-905 and made a related change. CASE NOTES Substantial compliance found.  Commonwealth was not grossly negligent in initially relying on an opinion of a psychologist who was not qualified in treatment under subsection B of § 37.2-904 of the Virginia Sexually Violent Predator Act, § 37.2-900 et seq., because, on learning of his lack of qualifications, it immediately notified the court and the sex offender and sought a replacement expert. Thus, pursuant to § 37.2-905.1, the Comm onwealth was presumed to have substantially complied with §§ 37.2-903, 37.2-904, and 37.2-905, and the court did not err in denying the offenders motions to dismiss the Commonwealths civil commitment petition. Warrington v. Commonwealth, 28 0 Va. 365, 699 S.E.2d 233, 2010 Va. LEXIS 238 (2010). No negligence.  Director of the Department of Corrections was not negligent, much less grossly negligent, for rejecting extensive documentary evidence at the screening stage in f avor of otherwise uncorroborated, impeached, and self-interested testimony of an inmate and his brother and thus, the trial court misapplied this section and erred in dismissing the Commonwealths petition for civil commitment. Commonwealth v. Giddens , 295 Va. 607, 816 S.E.2d 290, 2018 Va. LEXIS 92 (2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction.  Language of subsection A of § 37.2-906 is unambiguous and the court is therefore bound by the plain meaning that 90 days means 90 days; this is the intent of t he legislature when this statute is read with § 37.2-905.1 because the General Assembly did not include subsection A of § 37.2-906 in this substantial compliance statute, which is further evidence, in addition to the plain language of subsection A of § 37.2-906, of legislative intent that the probable cause hearing occur within 90 days. Commonwealth v. Rickman, 94 Va. Cir. 1, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 211 (Chesterfield County Jan. 27, 2016), aff'd on other grounds, 294 Va. 531, 808 S.E.2d 395, 2017 V a. LEXIS 199 (2017). Use of shall in subsection A is mandatory, not directory; this is based on a strict construction of the statute, that the court must conduct the h earing within the timeframe, the plain and unambiguous language of the statute particularly when read with § 37.2-905.1, the provision of only two grounds to extend the time frame, application of the rule of lenity, and the liberty and due process int erests inherent in a Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act proceeding.

Upon the fi ling of a petition alleging that the respondent is a sexually violent predator, the circuit court shall (i) forthwith order that until a final order is entered in the proceeding, in the case of a prisoner, he remain in the secure custody of the Departmen t of Corrections or, in the case of a defendant, he remain in the secure custody of the Department and (ii) schedule a hearing within 90 days to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the respondent is a sexually violent predator. The re spondent may waive his right to a hearing under this section. A continuance extending the case beyond the 90 days may be granted to either the Attorney General or the respondent upon good cause shown or by agreement of the parties. The clerk shall mail a copy of the petition to the attorney appointed or retained for the respondent and to the person in charge of the facility in which the respondent is then confined. The person in charge of the facility shall cause the petition to be delivered to the resp ondent and shall certify the delivery to the clerk. In addition, a written explanation of the sexually violent predator involuntary commitment process and the statutory protections associated with the process shall be given to the respondent at the time the petition is delivered. B. Any hearing or proceeding under this section may be conducted using a two-way electronic video and audio communication system to provide for the appearance of any parties and witnesses. Any two-way electronic video and audio communication system shall meet the stan dards set forth in subsection B of § 19.2-3.1. C. Prior to an y hearing under this section, the judge shall ascertain if the respondent is represented by counsel and, if he is not represented by counsel, the judge shall appoint an attorney to represent him. However, if the respondent requests an opportunity to empl oy counsel, the court shall give him a reasonable opportunity to employ counsel at his own expense. D. A responden t who has refused to cooperate with a mental health examination required pursuant to § 37.2-904 may, within 21 days of the retention of counsel or appointment of counsel, rescind his refusal and elect to cooperate with the mental health examination. C ounsel for the respondent shall provide written notice of the respondents election to cooperate with the mental health examination to the court and the attorney for the Commonwealth within 30 days of the retention or appointment of counsel, and the p robable cause hearing shall be stayed until 30 days after receipt of the mental health examiners report. The mental health examination shall be conducted in accordance with subsection B of § 37.2-904. Results of the evaluation shall be filed with the court and copies of the results shall be provided to counsel for the parties. The mental health examiners itemized account of expenses, duly sworn to, shall be presented to the court and, when allowed, shall be certified to the Supreme Court for payment out of the state treasury and shall be charged against the appropriations made to pay criminal charges.In the event that a respondent refuses to cooperate with the mental health examination required by § 37.2-904 or fails or refuses to coopera te with the mental health examination following rescission of his refusal pursuant to this subsection, the court shall admit evidence of such failure or refusal and shall bar the respondent from introducing his own expert psychiatric and psychological ev idence. E. At the prob able cause hearing, the judge shall (i) verify the respondents identity and (ii) determine whether probable cause exists to believe that he is a sexually violent predator. The existence of any prior convictions or charges may be shown with affidavits or documentary evidence. The details underlying the commission of an offense or behavior that led to a prior conviction or charge may be shown by affidavits or documentary evidence, including but not limited to, hearing and/or trial transcripts, probati on and parole and sentencing reports, police and sheriffs reports, and mental health evaluations. If he meets the qualifications set forth in subsection B of § 37.2-904, the expert witness may be permitted to testify at the probable cause hearing as to his diagnosis, his opinion as to whether the respondent meets the definition of a sexually violent predator, his recommendations as to treatment, and the basis for his opinions. Such opinions shall not be dispositive of whether the respondent is a sexually violent predator. F. In the case of a prisoner in the custody of the Department of Corrections, if the judge finds that there is not probable cause to believe that the respondent is a sexually violent predator, the judge shall dismiss the petition, and the respondent shall remain in th e custody of the Department of Corrections until his scheduled date of release from prison. In the case of a defendant, if the judge finds that there is not probable cause to believe the respondent is a sexually violent predator, the judge shall dismiss the petition and order that the respondent be discharged, involuntarily admitted pursuant to §§ 37.2-814 through 37.2-819, or certified for admission pursuant to § 37.2-806.

CASE NOTES Subject matter jurisdiction.  Petitioner did not show that his involuntary civil commitment was invalid even though he claimed that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hold a probable cause hearing to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to hold a hearing on whether he was a sexually violent predator and to find that he was in fact a sexually violent predator; statutory law clearly authorized the trial court to ho ld such hearings, even where defendant was not currently in custody. Jenkins v. Dir. of the Va. Ctr. for Behavioral Rehab., 271 Va. 4, 624 S.E.2d 453, 2006 Va. LEXIS 12 (2006). Probable cause hearing date.  Because the Sexually Violent Predators Act, §§ 37.2-900 to 37.2-921, conspicuously omitted any shall command requiring dismissal of petitions as the specific, exclusive remedy for a schedule violation, the Sexually Violent Predators Acts scheduling requirement served as a directory, not mandatory, command and defendant was not entitled to dismissal based on the scheduling of the hearing beyond t he 90-day deadline. Rickman v. Commonwealth, 294 Va. 531, 808 S.E.2d 395, 2017 Va. LEXIS 199 (2017). Expert evidence.  Bar on expert evidence found in this section applied in probable cause hearings, not commitment hearings, and therefore, the trial court erred in concluding that this section barred respondent from introducing evidence at his commitment hearing. However, the error was harmless because respondent repeatedly refused to submit to an examination as required by § 37.2-904, and the trial court allowed respondent s experts reports to be mentioned as impeachment evidence.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction.  Language of subsection A of this section is unambiguous and the court is therefore bound by the plain meaning that 90 days means 90 days; this is the intent of th e legislature when this statute is read with § 37.2-905.1 because the General Assembly did not include subsection A of § 37.2-906 in this substantial compliance statute, which is further evidence, in addition to the plain language of subsection A o f § 37.2-906, of legislative intent that the probable cause hearing occur within 90 days.

Legislature in using the language extending the case beyond the 90 days, and in providing only two grounds on which the court can extend the case beyond t hat time, manifests an intent that 90 days requirement is mandatory and not directory; holding the Commonwealth to the clearly stated timeframe of subsection A does not constitute an unreasonably restrictive interpretation, particularly given that the Co mmonwealth need show only good cause to schedule a hearing beyond the timeframe. Commonwealth v. Rickman, 94 Va. Cir. 1, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 211 (Chesterfield County Jan. 27, 2016), aff'd on other grounds, 294 Va. 531, 808 S.E.2d 395, 2017 Va. LEXIS 199 (2017). Authority granted to the Commonwealth pursuant to the the Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act is strictly statutory, it finds no basis in the commo n law, and it uniquely combines both civil and criminal elements; as such, that authority must be strictly construed if the Sexually Violent Predators Act is to be applied without prejudice or excess.

Upon a find ing of probable cause the judge shall ascertain if the respondent is requesting expert assistance. If the respondent requests expert assistance and has not employed an expert at his own expense, the judge shall appoint such experts as he deems necessary. However, if the respondent refused to cooperate with the mental health examination required pursuant to § 37.2-904 or failed or refused to cooperate with a mental health examination following rescission of a refusal pursuant to § 37.2-906, any exp ert appointed to assist the respondent shall not be permitted to testify at trial nor shall any report of any such expert be admissible. Any expert employed or appointed pursuant to this section shall be a licensed psychiatrist or licensed clinical psych ologist who is skilled in the diagnosis and risk assessment of sex offenders and knowledgeable about the treatment of sex offenders, and who is not a member of the CRC. Any expert employed or appointed pursuant to this section shall have reasonable acce ss to all relevant medical and psychological records and reports pertaining to the respondent. No such expert shall be permitted to testify as a witness on behalf of the respondent unless that expert has prepared a written report detailing his findings a nd conclusions and has submitted his report, along with all supporting data, to the court, the Attorney General, and counsel for the respondent. Such report shall be submitted no less than 45 days prior to the trial of the matter unless a different time period is agreed to by the parties. B. Each psychi atrist, psychologist, or other expert appointed by the court to render professional service pursuant to this chapter who is not regularly employed by the Commonwealth, except by the University of Virginia School of Medicine and the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, shall receive a reasonable fee for such service. The fee shall be determined in each instance by the court that appointed the expert, in accordance with guidelines established by the Supreme Court after consultation with th e Department. The fee shall not exceed $5,000. However, in addition, if any such expert is required to appear as a witness in any hearing held pursuant to this chapter, he shall receive mileage and a fee of $750 for each day during which he is required t o serve. An itemized account of expenses, duly sworn to, shall be presented to the court, and, when allowed, shall be certified to the Supreme Court for payment out of the state treasury, and shall be charged against the appropriations made to pay crimin al charges.

Expert not required to b e licensed in Virginia.  Trial court did not err in admitting the testimony of defendants expert witness, a psychologist who was not licensed to practice in Virginia, as nothing in § 37.1-70.8(A) [now § 37.2-907], as applicable at time of trial, or elsewhere in Sexually Violent Predators Act, expressly required or by implications suggested that a mental health expert must be licensed to practice in Virginia.

Hood v. Commo nwealth, 280 Va. 526, 701 S.E.2d 421, 2010 Va. LEXIS 269 (2010). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Psychologists qualified.  In a case in which the Commonwealth sought to have defendant determined to be a sexually violent predator and, as such, subjected to civil commitment with the Vir ginia Department of Corrections pursuant to § 37.2-900 et seq., the two psychologists who examined defendant were qualified to examine him and to render their opinions as to whether he was a sexually violent predator according to the requirement of § 37.2-907; the uncontroverted evidence presented by both expert witnesses was that defendant had mental abnormality of Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified (non-consent) as well as Antisocial Personality Disorder; and his conviction for aggravated sexu al battery was a sexually violent offense within the meaning of § 37.2-900, the Commonwealth had proven by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was convicted of a sexually violent offense and, due to a mental abnormality or personality disorde r, he would find it difficult to control his predatory behavior, making him likely to engage in sexually violent acts in the future as defined by § 37.2-900.

Within 120 days after the completion of the probable cause hearing held pursuant to § 37.2-906, the court shall conduct a trial to determine whether the respondent is a sexually violent predator. A continuance extending the case beyond the 120 days may be grante d to either the Attorney General or the respondent upon good cause shown or by agreement of the parties. B. The Attorne y General or the respondent shall have the right to a trial by jury. Seven persons from a panel of 13 shall constitute a jury in such cases. If a jury determines that the respondent is a sexually violent predator, a unanimous verdict shall be required. I f no demand is made by either party for a trial by jury, the trial shall be before the court. C. The court o r jury shall determine whether, by clear and convincing evidence, the respondent is a sexually violent predator. If the court or jury does not find clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a sexually violent predator, the court shall, in the case of a prisoner, direct that he be returned to the custody of the Department of Corrections. The Department of Corrections shall immediately release him if his scheduled release date has passed, or hold him until his scheduled release date. In the cas e of a defendant, if the court or jury does not find by clear and convincing evidence that he is a sexually violent predator, the court shall order that he be discharged, involuntarily admitted pursuant to §§ 37.2-814 through 37.2-819, or certified for admission pursuant to § 37.2-806.If he meets the qualifications set forth in subsection B of § 37.2-904 or 37.2-907, any expert witness may be permitted to testify at the trial as to his diagnosis, his opinion as to whether the respondent meet s the definition of a sexually violent predator, his recommendation as to treatment, and the basis for his opinions. Such opinions shall not be dispositive of whether the respondent is a sexually violent predator. D. If the cour t or jury finds the respondent to be a sexually violent predator, the court shall then determine that the respondent shall be committed or continue the trial for not less than 45 days nor more than 60 days pursuant to subsection E. A continuance extendin g the case beyond the 60 days may be granted to either the Attorney General or the respondent upon good cause shown or by agreement of the parties. In making its determination, the court may consider (i) the nature and circumstances of the sexually viole nt offense for which the respondent was charged or convicted, including the age and maturity of the victim; (ii) the results of any actuarial test, including the likelihood of recidivism; (iii) the results of any diagnostic tests previously administered to the respondent under this chapter; (iv) the respondents mental history, including treatments for mental illness or mental disorders, participation in and response to therapy or treatment, and any history of previous hospitalizations; (v) the respo ndents present mental condition; (vi) the respondents disciplinary record and types of infractions he may have committed while incarcerated or hospitalized; (vii) the respondents living arrangements and potential employment if he were to be p laced on conditional release; (viii) the availability of transportation and appropriate supervision to ensure participation by the respondent in necessary treatment; and (ix) any other factors that the court deems relevant. If after considering the facto rs listed in § 37.2-912, the court finds that there is no suitable less restrictive alternative to involuntary secure inpatient treatment, the judge shall by written order and specific findings so certify and order that the respondent be committed to the custody of the Department for appropriate inpatient treatment in a secure facility designated by the Commissioner. Respondents committed pursuant to this chapter are subject to the provisions of § 19.2-174.1 and Chapter 11 (§ 37.2-1100 et seq.) . E. If the cour t determines to continue the trial to receive additional evidence on possible alternatives to commitment, the court shall require the Commissioner to submit a report to the court, the Attorney General, and counsel for the respondent suggesting possible a lternatives to commitment. The court shall then reconvene the trial and receive testimony on the possible alternatives to commitment. At the conclusion of testimony on the possible alternatives to commitment, the court shall consider: (i) the treatment n eeds of the respondent; (ii) whether less restrictive alternatives to commitment have been investigated and deemed suitable; (iii) whether any such alternatives will accommodate needed and appropriate supervision and treatment plans for the respondent, i ncluding but not limited to, therapy or counseling, access to medications, availability of travel, and location of proposed residence; and (iv) whether any such alternatives will accommodate needed and appropriate regular psychological or physiological t esting, including but not limited to, penile plethysmograph testing or sexual interest testing. If the court finds these criteria are adequately addressed and the court finds that the respondent meets the criteria for conditional release set forth in § 37.2-912, the court shall order that the respondent be returned to the custody of the Department of Corrections to be processed for conditional release as a sexually violent predator pursuant to his conditional release plan. The court shall also ord er the respondent to be subject to electronic monitoring of his location by means of a GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking device, or other similar device, at all times while he is on conditional release. Access to anti-androgen medications or other medication prescribed to lower blood serum testosterone shall not be used as a primary reason for determining that less restrictive alternatives are appropriate pursuant to this chapter. F. The Departm ent shall recommend a specific course of treatment and programs for provision of such treatment and shall monitor the respondents compliance with such treatment as may be ordered by the court under this section, unless the respondent is on parole or probation, in which case the parole or probation officer shall monitor his compliance. G. In the even t of a mistrial, the court shall direct that the prisoner remain in the secure custody of the Department of Corrections or the defendant remain in the secure custody of the Department until another trial is conducted. Any subsequent trial following a mis trial shall be held within 90 days of the previous trial.

CASE NOTES Civil committment of sexually violent predators.  Virginias Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA) [see now § 37.2-900 et seq.], is a non-punitive, civil commitment statute because if a person is found to b e a sexually violent predator, he is civilly committed for control, care and treatment until such time as the persons mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person will not present an undue risk to public safety.

The committ ing court shall conduct a hearing 12 months after the date of commitment to assess each respondents need for secure inpatient treatment. A hearing for assessment shall be conducted at yearly intervals for five years and at biennial intervals thereaft er. The court shall schedule the matter for hearing as soon as possible after it becomes due, giving the matter priority over all pending matters before the court. A continuance extending the review may be granted to either the Attorney General or the re spondent upon good cause shown or by agreement of the parties. Whenever practicable, the hearing for assessment shall be conducted using a two-way electronic video and audio communication system that meets the standards set forth in subsection B of § 19.2-3.1. B. Prior to th e hearing, the Commissioner shall provide to the court a report reevaluating the respondents condition and recommending treatment. The report shall be prepared by a licensed psychiatrist or a licensed clinical psychologist skilled in the diagnosis an d risk assessment of sex offenders and knowledgeable about the treatment of sex offenders. If the Commissioners report recommends discharge or the respondent requests discharge, the respondents condition and need for secure inpatient treatment sh all be evaluated by a second person with such credentials who is not currently treating the respondent. Any professional person who conducts a second evaluation of a respondent shall submit a report of his findings to the court and the Commissioner. A co py of any report submitted pursuant to this subsection shall be sent to the Attorney General and to any attorney appointed or retained for the respondent. C. The burden of proof at the hearing shall be upon the Commonwealth to prove to the court by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent remains a sexually violent predator. D. If the cour t finds, based upon the report and other evidence provided at the hearing, that the respondent is no longer a sexually violent predator, the court shall release the respondent from secure inpatient treatment. If the court finds that the respondent remain s a sexually violent predator, it shall order that he remain in the custody of the Commissioner for secure inpatient hospitalization and treatment or that he be conditionally released. To determine if the respondent shall be conditionally released, the c ourt shall determine if the respondent meets the criteria for conditional release set forth in § 37.2-912. If the court orders that the respondent be conditionally released, the court shall allow the Department no less than 30 days and no more than 60 days to prepare a conditional release plan. Any such plan must be able to accommodate needed and appropriate supervision and treatment plans for the respondent, including but not limited to, therapy or counseling, access to medications, availability of travel, location of residence, and regular psychological monitoring of the respondent if called for, including polygraph examinations, penile plethysmograph testing, or sexual interest testing, if necessary. Access to anti-androgen medications or other m edication prescribed to lower blood serum testosterone shall not be used as a primary reason for determining that less restrictive alternatives are appropriate pursuant to this chapter. In preparing the conditional release plan, the Department shall noti fy the attorney for the Commonwealth, the chief law-enforcement officer, and the governing body for the locality that is the proposed location of the respondents residence upon his conditional release.If the court places the respondent on conditional release, the court shall order the respondent to be subject to electronic monitoring of his location by means of a GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking device, or other similar device, at all times while he is on conditional release.

CASE NOTES Sexually violent predator has diminished liberty interest.  Sexually violent predators (SVP) liberty interest is a diminished one when compared to the liberty interests under review in capital cases and other criminal proceedings; a defendant in a criminal case was presumed innocent, but respondents had already been found, by clear and convincing evidence, to be sexually violent predators, and their onerous terms of release limited an SVPs liberty and thus , diminish the liberty interest at issue. Harvey v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 403, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019). Du e process does not require appointment of defense expert.  Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide a sexually violent predator with an expert; continuances to locate and produce an expert will cause delay where resolution of a matter is intended to be both expeditious and temporary, and the allocation of the burden of proof reduced the need for a separate expert for a respondent, and the risk of error is significantly mitigated by subsequent reviews. Har vey v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 403, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019). Because of the temporary, expedited nature of the hearing and the other protections afforded to respondents, including the right to counsel, the Due Process Claus e did not require the State to appoint an expert to assist them in a hearing to determine whether they violated the conditions of their release and whether those violations rendered them unsuitable for conditional release; at their annual review, if they requested discharge, respondents were entitled to be evaluated by a second expert. Harvey v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 403, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019). Mental health of offende r may change over time.  Virginia Civil Commitment of Sexually Violent Predators Act assumes the mental health of a sexually violent offender may change over time as this section outlines a process for reevaluation after commitment and requiring release if a court finds, based upon the report and other evidence provided at the hearing, that the respondent is no longer a sexually violent predator.

Hearing by video conference.  Provision in subsection A for conducting annual assessment hearings under the Virginia Sexually Violent Predator Act by video conference is not facially unconstit utional. Shellman v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 711, 733 S.E.2d 242, 2012 Va. LEXIS 197 (2012). Conducting an annual assessment hearing under § 37.2-910 of the Virginia Sexually Violent Predator Act by video conference did not violate respondents righ ts to counsel and to due process; as he was able to participate in the hearing and confer with his counsel, he was not prejudiced by the trial courts denial of his request to attend the hearing in person. Shellman v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 711, 733 S. E.2d 242, 2012 Va. LEXIS 197 (2012). Predator failed to show no need for secure inpatient treatment.  Sexually violent predator failed to satisfy the first criterion set forth in subsection A of § 37.2-912 because both experts who testified, including his own e xpert, opined without objection that the predator did need secure inpatient treatment. He was only in the first phase of the three-phase treatment, and his attendance rate at group therapy had dropped to 15 percent. Commonwealth v. Bell, 282 Va. 308, 714 S.E.2d 562, 2011 Va.

At any time the court considers the respondents need for secure inpatient treatment pursuant to this chapter, it shall place the respondent on conditional release if it finds that (i) he does not need secure inpatient treatment but needs outpatient treatment or monitoring to prevent his condition from deteriorating to a degree that he would need secure inpatient treatment; (ii) appropriate outpatient supervision and treatment are reasonably available; (iii) there is significant reason to believe that the respo ndent, if conditionally released, would comply with the conditions specified; and (iv) conditional release will not present an undue risk to public safety. In making its determination, the court may consider (i) the nature and circumstances of the sexual ly violent offense for which the respondent was charged or convicted, including the age and maturity of the victim; (ii) the results of any actuarial test, including the likelihood of recidivism; (iii) the results of any diagnostic tests previously admin istered to the respondent under this chapter; (iv) the respondents mental history, including treatments for mental illness or mental disorders, participation in and response to therapy or treatment, and any history of previous hospitalizations; (v) t he respondents present mental condition; (vi) the respondents response to treatment while in secure inpatient treatment or on conditional release, including his disciplinary record and any infractions; (vii) the respondents living arrangement s and potential employment if he were to be placed on conditional release; (viii) the availability of transportation and appropriate supervision to ensure participation by the respondent in necessary treatment; and (ix) any other factors that the court d eems relevant.

A judicial officer may issue an emergency custody order, upon the sworn petition of any responsible person or upon his own motion, based upon probable cause to believe that a respondent on conditional release within his judicial district has violated the conditions of his release and is no longer a proper subject for conditional release. The judicial officer shall forward a copy of the petition and the emergency custody order to the circuit court that conditionally released the respondent, the Attorney General, th e Department, and the attorney for the Commonwealth for the locality that is the location of the respondents residence. Petitions and orders for emergency custody of conditionally released respondents pursuant to this section may be filed, issued, se rved, or executed by electronic means, with or without the use of two-way electronic video and audio communication, and returned in the same manner with the same force, effect, and authority as an original document. All signatures thereon shall be treate d as original signatures. B. The emergen cy custody order shall require a law-enforcement officer to take the respondent into custody immediately. A law-enforcement officer may lawfully go to or be sent beyond the territorial limits of the county, city, or town in which he serves to any point i n the Commonwealth for the purpose of executing an emergency custody order pursuant to this section. The respondent shall be transported to a secure facility specified by the Department where a person designated by the Department who is skilled in the di agnosis and risk assessment of sex offenders and knowledgeable about the treatment of sex offenders shall, as soon as practicable, perform a mental health examination of the respondent, including a personal interview.

The evaluators report shall become part of the record in the case. C. The respond ent on conditional release shall remain in custody until a hearing is held in the circuit court that conditionally released the respondent on the motion or petition to determine if he should be returned to the custody of the Commissioner. The hearing sha ll be given priority on the courts docket. D. The respond ents failure to comply with the conditions of release, including outpatient treatment, may be admitted into evidence. The evaluator designated in subsection B may be permitted to testify at the hearing as to his diagnosis, his opinion as to whether t he respondent remains suitable for conditional release, his recommendation as to treatment and supervision, and the basis for his opinions. If upon hearing the evidence, the court finds that the respondent on conditional release has violated the conditio ns of his release and that the violation of conditions was sufficient to render him no longer suitable for conditional release, the court shall revoke his conditional release and order him returned to the custody of the Commissioner for secure inpatient treatment.

Research References. Virginia Forms (Matthew Bender). No. 9-517 Emergency Custody Order  Violation of Conditional Release. CASE NOTES Du e process does not require appointment of defense expert.  Because of the temporary, expedited nature of the hearing and the other protections afforded to respondents, including the right to counsel, the Due Process Claus e did not require the State to appoint an expert to assist them in a hearing to determine whether they violated the conditions of their release and whether those violations rendered them unsuitable for conditional release; at their annual review, if they requested discharge, respondents were entitled to be evaluated by a second expert. Harvey v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 403, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019). States interest weighed against the appointment of an expert for a sexually violent predator; the expert was not the prosecutions expert or the defense s expert and can conclude, over the objections of the Attorney General, that the respondent is, in fact, amenable to conditional release, and this non-adversarial model for selecting experts reduces the risk of an erroneous deprivation of a liberty i nterest. Harvey v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 403, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019). Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide a sexually violent predator with an expert; continuances to locate and produce an expert will cause delay where resolution of a matter is intended to be both expeditious and temporary, and the allocation of the burden of proof reduced the need for a separate expert for a respondent, and the risk of error is significantly mitigated by subsequent reviews. Har vey v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 403, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019). Due Process Clause does not require the State to provide a sexually violent predator (SVP) with an expert; the SVP possesses a recognized but diminished liberty i nterest, the expert who issues the report is not selected by the entity responsible for prosecuting SVP cases but rather by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, and the SVP is afforded other due process protections, such as the right to counsel. Harvey v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 403, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019). Sexually violent predator has diminished liberty interest.  Sexually violent predators (SVP) liberty interest is a diminished one when compared to the liberty interests under review in capital cases and other criminal proceedings; a defendant in a criminal case was presumed innocent, but respondents had already been found, by clear and convincing evidence, to be sexually violent predators, and their onerous terms of release limited an SVPs liberty and thus , diminish the liberty interest at issue. Harvey v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 403, 829 S.E.2d 534, 2019 Va. LEXIS 106 (2019). Conditional release of sexually violent predator to out-of-state agency.  Circuit court erred in conditionally releasing a sexually violent predator to an out-of-state agency because no provision of the Virginia Civil Commitment of Sexu ally Violent Predators Act), § 37.2-900 et seq., authorized the conditional release of an sexually violent predator outside the Commonwealth of Virginia. Commonwealth v. Amerson, 281 Va. 414, 706 S.E.2d 879, 2011 Va. LEXIS 54 (2011).

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Authority to recommit without annual review hearing.  Circuit court had authority to recommit respondent to the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (DBHDS) upon his release from the Federal Bur eau of Prisons without affording him an annual review hearing because he was serving a period of active incarceration of twelve months or longer, and thus, his review hearing was tolled until twelve months after he has been returned to the DBHDS; the pla in meaning of the statute is unambiguous and would not lead to an absurd result.

App. LEXIS 576 (2004) (decided under prior law).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_37.2-1101"><akn:num>§ 37.2-1101</akn:num><akn:heading>Judicial authorization of treatment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. An appropri ate circuit court or district court judge or special justice may authorize treatment for a mental or physical disorder on behalf of an adult person, in accordance with this section, if it finds upon clear and convincing evidence that (i) the person is ei ther incapable of making an informed decision on his own behalf or is incapable of communicating such a decision due to a physical or mental disorder and (ii) the proposed treatment is in the best interest of the person. B. Any person may request authorization of treatment for an adult person by filing a petition in the circuit court or district court or with a special justice of the county or city in which the person for whom treatment is sought resides or is located or in the county or city in which the proposed place of treatment is located. Upon filing the petition, the petitioner or the court shall deliver or send a certified copy of the petition to the person for whom treatment is sought and, if the identity and whereabouts of the persons next of kin are known, to the next of kin. C. As soon as reasonably possible after the filing of the petition, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the interests of the person for whom treatment is sought at the hearing. However, the appointment shall not be required in the event that the person or another interested person on behalf of the person elects to retain private counsel at his own expense to represent the interests of the person at the hearing. If the person for whom treatment is sought is indigent, his counsel shall be paid by the Commo nwealth as provided in § 37.2-804 from funds appropriated to reimburse expenses incurred in the involuntary admission process. However, this provision shall not be construed to prohibit the direct payment of an attorneys fee by the person or an in terested person on his behalf, which fee shall be subject to the review and approval of the court. D. Following t he appointment of an attorney pursuant to subsection C, the court shall schedule an expedited hearing of the matter. The court shall notify the person for whom treatment is sought, his next of kin, if known, the petitioner, and their respective counsel o f the date and time for the hearing. In scheduling the hearing, the court shall take into account the type and severity of the alleged physical or mental disorder, as well as the need to provide the persons attorney with sufficient time to adequately prepare his clients case. E. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsections B and D regarding delivery or service of the petition and notice of the hearing to the next of kin of any person for whom consent to treatment is sought, if the person is a patient in any hospital, including a hospital licensed by the Department of Health pursuant to § 32.1-123 or an individual receiving services in any facility operated by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and such person has no known guardian or legally authorized repr esentative, at the time the petition is filed, the court may dispense with the requirement of any notice to the next of kin. If treatment is necessary to prevent imminent or irreversible harm, the court in its discretion may dispense with the requirement of providing notice. This subsection shall not be construed to interfere with any decision made pursuant to the Health Care Decisions Act (§ 54.1-2981 et seq.). F. Prior to th e hearing, the attorney shall investigate the risks and benefits of the treatment decision for which authorization is sought and of alternatives to the proposed decision. The attorney shall make a reasonable effort to inform the person of this informatio n and to ascertain the persons religious beliefs and basic values and the views and preferences of the persons next of kin. A health care provider shall disclose or make available to the attorney, upon request, any information, records, and repor ts concerning the person that the attorney determines necessary to perform his duties under this section. Evidence presented at the hearing may be submitted by affidavit in the absence of objection by the person for whom treatment is sought, the petition er, either of their respective counsel, or by any other interested party. G. Prior to au thorizing treatment pursuant to this section, the court shall find: 1. That there is no available person with legal authority under Article 8 (§ 54.1-2981 et seq.) of Chapter 29 of Title 54.1, under the regulations promulgated pursuant to § 37.2-400, or under other applicable law to authorize the proposed treatment. A pers on who would have legal authority to authorize the proposed treatment shall be deemed to be unavailable if such person (i) cannot be contacted within a reasonable period of time in light of the immediacy of the need for treatment for the person for whom treatment is sought, (ii) is incapable of making an informed decision, or (iii) is unable or unwilling to make a decision regarding authorization of the proposed treatment or to serve as the legally authorized representative of the person for whom treatm ent is sought; 2. That the person for whom treatment is sought is incapable of making an informed decision regarding treatment or is physically or mentally incapable of communicating such a decision; 3. That the person who is the subject of the petition is unlikely to become capable of making an informed decision or of communicating an informed decision within the time required for de cision; and 4. That the proposed treatment is in the best interest of the person and is medically and ethically appropriate with respect to (i) the medical diagnosis and prognosis and (ii) any other information provided by the attending physician of the person for whom treatment is sought. However, the court shall not authorize a proposed treatment that is contrary to the provisions of an advance directive executed by the person pursuant to § 54. 1-2983 or is proven by a preponderance of the evidence to be contrary to the persons religious beliefs or basic values or to specific preferences stated by the person before becoming incapable of making an informed decision, unless the treatment is n ecessary to prevent death or a serious irreversible condition. The court shall take into consideration the right of the person to rely on nonmedical, remedial treatment in the practice of religion in lieu of medical treatment. H. Any order a uthorizing treatment pursuant to subsection A shall describe any treatment authorized and may authorize generally such related examinations, tests, or services as the court may determine to be reasonably related to the treatment authorized. Treatment aut horized by such order may include palliative care as defined in § 32.1-162.1, if appropriate. The order shall require the treating physician to review and document the appropriateness of the continued administration of antipsychotic medications not le ss frequently than every 30 days. The order shall require the treating physician or other service provider to report to the court and the persons attorney any change in the persons condition resulting in probable restoration or development of the persons capacity to make and to communicate an informed decision prior to completion of any authorized treatment and related services. The order may further require the treating physician or other service provider to report to the court and the pers ons attorney any change in circumstances regarding any authorized treatment or related services that may indicate that such authorization is no longer in the persons best interests. Upon receipt of such report or upon the petition of any interest ed party, the court may enter an order withdrawing or modifying its prior authorization as it deems appropriate. Any petition or order under this section may be orally presented or entered, provided a written order shall be subsequently executed. I. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of a treating physician or other service provider to administer treatment without judicial authorization when necessary to stabilize the condition of the person for whom treatment is sought in an eme rgency.

Based upon the opinion of a licensed physician that an adult person is incapable of making an informed decision as a result of a physical injury or illness and that the medical standard of care indicates that testing, observation, and treatment are necessary to pre vent imminent and irreversible harm, a magistrate may issue, for good cause shown, an emergency custody order for the adult person to be taken into custody and transported to a hospital emergency room for testing, observation, or treatment. B. Prior to is suance of an emergency custody order pursuant to this section, the magistrate shall ascertain that there is no legally authorized person available to give consent to necessary treatment for the adult person and that the adult person (i) is incapable of m aking an informed decision regarding obtaining necessary treatment, (ii) has refused transport to obtain such necessary treatment, (iii) has indicated an intention to resist such transport, and (iv) is unlikely to become capable of making an informed dec ision regarding obtaining necessary treatment within the time required for such decision. C. An opinion by the licensed physician that an adult person is incapable of making an informed decision as a result of physical injury or illness shall only be rendered after the licensed physician has communicated electronically or personally with the emergency medi cal services personnel on the scene and has attempted to communicate electronically or personally with the adult person to obtain information and medical data concerning the cause of the adult persons incapacity, has attempted to obtain consent from the adult person, and has failed to obtain consent. D. If there is a change in the persons condition, the emergency medical services personnel shall contact the licensed physician. If at any time the licensed physician determines that a person subject to an order under this subsection has become capable of making a nd communicating an informed decision, the physician shall rely on the persons decision on whether to consent to further observation, testing, or treatment. E. Upon reachi ng the emergency room, the person shall be evaluated by a licensed physician. If the physician determines that the person meets the requirements of § 37.2-1104, the physician may apply for a temporary detention order pursuant to that that section. If the physician determines that the person does not meet the requirements of § 37.2-1104, the person shall be released from custody immediately. The person shall remain in custody until this evaluation is performed, but in no event shall the period of c ustody under this section exceed four hours. F. The law-enf orcement officer may lawfully go to or be sent beyond the territorial limits of the county, city or town in which he serves to any point in the Commonwealth for the purpose of executing an emergency custody order pursuant to this section. Nothing herein shall preclude a law-enforcement officer from obtaining emergency medical treatment or further medical evaluation at any time for a person in his custody as provided in this section. G. If an emerg ency custody order is not executed within four hours of its issuance, the order shall be void and shall be returned unexecuted to the office of the clerk of the issuing court or, if such office is not open, to any magistrate serving the jurisdiction of t he issuing court.

The court o r, if the court is unavailable, a magistrate serving the jurisdiction where the respondent is located may, with the advice of a licensed physician who has attempted to obtain informed consent of an adult person to treatment of a mental or physical condit ion, issue an order authorizing temporary detention of the adult person in a hospital emergency department or other appropriate facility for testing, observation, or treatment upon a finding that (i) probable cause exists to believe the person is incapab le of making or communicating an informed decision regarding treatment of a physical or mental condition due to a mental or physical condition and (ii) the medical standard of care calls for observation, testing, or treatment within the next 24 hours to prevent injury, disability, death, or other harm to the person resulting from such mental or physical condition.
