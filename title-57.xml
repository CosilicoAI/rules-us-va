that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishment, or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to b eget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who, being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who, being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infal lible, and as such endeavoring to impose them on others, have established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions whi ch he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical, and even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards which, proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremi tting labors, for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometry; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upo n him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which, in common with his fellow citizens, he has a na tural right; that it tends only to corrupt the principles of that religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honors and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform to it; that though, indeed, those are crimina l who do not withstand such temptation, yet, neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on sup position of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he, being of course judge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rules of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only a s they shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere, when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail, if left to herself; that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate; errors ceasing to be dan gerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them: Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enfor ced, restrained, molested or burthened, in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and th at the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge or affect their civil capacities. And though we well know that this Assembly, elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding as semblies constituted with powers equal to our own, and that, therefore, to declare this act to be irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind; and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present, or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right. History History.

B. No governme nt entity shall substantially burden a persons free exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless it demonstrates that application of the burden to the person is (i) essential to further a compelling gove rnmental interest and (ii) the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest. C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to (i) authorize any government entity to burden any religious belief or (ii) affect, interpret or in any way address those portions of Article 1, Section 16 of the Constitution of Virginia, the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom (§ 57-1 et seq.), and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution that prohibit laws respecting the establishment of religion.

A person wh ose religious exercise has been burdened by government in violation of this section may assert that violation as a claim or defense in any judicial or administrative proceeding and may obtain declaratory and injunctive relief from a circuit court, but sh all not obtain monetary damages. A person who prevails in any proceeding to enforce this section against a government entity may recover his reasonable costs and attorney fees. The provisions of this subsection relating to attorney fees shall not apply t o criminal prosecutions. E.

[Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. History and effect of statute.  The Statute of Charitable Trusts, St. 43 Elizabeth, c. 4, passed to make good conveyances to pious uses, not otherwise good, and relating to the administration of such trusts by the courts of equity, was repealed by the legislature of Virginia in 1792. See Fitzgerald v. Doggett's Ex'r, 155 Va. 112, 155 S.E. 129, 1930 Va. LEXIS 150 (1930). The history of this section begins with Acts 1839, p. 11. Triplett v. Trotter, 169 Va. 440, 193 S.E. 514, 1937 Va. LEXIS 189 (1937). By the act of April 2, 1839, concerning devises and bequests made to schools, etc., and the Act of 1840-41, Code, c. 80, § 2, a devise to a school which was vo id at common law was made valid, though it had not been reported to the General Assembly, as directed by § 7 of said first act, and no act had been passed incorporating the institution. Kelly v. Love's Adm'r, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 124, 1870 Va. LEXIS 4 ( 1870). By the 2nd section, c. 80, of the Code of 1860, the legislature relinquished the right, previously reserved to the State, of determining whether it would or would not accept the devises and bequests for literary purposes made since 1839; and declared its pleasure to be, that all such devises and bequests should be valid, except those only which had become void by the provisions of the 7th section of that act. Thi s legislation operated as a general act of acceptance in all cases, and instead of a special acceptance in each particular case. The heirs could not complain of such legislation, as it took nothing from them; their rights having been already divested und er the provisions of the 1st section of the act of 1839. Kelly v. Love's Adm'r, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 124, 1870 Va. LEXIS 4 (1870). This section as amended in 1914 validated indefinite charitable bequests or devises, whether made to a body corporate or unincorporated, or to a natural person. F itzgerald v. Doggett's Ex'r, 155 Va. 112, 155 S.E. 129, 1930 Va. LEXIS 150 (1930). The Maryland case of Fletcher v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., 193 Md. 400, 67 A.2d 386 (1949), stands for the proposition that the general validating act of 1914 est ablished the doctrine of judicial cy pres in Virginia. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963). Virginia would, in any appropriate case pertaining to a trust coming into existence after 1914, apply judicial cy pres. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434, 1963 U.S . Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963). There was a time when charitable bequests were not valid. But this section and others ha ve given life to such bequests. The attainment of this desired end was in the power of the legislature. Owens v. Bank of Glade Spring, 195 Va. 1138, 81 S.E.2d 565, 1954 Va. LEXIS 192 (1954). The language of the statute is clear, plain and unambiguous. Moore v. Downham, 166 Va. 77 , 184 S.E. 199, 1936 Va. LEXIS 166 (1936). It clearly validates and makes enforceable all gifts for charitable uses, subject to cer tain restrictions therein contained. Trustees of Gen. Ass'y of Presbyterian Church v. Guthrie, 86 Va. 125, 10 S.E. 318, 1889 Va. LEXIS 18 (1889). Under this section every devise made for charitable purposes is just as valid as a devise made to a certain natural person or for his benefit. Moore v. Downham, 1 66 Va. 77, 184 S.E. 199, 1936 Va. LEXIS 166 (1936); Thomas v. Bryant, 185 Va. 845, 40 S.E.2d 487, 1946 Va. LEXIS 258 (1946). On its face this section has no effect other than to save some charitable trusts which would otherwise fail because the trustee is not a certain, natural person. Smith v. Moore, 343 F.2d 594, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6158 (4th Cir. 1965). The legislature did not exceed its power in making charitable bequests valid by the enac tment of this and related sections. SeeRoller v. Shaver, 178 Va. 467, 17 S.E.2d 419, 1941 Va. LEXIS 182 (1941). Religious donations are not affected by this section, but are controlled by the sections of the Code specifically made applicable to them. Moore v. Perkins, 169 Va. 175, 192 S.E. 806, 1937 Va. LEXIS 165 (1937). This section deals primarily with charitable trusts for literary and educational purposes. It could hardly be the intent of the legislature, in the use of the wor ds charitable purposes, as set forth in this section, to remove all restrictions upon trusts for religious purposes without specifically amending other sections of the Code dealing with that subject. Moore v. Perkins, 169 Va. 175, 192 S.E. 806, 1 937 Va. LEXIS 165 (1937). This section and former §§ 55-27 through 55-29 must be considered in the light of § 26-54, which was intended to broaden the scope of charitable trusts. Moore v. Downham, 166 Va. 77, 184 S.E. 199, 1936 Va. LEXIS 166 (1936) (see annotations in Uniform Trust Code, §§ 55-541.01 et seq.). Charitable trusts may be of indefinite duration.  Charitable trusts of indefinite duration for vaguely-defined beneficiaries are enforceable in Virginia under this section. Beach v. Gilbert, 133 F.2d 50, 77 U.S. App. D.C. 117, 1943 U.S. App. LEXIS 3749 (D.C. Cir. 1943) (see now Uniform Trust Code, § 55-541.01 et seq.). There is no limitation on the amount of personal or real property that may be acquired f or charitable trusts for educational or literary purposes, or for any other charitable purpose within the purview of this section. Moore v. Perkins, 169 Va. 175, 192 S.E. 806, 1937 Va. LEXIS 165 (1937). Meaning of persons within this State.  This former provision of this section, validating a gift for the education of white and colored persons within this State, meant that the institution itse lf should be located in Virginia, and not that the beneficiaries of such gift should be confined to residents of this State. Triplett v. Trotter, 169 Va. 440, 193 S.E. 514, 1937 Va. LEXIS 189 (1937). Devise to trustee to be disposed of for charitable purposes is valid.  Where the residuary clause devised the residue of testatrix property to the executor and trustee, to be disposed of for charitable purposes to such associatio ns, corporations or individuals as he deemed proper, it was held that the devise was made valid by this section. The devise was not invalid because of the contingency that the trustee might refuse to act, since former §§ 55-27 through 55-29 and 26- 54 [see now Uniform Trust Code, § 55-541.01 et seq.] provide for the substitution of trustees where the original ones fail or refuse to act. Moore v. Downham, 166 Va. 77, 184 S.E. 199, 1936 Va. LEXIS 166 (1936). And gift to worthy and dependent young men is valid.  A gift by will to establish and maintain a college for the education of such worthy and dependent young men as may be selected by a board of trustees desi gnated or provided for in the will, and as the income of the trust will permit, is on its face a valid gift for educational purposes under this section. Triplett v. Trotter, 169 Va. 440, 193 S.E. 514, 1937 Va. LEXIS 189 (1937). A gift of trust funds to some strictly charitable organization of continued and proven service, to be selected by the trustee, is sufficiently definite and certain as to purpose. McClure v. Carter, 202 Va. 191, 116 S.E.2d 260, 1960 Va. LEXIS 205 (1960). Unincorporated association named as trustee.  In the instant case testatrix clearly expressed the purpose she had in view, namely, the creating of a trust for the benefit of a certain class of old, or enfeebl ed, preachers. She believed that she had indicated a trustee, but failed to do so, because she did not in the will clearly identify the party intended, and if the witnesses who testified are correct that she named the Conference Board of Finance, an unin corporated societ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_57-7"><akn:num>§ 57-7</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1993, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>370.

Text Every conveyance or transfer of real or personal property, whether inter vivos or by will, which is made to or for the benefit of any church, church diocese, religious congregation or religious society, whether by purchase or gift, shall be valid. Any such conveyance or transfer that fails to state a specific purpose shall be used for the religious and benevolent purposes of the church, church diocese, religious congregation or religious society as determined appropriate by the authorities which, under its rules or usages, have charge of the administration of the temporalities thereof. No such conveyance or transfer shall fail or be declared void for insufficient designation of the beneficiaries in any case where the church, church diocese, religious congregation or religious society has lawful trustees in existence, is capable of securing the appointment of lawful trustees upon application as prescribed in § 57-8, is incorporated, has created a corporation pursuant to § 57-16.1, or has ecclesi astical officers pursuant to the provisions of § 57-16.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former §§ 57-7 and 57-12. Limits on property held by church trustees under former § 57-12.  For construction and application of former § 57-12, which until its repeal in 2003 limited the amount of real and personal property that could be held by churc h trustees, see Moore v. Perkins, 169 Va. 175, 192 S.E. 806, 1937 Va. LEXIS 165 (1937); Maguire v. Loyd, 193 Va. 138, 67 S.E.2d 885, 1951 Va. LEXIS 248 (1951); Owens v. Bank of Glade Spring, 195 Va. 1138, 81 S.E.2d 565, 1954 Va. LEXIS 192 (1954); Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, 214 Va. 500, 201 S.E.2d 752, 1974 Va. LEXIS 167 (1974); Falwell v. City of Lynchburg, 198 F. Supp. 2d 765, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1939 (W.D. Va. 2002). History of section.  See Maguire v. Loyd, 193 Va. 138, 67 S.E.2d 885, 1951 Va. LEXIS 248 (1951). Religious cong regations used in limited sense.  This section relates only to conveyances, devises and dedications of property for the use of religious congregations, in the limited and local sense of th e term, viz.: for the members of those religious congregations, who, from their residence at or near the place of public worship, may be expected to use it for such purpose. Brooke v. Shacklett, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 301, 1856 Va. LEXIS 18 (1856). This section validates conveyances, devises and dedications of land for specified religious purposes. Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, 214 Va. 500, 201 S.E.2d 752, 1974 Va. LEXIS 167 (1974). The words church, religious congregation, or religious society, mean a local unincorporated body, and, hence, the provisions of the section do not apply to the residuary clause in a will which gave to a trustee all testatrixs remaining money with a provision that the interest be paid by the trustee to the Met hodist Church South for missionary work. Moore v. Perkins, 169 Va. 175, 192 S.E. 806, 1937 Va. LEXIS 165 (1937) (see Maguire v. Loyd, 193 Va. 138, 67 S.E.2d 885 (1951), affd on rehearing, 194 Va. 266, 72 S.E.2d 631 (1952)). The words church, religious congregation, or religious society, as used in this section, are construed to mean the local congregation rath er than a larger hierarchical body. Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, 214 Va. 500, 201 S.E.2d 752, 1974 Va. LEXIS 167 (1974). Scope of denominational trusts broadened.  Trial court erred by holding that § 57-7.1 did not change the policy in Virginia that held that church property could be held by trustees for the local congreg ation, not for the general church as § 57-7.1 validated conveyances and transfers of both real and personal property that were made to or for the benefit of any church, church diocese, religious congregation or religious society; the Virginia general assembly intended to broaden the scope of denominational trusts to include all real and personal property that was conveyed or transferred to or for the benefit of a hierarchical church. Falls Church v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, 2 85 Va. 651, 740 S.E.2d 530, 2013 Va. LEXIS 48 (2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1002, 134 S. Ct. 1513, 188 L. Ed. 2d 449, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 1901 (2014). Section 57-7.1 changes the policy in Virginia that held that church property could be held by trustees for the local congregation, not for the general church as § 57-7.1 validates conveyances and transfers of both real and personal property that are made to or for the benefit of any church, church diocese, religious congregation or religious society; the Virginia general assembly intends § 57-7.1 to broade n the scope of denominational trusts to include all real and personal property that is conveyed or transferred to or for the benefit of a hierarchical church. Falls Church v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, 285 Va. 651, 740 S.E.2d 530, 2013 Va. LEXIS 48 (2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1002, 134 S. Ct. 1513, 188 L. Ed. 2d 449, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 1901 (2014). Constr uctive trust imposed on congregations property.  Equity dictated that a constructive trust be imposed on the property of a congregation for the benefit of a diocese and a national church as: (1) the Dennis Canon codified in explicit terms a trust relationship that had been implicit in the relationship between local parishes and dioceses since the founding of the national church; (2) the congregation had affirmatively assented to the constitution and canons of t he national church and agreed to be benefited and bound by every rule and canon that was to be framed by any convention acting under the churchs constitution; (3) the congregation, the diocese and the national church intended, agreed and expected tha t the property would be held in trust by the congregation as trustee for the benefit of the national church; and (4) the congregations attempt to withdraw from the diocese and the national church and still maintain the property violated its fiduciary obligation to the church. Falls Church v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, 285 Va. 651, 740 S.E.2d 530, 2013 Va. LEXIS 48 (2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1002, 134 S. Ct. 1513, 188 L. Ed. 2d 449, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 1901 (2014). Constructive trust was imposed under § 57-10 on the personal property of a congregation, including any contributions or donations or payments of membership due s, in favor of a diocese and a national church as § 57-7.1 explicitly applied to every conveyance or transfer of real or personal property; the fact that the national church and the diocese granted the congregation discretion as to how it distributed any contributions or donations it received did not change the fact that such contributions and donations were held in trust for the benefit of the diocese and the national church. The congregations evidence of its vestrys statement was insufficie nt to show the donative intent of the congregants. Falls Church v. Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, 285 Va. 651, 740 S.E.2d 530, 2013 Va. LEXIS 48 (2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1002, 134 S. Ct. 1513, 188 L. Ed. 2d 449, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 1 901 (2014). Mode of transfer.  This section clearly covers any mode of voluntary transfer of personal estate, whether inter vivos or testamentary. No limitation or restriction as to the manner of effecting such voluntary transfers is in any way indicated by this section. Maguire v. Loyd, 193 Va. 138, 67 S.E.2d 885, 1951 Va. LEXIS 248 (1951). This section places no limitation upon gifts, grants, and bequests of personal property to churches, except as provided in § 57-12 (repealed in 2003). Owens v. Bank of Glade Spring, 195 Va. 1138, 81 S.E.2d 565, 1954 Va. LEXIS 192 (1954). Will need not show use and purpose of gift.  A bequest to a church is not invalid because the will does not show the use and purpose of the gift. This section takes care of the situation when the object and purpose of a gift to a religious congregation are indefinite or uncertain. Owens v. Bank of Glade Spring, 195 Va. 1138, 81 S.E.2d 565, 1954 Va. LEXIS 192 (1954). Thus, no implied trusts for supercongregational churches may be upheld.  As express trusts for supercongregational churches are invalid under Virginia law no implied trusts for such denominations may be upheld.

Trustees have mere legal title with no power to manage or control.  Trustees of religious societies appointed under this section merely hold the legal title of the real estate conveyed for the use of a religious society at whose i nstance they have been appointed, and have no power over the management, control and acquisition thereof of their own volition. Rohr v. City of Richmond, 20 Va. L. Reg. 260 (1914). Jurisdiction of court in summary proceedings under this section.  In summary proceedings under this section, circuit courts have jurisdiction to appoint, change, and remove church trustees, but not to determine how they shall ad minister their trust. Wade v. Hancock, 76 Va. 620, 1882 Va. LEXIS 64 (1882). Relationship to bankruptcy.  Debtors Chapter 13 plan could not be approved where the plan proposed to pay a secured claim on real property that, pursuant to § 57-8, the debtor held exc lusively for the use and benefit of his church, and the plan proposed to pay debt of other co-debtors (the other church trustees) who would contribute nothing. Morris v. Williams, 338 Bankr. 678, 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 2426 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2004). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Creation of express trust.  Deed conveying the property at issue to trustees did not create an express trust for the benefit of a church diocese where, under former § 57-7, the only conve yances that were valid for the use or benefit of a diocese were conveyances for a clergy residence, and the property was not such a residence.

If a divisi on has heretofore occurred or shall hereafter occur in a church or religious society, to which any such congregation whose property is held by trustees is attached, the members of such congregation over 18 years of age may, by a vote of a majority of the whole number, determine to which branch of the church or society such congregation shall thereafter belong. Such determination shall be reported to the circuit court of the county or city, wherein the property held in trust for such congregation or the greater part thereof is; and if the determination be approved by the court, it shall be so entered in the courts civil order book, and shall be conclusive as to the title to and control of any property held in trust for such congregation, and be resp ected and enforced accordingly in all of the courts of the Commonwealth. B. If a divisi on has heretofore occurred or shall hereafter occur in a congregation whose property is held by trustees which, in its organization and government, is a church or society entirely independent of any other church or general society, a majority of the memb ers of such congregation, entitled to vote by its constitution as existing at the time of the division, or where it has no written constitution, entitled to vote by its ordinary practice or custom, may decide the right, title, and control of all property held in trust for such congregation.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Insofar as this section alters the terms of the trust and impairs the obligation of the contract, it is unconstitutional. Finley v. Brent, 87 Va. 103, 12 S.E. 228 , 1890 Va. LEXIS 98 (1890). Purpose of statute.  Clear purpose of subsection A of § 57-9 is to provide a method by which the disputed title to and control of any property held in trust for a congregation may be conclusively determined. The church or religious society referenced in the statute in which a division has occurred contemplates one that has an interest in the property for which the title and control is at issue. Protestant Episcopal Church v. Truro Church, 280 Va. 6, 694 S.E.2d 555, 2010 Va. LEXIS 62 (2010). Construction.  Proper construction of the language of subsection A of § 57-9 must take into account the interrelationship of the words being considered. Thus, in order to det ermine whether a congregation is entitled to petition for the relief afforded by subsection A, as a prerequisite the congregation must show that there has been a division in a church or religious society to which any such congregation is attached. Protes tant Episcopal Church v. Truro Church, 280 Va. 6, 694 S.E.2d 555, 2010 Va. LEXIS 62 (2010). Authority afforded by subsection A permitting congregations to vote in order to determine to which branch of a church or religious society such congregation shall thereafter belong must be construed within the context of the first phrase of the statute. That is, the branch of the church or society to which the congregation votes to belong must be a branch of the church or religious society to which the petitionin g congregation is attached prior to the division. Protestant Episcopal Church v. Truro Church, 280 Va. 6, 694 S.E.2d 555, 2010 Va. LEXIS 62 (2010). Proper construction of subsection A required a petitioning congregation to establish both that there had been a division within the church or religious society to which it was attached and that subsequent to that division the congregation sought to affiliate with a branch derived from that same church or religious society. Protestant Episcopal Church v. Truro Church, 280 Va. 6, 694 S.E.2d 555, 2010 Va. LEXIS 62 ( 2010). Application of first and third s entences.  The first sentence of this section relates to churches, such as Episcopal and Presbyterian churches, that are subject to control by supercongregational bodies. Th e third sentence of this section relates to the other category, autonomous or entirely independent churches. Baber v. Caldwell, 207 Va. 694, 152 S.E.2d 23, 1967 Va. LEXIS 125 (1967). Interrelation or cooperation with a missionary society and a district convention does not destroy or even impair a churchs independence under the third sentence of this section. Baber v. Caldwell, 207 Va. 694, 152 S.E.2d 23, 1967 Va. LEXIS 125 (1967). Inapplicable to congregations dispute with hierarchical church.  Subsection A of § 57-9 was inapplicable to congregations dispute with a hierarchical church and a diocese because, while there was an alternative polity to which the congregations could and did attach themselves, within the meaning of § 57-9, that polity was not a branch of either the church or the diocese to which congregations could vote to join. Protestant Episcopal Church v. Truro Church, 28 0 Va. 6, 694 S.E.2d 555, 2010 Va. LEXIS 62 (2010). This section recognizes a distinction between an autonomous congregation and one which i s part of a supercongregational or hierarchical denomination in providing for the determination of property rights upon a division of a church or congregation. Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, 214 Va. 500, 201 S.E.2d 752, 1974 Va. LEXIS 167 (1974). Division of church.  Majority vote by one or more congregations to separate from a hierarchical church under subsection A of § 57-9 would not alone be sufficient to establish the f act of a division. Protestant Episcopal Church v. Truro Church, 280 Va. 6, 694 S.E.2d 555, 2010 Va. LEXIS 62 (2010). In determining the proper party to approve a property transfer, the trial court must loo k to the organizational structure of the church. Norfolk Presbytery v. Bollinger, 214 Va. 500, 201 S.E.2d 752, 1974 Va. LEXIS 167 (1974). A majority of the members of a divided congregation has the right to control the use of the church property if the church, in its organization and government, is a church or society entirely independent of any other church or general society. Green v. Lewis, 221 Va. 547, 272 S.E.2d 181, 1980 Va. LEXIS 275 (1980). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Constitutionality.  Provisions of subsection A of § 57-9 did not violate the Free Exercise Clause as neither the historical context nor the legislative history indicated that § 57-9 was motivated by any type of hostility to religion in general. Because the General Assembly was motivated by a non-discriminatory purpose  resolving property disputes quickly and peacefully when a denomination divided  § 57-9 was neutral and generally applicable. In re Multi-Circuit Episcopal Church Prop. Litig., 76 Va. Cir. 894, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 85 (Fairfax County June 27, 2008). Provisions of subsection A of § 57-9 did not violate the Establishment Clause pursuant to the test in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13 (1971), as § 57-9 neither advanced nor inhibited religion. The statute did not differentiate between religious sec ts, but rather differentiated on how property was held; the statute did nothing to indoctrinate anyone in a particular religious belief. In re Multi-Circuit Episcopal Church Prop. Litig., 76 Va. Cir. 894, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 85 (Fairfax County June 27, 2 008). Provisions of subsection A of § 57-9 do not violate the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution; rather, the statute is a statute designed to resolve church pr operty disputes. When a court, pursuant to that statute, makes an adjudication, the courts decision  for or against either party  does not constitute a taking. In re Multi-Circuit Episcopal Church Prop. Litig., 76 Va. Cir. 894, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 85 (Fairfax County June 27, 2008). Congregations filed petitions under § 57-9 against their national denomination and diocese to determine the disposition of church property. Section 57-9 did no t violate the denominations and dioceses rights under the Contract Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, § 10, cl. 1, as the Contracts Clause applied only retrospectively, and the denomination and diocese had no contractual rights to the property at is sue in 1867, when the predecessor to § 57-9 was enacted.

The congregations evidence of its vestrys statement was insufficie nt to show the donative intent of the congregants. Falls Church v.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Disposition of church property held by endowment fund, a corporate entity.  Section 57-10 and, hence, § 57-9, did not control the disposition of a church endowment fund because the funds in question were held by a corporation, the chur ch endowment fund, and that form of corporate ownership took the fund wholly beyond the reach of the churchs subsection A of § 57-9 petition; as a matter of law, the power to appoint directors to a charitable, non-stock, non-profit corporation is not a personal property interest.

The contention was made that no action may be taken by the congregation or the trustees which may encumber the lands or property of the church unless proceedings are instituted in conformity with this section and § 57-15.

The trustee s of such a church diocese, congregation, or church or religious denomination, or society or branch or division thereof, in whom is vested the legal title to such land held for any of the purposes mentioned in § 57-7.1, may file their petition in the circuit court of the county or the city wherein the land, or the greater part thereof held by them as trustees, lies, or before the judge of such court in vacation, asking leave to sell, encumber, extend encumbrances, improve, make a gift of, or exchange the land, or a part thereof, or to settle boundaries between adjoining property by agreement. Upon evidence being produced before the court that it is the wish of the congregation, or church or religious denomination or society, or branch or division th ereof, or the constituted authorities thereof having jurisdiction in the premises, or of the governing body of any church diocese, to sell, exchange, encumber, extend encumbrances, make a gift of, or improve the property or settle boundaries by agreement , the court shall make such order as may be proper, providing for the sale of such land, or a part thereof, or that the same may be exchanged, encumbered, improved, or given as a gift, or that encumbrances thereon be extended, and in case of sale for the proper investment of the proceeds or for the settlement of such boundaries by agreement.When any such religious congregation has become extinct or has ceased to occupy such property as a place of worship, so that it may be regarded as abandoned property , the petition may be filed either by the surviving trustee or trustees, should there be any, or by any one or more members of such congregation, should there be any, or by the religious body which by the laws of the church or denomination to which the c ongregation belongs has the charge or custody of the property, or in which it may be vested by the laws of such church or denomination. The court shall either (i) make a decree for the sale of the property or the settlement of boundaries between adjoinin g properties by agreement, and the disposition of the proceeds in accordance with the laws of the denomination and the printed acts of the church or denomination issued by its authority, embodied in book or pamphlet form, shall be taken and regarded as t he law and acts of such denomination or religious body or (ii) at the request of the surviving trustees and after notice in accordance with law to all necessary parties, make such order as may be proper providing for the gift of such property to any will ing local, state or federal entity or to a willing private, nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under § 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code, provided the court finds that (a) the property includes a historic building or landmark so design ated by the Commonwealth and (b) the purpose of such gift is historical preservation of the property.The court may make such order as to the costs in all these proceedings as may seem proper. B. As an alter native to proceeding under subsection A, (i) the trustees of a church or religious body that incorporate may transfer the title to the real and personal property of the church or religious body held by them to the incorporated church or religious body; a nd (ii) the trustees of a church or religious body that do not incorporate under subdivision (i) hereof may transfer title to the real and personal property of the church or religious body held by them to a corporation created pursuant to § 57-16.1 wi thout, in either instance, obtaining court permission if the transfer is authorized in accordance with the churchs or religious bodys polity. If no petition seeking to set such a transfer aside is filed within one year of the recordation of the t rustees deed transferring title to the real estate, or the date of the transfer of any personal property, it shall be conclusively presumed that the transfer was made in accordance with the churchs or religious bodys polity insofar as a good faith purchaser or lender is concerned.

Heading of the statute, conveyance of church land held in adverse possession, suggests that the statute applies where a churchs possession is adverse to the record title owner of the land; if there were no deed for the land anywhere in the land records, there would be no owner to whom a churchs possession is adverse, and the legislature appears to have contemplated that the land was owned of recor d prior to coming into a churchs possession.

A cemetery may not be established in a city or town, but it may be added to or enlarged without running counter to the inhibition found in the section. Temple v. City of Petersburg, 182 Va. 418, 29 S.E.2d 357, 1944 Va. LEXIS 191 (1944). To enlarge or add to a cemetery is not to establish one within the meaning of this secti on. Temple v. City of Petersburg, 182 Va. 418, 29 S.E.2d 357, 1944 Va. LEXIS 191 (1944). Provision affecting residences does not relate to action of adjacent owner.  The provision in the statute that no cemetery shall be established within 250 yards of a residence affects residences alone and has nothing to do with the right o f action given to an adjacent landowner for damage done thereby. Lambert v. City of Norfolk, 108 Va. 259, 61 S.E. 776, 1908 Va. LEXIS 30 (1908). Meaning of word damaged.  The word damaged in this section is used in the same sense that it is in former § 58 of the Constitution. It means damage done to the corpus of the pro perty, or to some right enjoyed in connection therewith. The mere fact that private property is rendered less desirable for some purposes, or that the establishment of a cemetery will offend the taste or feelings of the adjacent owners, or may affect the sentiments of prospective purchasers and thereby render the property less desirable and even less salable, does not constitute damage within the meaning of the statute.

History History. Code 1919, § 57. § 57-27.1. Access to cemeteries located on private property; cause of action for injunctive relief; applicability. Text A. Owners of p rivate property on which a cemetery or graves are located shall have a duty to allow ingress and egress to the cemetery or graves by (i) family members and descendants of deceased persons buried there; (ii) any cemetery plot owner; and (iii) any person e ngaging in genealogy research, who has given reasonable notice to the owner of record or to the occupant of the property or both. No landowner shall erect a wall, fence or other structure or device that prevents ingress and egress to the cemetery or grav e, unless the wall, fence or other structure or device has a gate or other means by which ingress and egress can be accomplished by persons specified in this subsection. The landowner may designate the frequency of access, hours and duration of the acces s and the access route if no traditional access route is obviously visible by a view of the property. The landowner, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall be immune from liability in any civil suit, claim, action, or cause of ac tion arising out of the access granted pursuant to this section. B. The right o f ingress and egress granted to persons specified in subsection A shall be reasonable and limited to the purposes of visiting graves, maintaining the gravesite or cemetery, or conducting genealogy research. The right of ingress and egress shall not be co nstrued to provide a right to operate motor vehicles on the property for the purpose of accessing a cemetery or gravesite unless there is a road or adequate right-of-way that permits access by a motor vehicle and the owner has given written permission to use the road or right-of-way of necessity. C. Any person entering onto private property to access a gravesite or cemetery shall be responsible for conducting himself in a manner that does not damage the private lands, the cemetery or gravesites and shall be liable to the owner of the property for any damage ca used as a result of his access. D. Any person denied reasonable access under the provisions of this section may bring an action in the circuit court where the property is located to enjoin the owner of the property from denying the person reasonable ingress and egress to the cemetery or gravesite.

History History. 1993, c. 713; 2004, c. 831; 2008, c. 390; 2011, c. 257. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2005, c. 555, cl. 1, as amended by Acts 2006, cc. 105 and 180, provides: § 1. Buchanan County, Dickenson County, and Tazewell County may make appropri ations in such sums and at such times as the governing body of the county deems proper, for maintenance of private roads that provide the sole access to private family cemeteries containing 10 or more graves. Appropriations shall be made for this purpose only when necessary to keep the roads passable by motor vehicle and only when such action is not in conflict with the provisions of § 57-27.1. The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendment by c. 831 rewrote the section, which formerly read: After reasonable notice to the property owner at his last known address, representative s of local historical commissions may enter upon the land of a private or family cemetery for the purpose of conducting official business, unless the property owner objects. The 2008 amendments.

The 2011 amendment by c. 257 added the second sentence in subsection A. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Right to access.  Statute did not give family members and descendants of deceased persons buried in a cemetery the right to cross two tracts of land; the cemetery access statute, g iven its plain meaning, obligates only owners of private property on which a cemetery or graves are located to allow ingress and egress to the cemetery, and there is nothing in the statute that would provide a similar obligation to owners of adjoining pr operties on which the cemetery or graves are not located. Wintergreen Homestead, LLC v. Pennington, 108 Va. Cir. 514, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 519 (Nelson County Oct. 12, 2021), aff'd, 76 Va. App. 69, 880 S.E.2d 30, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 604 (2022). § 57-27.2. Correction of interment errors. Text A. In any inst ance where the operator of a cemetery is informed or becomes aware that it has interred or permitted the interment of a body or cremains in the wrong burial space, it shall disinter the burial container wrongfully interred, identify the burial container, and reinter it in the proper burial space. The cemetery shall give reasonable notice, in advance of the disinterment, to the nearest known next of kin of the deceased person and, if requested, the owner of such burial space. For the purposes of this sec tion, interment means the same as such term is defined in § 54.1-2310. B. At the time specified for the disinterment and reinterment, the cemetery shall permit the nearest known next of kin and, if requested, the owner of such burial space to witness the disinterment and reinterment. C. The cemeter y shall bear all costs of the disinterment and reinterment. History History. 1997, c. 74. § 57-27.3. Authorization for interment. Text A cemetery may accept the notarized signature of one next of kin of a decedent for the purpose of authorizing the interment or entombment, and for erecting a memorial o n the grave, crypt or niche, unless the cemetery is on written notice that there exists a dispute between next of kin over such interment, entombment or memorialization. In the case of such a dispute, the cemetery shall have no obligation to perform the interment, entombment or memorialization until there is agreement of all next of kin, or a court order adjudicating the issue among all necessary parties. For purposes of this section, next of kin means any of the following persons, regardless of the relationship to the decedent: any person designated to make arra ngements for the disposition of the decedents remains upon his death pursuant to § 54.1-2825, the legal spouse, child over 18 years of age, custodial parent, noncustodial parent, siblings over 18 years of age, guardian of minor child, guardian of minor siblings, maternal grandparents, paternal grandparents, maternal siblings over 18 years of age and paternal siblings over 18 years of age, or any other relative in the descending order of blood relationship.

When a grav eyard, wholly or partly within any locality, has been abandoned, is unused and neglected by the owners, or is a previously unidentified graveyard, and such graveyard is necessary, in whole or in part, for public purposes, authorized by the charter of suc h locality, or by the general statutes providing for the government of localities, such locality may acquire title to such burying ground by condemnation proceedings, to be instituted and conducted in the manner and mode prescribed in the statutes provid ing for the exercise of the power of eminent domain by localities. The locality may continue to maintain all or a portion of the burying ground as a graveyard. B. The court t aking jurisdiction of the case may, in its discretion, require the locality to acquire the whole burying ground, in which event the locality may use such part thereof as may be necessary for its purposes and sell the residue. The court, however, shall di rect that the remains interred in such graveyard, if possible so to do, be removed to some repository used and maintained as a cemetery. C. Should any locality, having acquired by any means land on which a previously unidentified or abandoned graveyard is located, including lands acquired in accordance with § 22.1-126.1 for educational purposes, initiate plans to use that land for purposes other tha n to maintain the graveyard, such locality shall, prior to completion of said plans, develop and engage in active public notice and participation regarding efforts to avoid adverse impacts to the graveyard or to remove the remains interred in such gravey ard to an alternative repository. Such public notice and participation shall include, at minimum, publication of at least one notice in a local newspaper of general circulation, notice posted at the site of the graveyard, and notice to and consultation w ith any historic preservation or other such commission, as well as area historical and genealogical societies, and at least one public hearing. The locality shall make a good faith effort to identify and contact living descendants of the persons buried i n the graveyard, if known. In addition, the locality is encouraged to post such notice on the Internet, including appropriate websites and through the use of social media, and to consult with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. Having given al l public comment due consideration, the locality is encouraged first to adjust plans to maintain the graveyard as part of the larger land use plan or, if that is not feasible, to request permission to proceed with removal through the court or through the Virginia Department of Historic Resources should archaeological removal be appropriate. In any event, any removal of remains should be given all due care and respect, as should the selection of and reburial in another cemetery. This requirement for publ ic notice, consultation, consideration of comments, and following due process for removal of human remains shall apply in cases where the presence of a previously unidentified or abandoned graveyard is discovered during either the planning or constructio n phases of a project. D. Any localit y that has acquired by any means land on which a previously unidentified or abandoned cemetery or gravesite of any Virginian held as a slave at the time of his death is located shall notify the Virginia Department of Historic Resources of the location of such cemetery or gravesite. The Department shall record the location of the cemetery or gravesite. A listing of the locations of all previously unidentified or abandoned cemeteries and gravesites of Virginians held as slaves at the time of their deaths that have been provided to the Department shall be maintained by the Department as a public record.

The court shall not enter an order requiring the owners of a graveyard in which a grave or entombment right has never been sold to improve it or place it in a suitable condition. However, after hearing the evidence the court may allow the petitioners, at their own expense, to improve the graveyard and place it in suitable condition and may also require bond to ensure that the petitioners will not injure or remove any t omb, monument, gravestone, grave marker, or vault without having first obtained court approval. Acting pursuant to court order, the petitioners may thereafter enter upon the land and improve the graveyard and place it in suitable condition. The costs i n any case involving a graveyard in which a grave or entombment right has never been sold shall be paid by the petitioners. In any case involving a graveyard in which a grave or entombment right has been sold, the court shall determine whether the owners or petitioners shall pay the costs of improving the graveyard and may require bond to insure against injury or removal of any tomb, monument, gravestone, grave marker, or vault without court approval.

The notice shall request the owners current address, if different from the last known address, and the addresses of the own ers heirs or assigns. If a written response is received from the person to whom notice was sent by the cemetery, the interment rights shall not be deemed abandoned and such rights shall continue for an additional 50 years from the date the response w as received by the cemetery. If notice is returned undeliverable or if no response is received by the cemetery within 30 days after notice was sent, the cemetery shall publish a general notice pursuant to subsection D in a newspaper of general circulatio n (i) in the county or city where the cemetery is located and (ii) in the county or city of the last known address of the record owner of the interment rights. C. In cases in which the last address for the last record owner of an interment right or his heirs, assigns, or next of kin is not known to and cannot reasonably be ascertained by the owner of the cemetery, the cemetery owner shall publish a notice, once a week for fo ur consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city where the cemetery is located pursuant to subsection D. D. Notice requ ired to be published pursuant to subsections B and C shall contain the name and business address of the cemetery and the name of the last record owner of the interment rights and shall state the intent of the cemetery owner to declare the interment right s abandoned.

If a written response is received by the cemetery, the interment rights shall not be deemed abandoned and such rights shall continue for an additional 50 years from the date the response was received by the cemetery. E. If, within 30 years after the interment rights have been deemed abandoned, the record owner, or his heirs or assigns, can prove to the cemetery or a court of competent jurisdiction that he is entitled to the interment rights, the cemetery shall, at no cost, provide a right of interment similar to the one that was abandoned.
