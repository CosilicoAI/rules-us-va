CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Air conditioni ng unit installed in house was good.  Home buyers sufficiently alleged §§ 8.2-314 and 8.2-315 claims against a builder as an air conditioning unit was a good under §§ 8.2-101 and 8 .2-105, even though it had been installed in a house; the Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 warranties extended down the chain of distribution under § 8.2-318. French v. York Int'l Corp., 72 Va. Cir. 538, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 142 (Greene County Feb. 27 , 2007). OFFICIAL COMMENT This Article is a complete revision and modernization of the Uniform Sales Act which was promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1906 and has been adopted in 34 states and Alaska, the District of Columbia and Hawaii. The coverage of the present Article is much more extensive than that of the old Sales Act and extends to the various bodies of case law which have been developed both outside of and under the latter. The arrangement of the present Article is in terms of contract for sale and the various steps of its performance. The legal consequences are stated as following d irectly from the contract and action taken under it without resorting to the idea of when property or title passed or was to pass as being the determining factor. The purpose is to avoid making practical issues between practical men turn upon the locatio n of an intangible something, the passing of which no man can prove by evidence and to substitute for such abstractions proof of words and actions of a tangible character. VIRGINIA COMMENT Since Virginia never adopted the Uniform Sales Act, there is no comprehensive statutory treatment of the law of sales, which would be replaced by this title. At t he most, there are about ten statutory sections and rules of court in Virginia that are related to this title. Virginia sales law is to be found in some 214 sales cases decided by the supreme court of appeals between 1799 and the present. Title 8.2 provides systematization of this case law. The UCC makes only a few changes in sales law as it has been generally understood in Virginia.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-102"><akn:num>§ 8.2-102</akn:num><akn:heading>Scope; certain security and other transactions excluded from this title</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Unless the context otherwise requires, this title applies to transactions in goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an unconditional contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a security transaction nor does this title impair or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers.

CASE NOTES Where contract contemplated both services and goods, since agreement was dominated by la nguage designating a sale of goods, the agreement at issue contained the UCC implied sales warranties. Fournier Furniture, Inc. v. Waltz-Holst Blow Pipe Co., 980 F. Supp. 187, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17381 (W.D. Va. 1997). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Warranty of merchantability does not extend to new home purchases.  Provisions of § 8.2-318 do not extend the warranty of merchantability to a buyer of a new home, as a home buyer does not purchase goods; Title 8.2 of t he Uniform Commercial Code applies only to transactions in goods, under § 8.2-102, and only items that are movable at the time of identification to the contract are goods, under § 8.2-105. Glass v. Trafalgar House Prop., Inc., 58 Va. Cir. 437, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 160 (Loudoun County Apr. 15, 2002). Modular home built in factory as a good.  Modular home built in a factory and moved to a lot for installation is a good for purposes of subdivision 1 of § 8.2-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code . Cash v. GWVA Corp., 74 Va. Cir. 243, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 169 (Fairfax County Oct. 4, 2007). Installation services were not goods.  Home buyers did not sufficiently allege §§ 8.2-314 and 8.2-315 claims against an installer of an air conditioning unit as the buyers alleged that the instal ler installed the unit, and Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 did not apply to services under § 8.2-102. French v. York Int'l Corp., 72 Va. Cir. 538, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 142 (Greene County Feb. 27, 2007). Contract for purchase of motor vehicle for personal use.  Four-year statute of limitations of § 8.2-725 applied to assignees breach of contract claim against a borrower who purchased a motor vehicle for the purcha sers personal use. A motor vehicle was a good under § 8.2-105, and the assignees right to sue arose from contract constituting a transaction in goods under § 8.2-102. Credit Acceptance Corp. v. Coates, 75 Va. Cir. 267, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 3 (Fairfax County June 20, 2008). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 75, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Sec tion 75 has been rephrased. Purposes of changes and new matter: To make it clear that: The Article leaves substantially unaffected the law relating to purchase money security such as conditional sale or chattel mortgage though it regulates the gener al sales aspects of such transactions. Security transaction is used in the same sense as in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).

Distributor entitled to credit for suppliers inventory as seller.  A distributor of petroleum products was a seller where, following the termination of its distributor agreement with an oil company, the distributor had th e right under the agreement to have the value of the oil companys products in its inventory applied against any amount by which it was indebted to the oil company; the distributor had title to its inventory of the oil company products and a contractu al right to exchange that inventory for valuable consideration, that is, a credit against its debt to the oil company. Although somewhat atypical, this arrangement was the very essence of a sales contract, in which no doubt existed that the distributor w as the seller and the oil company the buyer. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Earhart Petroleum, Inc., No. 99-2093, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8674 (4th Cir. May 3, 2000). Hospital considered as seller.  Where a patient filed breach of warranty claims against a manufacturer and a hospital, the action, which was removed based on diversity jurisdiction, was remanded to the state court because the manufacturer failed to demonstrate that there was no reasonable possibility that a state court could find that the non-diverse hospital, which sold an allegedly defective pulse generator to the patient, was liable for brea ch of the implied warranty of merchantability set forth in § 8.2-314; the merchants contention that the hospital was fraudulently joined was rejected because (1) a state court could find that the hospital was a seller; and (2) evidence showing tha t the hospital was engaged in the continued practice of selling spinal cord stimulators to patients supported the allegation that the hospital was a merchant under § 8.2-104.

The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose provided under § 8.2-315 app lies to sales only, and not to bailments or chattel lease transactions. Leake v. Meredith, 221 Va. 14, 267 S.E.2d 93, 1980 Va. LEXIS 209 (1980). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Subsection (1): Section 76, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: The definitions of buyer and seller have been slightly rephrased, the reference in Section 76 of the prior Act to any legal successor in inter est of such person being omitted. The definition of receipt is new. Purposes of changes and new matter: 1. The phrase any legal successor in interest of such person has been eliminated since Section 2-210 of this Article, which limits some types of delegatio n of performance on assignment of a sales contract, makes it clear that not every such successor can be safely included in the definition. In every ordinary case, however, such successors are as of course included. 2. Receipt must be distinguished from delivery particularly in regard to the problems arising out of shipment of goods, whether or not the contract calls for making delivery by way of documents of title, since the seller may frequently fulfill his obligations to deliver even though the buyer may never receive the goods. Delivery with respect to documents of title is defined in Article 1 an d requires transfer of physical delivery. Otherwise the many divergent incidents of delivery are handled incident by incident.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Includes manufacturer and distribu tor.  Both manufacturer of patented synthetic stucco exterior wall cladding product, and distributor to builders, were merchants under subsection 1. Bay Point C ondo. Ass'n v. RML Corp., 57 Va. Cir. 295, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 10 (Norfolk Jan. 28, 2002). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. But see Sections 15 (2), (5), 16(c), 45(2) and 71, Uniform Sales Act, and Sections 35 and 37, Uniform Bills of Lading Act for examples of the policy expressly provided for in this Article. Purposes: 1. This Article assumes that transaction between professionals in a given field require special and clear rules which may not apply to a casual or inexperienced s eller or buyer. It thus adopts a policy of expressly stating rules applicable between merchants and as against a merchant wherever they are needed instead of making them depend upon the circumstances of each case as in the statutes cited above. This section lays the foundation of this policy by defining those who are to be regarded as professionals or merchants and by stating when a transaction is deemed to be between merchants. 2. The term merchant as defined here roots in the law merchant concept of a professional in business. The professional status under the definition may be based upon specialized knowledge as to the goods, specialized knowledge as to business practices, or specialized knowledge as to both and which kind of specialized knowledge may be sufficient to establish the merchant status is indicated by the n ature of the provisions. The special provisions as to merchants appear only in this Article and they are of three kinds. Sections 2-201(2), 2-205, 2-207 and 2-209 dealing with the statute of frauds, firm offers, confirmatory memoranda and modification rest on normal business practices which are or ought to be typical of and familiar to any person in business. For purposes of these sections almost every person in business would, therefore , be deemed to be a merchant under the language who . . . by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices . . . involved in the transaction . . . since the practices involved in the transaction a re non-specialized business practices such as answering mail. In this type of provision, banks or even universities, for example, well may be merchants. But even these sections only apply to a merchant in his mercantile capacity; a lawyer or bank president buying fishing tackle for his own use is not a merchant. On the other hand, in Section 2-314 on the warranty of merchantability, such warranty is implied only if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of tha t kind. Obviously this qualification restricts the implied warranty to a much smaller group than everyone who is engaged in business and requires a professional status as to particular kinds of goods. The exception in Section 2-402(2) for retention o f possession by a merchant-seller falls in the same class; as does Section 2-403(2) on entrusting of possession to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind. A third group of sections includes 2-103(1) (b), which provides that in the case of a merchant good faith includes observance of reasonable commercial sta ndards of fair dealing in the trade; 2-327(1) (c), 2-603 and 2-605, dealing with responsibilities of merchant buyers to follow sellers instructions, etc.; 2-509 on risk of loss, and 2-609 on adequate assurance of performance. This group of sections a pplies to persons who are merchants under either the practices or the goods aspect of the definition of merchant. 3. The or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker . . .  clause of the definition of merchant means that even persons such as universities, for example, can come within the definition of merchant if they have regular purchasing departments or business personnel who are familiar with business practices and who are equipped to take any action required.

(2) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are future goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell. (3) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods. (4) An undivid ed share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight or other measure may to the extent of the sellers interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common. (5) Lot means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract. (6) Commerc ial unit means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a sin gle whole.

CASE NOTES No distinction made betw een new and used goods.  The Code makes absolutely no distinction between new and used goods when defining goods in this section. If the drafters of the Code had intended for this particular section to apply only to new goods, then it would have been simple to have so stated; however, this was not done.

Contract to pave a parking lot was for goods.  Oral agreement whereby a paving contractor was to pave a parking lot at a moving companys place of business was to be construed under the Uniform Commercial C ode as the contract contemplated the delivery and installation of goods, paving, as in essence the moving company sought to buy paving material and the labor aspect, while not insignificant, was incidental to the process. Harrison's Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Princess Anne Paving Corp., 60 Va. Cir. 303, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 266 (Portsmouth Nov. 4, 2002). Air conditioni ng unit installed in house was good.  Home buyers sufficiently alleged §§ 8.2-314 and 8.2-315 claims against a builder as an air conditioning unit was a good under §§ 8.2-101 and 8 .2-105, even though it had been installed in a house; the Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 warranties extended down the chain of distribution under § 8.2-318. French v. York Int'l Corp., 72 Va. Cir. 538, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 142 (Greene County Feb. 27 , 2007). Wall cladding prod uct and application is a good.  Synthetic stucco product and its application as exterior wall cladding, sold under a patent, was a subsection (1) good, not a mere intangible concept, and thus carried a manufacturers warranty applicable to its direct purchaser. Bay Point Condo. Ass'n v. RML Corp., 57 Va. Cir. 295, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 10 (Norfolk Jan. 28, 2002). Modular home built in factory.  Modular home built in a factory and moved to a lot for installation is a good for purposes of subdivision 1 of § 8.2-105 of the Uniform Commercial Code . Cash v. GWVA Corp., 74 Va. Cir. 243, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 169 (Fairfax County Oct. 4, 2007). Motor vehicles f all within the definition of goods.  Motor vehicles fall within the Uniform Commercial Codes definition of a good, § 8.2-105, even if the vehicle is acquired for personal use. Credit Acceptanc e Corp. v. Coates, 75 Va. Cir. 267, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 83 (Fairfax County June 20, 2008). Four-year statute of limitations of § 8.2-725 applied to assignees breach of contract claim against a borrower who purchased a motor vehicle for the borrow ers personal use. A motor vehicle was a good under § 8.2-105, and the assignees right to sue arose from contract constituting a transaction in goods under § 8.2-102. Credit Acceptance Corp. v. Coates, 75 Va. Cir. 267, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 83 (Fairfax County June 20, 2008). Warranty of merchantability does not extend to new home purchases.  Provisions of § 8.2-318 do not extend the warranty of merchantability to a buyer of a new home, as a home buyer does not purchase goods; Title 8.2 of t he Uniform Commercial Code applies only to transactions in goods, under § 8.2-102, and only items that are movable at the time of identification to the contract are goods, under § 8.2-105. Glass v. Trafalgar House Prop., Inc., 58 Va. Cir. 437, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 160 (Loudoun County Apr. 15, 2002). Action barred by statute of limitati on.  Pleas in bar to implied warranty claims were sustained because the companys suit was not filed until almost eight years after the parties entered into the con tracts; neither the general contractor nor the subcontractor were merchants under the Uniform Commercial Code, and to the extent that any other warranty claim against them was made, such claims were barred by the five-year statute of limitations for writ ten contract and the three-year statute of limitations for an unwritten contract. E. Va. Bank Shares, Inc. v. PPI Dissolution Co., 100 Va. Cir. 472, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 225 (Essex County Apr. 15, 2013). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4)Sections 5, 6 and 76, Uniform Sales Act; Subsections (5) and (6)none. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes and new matter: 1. Subsection (1) on goods: The phraseology of the prior uniform statutory provision has been changed so that: The definition of goods is based on the concept of movability and the term chattels personal is not used. It is not intended to deal with things which are not fairly identifiable as movables before the contract is performed. Growing crops are included within the definition of goods since they are frequently intended for sale. The concept of industrial growing crops has been ab andoned, for under modern practices fruit, perennial hay, nursery stock and the like must be brought within the scope of this Article. The young of animals are also included expressly in this definition since they, too, are frequently intended for sale a nd may be contracted for before birth. The period of gestation of domestic animals is such that the provisions of the section on identification can apply as in the case of crops to be planted. The reason of this definition also leads to the inclusion of a wool crop or the like as goods subject to identification under this Article. The exclusion of money in which the price is to be paid from the definition of goods does not mean that foreign currency which is included in the definiti on of money may not be the subject matter of a sales transaction. Goods is intended to cover the sale of money when money is being treated as a commodity but not to include it when money is the medium of payment. As to contracts to sell timber, minerals, or structures to be removed from the land Section 2-107(1) (Goods to be severed from realty: recording) controls. The use of the word fixtures is avoided in view of the diversity of definitions of that term. This Article in including within its scope things attach ed to realty adds the further test that they must be capable of severance without material harm thereto. As between the parties any identified things which fall within that definition become goods upon the making of the contract for sale. Investment securities are expressly excluded from the coverage of this Article. It is not intended by this exclusion, however, to prevent the application of a particular section of this Article by analogy to securities (as was done with the Original Sales Act in Agar v. Orda, 264 N.Y. 248, 190 N.E. 479, 99 A.L.R. 269 (1934)) when the reason of that section makes such application sensible and the situation involved is not covered by the Article of this Act dealing specifically with such securities (Article 8). 2.

A sale consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (§ 8.2-401). A present sale means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract. (2) Goods or c onduct including any part of a performance are conforming or conform to the contract when they ar e in accordance with the obligations under the contract. (3) Termina tion occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On termination all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives. (4) Cancell ation occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of termination except that the cancelling party a lso retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

CASE NOTES Constructive del ivery of portions of a larger mass.  In cases where portions of a larger mass, liquid or solid, are sold, and where the portion sold must be weighed or measured (which, of necessity, includes the ide a of separating them from the general mass), it may be said that the identity and individuality of the part sold must be ascertained by actual separation from its kindred residue, before the sale will be complete to pass the property; or, in other words, before there can be a constructive delivery.

Cont inuation of security interest after authorized sale.  An electrical contractors creditors security interest in electrical supplies to be installed in a school under construction would not continue after dispo sition of the goods to the schools general contractor where, under the terms of the contract between the general contractor and the electrical contractor, there was an authorized sale as defined by this section within the contemplation of the terms o f the security agreement. Graves Constr. Co. v. Rockingham Nat'l Bank, 220 Va. 844, 263 S.E.2d 408, 1980 Va. LEXIS 175 (1980). Cancellation of a plea agreement.  In cancelling defendants plea agreement, the Government retained its remedy for breach under the agreement, pursuant to the U.C.C. [see subsections 3 and 4 of this section] the use of the statements defendant had given pursuant to the agreement. United States v.

Receipt of commission is not a sale of goods.  A sale of goods under Virginia law actually required title to pass from the seller to the buyer; the fact that a distributor made a commission on goods that were sold by the deceased did not make the distributor the seller. Wachovia Bank, N.A., Adm'r of the Estate of Susan Hale Young v. Bourn, No. 7:02CV00773, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 519 (W.D. Va. Jan. 7, 2003). Summary judgment denied.  Where a plaintiff moved for summary judgment as to defendants breach of contract counterclaim, a genuine dispute of material fact precluded summary judgment; the written contract between the parties consisted of a series of terse purchase orders and invoices, and neither the defendants purchase orders nor the plaintiffs invoices made any reference to contaminants in the pallets, much less mention inse ct infestation.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Intended beneficiary.  Window companys demurrer was overruled because a property owner sufficiently carried its burden, for purposes of demurrer, of showing that it was an intended beneficiary of the contracts between the company and a subcontractor; the owner provided a limited warranty between the subcontractor and company that stated the warranty applied to the original homeowner and identified the owner. 139 Riverview, LLC v. Q uaker Window Prods., 90 Va. Cir. 74, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 45 (Norfolk Mar. 2, 2015). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Subsection (1)Section 1 (1) and (2), Uniform Sales Act; Subsection (2)none, but subsection generally continues policy of Sections 11, 44 and 69, Uniform Sales Act; Subsections (3) and (4)none. Changes: Com pletely rewritten. Purposes of changes and new matter: 1. Subsection (1): Contractual for sale is used as a general concept throughout this Article, but the rights of the parties do not vary according to wheth er the transaction is a present sale or a contract to sell unless the Article expressly so provides. 2. Subsection (2): It is in general intended to continue the policy of requiring exact performance by the seller of his obligations as a condition to his right to require acceptance. However, the seller is in part safeguarded against surprise as a result of sudden technicality on the buyers part by the provisions of Section 2-508 on sellers cure of improper tender or delivery. Moreover usage of trade freq uently permits commercial leeways in performance and the language of the agreement itself must be read in the light of such custom or usage and also, prior course of dealing, and in a long term contract, the course of performance. 3. Subsections (3) and (4): These subsections are intended to make clear the distinction carried forward throughout this Article between termination and cancellat ion.

(2) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in subsection (1) or of timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods within this title whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a present sale before severance. (3) The provis ions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third par ties of the buyers rights under the contract for sale.

CASE NOTES A sale of land at auction is not controlled by § 8.2-328 (2), since this title applie s only to transactions relating to goods. Hoffman v. Horton, 212 Va. 565, 186 S.E.2d 79, 1972 Va. LEXIS 209 (1972). Real estate statute of frauds applicable to sale of model home.  Under § 8.2-107(1), the real estate statute of frauds, § 11-2(6), rather than the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) statute of frauds, § 8.2-201(1), applied to a contract for the sale of a model home because the model home was a structure and the alleged contract provided that a buyer was to remove the home from a builders display lot. Although the UCC statute of frauds did not apply, the buyers acti on for breach of an oral contract would have been barred under either statute of frauds because the buyer conceded that there was no writing that qualified under either statute and the buyer did not show that the builder admitted that a contract was made . Baker v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 438 F. Supp. 2d 649, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49028 (W.D. Va. 2006). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: See Section 76, Uniform Sales Act on prior policy; Section 7, Uniform Conditional Sales Act. Purposes: 1. Subsection (1). Notice that this subsection applies only if the minerals or structures are to be severed by the seller. If the buyer is to sever, such transactions are considered contracts affecting land and all problems of the Statute of Frauds and of the recording of land rights apply to them. Therefore, the Statute of Frauds section of this Article does not apply to such contracts though they must c onform to the Statute of Frauds affecting the transfer of interests in land. 2. Subsection (2). Things attached to the realty which can be severed without material harm are goods within this Article regardless of who is to effect t he severance. The word fixtures has been avoided because of the diverse definitions of this term, the test of severance without material harm being substituted. The provision in subsection (3) for recording such contracts is within the purview of this Article since it is a means of preserving the buyers rights under t he contract of sale. 3. The security phases of things attached to or to become attached to realty are dealt with in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9) and it is to be not ed that the definition of goods in that Article differs from the definition of goods in this Article. However, both Articles treat as goods growing crops and also timber to be cut under a contract of severance. Cross references: Point 1: Section 2-201. Point 2: Section 2-105. Point 3: Articles 9 and 9-105. Definitional cross references: Buyer. Section 2-103. Contract. Section 1-201. Contract for sale. Section 2-106. Goods. Section 2-105. Party.

Under Virginia law, when standing timber sold is to be severed within a reasonable time by either the buyer or seller the transaction is not within the statute of frauds provision relating to transfers of interests in land. Va. Code 11-2(6), as interpreted by Hurricane Lumber Co. v. Lowe, 110 Va. 380, 383, 66 S.E. 66 (1909). Since Virginia has no statute of frauds provision relating to the sale of goods, the tran saction need not be reduced to writing. But see Stuart v. Pennis, 91 Va. 688, 689-91, 22 S.E. 509 (1895) (buyer has right to let timber stand for 3 years). The UCC provides that if the seller is to sever at any time, a sale of standing timber is within t he scope of Title 8.2 and thus subject to the statute of frauds provision relating to the sale of goods, § 8.2-201. The net effect of this is to reduce the scope of the statute of frauds provision relating to interests in land when the seller is to se ver but to increase the requirement of a writing by bringing these transactions within the scope of Title 8.2. VIRGINIA COMMENT In Stuart v. Pennis, 91 Va. 688, 691, 22 S.E. 509 (1895), it was said that land includes everything attached to it, a statement that would include growing crops, but this broad definition seems to have been limited by Hurricane Lumber Co. v. Lowe, 110 Va. 380, 383, 66 S.E. 66 (1909). Under § 8.2-107(2) growing crops are defined as goods. See also, Note, CropsPersonalty or Realty in Virginia, 39 Va. L. Rev. 1115 (1953). The UCC makes no provision for legislation such as Virginias timber branding statute, Code 1950, §§ 59.1-103 to 59.1-116, and there appears to be no nec essary conflict between the UCC and this legislation, under § 59.1-113 of which the branding of marketable timber is deemed to be a change of ownership and possession. The statute was applied in Hurley v. Hurley, 110 Va. 31, 65 S.E. 472 (1909). Subsec tion 8.2-107(3) authorizes the recordation of contracts for sale under this section as though they involved transfers of interests in land, so as thereby to give third parties notice. This provision changes the result in Braxton v. Bell, 92 Va. 229, 235, 23 S.E. 289 (1895), holding that the recordation of a contract in regard to personal property, not required by statute to be recorded, as a nullity and not notice to any person.

(3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable (a) if t he goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the sellers business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or (c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (§ 8.2-606).

CASE NOTES Sufficiency of writing.  To avoid the proscription of the statute of frauds, a writing must provide a basis for believing that the offered oral evidence rests on a real transaction. The w riting need not, however, conclusively establish the existence of a contract to survive the scrutiny of the statute of frauds. Barber &amp; Ross Co. v. Lifetime Doors, Inc., 810 F.2d 1276, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 1480 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 823, 108 S. Ct. 86, 98 L. Ed. 2d 48, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 3504 (1987). Language excluding warranties or remedies must be conspicuous.  When a writing which meets the requirements of this section is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement, the terms thereof may not be cont radicted by evidence of any prior agreement. To limit either warranties or remedies, however, the exclusionary language in the writing must be conspicuous. Armco, Inc. v. New Horizon Dev. Co., 229 Va. 561, 331 S.E.2d 456, 1985 Va. LEXIS 232 (1985 ). A writing may satisfy subsection (1) even though it was made before the contract was for med. Wells, Waters &amp; Gases, Inc. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., 19 F.3d 157, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5240 (4th Cir. 1994). Acknowledgment became contract in 10 days when transaction between merchants.  Where the transaction was between merchants, the acknowledgment sent by the seller on receipt of the buyers purchase order became the parties cont ract when the buyer failed to give the seller written notice of any objection within 10 days after receiving the acknowledgment. Armco, Inc. v. New Horizon Dev. Co., 229 Va. 561, 331 S.E.2d 456, 1985 Va. LEXIS 232 (1985). Claim brought by manufacturer against bakery for purchase price of packaging material was not within the statute of frauds where the cellophane wrapping material was manufactured to the size required by bakerys containers, was imprinted with bakerys name and unique artwork, and was completely produced by the seller. Fl owers Baking Co. v. R-P Packaging, Inc., 229 Va. 370, 329 S.E.2d 462, 1985 Va. LEXIS 215 (1985). Where there was a written agreement signed by the president of the company against whom enforcement was sought, subsection (1) of this section did not apply. Wells, Waters &amp; Gases, Inc. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., 19 F.3d 157, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5240 (4th Cir. 1994). Written sales brochures given by seller to purchaser met the signature requirement of th e statute of frauds, because the sellers trademark appeared on the documents, and that was sufficient to authenticate them. Barber &amp; Ross Co. v. Lifetime Doors, Inc., 810 F.2d 1276, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 1480 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 823, 10 8 S. Ct. 86, 98 L. Ed. 2d 48, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 3504 (1987). Written sales brochures given by seller to purchaser stated a sufficiently definite quantity for purposes of the statute of frauds, where they referred to meeting the purchasers needs. Barber &amp; Ross Co. v. Lifetime Doors, Inc., 810 F.2d 1276, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 1480 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 823, 108 S. Ct. 86, 98 L. Ed. 2d 48, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 3504 (1987). Purchase order was confirmatory writing effective against sender.  Purchase order held to be confirmatory writing effective against the sender under subsection (2). The statute of frauds defense was thus unavailable. Howard P. Fo ley Co. v. Phoenix Eng'g &amp; Supply Co., 819 F.2d 60, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 6438 (4th Cir. 1987). No offer and no ac ceptance so no breach of contract.  There was no offer and no acceptance, therefore defendant was not liable for breach of contract; plaintiff and defendant were engaged in contract negotiations rel ated to the potential sale of four cranes, but no offer was made by defendant. The record was devoid of any evidence that would suggest that plaintiff and defendant had a meeting of the minds or an intent to enter into a contract; had it been an offer, i t was not accepted by plaintiff as the document containing the handwritten purchase order number was not signed by plaintiff, and instead, plaintiff sent a separate agreement with materially different terms and conditions. P&amp;J Arcomet v. Perini Corp., No . 1:07cv342, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84343 (E.D. Va. Nov. 14, 2007). Third comment to this section undercuts the claim that an unanswered confirmation is dis positive of both the existence and terms of a contract. The confirmation is merely evidential as an admission. Howard P. Foley Co. v. Phoenix Eng'g &amp; Supply Co., 819 F.2d 60, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 6438 (4th Cir. 1987). Applicability to sale of model home removed from lot.  Under § 8.2-107(1), the real estate statute of frauds, § 11-2(6), rather than the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) statute of frauds, § 8.2-201(1), applied to a contract for the sale of a model home because the model home was a structure and the alleged contract provided that a buyer was to remove the home from a builders display lot. Although the UCC statute of frauds did not apply, the buyers acti on for breach of an oral contract would have been barred under either statute of frauds because the buyer conceded that there was no writing that qualified under either statute and the buyer did not show that the builder admitted that a contract was made . Baker v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 438 F. Supp. 2d 649, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49028 (W.D. Va. 2006). No contract based upon part perfor mance.  Enforcement of any contract, based upon part performance under § 8.2-201(3)(c), extended only to the buyers entryway flooring and not to the purchase and i nstallation of flooring in one of the buyers offices because payment was made by the buyer and accepted by the seller for only the entryway flooring. Delta Star, Inc. v. Michael's Carpet World, 276 Va. 524, 666 S.E.2d 331, 2008 Va. LEXIS 90 (2008). No confirmation of contract.  Pursuant to § 8.2-201(2), an enforceable contract did not exist between the seller and the buyer for the purchase and installation of flooring in one of the bu yers offices because the seller, in submitting the sellers proposals, sought to form a contract, rather than to confirm a contract, and the sellers installation sketches and the buyers credit application similarly did not confirm a contra ct. Additionally, the sellers invoice for an entryway flooring did not serve as confirmation of a contract for the purchase and installation of flooring in an office. Delta Star, Inc. v. Michael's Carpet World, 276 Va. 524, 666 S.E.2d 331, 2008 Va. L EXIS 90 (2008). Material not specially manufactured.  Buyers and sellers unwritten contract for the purchase and installation of flooring materials was not enforceable under § 8.2-201(3)(a) because the flo oring materials were not specifically manufactured for the buyer. Delta Star, Inc. v. Michael's Carpet World, 276 Va. 524, 666 S.E.2d 331, 2008 Va. LEXIS 90 (2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Defendants testimony as to existence of oral agreement provided exception to statute of frauds.  Where landlords sued their tenants for detinue based on an oral agreement for the sale of personalty located at the leased premises, pursuant to § 8.2-201(3)(b ), the tenants statute of frauds defense regarding contracts for the sale of goods failed in the face of their sworn testimony concerning that oral agreement.

CASE NOTES Language excluding warranties or remedies must be conspicuous.  When a writing which meets the requirements of § 8.2-201 is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement, the terms thereof may not be cont radicted by evidence of any prior agreement. To limit either warranties or remedies, however, the exclusionary language in the writing must be conspicuous. Armco, Inc. v. New Horizon Dev. Co., 229 Va. 561, 331 S.E.2d 456, 1985 Va. LEXIS 232 (1985 ). This section expressly allows evidence of course of dealing or usage of trade to explain or supplement terms intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement. Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7419 (4th Cir. 1971); Brunswick Box Co. v. Coutinho, Caro &amp; Co., 617 F.2d 355, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 19582 (4th Cir. 1980). Course of conduct did not establish contract.  Parties course of conduct did not establish the existence of an enforceable contract under § 8.2-202 because the parties course of dealing was relevant only to explain or supplement the terms of the parties contract. The parties course of dealing could not establish the existence of a contract. Delta Star, Inc. v. Michael's Carpet World, 276 Va. 524, 666 S.E.2d 331, 2008 Va. LEXIS 90 (2008). Peculiar meaning o f contract phrases admissible.  Evidence that contract phrases or terms have acquired, by custom in the locality, or by usage of the trade, a peculiar meaning not attached to them in their ordin ary use is admissible even though the phrases or items themselves are unambiguous. Doswell Ltd. Partnership v. VEPCO, 251 Va. 215, 468 S.E.2d 84, 1996 Va. LEXIS 27 (1996). Test of admissibility.  When this section is read in light of § 8.1-205 (4), it is clear that the test of admissibility of evidence of course of dealing or usage of the trade is not w hether the contract appears on its face to be complete in every detail, but whether the proffered evidence of course of dealing and trade usage reasonably can be construed as consistent with the express terms of the agreement. Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7419 (4th Cir. 1971); Brunswick Box Co. v. Coutinho, Caro &amp; Co., 617 F.2d 355, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 19582 (4th Cir. 1980). A finding of ambiguity in a contract is not necessary for the admission of extrinsic evi dence about the usage of the trade and the parties course of dealing. Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7419 (4th Cir. 1971); Brunswick Box Co. v. Coutinho, Caro &amp; Co., 617 F.2d 355, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 19582 ( 4th Cir. 1980). The parol evidence rule would not bar the introduction of extrinsic evidence as to the intentions of the parties in their use of the term F.A.S. Norfolk, Virg inia in their written agreement under which the seller was to supply the buyer with certain stevedoring pallets. Although the term is not in and of itself ambiguous, that conclusion does not preclude the admission of extrinsic evidence, not only abou t the usage of the trade, but the parties course of dealings as well. Brunswick Box Co. v. Coutinho, Caro &amp; Co., 617 F.2d 355, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 19582 (4th Cir. 1980). Course of dealing and trade usage are not synonymous with verbal understandings, terms a nd conditions. This section draws a distinction between supplementing a written contract by consistent additional terms and supplementing it by course of dealing or usage of trade. Columbia Nitrogen Corp. v. Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7419 (4th Cir. 1971). Proof of fraud in procurement of contract.  When fraud in the procurement of the written contract is pleaded, parol evidence tending to prove the fraud is admissible. George Robberecht Seafood, Inc. v. Mait land Bros. Co., 220 Va. 109, 255 S.E.2d 682, 1979 Va. LEXIS 241 (1979). Any express oral warranties were effectively disclaimed.  Even if a seller made express oral warranties prior to the sale of an RV, they were effectively disclaimed under § 8.2-316(1) by a merger clause in the purchas e contract pursuant to § 8.2-202 and thus, the sellers motion to dismiss a claim for breach of express warranties was granted. Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). Basis of bargain oral statements not admissible to contradict warranty disclaimer.  Even if the oral representations made by defendants representative became the basis of the bargain and therefore constituted an express warranty, thos e oral statements would not be admissible to contradict or vary the disclaimer of express warranties clause contained in the integrated agreement between defendant and plaintiff. King Indus., Inc. v. Worlco Data Sys., 736 F. Supp. 114, 1989 U.S. Dist. LE XIS 17041 (E.D. Va. 1989), aff'd, 900 F.2d 253, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 4361 (4th Cir. 1990). Complete and exclusive purch ase agreement.  Where the district court did not explicitly apply the language of subdivision (b), but its reference to a merged contract and to the fact that any liabili ty would have to be discovered within the four corners of the instrument left no doubt that the court found asset purchase agreement to be a complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between buyer and seller, in light of the detai led nature of the contract, including the well-drafted merger clause, there was no error in that conclusion. It followed, therefore, that this section precluded any effort by buyer to establish, through handout distributed at a meeting between buyers and sellers representatives, a warranty relating to the products cavitation capacity, even in the unlikely eventuality that the warranty could be construed as a consistent additional term. Hoover Universal, Inc. v. Brockway Imco, Inc., 809 F.2d 1039, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 1190 (4th Cir. 1987). No violation of parol evidence rule.  District court did not violate the parol evidence rule, where the parties contract assured that a software system would operate correctly and the evidence off ered by the faucet manufacturer related to the ambiguous term correctly as well as to breach of the promise that the installation of a software system perform correctly. SER Solutions, Inc. v. Masco Corp., 103 Fed. Appx. 483, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 13650 (4th Cir. 2004). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. This section definitely rejects: (a) Any assumption that because a writing has been worked out which is final on some matters, it is to be taken as including all the matters agreed upon; (b) The premise that the language used has the meaning attributable to such language by rules of construction existing in the law rather than the meaning which ar ises out of the commercial context in which it was used; and (c) The requirement that a condition precedent to the admissibility of the type of evidence specified in paragraph (a) is an original determination by the court t hat the language used is ambiguous. 2. Paragraph (a) makes admissible evidence of course of dealing, usage of trade and course of performance to explain or supplement the terms of any writing statin g the agreement of the parties in order that the true understanding of the parties as to the agreement may be reached. Such writings are to be read on the assumption that the course of prior dealings between the parties and the usages of trade were taken for granted when the document was phrased. Unless carefully negated they have become an element of the meaning of the words used. Similarly, the course of actual performance by the parties is considered the best indication of what they intended the writ ing to mean. 3. Under paragraph (b) consistent additional terms, not reduced to writing, may be proved unless the court finds that the writing was intended by both parties as a complete and exclusive statement of all the terms. If the additional terms are such that, if agreed upon, they would certainly have been included in the document in the view of the court, then evidence of their alleged making must be kept from the trie r of fact.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provisions: Section 3, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Por tion pertaining to seals rewritten. Purposes of changes: 1. This section makes it clear that every effect of the seal which relates to sealed instruments as such is wiped out insofar as contracts for sale are co ncerned. However, the substantial effects of a seal, except extension of the period of limitations, may be had by appropriate drafting as in the case of firm offers (see Section 2-205). 2. This section leaves untouched any aspects of a seal which relate merely to signatures or to authentication of execution and the like. Thus, a statute providing that a purported signature gives prima facie evidence of its own authenticity or that a signature gives prima facie evidence of consideration is still applicable to sales transactions even though a seal may be held to be a signature within the meaning o f such a statute. Similarly, the authorized affixing of a corporate seal bearing the corporate name to a contractual writing purporting to be made by the corporation may have effect as a signature without any reference to the law of sealed instruments.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Although seals are still recognized in Virginia, there have been no cases involving contracts for the sale of goods, where a question involving a seal has arisen. At least in equity, the seal no longer prevents inquiry as to whether a sealed instrument is supported by consideration. Norris v. Barbour, 188 Va. 723, 737, 51 S.E.2d 334 (1949); Cooper v.

CASE NOTES Parties words and conduct must manifest intention to be bound.  While the UCC has greatly modified the rigors of the common-law rules governing the formation of contracts, it remains a prerequisite that the parties words a nd conduct must manifest an intention to be bound. Flowers Baking Co. v. R-P Packaging, Inc., 229 Va. 370, 329 S.E.2d 462, 1985 Va. LEXIS 215 (1985). Although the parties may make a contract which deliberately leaves material terms open for future determination, no contract results where their words and conduct demonstrate a lack of intention to contract. Such a lack is not remedied by evidence of custom and usage in the trade, or by a written memorandum purporting to confirm oral discussions which did not in themselves amount to an agreement. Flowers Baking C o. v. R-P Packaging, Inc., 229 Va. 370, 329 S.E.2d 462, 1985 Va. LEXIS 215 (1985). Price quotation was not an offer.  Given that price quotations are typically nothing more than invitations to enter into negotiations and that the terms and conditions in a sellers price quotat ion stated that all orders were subject to the sellers acceptance, the sellers quotation was not an offer. Kraft Foods N. Am., Inc. v. Banner Eng'g &amp; Sales, Inc., 446 F. Supp. 2d 551, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61702 (E.D. Va. 2006). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten by this and other sections of this Article. Purposes of changes: Subsection (1) continues without change the basic policy of recognizing any manner of expression of agreement, oral, written or otherwise. The legal effect of suc h an agreement is, of course, qualified by other provisions of this Article. Under subsection (1) appropriate conduct by the parties may be sufficient to establish an agreement. Subsection (2) is directed primarily to the situation where t he interchanged correspondence does not disclose the exact point at which the deal was closed, but the actions of the parties indicate that a binding obligation has been undertaken. Subsection (3) states the principle as to open terms underlying later sections of the Article. If the parties intend to enter into a binding agreement, th is subsection recognizes that agreement as valid in law, despite missing terms, if there is any reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy. The test is not certainty as to what the parties were to do nor as to the exact amount of damages due the plai ntiff. Nor is the fact that one or more terms are left to be agreed upon enough of itself to defeat an otherwise adequate agreement. Rather, commercial standards on the point of indefiniteness are intended to be applied, this Act making provision elsewhere for missing terms needed for performance, open price, remedies and the like. The more terms the parties leave open, the less likely it is that they have intended to conclude a binding agreement, but their actions may be frequently conclusi ve on the matter despite the omissions.

VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC is consistent with the Virginia policy of enforcing apparently indefinite agreements whenever possible by resort to external, objective standards of reaso nableness. Turpin v. Branaman, 190 Va. 818, 828, 58 S.E.2d 63 (1950), held an agreement to be sufficiently definite where one of its terms provided the means and formula by which the quantity could be determined. Cocoa Products Co. of America, Inc. v. Du che, 156 Va. 86, 90, 158 S.E. 719 (1931), held an agreement for the sale of three to five cars of cocoa butter to be sufficiently definite. Smokeless Fuel Co. v. Seaton &amp; Sons, 105 Va. 170, 172-74, 52 S.E. 829 (1906), held a contract for 1,000 to 1,500 t ons of coal to be sufficiently definite. The section is consistent with Chandler v. Kelley, 149 Va. 221, 227-32, 141 S.E. 389 (1928), holding that a contract for sale had been made, an intermediary being an agent for the buyer.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-205"><akn:num>§ 8.2-205</akn:num><akn:heading>Firm offers</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration , during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

Commercial Law, §§ 3, 5-7. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provisions: Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten by this and other sections of this Article. Purposes of changes: 1. This section is intended to modify the former rule which required that firm offers be sustained by consideration in order to bind, and to require inste ad that they must merely be characterized as such and expressed in signed writings. 2. The primary purpose of this section is to give effect to the deliberate intention of a merchant to make a current firm offer binding. The deliberation is shown in the case of an individualized document by the merchants signature to the offer, and in the case of an offer included on a form supplied by the other party to the transaction by the separate signing of the particular clause which contains the offe r. Signed here also includes authentication but the reasonableness of the authentication herein allowed must be determined in the light of the purpose of the section. The circumstances surrounding the signing may justify something less than a for mal signature or initialing but typically the kind of authentication involved here would consist of a minimum of initialing of the clause involved. A handwritten memorandum on the writers letterhead purporting in its terms to confirm a firm o ffer already made would be enough to satisfy this section, although not subscribed, since under the circumstances it could not be considered a memorandum of mere negotiation and it would adequately show its own authenticity. Similarly, an authorized tele gram will suffice, and this is true even though the original draft contained only a typewritten signature. However, despite settled courses of dealing or usages of the trade whereby firm offers are made by oral communication and relied upon without more evidence, such offers remain revocable under this Article since authentication by a writing is the essence of this section. 3. This section is intended to apply to current firm offers and not to long term options, and an outside time limit of three months during which such offe rs remain irrevocable has been set. The three month period during which firm offers remain irrevocable under this section need not be stated by days or by date. If the offer states that it is guaranteed or firm until the happening of a co ntingency which will occur within the three month period, it will remain irrevocable until that event. A promise made for a longer period will operate under this section to bind the offeror only for the first three months of the period but may of course be renewed. If supported by consideration it may continue for as long as the parties specify. This section deals only with the offer which is not supported by consideration. 4. Protection is afforded against the inadvertent signing of a firm offer when contained in a form prepared by the offeree by requiring that such a clause be sepa rately authenticated. If the offer clause is called to the offerors attention and he separately authenticates it, he will be bound; Section 2-302 may operate, however, to prevent an unconscionable result which otherwise would flow from other terms ap pearing in the form. 5. Safeguards are provided to offer relief in the case of material mistake by virtue of the requirement of good faith and the general law of mistake. Cross references: Point 1: Section 1-102.

Moore Elec. Contr actor v. Westinghouse Elec. Supply Co., 221 Va. 745, 273 S.E.2d 553, 1981 Va. LEXIS 204 (1981). Court would not interpret broadly an offer term that made commencement of work a form of acceptance.  While a purchase order was generally an offer, and such an offer could specify the method of acceptance, applying Virginia law, the court would not interpret broa dly an offer term that made commencement of work a form of acceptance; steps a subcontractor took to investigate whether it could fulfill a manufacturers order did not constitute commencement of work and, thus, the subcontractors acknowledgement constituted a counter-offer and the terms of the purchase order did not govern the parties transaction. Roanoke Cement Co., L.L.C. v. Falk Corp., 413 F.3d 431, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 13139 (4th Cir. 2005). Where the language of a distributor agreement unambiguously indicated that it was subjec t to acceptance at the suppliers general office, under subdivision (1)(b) of this section, the supplier could not accept the agreement by performance. Wells, Waters &amp; Gases, Inc. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., 19 F.3d 157, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 5240 (4 th Cir. 1994). Buyers offer accepted by delivery of goods.  Where a buyers purchase order directed that a seller could accept its offer either by express acceptance of the purchase order or by shipment of the goods pur suant to the purchase order and that all shipments should be made F.O.B. destination, the seller accepted the contract when it delivered the goods, whether conforming or nonconforming, to the buyers plant in Virginia; thus, the parties contract w as made in Virginia. Kraft Foods N. Am., Inc. v. Banner Eng'g &amp; Sales, Inc., 446 F. Supp. 2d 551, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61702 (E.D. Va. 2006). Controlling provision.  Plaintiffs contention that defendants forum selection clause was not part of the contract failed because terms and conditions of defendants purchase o rder established the parameters of the contract, and as such, defendants choice of venue provision was the controlling provision in the contract; plaintiffs argument attempting to incorporate its terms and conditions from its supplemental proposa l failed. Power Paragon, Inc. v. Precision Tech. USA, Inc., 605 F. Supp. 2d 722, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108324 (E.D. Va. 2008). Requirements for summary judgment.  Buyer offered no evidence of a requirements contract with the seller, aside from the buyers own unsubstantiated affidavit stating that the seller verbally agr eed to fulfill all of the buyers needs for the contract; however, more than this blanket assertion was required to prevail on a motion for summary judgment. E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Park, 42 Fed. Appx. 605, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 15433 (4th Cir . 2002). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten in this and other sections of this Article. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. Any reasonable manner of acceptance is intended to be regarded as available unless the offeror has made quite clear that it will not be acceptable. Former tech nical rules as to acceptance, such as requiring that telegraphic offers be accepted by telegraphed acceptance, etc., are rejected and a criterion that the acceptance be in any manner and by any medium reasonable under the circumstances, is substi tuted. This section is intended to remain flexible and its applicability to be enlarged as new media of communication develop or as the more time-saving present day media come into general use. 2. Either shipment or a prompt promise to ship is made a proper means of acceptance of an offer looking to current shipment. In accordance with ordinary commercia l understanding the section interprets an order looking to current shipment as allowing acceptance either by actual shipment or by a prompt promise to ship and rejects the artificial theory that only a single mode of acceptance is normally envisaged by a n offer. This is true even though the language of the offer happens to be ship at once or the like. Shipment is here used in the same sense as in Section 2-504; it does not include the beginning of delivery by the sellers own truck or by messenger. But loading on the sellers own truck might be a beginning of performance under subsection (2). 3. The beginning of performance by an offeree can be effective as acceptance so as to bind the offeror only if followed within a reasonable time by notice to the offeror. Such a beginning of performance must unambiguously express the offerees intention to engage himself. For the protection of both parties it is essential that notice follow in due course to constitute acceptance. Nothing in this section howeve r bars the possibility that under the common law performance begun may have an intermediate effect of temporarily barring revocation of the offer, or at the offerors option, final effect in constituting acceptance. 4. Subsection (1) (b) deals with the situation where a shipment made following an order is shown by a notification of shipment to be referable to that order but h as a defect. Such a non-conforming shipment is normally to be understood as intended to close the bargain even though it proves to have been at the same time a breach. However, the seller by stating that the shipment is non-conforming and is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer keeps the shipment or notification from operating as an acceptance. Definitional cross references: Buyer. Section 2-103. Conforming. Section 2-106. Contract. Section 1-201. Goods. Section 2-105. Notifies. Section 1-201. Reasonable time. Section 1-204. VIRGINIA COMMENT The supreme court of appeals has said that the acid test of the formation of a contract for the sale of goods is A meeting of the minds of the parties. Pa lmer v. Charles E. Frosst &amp; Cos., 139 Va. 239, 244, 123 S.E. 357 (1924). See also Rownd v. Bell, 156 Va. 811, 813-14, 158 S.E. 890 (1931); Old Dominion Coal Corp. v. Snipes, 142 Va. 331, 339-40, 128 S.E. 518 (1925); Insurance Company of North America v. Gamble &amp; Co., 94 Va. 622, 625, 27 S.E. 463 (1897). The UCC generally follows this approach, with perhaps, some relaxation of what constitutes a meeting of the minds. Without expressly so providing, the UCC continues the general proposition of contract la w that an offer can be revoked at any time before it is accepted. J. B. Colt Co. v. Elam, 138 Va. 124, 127, 120 S.E. 857 (1924); Virginia Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Hughes, 140 Va. 249, 257-58, 124 S.E. 283 (1924). The UCC rejects technical rules of acceptance, providing that an offer shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable under the circumstances, thus relaxing the requirement of Virginia Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Hughes, 140 Va. 249, 258, 124 S.E. 283 (1924), that an offer made by mail must generally be accepted by an answer sent by return mail. Under this section an order or other offer for prompt or current shipment can be accepted either by prompt shipment or a prompt promise to ship. In Virgin ia Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Hughes, 140 Va. 249, 258, 124 S.E. 283 (1924), the buyer asked the seller t...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-207"><akn:num>§ 8.2-207</akn:num><akn:heading>Additional terms in acceptance or confirmation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly m ade conditional on assent to the additional or different terms. (2) The additi onal terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless: (a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer; (b) they materially alter it; or (c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received. (3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this act.

Acceptance of offer by l etter held reasonable.  While the buyers did not sign and return one copy of the contract in the manner requested by the seller, their acceptance of offer by letter was reasonable under the circumstances because they had misplaced the contract and the copy thereof. McAfee v. Brewer, 214 Va. 579, 203 S.E.2d 129, 1974 Va. LEXIS 181 (1974). Buyers letters constituted a definite and seasonable acceptance or written confirmation sent within five weeks, a reasonable time for amount specified by the seller due upon acceptance of the contract, and the request to include another item on the contract manifested the buyers assent or confirmation of the specific items enumerated in the sellers letter. McAfee v. Brewer, 214 Va. 579, 203 S.E.2d 129 , 1974 Va. LEXIS 181 (1974). Under a reservation of privilege, which operated to preserve the electrical fixt ure suppliers right to install cheaper fixtures if the owner/architect ultimately approved them, the electrical contractor would go along with an attempt to secure permission from the owner and architect to make the substitution, but once the owner a nd architect for the project decided that cheaper fixtures were unacceptable, the suppliers privilege was lost. The supplier was then bound by the terms of the agreement plus any additional terms contained in the confirmation letter which did not materially alter the terms of the original agreement and to which it did not seasonably object. None of the possible alterations that the confirmatory letter might have introduced would negate the suppliers liability on the contract. Howard P. F oley Co. v. Phoenix Eng'g &amp; Supply Co., 819 F.2d 60, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 6438 (4th Cir. 1987). Conditional nature of purchase order made it a counteroffer.  Even if a seller intended its price quotation to be an offer, a purchase order submitted by the buyer was not an acceptance because the purchase order made it cle ar that the buyer was unwilling to proceed in the absence of the sellers assent to the terms and conditions in the purchase order; thus, under subsection (1) of § 8.2-207, the conditional nature of the buyers purchase order made it a counterof fer rejecting the terms of the sellers offer. Kraft Foods N. Am., Inc. v. Banner Eng'g &amp; Sales, Inc., 446 F. Supp. 2d 551, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61702 (E.D. Va. 2006). Invoice not an acceptance.  Invoice does not operate as an acceptance under the Uniform Commercial Code when it is subject to and expressly conditioned upon assent to the terms and condition s provided for in the invoice. P&amp;J Arcomet v. Perini Corp., No. 1:07cv342, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84343 (E.D. Va. Nov. 14, 2007). Controlling provision.  Plaintiffs contention that defendants forum selection clause was not part of the contract failed because terms and conditions of defendants purchase o rder established the parameters of the contract, and as such, defendants choice of venue provision was the controlling provision in the contract; plaintiffs argument attempting to incorporate its terms and conditions from its supplemental proposa l failed.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Acceptance of new proposals.  To the extent that an order confirmation included additional terms not part of the existing agreement between the parties, those additional terms were construed a s proposals for addition to the contract, which proposal a buyer accepted by signing and returning the order confirmation. Colonna's Shipyard, Inc. v. Alpha Pipe Co., 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 210 (Norfolk Aug. 27, 2012). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten by this and other sections of this Article. 1. This section is intended to deal with two typical situations. The one is the written confirmation, where an agreement has been reached either orally or by info rmal correspondence between the parties and is followed by one or both of the parties sending formal memoranda embodying the terms so far as agreed upon and adding terms not discussed. The other situation is offer and acceptance, in which a wire or lette r expressed and intended as an acceptance or the closing of an agreement adds further minor suggestions or proposals such as ship by Tuesday, rush, ship draft against bill of lading inspection allowed, or the like. A frequent exam ple of the second situation is the exchange of printed purchase order and acceptance (sometimes called acknowledgment) forms. Because the forms are oriented to the thinking of the respective drafting parties, the terms contained in them often do not correspond. Often the sellers form contains terms different from or additional to those set forth in the buyers form. Nevertheless, the parties proceed with the transaction. 2. Under this Article a proposed deal which in commercial understanding has in fact been closed is recognized as a contract. Therefore, any additional matter cont ained in the confirmation or in the acceptance falls within subsection (2) and must be regarded as a proposal for an added term unless the acceptance is made conditional on the acceptance of the additional or different terms. 3. Whether or not additional or different terms will become part of the agreement depends upon the provisions of subsection (2). If they are such as materially to alter the original bargain, they will not be included unless expressly agreed to by the other party. If, however, they are terms which would not so change the bargain they will be incorporated unless notice of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time. 4. Examples of typical clauses which would normally materially alter the contract and so result in surprise or hardship if incorporated without express aw areness by the other party are: a clause negating such standard warranties as that of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose in circumstances in which either warranty normally attaches; a clause requiring a guaranty of 90% or 100% deliveries in a case such as a contract by cannery, where the usage of the trade allows greater quantity leeways; a clause reserving to the seller the power to cancel upon the buyers failure to meet any invoice when due; a clause requiring that complaints be m ade in a time materially shorter than customary or reasonable. 5. Examples of clauses which involve no element of unreasonable surprise and which therefore are to be incorporated in the contract unless notice of objection is seasonably given are: a clause setting forth and perhaps enlarging slightly upon the sellers exemption due to supervening causes beyond his control, similar to those covered by the provision of this Article on merchants excuse by failure of presu pposed conditions or a clause fixing in advance any reasonable formula of proration under such circumstances; a clause fixing a reasonable time for complaints within customary limits, or in the case of a purchase for sub-sale, providing for inspection by the sub-purchaser; a clause providing for interest on overdue invoices or fixing the sellers standard credit terms where they are within the range of trade practice and do not limit any credit bargained for; a clause limiting the right of rejection for defects which fall within the customary trade tolerances for acceptance with adjustment or otherwise limiting remedy in a reasonable manner (see Sections 2-718 and 2-719). 6. If no answer is received within a reasonable time after additional terms are proposed, it is both fair and commercially sound to assume that their inclusion ha s been assented to. Where clauses on confirming forms sent by both parties conflict each party must be assumed to object to a clause of the other conflicting with one on the confirmation sent by himself. As a result the require...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-208"><akn:num>§ 8.2-208</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 2003, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>353.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-209"><akn:num>§ 8.2-209</akn:num><akn:heading>Modification, rescission and waiver</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) An agreeme nt modifying a contract within this title needs no consideration to be binding.

(3) The requir ements of the statute of frauds section of this title (§ 8.2-201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions. (4) Although a n attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver. (5) A party wh o has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Modification of a prior agreement.  To the extent that an order confirmation included additional terms not part of the existing agreement between the parties, those additional terms were construed a s proposals for addition to the contract, which proposal a buyer accepted by signing and returning the order confirmation. Colonna's Shipyard, Inc. v. Alpha Pipe Co., 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 210 (Norfolk Aug. 27, 2012). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Subsection (1)Compare Section 1, Uniform Written Obligations Act; Subsections (2) to (5)none. Purposes of changes and new matter: 1. This section seeks to protect and make effective all necessary and desirable modifications of sales contracts without regard to the technicalities which at pre sent hamper such adjustments. 2. Subsection (1) provides that an agreement modifying a sales contract needs no consideration to be binding. However, modifications made thereunder must meet the test of good faith imposed by this Act. The effective use of bad faith to escape performance on the original contract terms is barred, and the extortion of a modification without legitimate commercial reason is ineffective as a violation of the duty of good faith. Nor can a mere technical consideration support a modification made in bad faith. The test of good faith between merchants or as against merchants includes observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade  (Section 2-103), and may in some situations require an objectively demonstrable reason for seeking a modification. But such matters as a market shift which makes a performance come to involve a loss may provide such a reason even though there is no such unforeseen difficulty as would make out a legal excuse from performance under Sections 2-615 and 2-616. 3. Subsections (2) and (3) are intended to protect against false allegations of oral modifications. Modification or rescission includes abandonment or oth er change by mutual consent, contrary to the decision in Green v. Doniger, 300 N.Y. 238, 90 N.E.2d 56 (1949); it does not include unilateral termination or cancellation as defined in Section 2-106. The Statute of Frauds provisions of this Article are expressly applied to modifications by subsection (3). Under those provisions the delivery and acceptance  test is limited to the goods which have been accepted, that is, to the past. Modification for the future cannot therefore be conjured up by oral testimony if the price involved is $500.00 or more since such modification must be shown at leas t by an authenticated memo. And since a memo is limited in its effect to the quantity of goods set forth in it there is safeguard against oral evidence. Subsection (2) permits the parties in effect to make their own Statute of Frauds as regards any future modification of the contract by giving effect to a clause i n a signed agreement which expressly requires any modification to be by signed writing. But note that if a consumer is to be held to such a clause on a form supplied by a merchant it must be separately signed. 4. Subsection (4) is intended, despite the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), to prevent contractual provisions excluding modification except by a signed writ ing from limiting in other respects the legal effect of the parties actual later conduct. The effect of such conduct as a waiver is further regulated in subsection (5). Cross references: Point 1: Section 1-203. Point 2: Sections 1-201, 1-203, 2-615 and 2-616.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Subsection 8.2-209(1), providing that an agreement modifying a contract within this title is binding without consideration, probably changes Virginia law as state d in Georgetown v. Reynolds, 161 Va. 164, 173, 170 S.E. 741 (1933), citing Richmond Leather Manufacturing Co. v. Fawcett, 130 Va. 484, 107 S.E. 800 (1921), for the proposition that a purchaser, who told the seller that if he continued to ship there would be no lawsuit, was held not to be bound by his promise not to sue. Virginia law has recognized that a stipulation in a written contract that it can only be modified by a writing can be rescinded by an oral agreement. Zurich Gener al Accident and Liability Insurance Co., Ltd. v. Baum, 159 Va. 404, 409, 165 S.E. 518 (1932). Subsection 8.2-209(2) modifies this rule. Prior Virginia law is in accord with subsection 8.2-209(5) in recognizing that the waiver of an executory portion of a contract may be retracted by giving reasona ble notification that strict performance is to be required. Cocoa Products Co. of America, Inc. v. Duche, 156 Va. 86, 97, 158 S.E. 719 (1931); Richmond Leather Manufacturing Co. v. Fawcett, 130 Va. 484, 506, 107 S.E. 800 (1921). The UCC does not say whether causes of action for breaches survive termination of contracts by mutual agreement. Under prior Virginia law such causes of action do not survive, unless expressly reserved. Plant Lipford, Inc. v. E. W. Gates &amp; Son Co., 141 Va. 325, 335, 127 S.E. 183 (1925); Juniper Lumber Co. v. John M.

No delegation of performance relieves the party deleg ating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach. (2) Except as otherwise provided in § 8.9A-406, unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignors due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement oth erwise. (3) The creati on, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the sellers interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyers chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attach ment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer and (ii) a court hav ing jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement. (4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of the contract is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignors performance. (5) An assignm ent of the contract or of all my rights under the contract or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract. (6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (§ 8.2-609).

CASE NOTES Offer and acceptance of assignment.  Subsection (4) indicates that there must be an offer of assignment and an acceptance of the assignment. Virginia Block Co. v. Virginia Wilbert Vault Co., 8 Bankr. 616, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 5014 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. Generally, this section recognizes both delegation of performance and assignability as normal impermissible incidents of a contract for the sale of goods. 2. Delegation of performance, either in conjunction with an assignment or otherwise, is provided for by subsection (1) where no substantial reason can be shown as to why the delegated performance will not be as satisfactory as personal performance. 3. Under subsection (2) rights which are no longer executory such as a right to damages for breach may be assigned although the agreement prohibits assignment. In such cases no question of delegation of any performance is involved. Subsection (2) is subject to Section 9-406, which makes rights to payment for goods sold (accounts), whether or not earned, freely alienable notwithstanding a contrary agreemen t or rule of law. 4. The nature of the contract or the circumstances of the case, however, may bar assignment of the contract even where delegation of performance is not involved. This Article and this section are intended to clarify this problem, particularly in cases dealing with output requirement and exclusive dealing contracts. In the first place the section on requirements and exclusive dealing removes from the construction of the original contract most of the personal discretion element by substituting the reasonably objective standard of good faith operation of the plant or business to be supplied. Secondly, the section on insecurity and assurances, which is speci fically referred to in subsection (5) of this section, frees the other party from the doubts and uncertainty which may afflict him under an assignment of the character in question by permitting him to demand adequate assurance of due performance without which he may suspend his own performance. Subsection (5) is not in any way intended to limit the effect of the section on insecurity and assurances and the word performance includes the giving of orders under a requirements contract. Of course, i n any case where a material personal discretion is sought to be transferred, effective assignment is barred by subsection (2). 5. Subsection (4) lays down a general rule of construction distinguishing between a normal commercial assignment, which substitutes the assignee for the assignor both as to rights and duties, and a financing assignment in which only the assignors rights are transferred. This Article takes no position on the possibility of extending some recognition or power to the original parties to work out normal commercial readjustments of th e contract in the case of financing assignments even after the original obligor has been notified of the assignment. This question is dealt with in the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9). 6. Subsection (5) recognizes that the non-assigning original party has a stake in the reliability of the person with whom he has closed the original contract, and is, therefore, entitled to due assurance that any delegated performance will be properly forthcoming. 7. This section is not intended as a complete statement of the law of delegation and assignment but is limited to clarifying a few points doubtful under the case law. Particularly, neither this section nor this Article touches directly on such questions as the need or effect of notice of the assignment, the rights of successive assignees, or any question of the form of an assignment, either as between the parties or as against any third parties. Some of these questions are dealt with in Article 9. Cross references: Point 3: Article 5 and 9. Point 4: Sections 2-306 and 2-609. Point 5: Article 9, Sections 9-317 and 9-318. Point 7: Article 9.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 11 and 41, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: This section uses the term obligation in contrast to the term duty in order to provide for the condition aspects of delivery and payment i nsofar as they are not modified by other sections of this Article such as those on cure of tender. It thus replaces not only the general provisions of the Uniform Sales Act on the parties duties, but also the general provisions of that Act on the eff ect of conditions. In order to determine what is in accordance with the contract under this Article usage of trade, course of dealing and performance, and the general background of circumstances must be given due consideration in conjunction with the lay meaning of the words used to define the scope of the conditions and duties.

Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3759 (W.D. Va. 2000). The essence of unconscionability in the context of a disclaimer of liability for consequ ential damages is an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party. Blevins v. New Holland N. Am., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3759 (W. D. Va. 2000). Contract held unconscionable.  Where debtors moved from West Virginia to Virginia where the husband had taken an executive position with a new employer, and where complete furniture delivery an d installation had been made to their new home before their arrival and without their knowledge, and the debtors had no freedom to retract, reject or repudiate the furniture transaction, whether it be for cash or credit, since the husband was for all int ents and purposes at the time in question beholden to the furniture company because of its relationship with his new employer, it would have been unconscionable for the court to require total compliance with the agreement which was made upon such unequal terms that the harshness thereof would contravene the intent of the drafters of this section. Costner's Furn., Inc. v. Cawthorn, 1 Bankr. 267, 1979 Bankr. LEXIS 803 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1979). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. This section is intended to make it possible for the courts to police explicitly against the contracts or clauses which they find to be unconscionable. In the past such policing has been accomplished by adverse construction of language, by manipulation of the rules of offer and acceptance or by determinations that the clause is contrary to public policy or to the dominant purpose of the contract. This section is intended to allow the court to pass directly on the unconscionability of the contract or particular clause therein and to make a conclusion of law as to its unconscionability. The basic test is whether, in the light of the general commercial backgroun d and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case, the clauses involved are so one-sided as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract. Subsection (2) makes it clear that it is proper for the court to hear evidence upon these questions. The principle is one of the prevention of oppression and unfair surprise (Cf. Campbell Soup Co. v. Wentz, 172 F.2d 80, 3d Cir. 1948) and not of disturbance of allocation of risks because of superior bargaining power. The underlying basis of this section is illustrated by the results in cases such as the following: Kansas City Wholesale Grocery Co. v. Weber Packing Corporation, 93 Utah 414, 73 P.2d 1272 (1937), where a clause limiting time for complaints was held inapplicabl e to latent defects in a shipment of catsup which could be discovered only by microscopic analysis; Hardy v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation, 38 Ga. App. 463, 144 S.E. 327 (1928), holding that a disclaimer of warranty clause applied only to express warranties, thus letting in a fair implied warranty; Andrews Bros. v. Singer &amp; Co. (1934 CA) 1 K.B. 17, holding that where a car with substantial mileage was delivered instead of a new car, a disclaimer of warranties, including those implied , left unaffected an express obligation on the description, even though the Sale of Goods Act called such an implied warranty; New Prague Flouring Mill Co. v. G. A. Spears, 194 Iowa 417, 189 N.W. 815 (1922), holding that a clause permitting t he seller, upon the buyers failure to supply shipping instructions, to cancel, ship, or allow delivery date to be indefinitely postponed 30 days at a time by the inaction, does not indefinitely postpone the date of measuring damages for the buyer s breach, to the sellers advantage; and Kansas Flour Mills Co. v. Dirks, 100 Kan. 376, 164 P. 273 (1917), where under a similar clause in a rising market the court permitted the buyer to measure his damages for non-delivery at the end of only one 30 day postponement; Green v. Arcos, Ltd. (1931 Ca) 47 T.L.R. 336, where a blanket clause prohibiting rejection of shipments by the buyer was restricted to apply to shipments where discrepancies represented merely mercantile variations; Meyer v. Packard Cle veland Motor Co., 106 Ohio St. 328, 140 N.E. 118 (1922), in which the court held that a waiver of all agreements not specified did not preclude implied warranty of fitness of a rebuilt dump truck for ordinary use as a dump truck; Austin Co. v. J. H. Tillman Co., 104 Or. 541, 209 P. 131 (1922), where a clause limiting the buyers remedy to return was held to be applicable only if the seller had delivered a machine needed for a construction job which reasonably met the contract description; Bek kevold v. Potts, 173 Minn. 87, 216 N.W. 790, 59 A.L.R. 1164 (1927), refusing to allow warranty of fitness for purpose imposed by law to be negated by clause excluding all warranties made by the seller; Robert A. Munroe &amp; Co. v. Meyer (1930) 2 K.B . 312, holding that the warranty of description overrides a clause reading with all faults and defects where adulterated meat not up to the contract description was delivered. 2. Under this section the court, in its discretion, may refuse to enforce the contract as a whole if it is permeated by the unconscionability, or it may strike an y single clause or group of clauses which are so tainted or which are contrary to the essential purpose of the agreement, or it may simply limit unconscionable clauses so as to avoid unconscionable results. 3. The present section is addressed to the court, and the decision is to be made by it. The commercial evidence referred to in subsection (2) is for the court s consideration, not the jurys. Only the agreement which results from the courts action on these matters is to be submitted to the general triers of the facts. Definitional cross reference: Contract.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provisions: Subsections (2) and (3) of Section 9, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: 1. This section corrects the phrasing of the Uniform Sales Act so as to avoid misconstruction and produce greater accuracy in commercial result. While it continue s the essential intent and purpose of the Uniform Sales Act it rejects any purely verbalistic construction in disregard of the underlying reason of the provisions. 2. Under subsection (1) the provisions of this Article are applicable to transactions where the price of goods is payable in something other than money. T his does not mean, however, that this whole Article applies automatically and in its entirety simply because an agreed transfer of title to goods is not a gift. The basic purposes and reasons of the Article must always be considered in determining the ap plicability of any of its provisions. 3. Subsection (2) lays down the general principle that when goods are to be exchanged for realty, the provisions of this Article apply only to those aspects of th e transaction which concern the transfer of title to goods but do not affect the transfer of the realty since the detailed regulation of various particular contracts which fall outside the scope of this Article is left to the courts and other legislation . However, the complexities of these situations may be such that each must be analyzed in the light of the underlying reasons in order to determine the applicable principles. Local statutes dealing with realty are not to be lightly disregarded or altered by language of this Article. In contrast, this Article declares definite policies in regard to certain matters legitimately within its scope though concerned with real property situations, and in those instances the provisions of this Article control.

Commercial Law, §§ 4, 12, 23, 32. CASE NOTES This section authorizes the court to fill in a gap which the parties have intentionally left open with respect to sale price, but by its own terms it applies only where the parties intended to conclude a contract. Flowers Baking Co. v. R-P Packaging, Inc., 229 Va. 370, 329 S.E.2d 462, 1985 Va. LEXIS 215 (1985). Parties words and conduct must manifest intention to be bound.  While the UCC has greatly modified the rigors of the common-law rules governing the formation of contracts, it remains a prerequisite that the parties words a nd conduct must manifest an intention to be bound. Flowers Baking Co. v. R-P Packaging, Inc., 229 Va. 370, 329 S.E.2d 462, 1985 Va. LEXIS 215 (1985). Although the parties may make a contract which deliberately leaves material terms open for future determination, no contract results where their words and conduct demonstrate a lack of intention to contract. Such a lack is not remedied by evidence of custom and usage in the trade, or by a written memorandum purporting to confirm oral discussions which did not in themselves amount to an agreement. Flowers Baking C o. v. R-P Packaging, Inc., 229 Va. 370, 329 S.E.2d 462, 1985 Va. LEXIS 215 (1985). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 9 and 10, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten. Purposes of changes: 1. This section applies when the price term is left open on the making of an agreement which is nevertheless intended by the parties to be a binding agreement. Th is Article rejects in these instances the formula that an agreement to agree is unenforceable if the case falls within subsection (1) of this section, and rejects also defeating such agreements on the ground of indefiniteness. Instead thi s Article recognizes the dominant intention of the parties to have the deal continue to be binding upon both. As to future performance, since this Article recognizes remedies such as cover (Section 2-712), resale (Section 2-706) and specific performance (Section 2-716) which go beyond any mere arithmetic as between contract price and market price, there is usually a reasonably certain basis for granting an appropriate remedy for breach so that the contract need not fail for indefiniteness. 2. Under some circumstances the postponement of agreement on price will mean that no deal has really been concluded, and this is made express in the preamble of s ubsection (1) (The parties if they so intend) and in subsection (4). Whether or not this is so is , in most cases, a question to be determined by the trier of fact. 3. Subsection (2), dealing with the situation where the price is to be fixed by one party rejects the uncommercial idea that an agreement that the seller may fix the price means that he may fix any price he may wish by the express qualification that the price so fixed must be fixed in good faith. Good faith includes observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade if the party is a merch ant. (Section 2-103). But in the normal case a posted price or a future sellers or buyers given price, price in effect, market price, or the like satisfies the good faith requirement. 4. The section recognizes that there may be cases in which a particular persons judgment is not chosen merely as a barometer or index of a fair price but is a n essential condition to the parties intent to make any contract at all. For example, the case where a known and trusted expert is to value a particular painting for which there is no market standard differs sharply from the situation where a named expert is to determine the grade of cotton, and the difference would support a finding that in the one the parties did not intend to make a binding agreement if that expert were unavailable whereas in the other they did so intend. Other circumstan ces would of course affect the validity of such a finding. 5. Under subsection (3), wrongful interference by one party with any agreed machinery for price fixing in the contract may be treated by the other party as a repu diation justifying cancellation, or merely as a failure to take cooperative action thus shifting to the aggrieved party the reasonable leeway in fixing the price. 6. Throughout the entire section, the purpose is to give effect to the agreement which has been made. That effect, however, is always conditioned by the requireme nt of good faith action which is made an inherent part of all contracts within this Act. (Section 1-203).

It applies to such contracts of nonproducing establishments such as dealers or distributors as well as to manufacturing concerns. 2. Under this Article, a contract for output or requirements is not too indefinite since it is held to mean the actual good faith output or requirements of the pa rticular party. Nor does such a contract lack mutuality of obligation since, under this section, the party who will determine quantity is required to operate his plant or conduct his business in good faith and according to commercial standards of fair de aling in the trade so that his output or requirements will approximate a reasonably foreseeable figure. Reasonable elasticity in the requirements is expressly envisaged by this section and good faith variations from prior requirements are permitted even when the variation may be such as to result in discontinuance. A shut-down by a requirements buyer for lack of orders might be permissible when a shut-down merely to curtail losses would not. The essential test is whether the party is acting in good fait h. Similarly, a sudden expansion of the plant by which requirements are to be measured would not be included within the scope of the contract as made but normal expansion undertaken in good faith would be within the scope of this section. One of the fact ors in an expansion situation would be whether the market price had risen greatly in a case in which the requirements contract contained a fixed price. Reasonable variation of an extreme sort is exemplified in Southwest Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma Portla nd Cement Co., 102 F.2d 630 (C.C.A. 10, 1939). This Article takes no position as to whether a requirements contract is a provable claim in bankruptcy. 3. If an estimate of output or requirements is included in the agreement, no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to it may be tendered or demanded. Any minimum or maximum set by the agreement shows a clear limit on the intended elasticity. In similar fashion, the agreed estimate is to be regarded as a center around which the parties intend the variation to occur. 4. When an enterprise is sold, the question may arise whether the buyer is bound by an existing output or requirements contract. That question is outside the scop e of this Article, and is to be determined on other principles of law. Assuming that the contract continues, the output or requirements in the hands of the new owner continue to be measured by the actual good faith output or requirements under the normal operation of the enterprise prior to sale. The sale itself is not grounds for sudden expansion or decrease. 5. Subsection (2), on exclusive dealing, makes explicit the commercial rule embodied in this Act under which the parties to such contracts are held to have implie dly, even when not expressly, bound themselves to use reasonable diligence as well as good faith in their performance of the contract. Under such contracts the exclusive agent is required, although no express commitment has been made, to use reasonable e ffort and due diligence in the expansion of the market or the promotion of the product, as the case may be. The principal is expected under such a contract to refrain from supplying any other dealer or agent within the exclusive territory. An exclusive d ealing agreement brings into play all of the good faith aspects of the output and requirement problems of subsection (1). It also raises questions of insecurity and right to adequate assurance under this Article. Cross references: Point 4: Section 2-210. Point 5: Sections 1-203 and 2-609.

Virginia Banner Coal Corp., 147 Va. 125, 135-36, 143-49, 136 S.E. 673 (1927); New Idea Spreader Co. v. R. M. Rogers &amp; Sons, 122 Va. 54, 64-65, 94 S.E. 351 (1917); Smokeless Fuel Co. v. W. E. Seaton &amp; Sons, 105 Va. 170, 174, 52 S.E. 829 (1906). A requirements contract is not one for such quantity as the purchaser may see fit to order, but a contract for a reasonable quantity by a good faith buyer, and a buyer whose requirements do no t equal a stated estimate is not required to take the estimated figure. Mathieson Alkali Works v. Virginia Banner Coal Corp., 147 Va. 125, 141-50, 136 S.E. 673 (1927). See Standard Ice Co. v. Lynchburg Diamond Ice Factory, 129 Va. 521, 527-32, 106 S.E. 3 90 (1921), for construction of the full making capacity of the plant. See also Potts v. Mathieson Alkali Works, 165 Va. 196, 215-18, 181 S.E. 521 (1935). The Official Comment, point 4, indicates that the UCC does not cover the situation presented in Wiseman v. Dennis, 156 Va. 431, 435, 157 S.E. 716 (1931), in which it was held that a buyer could not avoid a requirements contract by selling his business.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-307"><akn:num>§ 8.2-307</akn:num><akn:heading>Delivery in single lot or several lots</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Unless otherwise agreed all goods called for by a contract for sale must be tendered in a single delivery and payment is due only on such tender but where the circumsta nces give either party the right to make or demand delivery in lots the price if it can be apportioned may be demanded for each lot.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 45(1), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten and expanded. Purposes of changes: 1. This section applies where the parties have not specifically agreed whether delivery and payment are to be by lots and generally continues the essential intent of original Act, Section 45(1) by assuming that the parties intended delivery to be in a single lot. 2. Where the actual agreement or the circumstances do not indicate otherwise, delivery in lots is not permitted under this section and the buyer is properly entit led to reject for a deficiency in the tender, subject to any privilege in the seller to cure the tender. 3. The but clause of this section goes to the case in which it is not commercially feasible to deliver or to receive the goods in a single lot as for exam ple, where a contract calls for the shipment of ten carloads of coal and only three cars are available at a given time. Similarly, in a contract involving brick necessary to build a building the buyers storage space may be limited so that it would be impossible to receive the entire amount of brick at once, or it may be necessary to assemble the goods as in the case of cattle on the range, or to mine them. In such cases, a partial delivery is not subject to rejection for the defect in quantity alone, if the circumstances do not indicate a repudiation or default by t he seller as to the expected balance or do not give the buyer ground for suspending his performance because of insecurity under the provisions of Section 2-609. However, in such cases the undelivered balance of goods under the contract must be forthcomin g within a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner according to the policy of Section 2-503 on manner of tender of delivery. This is reinforced by the express provisions of Section 2-608 that if a lot has been accepted on the reasonable assumption tha t its nonconformity will be cured, the acceptance may be revoked if the cure does not seasonably occur. The section rejects the rule of Kelly Construction Co. v. Hackensack Brick Co., 91 N.J.L. 585, 103 A. 417, 2 A.L.R. 685 (1918) and approves the result in Lynn M. Ranger, Inc. v. Gildersleeve, 106 Conn. 372, 138 A. 142 (1927) in which a contract was made for six carloads of coal then rolling from the mines and consigned to the seller but the seller agreed to divert the carloads to the buyer as soon as the car numbers became known to him. He arranged a diversion of two cars and then notified the buyer who then repudiated the contract. The seller was held to be entitled to his full remedy for the two cars diverted because simultaneous delivery of all of the cars was not contemplated by either party. 4. Where the circumstances indicate that a party has a right to delivery in lots, the price may be demanded for each lot if it is apportionable. Cross references: Point 1: Section 1-201.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Paragraphs (a) and (b)Section 43(1), Uniform Sales Act; Paragraph (c)none. Changes: Sli ght modification in language. Purposes of changes and new matter: 1. Paragraphs (a) and (b) provide for those noncommercial sales and for those occasional commercial sales where no place or means of delivery has been agreed upon by the parties. Where delivery by carrier is required or authorized by the agreement, the sellers duties as to delivery of the goods are governed not by this section but by Section 2-504. 2. Under paragraph (b) when the identified goods contracted for are known to both parties to be in some location other than the sellers place of business or r esidence, the parties are presumed to have intended that place to be the place of delivery. This paragraph also applies (unless, as would be normal, the circumstances show that delivery by way of documents is intended) to a bulk of goods in the possessio n of a bailee. In such a case, however, the seller has the additional obligation to procure the acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyers right to possession. 3. Where customary banking channels call only for due notification by the banker that the documents are on hand, leaving the buyer himself to see to the p hysical receipt of the goods, tender at the buyers address is not required under paragraph (c). But that paragraph merely eliminates the possibility of a default by the seller if customary banking channels have been properly used in giving no tice to the buyer. Where the bank has purchased a draft accompanied by documents or has undertaken its collection on behalf of the seller, Part 5 of Article 4 spells out its duties and relations to its customer. Where the documents move forward under a l etter of credit the Article on Letters of Credit spells out the duties and relations between the bank, the seller and the buyer. 4. The rules of this section apply only unless otherwise agreed. The surrounding circumstances, usage of trade, course of dealing and course of performanc e, as well as the express language of the parties may constitute an otherwise agreement.

CASE NOTES Effect of antitrust laws.  A termination that is otherwise valid under this section may still be unreasonable under the antitrust laws. Barber &amp; Ross Co. v. Lifetime Doors, Inc., 810 F.2d 1 276, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 1480 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 823, 108 S. Ct. 86, 98 L. Ed. 2d 48, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 3504 (1987). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Subsection (1)see Sections 43(2), 45(2), 47(1) and 48, Uniform Sales Act, for policy continued under this Article, Subsection (2)none; Subsection (3)none. Changes: Com pletely different in scope. Purposes of changes and new matter: 1. Subsection (1) requires that all actions taken under a sales contract must be taken within a reasonable time where no time has been agreed upon. The reasonable time under this provision turns on the criteria as to reasonable time and on good faith and commercial standards set forth in Sections 1-203, 1-204 and 2-103. It thus depends upon what constitutes acceptable commercial conduct in view of the nat ure, purpose and circumstances of the action to be taken. Agreement as to a definite time, however, may be found in a term implied from the contractual circumstances, usage of trade or course of dealing or performance as well as in an express term. Such cases fall outside of this subsection since in them the time for action is agreed by usage. 2. The time for payment, where not agreed upon, is related to the time for delivery; the particular problems which arise in connection with determining the approp riate time of payment and the time for any inspection before payment which is both allowed by law and demanded by the buyer are covered in Section 2-513. 3. The facts in regard to shipment and delivery differ so widely as to make detailed provision for them in the text of this Article impracticable. The applicable principles, however, make it clear that surprise is to be avoided, good faith judgment is to be protected, and notice or negotiation to reduce the uncertainty to certainty is to be favored. 4. When the time for delivery is left open, unreasonably early offers of or demands for delivery are intended to be read under this Article as expressions of desi re or intention, requesting the assent or acquiescence of the other party, not as final positions which may amount without more to breach or to create breach by the other side. See Sections 2-207 and 2-609. 5. The obligation of good faith under this Act requires reasonable notification before a contract may be treated as breached because a reasonable time for deliver y or demand has expired. This operates both in the case of a contract originally indefinite as to time and of one subsequently made indefinite by waiver. When both parties let an originally reasonable time go by in silence, the course of conduct under the contract may be viewed as enlarging the reasonable time for tender or demand of performance. The contract may be terminated by abandonment. 6. Parties to a contract are not required in giving reasonable notification to fix, at peril of breach, a time which is in fact reasonable in the unforeseeable ju dgment of a later trier of fact. Effective communication of a proposed time limit calls for a response, so that failure to reply will make out acquiescence. Where objection is made, however, or if the demand is merely for information as to when goods wil l be delivered or will be ordered out, demand for assurances on the ground of insecurity may be made under this Article pending further negotiations. Only when a party insists on undue delay or on rejection of the other partys reasonable proposal is there a question of flat breach under the present section. 7. Subsection (2) applies a commercially reasonable view to resolve the conflict which has arisen in the cases as to contracts of indefinite duration. The rea sonable time of duration appropriate to a given arrangement is limited by the circumstances. When the arrangement has been carried on by the parties over the years, the reasonable time can continue indefinitely and the contract will not termi nate until notice. 8. Subsection (3) recognizes that the application of principles of good faith and sound commercial practice normally call for such notification of the termination of a going contract relationship as will give the other party reasonable time to seek a substitute arrangement. An agreement dispensing with notification or limiting the time for the seeking of a substitute arrangement is, of course, valid under this su bsection unless the results of putting it into operation would be the creation of an unconscionable state of affairs. 9. Justifiable cancellation for breach is a remedy for breach and is not the kind of termination covered by the present subsection. 10. The requirement of notification is dispensed with where the contract provides for termination on the happening of an agreed event. Event is a term chosen here to contrast with option or the like.

For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 4, 12. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 42 and 47(2), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten in this and other sections. Purposes of changes: This section is drawn to reflect modern business methods of dealing at a distance rather than face to face. Thus: 1. Paragraph (a) provides that payment is due at the time and place the buyer is to receive the goods rather than at the point of delivery except in docum entary shipment cases (paragraph(c) ). This grants an opportunity for the exercise by the buyer of his preliminary right to inspection before paying even though under the delivery term the risk of loss may have previously passed to him or the running of the credit period has already started. 2. Paragraph (b) while providing for inspection by the buyer before he pays, protects the seller. He is not required to give up possession of the goods until he h as received payment, where no credit has been contemplated by the parties. The seller may collect through a bank by a sight draft against an order bill of lading hold until arrival; inspection allowed. The obligations of the bank under such a pro vision are set forth in Part 5 of Article 4. In the absence of a credit term, the seller is permitted to ship under reservation and if he does payment is then due where and when the buyer is to receive the documents. 3. Unless otherwise agreed the place for the receipt of the documents and payment is the buyers city but the time for payment is only after arrival of the goo ds, since under paragraph (b), and Section 2-512 and 2-513 the buyer is under no duty to pay prior to inspection. 4. Where the mode of shipment is such that goods must be unloaded immediately upon arrival, too rapidly to permit adequate inspection before receipt, the seller m ust be guided by the provisions of this Article on inspection which provide that if the seller wishes to demand payment before inspection, he must put an appropriate term into the contract. Even requiring payment against documents will not of itself have this desired result if the documents are to be held until the arrival of the goods. But under (b) and (c) if the terms are C.I.F., C.O.D., or cash against documents payment may be due before inspection. 5. Paragraph (d) states the common commercial understanding that an agreed credit period runs from the time of shipment or from that dating of the invoice which i s commonly recognized as a representation of the time of shipment. The provision concerning any delay in sending forth the invoice is included because such conduct results in depriving the buyer of his full notice and warning as to when he must be prepar ed to pay.

Purposes: 1. Subsection (1) permits the parties to leave certain detailed particulars of performance to be filled in by either of them without running the risk of having th e contract invalidated for indefiniteness. The party to whom the agreement gives power to specify the missing details is required to exercise good faith and to act in accordance with commercial standards so that there is no surprise and the range of perm issible variation is limited by what is commercially reasonable. The agreement which permits one party so to specify may be found as well in a course of dealing, usage of trade, or implication from circumstances as in explicit language used by th e parties. 2. Options as to assortment of goods or shipping arrangements are specifically reserved to the buyer and seller respectively under subsection (2) where no other a rrangement has been made. This section rejects the test which mechanically and without regard to usage or the purpose of the option gave the option to the party first under a duty to move and applies instead a standard commercial interpretation t o these circumstances. The unless otherwise agreed provision of this subsection covers not only express terms but the background and circumstances which enter into the agreement. 3. Subsection (3) applies when the exercise of an option or cooperation by one party is necessary to or materially affects the other partys performance, but i t is not seasonably forthcoming; the subsection relieves the other party from the necessity for performance or excuses his delay in performance as the case may be. The contract-keeping party may at his option under this subsection proceed to perform in a ny commercially reasonable manner rather than wait. In addition to the special remedies provided, this subsection also reserves all other remedies. The remedy of particular importance in this connection is that provided for insecurity. Request ma y also be made pursuant to the obligation of good faith for a reasonable indication of the time and manner of performance for which a party is to hold himself ready. 4. The remedy provided in subsection (3) is one which does not operate in the situation which falls within the scope of Section 2-614 on substituted performance. Where the failure to cooperate results from circumstances set forth in that section, the other party is under a duty to proffer or demand (as the case may be) substitute performance as a condition to claiming rights against the non-cooperating party.

(2) A warranty under subsection (1) will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he o r a third person may have. (3) Unless oth erwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the s eller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.

Commercial Law, §§ 16, 28, 32, 33; 5A M.J. Cos ts, § 7. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 13, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten, the provisions concerning infringement being new. Purposes of changes: 1. Subsection (1) makes provision for a buyers basic needs in respect to a title which he in good faith expects to acquire by his purchase, namely, that he re ceive a good, clean title transferred to him also in a rightful manner so that he will not be exposed to a lawsuit in order to protect it. The warranty extends to a buyer whether or not the seller was in possession of the goods at the time the sale or contract to sell was made. The warranty of quiet possession is abolished. Disturbance of quiet possession, although not mentioned specifically, is one way, among many, in which the breach o f the warranty of title may be established. The knowledge referred to in subsection 1(b) is actual knowledge as distinct from notice. 2. The provisions of this Article requiring notification to the seller within a reasonable time after the buyers discovery of a breach apply to notice of a br each of the warranty of title, where the sellers breach was innocent. However, if the sellers breach was in bad faith he cannot be permitted to claim that he has been misled or prejudiced by the delay in giving notice. In such case the reason able time for notice should receive a very liberal interpretation. Whether the breach by the seller is in good or bad faith Section 2-725 provides that the cause of action accrues when the breach occurs. Under the provisions of that section the breac h of the warranty of good title occurs when tender of delivery is made since the warranty is not one which extends to future performance of the goods. 3. When the goods are part of the sellers normal stock and are sold in his normal course of business, it is his duty to see that no claim of infringement of a patent or trademark by a third party will mar the buyers title. A sale by a person other than a dealer, however, raises no implication in its circumstances of such a warranty. Nor is there such an implication when the buyer orders goods to be assemb led, prepared or manufactured on his own specifications. If, in such a case, the resulting product infringes a patent or trademark, the liability will run from buyer to seller. There is, under such circumstances, a tacit representation on the part of the buyer that the seller will be safe in manufacturing according to the specifications, and the buyer is under an obligation in good faith to indemnify him for any loss suffered. 4. This section rejects the cases which recognize the principle that infringements violate the warranty of title but deny the buyer a remedy unless he has been ex pressly prevented from using the goods. Under this Article eviction is not a necessary condition to the buyers remedy since the buyers remedy arises immediately upon receipt of notice of infringement; it is merely one way of establishing the fact of breach. 5. Subsection (2) recognizes that sales by sheriffs, executors, foreclosing lienors and persons similarly situated may be so out of the ordinary commercial course that their peculiar character is immediately apparent to the buyer and therefore no personal obligation is imposed upon the seller who is purporting to sell only an unknown or limited right. This subsection does not touch upon and leaves open all questi ons of restitution arising in such cases, when a unique article so sold is reclaimed by a third party as the rightful owner. Foreclosure sales under Article 9 are another matter. Section 9-610 provides that a disposition of collateral under that section includes warranties such as those imposed by this section on a voluntary disposition of property of the kind involved. Consequently, unless properly excluded under subsection (2) or under the special provisions for exclusion in Section 9-610, a disposition under Section 9-610 of collate ral consisting of goods includes the warranties imposed by subsection (1) and, if applicable, subsection (3). 6. The warranty of subsection (1) is not designated as an implied warranty, and hence is not subject to Section 2-316 (3). Disclaimer of the warranty of t itle is governed instead by subsection (2), which requires either specific language or the described circumstances. Cross references: Point 1: Section 2-403.

VIRGINIA COMMENT An express warranty of clear title in the sale of an automobile was involved in Silvey v. Johnston, 193 Va. 677, 679, 70 S.E.2d 280 (1952), but Virginia has not h ad a case involving an implied warranty of title.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-313"><akn:num>§ 8.2-313</akn:num><akn:heading>Express warranties by affirmation, promise, description, sample</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Express wa rranties by the seller are created as follows: (a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise. (b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description. (c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model. (2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as warrant or guarantee or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement pur porting to be merely the sellers opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.

CASE NOTES The drafters of the Uniform Commercial Code intended to modify the traditional requireme nt of buyer reliance on express warranties. Daughtrey v. Ashe, 243 Va. 73, 413 S.E.2d 336, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1762, 1992 Va. LEXIS 152 (1992). The part of the basis of the bargain language of subsection (1)(b) of this secti on does not establish a buyers reliance requirement; instead, this language makes a sellers description of the goods that is not his mere opinion a representation that defines his obligation. Daughtrey v. Ashe, 243 Va. 73, 413 S.E.2d 336, 8 Va. L aw Rep. 1762, 1992 Va. LEXIS 152 (1992). A plaintiff is not required to show that he relied upon the affirmation in order to recover under an express warranty claim. Yates v. Pitman Mfg., Inc., 257 Va. 6 01, 514 S.E.2d 605, 1999 Va. LEXIS 58 (1999). Removal of presumption of affirmatio n.  An affirmation of fact is presumed to be a part of the bargain, and any fact that would remove such affirmation out of the agreement requires clear affirmative pr oof. Yates v. Pitman Mfg., Inc., 257 Va. 601, 514 S.E.2d 605, 1999 Va. LEXIS 58 (1999). If one who has superior knowledge makes a statement about the goods sold and does not qu alify the statement as his opinion, the statement will be treated as a statement of fact. Daughtrey v. Ashe, 243 Va. 73, 413 S.E.2d 336, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1762, 1992 Va. LEXIS 152 (1992). Limitation on action for personal injury based on breach of warranty.  Where a cause of action to recover for personal injury is predicated upon a breach of warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code, § 8.01-243 is the proper stat ute of limitations to be applied. Tyler v. R.R. St. &amp; Co., 322 F. Supp. 541, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14571 (E.D. Va. 1971). Common-law warranties must also be considered before ruling on motion to dismiss.  Official Comment 2 to this section notes that the warranty sections of [Article 2] are not designed in any way to disturb those lines of case law growth which have recognized that warranties need not be confined . . . to sales contracts. Thus, even if plaintiffs allegations do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted under §§ 8.2-314 and 8.2-315, a court must also consider whether plai ntiffs allegations are sufficient to state a common-law implied warranty claim under Virginia law before ruling on defendants Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion. Harris v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 550 F. Supp. 1024, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15806 (W.D. Va. 1982). Comment 2 to this section does not suggest that the Uniform Commercial Code is applicable to nonsales transactions or that a common-law warranty concerning leases parallels the provisions of the Code. Leake v. Meredith, 221 Va. 14, 267 S.E.2d 93, 1980 Va. LEXIS 209 (1980). Basis of bargain oral statements not admissible to contradict warranty disclaimer.  Even if the oral representations made by defendants representative became the basis of the bargain and therefore constituted an express warranty, thos e oral statements would not be admissible to contradict or vary the disclaimer of express warranties clause contained in the integrated agreement between defendant and plaintiff. King Indus., Inc. v. Worlco Data Sys., 736 F. Supp. 114, 1989 U.S. Dist. LE XIS 17041 (E.D. Va. 1989), aff'd, 900 F.2d 253, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 4361 (4th Cir. 1990). Sellers description was an express warranty.  Jewelers description was an express warranty where the jeweler did more than give a mere opinion of the value of the goods; he specifically described them as diamonds of H color and v.v.s. quality. Daughtrey v. Ashe, 243 Va. 73, 413 S.E.2d 336, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1762, 1992 Va. LEXIS 152 (1992). Where a cut sheet, which was included in a sellers price quotation for an impedance pipe heating system, contained a notation regarding maximum torque, the to rque specification was an affirmation, for purposes of § 8.2-313, that bolts in insulated pipe joints could be torqued to 60 foot-pounds, and the torque specification was a description of the goods; thus, the seller expressly warranted that the bolts in the insulated pipe joints could be safely torqued to 60 foot-pounds. Kraft Foods N. Am., Inc. v. Banner Eng'g &amp; Sales, Inc., 446 F. Supp. 2d 551, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61702 (E.D. Va. 2006). Sellers description not express warranty.  Where statement made by boat dealer in its sales brochure was merely a commendation of the boats performance and did not describe a specific characteristic or feature of the boat, the statement expressed the manufacturers opinion concerning the quality of the boats performance and did not create an express warranty that the boat was capable of attaining a certain speed. Bayliner Marine Corp. v. Crow, 257 Va. 121, 509 S.E.2d 499, 1999 Va. LEXIS 12 (1999). Manufacturer of sprinkler heads, which allegedly failed to operate properly during a fire, was entitled to the protection of the statute of limitations under § 8.2-725 on insurers breach of warranty claims because there was not an express warranty of future performance regarding the sprinkler heads under § 8.2-313. Royal Indem. Co. v. Tyco Fire Prods., LP, 281 Va. 157, 704 S.E.2d 91, 2011 Va. LEXIS 24 ( 2011). Summary judgment.  In a suit alleging that defendants negligently failed to provide adequate instructions for manually programming the drug concentration into a patient-controlled a nalgesia pump, summary judgment was inappropriate as to a breach of express warranty claim because whether the statements in a news release and a brochure were part of the basis of the bargain creating an express warranty was a question for the jury. Jai n v. Abbott Labs., Inc., No. 7:13cv00551, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175242 (W.D. Va. Dec. 19, 2014). Failure to s tate claim for breach of express warranty.  Homebuilder failed to state a claim against a stucco manufacturer for breach of an express warranty where the homebuilders allegations amounted to no more tha n a legal conclusion, as the allegations did not identify any affirmations of fact, promises, descriptions, and/or use of samples and/or models purportedly made by the manufacturer; a mere legal conclusion was not sufficient. Pulte Home Corp. v. Parex, I nc., 265 Va. 518, 579 S.E.2d 188, 2003 Va. LEXIS 51 (2003). In an action in which a patient alleged that she suffered injuries as a result of the failure of batteries in a surgically implanted pulse generator and that a ho spital gave the patient documentation indicating that her doctor could provide a battery life estimate, the patient failed to state a claim against the hospital for breach of express warranty because the documentation did not contain an express warranty and the patients doctor, who was not a party to the case and was not an employee of the hospital, gave the patient a battery life estimate. Sanders v. Medtronic, Inc., No. 4:06cv57, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45516 (E.D. Va. June 26, 2006). In a case in which a truck buyer asserted a claim for breach of express warranty under § 8.2-313 in a last-ditch effort to defeat summary judgment, he did not satisfy his evidentiary burden on summary judgment. He had not offered a shred of evidence demonstrating the terms of any express warranty. Eversole v. Ford Motor Co., No. 3:11cv428-DJN, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49166 (E.D. Va. Apr. 6, 2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Clai m for breach of express warranty sufficiently stated.  Co-executors of decedents estate, who alleged manufacturers agents represented that a medical device was suitable for insertion into their decedents a rtery, stated sufficient facts to survive a demurrer in their breach of express warranty claim; privity was not required because it was a products liability claim, the co-executors had alleged that the decedents doctors were induced by the representa tions, and there was no need to show that the representations were made directly to the decedent. Hamlett v. Va. Vascular Assocs., 61 Va. Cir. 468, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 138 (Norfolk Apr. 21, 2003). Defendant contractors demurrer to an express warranty claim asserted by plaintiff, a general contractor, was denied in the general contractors suit for in demnity and contribution for liability arising from water da...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-314"><akn:num>§ 8.2-314</akn:num><akn:heading>Implied warranty: Merchantability; usage of trade</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Unless exc luded or modified (§ 8.2-316), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.

CASE NOTES Contingent and consequential damages are not generally associated with the law of neglig ence. They are terms applicable to and used in relation to the law of warranty and the U.C.C. In particular, they apply to the law of sales. Wellmore Coal Co. v. Powell Constr. Co., 600 F. Supp. 1042, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21519 (D. Va. 1984). Implied warranty of merchantability arises by operation of law, and not by agreement of the parties. Whittle v. Timesavers, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 115, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19748 (W.D. Va. 1985). Warranty implied unless prop erly excluded.  Warranty of merchantability is implied in every sale made by a merchant seller unless excluded in a manner which is effective under the Code. Whittle v. Timesaver s, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 115, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19748 (W.D. Va. 1985). Implied warranties in a contract for sale of an RV were not effectively disclaimed under § 8.2-316(2), as they were not conspicuous as defined in § 8.1A-201 (b)(10) where the disclaimer clause was located in the middle of the back page of the buyers order; the language referring the buyer to the back page  the merger clause  was located in the middle of the front page in an extremely small font s ize; the signatures of the buyer and dealer were on the bottom of the first page, and no signatures or initials appeared on the back of the page; font and print colors sizes were the same; and the disclaimer clause was not set off from the other paragrap hs on the back side of the order in any distinctive way. Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). Limitation on implied warranty.  While this section recognizes that an implied warranty can arise from a course of dealing between merchants, it further provides that no implied warranty arises w here it has been expressly disclaimed. Fisher v. Monsanto Co., 863 F. Supp. 285, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14032 (W.D. Va. 1994). Implied warranty of merchantability is distinctly different from implied contract of indemnity.  The implied warranty of merchantability that generally arises upon the sale (or delivery) of goods and the implied contract of indemnity that flows from the warra nty are distinctly different and are governed by different statutes of limitation. Wingo v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 638 F. Supp. 107, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25214 (W.D. Va. 1986). Implied contract for indemni ty upon breach.  Where there has been a breach of an implied warranty of merchantability an implied contract for indemnity will lie. Whittle v. Timesavers, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 115, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19748 (W.D. Va. 1985). No distinction made betw een new and used goods.  The Code makes absolutely no distinction between new and used goods when defining goods in § 8.2-105. If the drafters of the Code had intended for this particular section to apply only to new goods, then it would have been simple to have so stated; however, this was not done. In the absence of express language to the contrary, in the area of implied warranties no distinction is made between new and use d goods. Whittle v. Timesavers, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 115, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19748 (W.D. Va. 1985). Official Comments support th is conclusion.  Official Comment 3 for this section supports even further the conclusion that the drafters intended not to make a distinction between new and used goods. Had the implied warranty been intended to apply only to new goods, this comment would be meaningless. This statement by the drafters refers to the scope of the warranty and not the existence of such. It merely indicates that when you buy a used product you canno t expect it to be as good as a new one. In short, the warranty which attaches to a used good obviously takes into account normal wear and tear. Whittle v. Timesavers, Inc., 614 F. Supp. 115, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19748 (W.D. Va. 1985). When warranty arises.  An implied warranty of merchantability arises, if at all, at the time the product is sold to the purchaser. Goodbar v. Whitehead Bros., 591 F. Supp. 552, 1984 U.S . Dist. LEXIS 24746 (W.D. Va. 1984), aff'd, 769 F.2d 213, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 21195 (4th Cir. 1985). Distributor could not be held liable to deceaseds estate after the deceased was allegedly fatally wounded by ingestion of the manufacturers product becaus e the distributor did not actually sell the product at issue to the deceased. Wachovia Bank, N.A., Adm'r of the Estate of Susan Hale Young v. Bourn, No. 7:02CV00773, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 519 (W.D. Va. Jan. 7, 2003). Warranty runs from seller to purchaser and then through purchaser to ultimate user.  With one notable exception (limitation of damages in personal injury cases is prima facie unconscionable), the user can rise no higher than purchaser through whic h he obtained the implied warranty. Goodbar v. Whitehead Bros., 591 F. Supp. 552, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24746 (W.D. Va. 1984), aff'd, 769 F.2d 213, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 21195 (4th Cir. 1985). Employees of skilled purchaser received no warranty derivatively through employer.  When a skilled purchaser such as a foundry knows or reasonably should be expected to know of the dangerous propensities or characteristics of a product, no implie d warranty of merchantability arises. Where plaintiffs (employees of purchaser) claimed derivatively through the foundry on their implied warranty claim against suppliers of silica to the foundry, and where the foundry received no implied warranty as to the particular harmful propensities and characteristics of free silica because of their extensive knowledge in this area, plaintiffs claim on this theory failed. Goodbar v. Whitehead Bros., 591 F. Supp. 552, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24746 (W.D. Va. 1984 ), aff'd, 769 F.2d 213, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 21195 (4th Cir. 1985). In order to prove that product is not merchantable, the complaining party must first est ablish the standard of merchantability in the trade. Bayliner Marine Corp. v. Crow, 257 Va. 121, 509 S.E.2d 499, 1999 Va. LEXIS 12 (1999). A personal injury or wrongful death claimant may recover for breach of warrant by establishing (1) that the goods were unreasonably dangerous either for the use to which they would ordinarily be put or for some other reasonably foreseeable purpose, and (2) that the unreasonably dangerous condition existed when the goods left the defe ndants hands. Bly v. Otis Elevator Co., 713 F.2d 1040, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 25185 (4th Cir. 1983), different results reached on reh'g, 754 F.2d 1111, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 28168 (4th Cir. 1985). Obligation to reimburse due to breach of implied warranty of merchantability.  Dairy farm was obligated to reimburse the dairy cooperative for damages it paid as a result of the farms breach of implied warranty of merchantability when th e farm delivered adulterated milk to a dairy processor who had to issue a recall and close its plant; therefore, the appellate court affirmed the award of summary judgment in favor of the cooperative in its action for reimbursement of damages. Md. &amp; Va. Milk Producers Coop. Ass'n v. Crowell Farms Inc., 102 Fed. Appx. 267, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 11343 (4th Cir. 2004). A product can be unreasonably dangerous if defective in assembly or manufacture, if impr udently designed, or if not accompanied by adequate warnings about its hazardous properties. Bly v. Otis Elevator Co., 713 F.2d 1040, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 25185 (4th Cir. 1983), different results reached on reh'g, 754 F.2d 1111, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 2816 8 (4th Cir. 1985).

CASE NOTES In order to recover under this section, a buyer must prove that (1) the seller had reaso n to know the particular purpose for which the buyer required the goods, (2) the seller had reason to know the buyer was relying on the sellers skill or judgment to furnish appropriate goods, and (3) the buyer in fact relied upon the sellers skil l or judgment.

Contingent and consequential damages are not generally associated with the law of neglig ence. They are terms applicable to and used in relation to the law of warranty and the U.C.C. In particular, they apply to the law of sales. Wellmore Coal Co. v. Powell Constr. Co., 600 F. Supp. 1042, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21519 (D. Va. 1984). Breach of warranty and negli gence compared.  In negligence, a supplier of sand to a foundry will be liable for failure to warn the foundrys employees of the risks of silicosis if its conduct is unreasona ble, whereas the duty to warn under a theory of implied warranty focuses upon whether the lack of warning renders the product unreasonably dangerous and thereby breaches an implied warranty arising under this section. Goodbar v. Whitehead Bros., 591 F. S upp. 552, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24746 (W.D. Va. 1984), aff'd, 769 F.2d 213, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 21195 (4th Cir. 1985). Sale of goods prerequisite to warran ty.  An implied warranty of merchantability or a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is made only when a sale of goods occurs. Moore v. Allied Chem. Corp., 48 0 F. Supp. 364, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10976 (E.D. Va. 1979). An allegation in a complaint that the defendant corporation breached a warranty that a toxic chemical used in the manufacture of pesticides (kepone) was unlikely to cause contamination of the environment and humans failed to state a claim for breach of warranty of merchantability or for breach of warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, since there was involved neither a passing of title nor a transfer of go ods. Moore v. Allied Chem. Corp., 480 F. Supp. 364, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10976 (E.D. Va. 1979). Where contract contemplated both services and goods, since agreement was dominated by la nguage designating a sale of goods, the agreement at issue contained the UCC implied sales warranties. Fournier Furniture, Inc. v. Waltz-Holst Blow Pipe Co., 980 F. Supp. 187, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17381 (W.D. Va. 1997). The rules of implied warranty apply only when an article is being operated or used in the manner intended for it. Layne-Atlantic Co. v. Koppers Co., 214 Va. 467, 201 S.E.2d 609, 1974 Va. LEXIS 162 (1974). A manufacturer cannot be held to foresee an unanticipated or unpredictable misuse of the article it manufactures or sells. Layne-Atlantic Co. v. Koppers Co., 214 Va. 467, 201 S.E.2d 609, 1974 Va. LEXIS 162 (1974). Where there is an absence of defect in the product and the sellers goods were being installed in a manner not contemplated when they were sold, there is no im plied warranty giving liability to the seller for products failure in installation. Layne-Atlantic Co. v. Koppers Co., 214 Va. 467, 201 S.E.2d 609, 1974 Va. LEXIS 162 (1974). Doctrine of crashworthiness rejected .  The Virginia Supreme Court rejects the doctrine of crashworthiness which concerns the dangers posed by the vehicle occupants collision with the interior of th e vehicle upon collision, or the intrusion of moving or standing objects, upon collision, into the passenger area. Slone v. GMC, 249 Va. 520, 457 S.E.2d 51, 1995 Va. LEXIS 50 (1995). Warranted goods with no value except for particular purpose.  Where a seller breaches an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, and the warranted goods have no value except for that purpose, the purchaser may assert the breach as a complete defense to the sellers action for the purchase price. Medcom, Inc. v. C. Arthur Weaver Co., 232 Va. 80, 348 S.E.2d 243, 3 Va. Law Rep. 534, 1986 Va. LEXIS 231 (1986). Where the particular purpose is the purpose described in the contract, that purp ose cannot be considered in isolation or divorced from the specifications of the contract. Layne-Atlantic Co. v. Koppers Co., 214 Va. 467, 201 S.E.2d 609, 1974 Va. LEXIS 162 (1974). Seller had no re ason to know of a particular purpose.  In an action in which a patient alleged that she suffered injuries as a result of the failure of batteries in a surgically implanted pulse generator, the patient failed to state a claim against the hospital for breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose because the patients intended use for the pulse generator device was the ordinary use for such devices; thus, the patient was not able to show that the hospital had reason to know any particular purpose for which the pulse generator devices were intended. Sanders v. Medtronic, Inc., No. 4:06cv57, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45516 (E.D. Va. June 26, 2006). Generally, express warranties and disclaimers do not run with personal property. Matthews v. Ford Motor Co., 479 F.2d 399, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9835 (4th Cir. 1973). And do not absolve from liability imposed by implied warranty.  The exclusions contained in a manufacturers express warranty do not absolve an independent dealer from liability imposed by an implied warranty. Matthews v. F ord Motor Co., 479 F.2d 399, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9835 (4th Cir. 1973). No effective disclaimer.  Implied warranties in a contract for sale of an RV were not effectively disclaimed under § 8.2-316(2), as they were not conspicuous as defined in § 8.1A-201 (b)(10) where the disclaimer clause was located in the middle of the back page of the buyers order; the language referring the buyer to the back page  the merger clause  was located in the middle of the front page in an extremely small font s ize; the signatures of the buyer and dealer were on the bottom of the first page, and no signatures or initials appeared on the back of the page; font and print colors sizes were the same; and the disclaimer clause was not set off from the other paragrap hs on the back side of the order in any distinctive way. Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). Common-law warranties must also be considered before ruling on motion to dismiss.  Official Comment 2 to § 8.2-313 notes that the warranty sections of [Article 2] are not designed in any way to disturb those lines of case law growth which have recognized that warranties need not be confined . . . to sales contracts. Thus, even if plaintiffs allegations do not state a claim upon which relief can be granted under § 8.2-314 and this section, a court must also consider whether pla intiffs allegations are sufficient to state a common-law implied warranty claim under Virginia law before ruling on defendants Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion. Harris v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 550 F. Supp. 1024, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15806 (W.D. Va . 1982). Limitation on action for personal injury based on breach of warranty.  Where a cause of action to recover for personal injury is predicated upon a breach of warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code, § 8.01-243 is the proper stat ute of limitations to be applied. Tyler v. R.R. St. &amp; Co., 322 F. Supp. 541, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14571 (E.D. Va. 1971) (commented on in 6 U. Rich. L. Rev. 167 (1971)). The resolution of conflicting evidence is a function of the jury.  Where the evidence relating to an implied warranty and breach thereof was conflicting, it should have been submitted to the jury to resolve the conflicts. Medcom, Inc. v. C. Arthur Weaver Co., 232 Va. 80, 348 S.E.2d 243, 3 Va. Law Rep. 534, 1986 Va. LEXIS 231 (1986). Question whether there was implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose in a sale of goods is ordinarily a question of fact based on the circumstances sur rounding the transaction. Bayliner Marine Corp. v. Crow, 257 Va. 121, 509 S.E.2d 499, 1999 Va. LEXIS 12 (1999). Jury verdict on issue of breach of implied warranty held unassailable.  Where evidence of an automobiles defects was sufficient to establish breach of implied warranty, the jurys verdict on this issue is unassailable. Matthews v. Ford Motor Co., 479 F.2d 399, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9835 (4th Cir. 1973). Buyer did not rely on skill or judgment of seller to select or furnish suitable goods.  See Layne-Atlantic Co. v. Koppers Co., 214 Va. 467, 201 S.E.2d 609, 1974 Va. LEXIS 162 (1974). Buyer did not rely on skill or judgment of manufacturer to furnish suitable goods. ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-316"><akn:num>§ 8.2-316</akn:num><akn:heading>Exclusion or modification of warranties</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Words or c onduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this title on parol or extrinsic eviden ce (§ 8.2-202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable. (2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous.

CASE NOTES Limitation of conseq uential damages permitted.  A seller may by contract limit the remedies for breach of warranty and, in particular, may exclude consequential damages unless the exclusion is unconscionable. B levins v. New Holland N. Am., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3759 (W.D. Va. 2000). Limitation o n warranty or remedy must be conspicuous.  When a writing which meets the requirements of § 8.2-201 is intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement, the terms thereof may not be cont radicted by evidence of any prior agreement. To limit either warranties or remedies, however, the exclusionary language in the writing must be conspicuous. Armco, Inc. v. New Horizon Dev. Co., 229 Va. 561, 331 S.E.2d 456, 1985 Va. LEXIS 232 (1985 ). A writing excluding the implied warranty of fitness must be conspicuous. A clause buried in small type among eighteen other numbered paragraphs on the bac k of the purchase order fails to satisfy the definition of this essential adjective. Matthews v. Ford Motor Co., 479 F.2d 399, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9835 (4th Cir. 1973). Although defendants conspicuously disclaimed all warranties, plaintiff argued that defendants fraud precluded them from enforcing those disclaimers; however, plaintiff failed to prove fraud, and defendants disclaimers were effective. Waytec Elecs. Corp. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Elec. Materials, LLC, 459 F. Supp. 2d 480, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77673 (W.D. Va. 2006), aff'd, 255 Fed. Appx. 754, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 281 13 (4th Cir. 2007). Tailoring of warranty.  Manufacturer can tailor warranty with regard to breach of warranty remedies; liability and remedies in such action are thus limited in comparison with tort remedi es. Redman v. John D. Brush &amp; Co., 111 F.3d 1174, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 8812 (4th Cir. 1997). The essential purpose of the requirement of conspicuousness is to protect the buyer from surprise. Lacks v. Bottled Gas Corp., 215 Va. 94, 205 S.E.2d 671, 1974 Va. LEXIS 237 (1974). Whether a provision is conspicuous is a question of law for a court. Armco, Inc. v. New H orizon Dev. Co., 229 Va. 561, 331 S.E.2d 456, 1985 Va. LEXIS 232 (1985). Where excluding language in the contract is in larger type, it is conspicuous as a matte r of law. Armco, Inc. v. New Horizon Dev. Co., 229 Va. 561, 331 S.E.2d 456, 1985 Va. LEXIS 232 (1985). Subsection (2) controls in case of conflict with § 11-4.  Section 11-4, which specifies sizes of type in printed contracts, was inconsistent with subsection (2), which requires that a limiting term or clause need only be conspicuous, and therefore, did not apply to a transaction to which subsection (2) was applicable. Armco, Inc. v. New Horizon Dev. Co., 229 Va. 561, 331 S.E.2d 456, 1985 Va. LEXIS 232 (1985). Language in disclaimer was n ot conspicuous.  Language of a disclaimer in print of the same size, style, and color as that used in most of the other provisions, immersed in the body of the contract failed of its purpose and was not conspicuous within the meaning of this section and was ineffective. Lacks v. Bottled Gas Corp., 215 Va. 94, 205 S.E.2d 671, 1974 Va. LEXIS 237 (1974). Implied warranties in a contract for sale of an RV were not effectively disclaimed under § 8.2-316(2), as they were not conspicuous as defined in § 8.1A-201 (b)(10) where the disclaimer clause was located in the middle of the back page of the buyers order; the language referring the buyer to the back page  the merger clause  was located in the middle of the front page in an extremely small font s ize; the signatures of the buyer and dealer were on the bottom of the first page, and no signatures or initials appeared on the back of the page; font and print colors sizes were the same; and the disclaimer clause was not set off from the other paragrap hs on the back side of the order in any distinctive way. Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). Basis of bargain oral statements not admissible to contradict warranty disclaimer.  Even if the oral representations made by defendants representative became the basis of the bargain and therefore constituted an express warranty, thos e oral statements would not be admissible to contradict or vary the disclaimer of express warranties clause contained in the integrated agreement between defendant and plaintiff. King Indus., Inc. v. Worlco Data Sys., 736 F. Supp. 114, 1989 U.S. Dist. LE XIS 17041 (E.D. Va. 1989), aff'd, 900 F.2d 253, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 4361 (4th Cir. 1990). Disclaimer effective as to remote us er.  Where a components manufacturer effectively disclaimed implied warranties as to the product manufacturer under §§ 8.2-316(2) and 8.1A-201(b)(10), then they were also disclaimed as to the buyer of the product (the remote user). Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). Any express oral warranties were effectively disclaimed.  Even if a seller made express oral warranties prior to the sale of an RV, they were effectively disclaimed under § 8.2-316(1) by a merger clause in the purchas e contract pursuant to § 8.2-202 and thus, the sellers motion to dismiss a claim for breach of express warranties was granted. Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). Examination precludes implied warranty for defects which should have been revealed.  When a buyer before entering into a contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desires or has refused to examine the goods, there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him. Virginia Transformer Corp. v. P.D. George Co., 932 F. Supp. 156, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10255 (W.D. Va. 1996). No public policy reasons sufficient to prohibit exclusion of implied warranties.  What is crucially important about the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code is that if the legislature did not in 1964, when it adopted the Code, recognize the existence of public policy reasons sufficient to require it to say that there shall be no exclusion of implied warranties of fitness in the sale of personal property, then certainly this court cannot say that such reasons existed in 1962, when a controve rsy as to whether a new car warranty excluded implied warranties had its beginning. Marshall v. Murray Oldsmobile Co., 207 Va. 972, 154 S.E.2d 140, 1967 Va. LEXIS 165 (1967). Seller s fraud may be shown notwithstanding sale as is.  A buyer can show that a contract of sale was induced by the sellers fraud, notwithstanding the fact the sale was made as is. This is true even though the written contract contains covenants waiving warranties or disclaiming or limiting liabilities. ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-317"><akn:num>§ 8.2-317</akn:num><akn:heading>Cumulation and conflict of warranties express or implied</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Warranties whether express or implied shall be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if such construction is unreasonable the intention of the parties shall determine which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply: (a) Exac t or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description. (b) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: On cumulation of warranties, see Sections 14, 15, and 16, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten into one section. Purposes of changes: 1. The present section rests on the basic policy of this Article that no warranty is created except by some conduct (either affirmative action or failure to discl ose) on the part of the seller. Therefore, all warranties are made cumulative unless this construction of the contract is impossible or unreasonable. This Article thus follows the general policy of the Uniform Sales Act except that in case of the sale of an article by its patent or trade name the elimination of the warranty of fitness depends solely on whether the buyer has relied on the sellers skill and judgment; the use of the patent or trade name is but one factor in making this determination. 2. The rules of this section are designed to aid in determining the intention of the parties as to which of inconsistent warranties which have arisen from the cir cumstances of their transaction shall prevail. These rules of intention are to be applied only where factors making for an equitable estoppel of the seller do not exist and where he has in perfect good faith made warranties which later turn out to be inc onsistent. To the extent that the seller has led the buyer to believe that all of the warranties can be performed, he is estopped from setting up any essential inconsistency as a defense. 3. The rules in subsections (a), (b) and (c) are designed to ascertain the intention of the parties by reference to the factor which probably claimed the attentio n of the parties in the first instance. These rules are not absolute but may be changed by evidence showing that the conditions which existed at the time of contracting make the construction called for by the section inconsistent or unreasonable. Cross references: Point 1: Section 2-315. Definitional cross reference: Party. Section 1-201. VIRGINIA COMMENT Virginia, in accordance with this section, has recognized that warranties, when consistent, are cumulative. In Greenland Development Corp. v. Allied Heating Produ cts Co., 184 Va. 588, 597, 35 S.E.2d 801 (1945), 164 A.L.R. 1312 (1946), Note, 32 Va. L. Rev. 679 (1946), the court, saying that the precise question was one of first impression, said: Since the express warranty . . . is in no wise inconsistent with the implied warranty of fitness . . . both were binding on the seller. See also E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Universal Moulded Products Corp., 191 Va. 525, 566, 62 S.E.2d 233 (1955). The provision in subsection 8.2-317(c) that an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose prevails over an inconsistent express warranty changes the dic tum in Greenland Development Corp. v. Allied Heating Products Co., 184 Va. 588, 596-97, 35 S.E.2d 801 (1945), 164 A.L.R. 1312 (1946), Note, 32 Va. L. Rev. 679 (1946), to the effect that an express warranty prevails over an inconsistent implied warranty. § 8.2-317.1. Use of warranty registration cards. Text A. As used in this section, warranty registration card means a card or similar device that is provided to the purchaser of personal, family, or household goods with a statement that the purchasers return of the warranty registration card shortly after purc hase of the goods is a condition precedent to warranty coverage and performance. B. Unless any requirement that the purchaser of personal, family, or household goods return a warranty registration card as a condition precedent to warranty coverage and performance is conspicuously disclosed in any advertising and marketing materials that reference the goods warranty, a seller may not condition the coverage or performance of a warranty upon the return by the purchaser of a warranty registration card, or provide that the duration of a warranty is dependent upon the return by the purchaser of a w arranty registration card. C. This sectio n does not prohibit the use of warranty registration cards where a seller suggests use of the card as one possible means of proof of the date the goods were purchased. Any such suggestion to the purchaser shall include notice that failure to return the c ard will not affect rights under the warranty, if the purchaser can establish with reasonable certainty the date the goods were purchased. D. A violation of this section constitutes a prohibited practice under the Virginia Consumer Protection Act (§ 59.1-196 et seq.).

Section 8-654.3, Code 1950, was substituted for the first alternative version of this section appearing in the official text of the Uniform Commercial Code, which read as follows: § 2-318. Third Party Beneficiaries of Warranties Express or Implied. A sellers warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit t he operation of this section. Section 8-654.3, referred to in the Virginia Comment, was repealed by Acts 1977, c. 617. Law Review.

Food, §§ 6-9; 13B M.J. Negligence, § 14. CASE NOTES Section 8.01-223 is a companion statute to this section. Bryant Elec. Co. v. City of Fred ericksburg, 762 F.2d 1192, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 31288 (4th Cir. 1985). The legislature intended § 8.01-223 and this section to apply prospectively only from the dates of their enactments. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 754 F.2d 1111, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 28168 (4th Cir. 1985). This section, abolishing the privity requirement, would not apply retroactively to an injury incurred after the enactment of the statute but caused by a product m anufactured and transferred prior to the statutes enactment. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 754 F.2d 1111, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 28168 (4th Cir. 1985). The legislature intended that this section apply only from the date of its enactment. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 722 F.2d 74, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 14855 (4th Cir. 1983). It does not operate retroactively. Cook v. G.M. Diehl Mach. Works, 563 F. Supp. 281, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16892 (W.D. Va. 1983). Section not to be exte nded beyond express terms.  This section is in derogation of the common-law privity requirement; under Virginias rules of statutory construction, it is not to be extended beyond its expr ess terms. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 722 F.2d 74, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 14855 (4th Cir. 1983). Privity still necessary for economic loss recovery.  This section eliminates the privity requirement in an action for damages for physical injury to person or property, but not in an action to recover purely economi c loss damages. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R. v. Davis Indus., Inc., 787 F. Supp. 572, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3771 (E.D. Va. 1992). This section is to be read the same way as the more general statute abolishing the requirement of privity in actions for injury to person or property to the exten t it applies to economic loss in negligence actions. In other words, this section does not abrogate the privity requirement in such circumstances. Beard Plumbing &amp; Heating v. Thompson Plastics, 152 F.3d 313, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 18363 (4th Cir. 1998). Privity is required to recover economic loss under § 8.2-715(2) due to the breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, notwithstanding the language of this section. Beard Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. v. Thompson Plastics, Inc., 254 Va. 240, 491 S.E.2d 731, 19 97 Va. LEXIS 79 (1997). Homebuilder failed to state a claim against a stucco manufacturer for breach of an implied warranty, as the damages to the builder were consequential, and privity was required to recover economic loss, under § 8.2-715(2), due to an alleged breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; because § 8.2-715 2 a addressed in a specific way the subject of the ability to raise the common law requirement of pri vity as a defense and § 8.2-318 addressed the subject in a general way, § 8.2-715(2) a prevailed. Pulte Home Corp. v. Parex, Inc., 265 Va. 518, 579 S.E.2d 188, 2003 Va. LEXIS 51 (2003). Plaintiffs breach of warranty claim against defendant rip-saw manufacturer was dismissed due to lack of privity between plaintiffs decedent and defendant because plaintiff could not show the product was manufactured or sold before Virginias first anti-privity statute was enacted in 1962, and unlike for negligence claims, the inherently dangerous product exception to the privity requirement does not ap ply to warranty claims. Powell v. Diehl Woodworking Mach., Inc., 198 F. Supp. 3d 628, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103434 (E.D. Va. 2016). The limited contract requirement of Section 8.2-715(2) prevails over the general provisi ons relating to common law privity in this section. Beard Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. v. Thompson Plastics, Inc., 254 Va. 240, 491 S.E.2d 731, 1997 Va. LEXIS 79 (1997). This section does not create for the benefit of nonpurchasing users an independent warranty of merchantability but rather simply preserves for remote users the warranties already enjoyed by an immediate purchaser. Buettner v. R.W. Martin &amp; Sons, 47 F.3d 116, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 2801 (4th Cir. 1995). Virginias version of the Uniform Commercial Code strips a defendant of the defense of lack of privity. Matthews v. Ford Motor Co., 479 F.2d 399, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9835 (4th Cir. 1973). Virginia has expressly abolished any vertical privity requirement in actions for breach of warranty. Bly v. Otis Elevator Co., 713 F.2d 1040, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 25185 (4th Cir. 1983), different results reached on reh'g, 754 F.2d 1111, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 28168 (4th Cir. 1985). Manufacturer may not assert the defense of vertical privity against a consumer. Harris v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 550 F. Supp. 1024, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15806 (W.D. Va. 1982). Seller s disclaimer of warranty against third parties.  Absent an express statement from Virginia courts to the effect that sellers express disclaimers of warranty were not effective against third party users, the district court would not unilaterally establish the principle that sellers disclaimers of implied warranties do not run to third parties. Buettner v. Super Laundry Mach., 857 F. Supp. 471, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14469 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd sub no m. Buettner v. R. W. Martin &amp; Sons, 47 F.3d 116, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 2801 (4th Cir. 1995). Where plaintiff was a third party, not a party to the contract, the district court refused to hold that any exclusion of implied warranty is per se unconscionable with respect to third parties because they by definition were not a party to the contract. Buettner v. Super Laundry Mach., 857 F. Supp. 471, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14469 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd sub nom. Buettner v. R. W. Martin &amp; Sons, 47 F.3d 116, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 2801 (4th Cir. 1995). But see Reibold v. Simon Aerials, Inc., 859 F. Supp. 193, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10615 (E.D. Va. 1994). Privity in warranty actions against architects.  Neither § 8.01-223 nor this section alters the rule demanding privity of contract in warranty actions against architects. Gravely v. Providence Partnership, 54 9 F.2d 958, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 14606 (4th Cir. 1977). Privity not required of foreseeable user. This section allows foreseeable users of goods a remedy against the seller without regard to privity of contract. Blevins v. New Holland N. Am., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist.

Text (1) Unless oth erwise agreed the term F.O.B. (which means free on board) at a named place, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which (a) when the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at that place ship the goods in the manner provided in this title (§ 8.2-504) and bear the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of the carrier; or (b) when the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery of them in the manner provi ded in this title (§ 8.2-503): (c) when under either (a) or (b) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on board. If the term is F. O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this title on the form of bill of lading (§ 8.2-323). (2) Unless oth erwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means free alongside) at a named port, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which the seller must (a) at h is own expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel in the manner usual in that port or on a dock designated and provided by the buyer; and (b) obtain and tender a receipt for the goods in exchange for which the carrier is under a duty to issue a bill of lading. (3) Unless oth erwise agreed in any case falling within subsection (1) (a) or (c) or subsection (2) the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions for making delivery, including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading berth of the vessel and in an appropr iate case its name and sailing date. The seller may treat the failure of needed instructions as a failure of cooperation under this title (§ 8.2-311). He may also at his option move the goods in any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shipmen t. (4) Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 12, 21, 23. CASE NOTES Jurisdiction not established.  Fact that the risk of loss of goods shipped F.O.B. Danville passed from seller to out-of-state buyer when the goods were placed in the possession of the common ca rrier at Danville, pursuant to § 8.2-319(1)(a), and that technical acceptance of the order may have occurred in Virginia by sellers delivery of the panels to the carrier, was insufficient to establish that buyer had the necessary minimum contr acts with Virginia to satisfy due process and give Virginia courts jurisdiction. Danville Plywood Corp. v. Plain &amp; Fancy Kitchens, Inc., 218 Va. 533, 238 S.E.2d 800, 1977 Va. LEXIS 286 (1977). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. This section is intended to negate the uncommercial line of decision which treats an F.O.B. term as merely a price term. The distinctions taken in subsection (1) handle most of the issues which have on occasion led to the unfortunate judicial language just referred to. Other matters which have led to sound results being based on unhappy language in regard to F.O.B. clauses are dealt with in thi s Act by Section 2-311(2) (sellers option re arrangements relating to shipment) and Sections 2-614 and 615 (substituted performance and sellers excuse). 2. Subsection (1) (c) not only specifies the duties of a seller who engages to deliver F.O.B. vessel, or the like, but ought to make clear that no agreeme nt is soundly drawn when it looks to reshipment from San Francisco or New York, but speaks merely of F.O.B. the place. 3. The buyers obligations stated in subsection (1) (c) and subsection (3) are, as shown in the text, obligations of cooperation. The last sentence of subsecti on (3) expressly, though perhaps unnecessarily, authorizes the seller, pending instructions, to go ahead with such preparatory moves as shipment from the interior to the named point of delivery. The sentence presupposes the usual case in which instructio ns fail; a prior repudiation by the buyer, giving notice that breach was intended, would remove the reason for the sentence, and would normally bring into play, instead, the second sentence of Section 2-704, which duly calls for lessening damages . 4. The treatment of F.O.B. vessel in conjunction with F.A.S. fits, in regard to the need for payment against documents, with standard practice and case la w; but F.O.B. vessel is a term which by its very language makes express the need for an on board document. In this respect, that term is stricter than the ordinary overseas shipment contract (C.I.F., etc., Section 2-320). Cross references: Sections 2-311(3), 2-323, 2-503 and 2-504. Definitional cross references: Agreed. Section 1-201. Bill of lading. Section 1-201. Buyer. Section 2-103. Goods. Section 2-105. Seasonably. Section 1-204. Seller. Section 2-103. Term. Section 1-201. VIRGINIA COMMENT F.O.B. at a named place is a delivery term, even though only used in connection with a statement of the price. In Bott v. Snellenburg &amp; Co., Inc., 177 Va. 331, 33 8, 14 S.E.2d 372 (1941), on a construction of the contract as a whole, the term F.O.B. was found to be a delivery term, but the court quoted a definition in which it was said that F.O.B. used in connection with the price of goods is a price term and not a delivery term. A contrary agreement was also found in Rountree v. Graham, 144 Va. 145, 148-50, 131 S.E. 193 (1926). The UCC rejects this approach as uncommercial. See also Geoghegan Sons &amp; Co. v. Arbuckle Bros., 139 Va. 92, 101-04, 123 S.E. 387, 36 A.L .R. 399 (1924); Lawson v. Hobbs, 120 Va. 690, 693-95, 91 S.E. 750 (1917); Aspegren &amp; Co. v. Wallerstein Produce Co., 111 Va. 570, 572-73, 69 S.E. 597 (1911). The UCC is in accord with Lawson v. Hobbs, 120 Va. 690, 692-93, 91 S.E. 750 (1917), in which the court approved this statement: a sale f.o.b. cars means that the subject of the sale is to be placed on the cars for shipment without any expense or act on the part of the buyer, although this case involved an f.o.b. Suffolk rather than an f.o.b. cars term. See also Birdsong and Co., Inc. v. Am erican Peanut Corp., 149 Va. 755, 766-67, 141 S.E. 759 (1928). Virginia has recognized that the buyer must give any necessary shipping instructions. James River Lumber Co. v. Smith Bros., 135 Va. 406, 413-14, 116 S.E. 241 (19 23). A seller has not complied with an F.O.B. contract if he instructs the carrier to hold the goods until the seller hears that his draft has been paid. Fulton v. W. R. Grace Co., 143 Va. 12, 23-24, 129 S.E. 374 (1925).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-320"><akn:num>§ 8.2-320</akn:num><akn:heading>C</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>I.F. and C. &amp; F. terms. Text (1) The term C .I.F. means that the price includes in a lump sum the cost of the goods and the insurance and freight to the named destination. The term C. &amp; F. or C.F. means that the price so includes cost and freight to the named destination. (2) Unless oth erwise agreed and even though used only in connection with the stated price and destination, the term C.I.F. destination or its equivalent requires the seller at his own expense and risk to (a) put the goods into the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to the named destination; and (b) load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for; and (c) obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of th e contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the seller may add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and (d) prepare an invoice of the goods and procure any other documents required to effect shipment or to comply with the contract; and (e) forward and tender with commercial promptness all the documents in due form and with any endorsement necessary to perfect the buyers rights. (3) Unless oth erwise agreed the term C. &amp; F. or its equivalent has the same effect and imposes upon the seller the same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the obligation as to insurance. (4) Under the term C.I.F. or C. &amp; F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 12. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: To make it clear that: 1. The C.I.F. contract is not a destination but a shipment contract with risk of subsequent loss or damage to the goods passing to the buyer upon shipment if the seller has properly performed all his obligations with respect to the goods. Delivery to the carrier is delivery to the buyer for purposes of risk and title. Delivery of possession of the goods is accomplished by delivery of the bill of lading, a nd upon tender of the required documents the buyer must pay the agreed price without awaiting the arrival of the goods and if they have been lost or damaged after proper shipment he must seek his remedy against the carrier or insurer. The buyer has no ri ght of inspection prior to payment or acceptance of the documents. 2. The sellers obligations remain the same even though the C.I.F. term is used only in connection with the stated price and destination. 3. The insurance stipulated by the C.I.F. term is for the buyers benefit, to protect him against the risk of loss or damage to the goods in transit. A clause in a C.I.F. contract insurancefor the account of sellers should be viewed in its ordinary mercantile meaning that the sellers must pay for the insurance and not that it is intended to run to the sellers benefit. 4. A bill of lading covering the entire transportation from the port of shipment is explicitly required but the provision on this point must be read in the light of its reason to assure the buyer of as full protection as the conditions of shipment reasonably permit, remembering always that this type of contract is designed to move the goods in the channels commercially available. To enable the buyer to deal with the goods while they are afloat the bill of lading must be one that covers only the quantity of goods called for by the contract. The buyer is not required to accept his part of the goods without a bill of lading because the latter covers a larger quanti ty, nor is he required to accept a bill of lading for the whole quantity under a stipulation to hold the excess for the owner. Although the buyer is not compelled to accept either goods or documents under such circumstances he may of course claim his rig hts in any goods which have been identified to his contract. 5. The seller is given the option of paying or providing for the payment of freight. He has no option to ship freight collect unless the agreement so prov ides. The rule of the common law that the buyer need not pay the freight if the goods do not arrive is preserved. Unless the shipment has been sent freight collect the buyer is entitled to receive documentary evidence that he is not obligated to pay the freight; the s eller is therefore required to obtain a receipt showing that the freight has been paid or provided for. The usual notation in the appropriate space on the bill of lading that the freight has been prepaid is a sufficient receipt, as at common law. The phrase provided for is intended to cover the frequent situation in which the carrier extends credit to a shipper for the freight on successive shipments and receives periodical payments of the accrued freight charges from him. 6. The requirement that unless otherwise agreed the seller must procure insurance of a kind and on terms then current at the port for shipment in the usual am ount, in the currency of the contract, sufficiently shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading, applies to both marine and war risk insurance. As applied to marine insurance, it means such insurance as is usual or customary at the po rt for shipment with reference to the particular kind of goods involved, the character and equipment of the vessel, the route of the voyage, the port of destination and any other considerations that affect the risk. It is the substantial equivalent of th e ordinary insurance in the particular trade and on the particular voyage and is subject to agreed specifications of type or extent of coverage. The language does not mean that the insurance must be adequate to cover all risks to which the goods may be s ubject in transit. There are some types of loss or damage that are not covered by the usual marine insurance and are excepted in bills of lading or in applicable statutes from the causes of loss or damage for which the carrier or the vessel is liable. Su ch risks must be borne by the buyer under this Article. Insurance secured in compliance with a C.I.F. term must cover the entire transportation of the goods to the named destination. 7. An additional obligation is imposed upon the seller in requiring him to procure customary war risk insurance at the buyers expense. This changes the common law on the point. The seller is not required to assume the risk of including in the C.I.F. price the cost of such insurance, since it often fluctuates rapidly, but is required to treat it simply as a necessary for the buyers account. What war risk i nsurance is current or usual turns on the standard forms of policy or rider in common use. 8. The C.I.F. contract calls for insurance covering the value of the goods at the time and place of shipment and does not include any increase in market value dur ing transit or any anticipated profit to the buyer on a sale by him. The contract contemplates that before the goods arrive at their destination they may be sold again and again on C.I.F. terms and that the original policy of insur ance and bill of lading will run with the interest in the goods by being transferred to each successive buyer. A buyer who becomes the seller in such an intermediate contract for sale does not thereby, if his sub-buyer knows the circumstances, undertake to insure the goods again at an increased price fixed in the new contract or to cover the increase in price by additional insurance, and his buyer may not reject the documents on the ground that the original policy does not cover such higher price. If su ch a sub-buyer desires additional insurance he must procure it for himself. Where the seller exercises an option to ship freight collect and to credit the buyer with the freight against the C.I.F. price, the insurance need not cov er the freight since the freight is not at the buyers risk. On the other hand, where the seller prepays the freight upon shipping under a bill of lading requiring prepayment and providing that the freight shall be deemed earned and shall be retained by the carrier ship and/or cargo lost or not lost, or using words of similar import, he must procure insurance that will cover the freight, because notwithstanding that the goods are lost in transit the buyer is bound to pay the freight as part o f the C.I.F. price and will be unable to recover it back from the carrier. 9. Insurance for the account of whom it may concern is usual and sufficient. However, for a valid tender the policy of insurance must be one which can be disposed of together with the bill of lading and so must be sufficiently shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading. It must cover separately the quantity of goods called for by the buyers contract and not merely insure his g oods as part of a larger quantity in which others are interested, a case provided for in American mercantile practice by the use of negotiable certificates of insurance which are expressly authorized by this section. By usage these certificates are treat ed as the equivalent of separate policies and are good tender under C.I.F. contracts. The term certificate of insurance, however, does not of itself include certificates or cover notes issued by the insurance broker and stating that the g oods are covered by a policy. Their sufficiency as substitutes for policies will depend upon proof of an established usage or course of dealing.

(1) Wher e the price is based on or is to be adjusted according to net landed weights, delivered weights, out turn quantity or quality or the like, unless otherwise agreed the seller must reasonably estimate the price. The payment due on t ender of the documents called for by the contract is the amount so estimated, but after final adjustment of the price a settlement must be made with commercial promptness. (2) An agreement described in subsection (1) or any warranty of quality or condition of the goods on arrival places upon the seller the risk of ordinary deterioration, shrinkage and the like in transportation but has no effect on the place or time of identification to the contract for sale or delivery or on the passing of the risk of loss. (3) Unless otherwise agreed where the contract provides for payment on or after arrival of the goods the seller must before payment allow such preliminary inspection as is feasible; but if the goods are lost delivery of the documents and payment are due when the goods should have arrived. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 12. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: This section deals with two variations of the C.I.F. contract which have evolved in mercantile practice but are entirely consistent with the basic C.I.F. pattern. Subsections (1) and (2), which provide for a shift to the seller of the risk of quality and weight deterioration during shipment, are designed to conform the law to the best mercantile practice and usage without changing the legal consequences of the C. I.F. or C. &amp; F. term as to the passing of marine risks to the buyer at the point of shipment. Subsection (3) provides that where under the contract documents are to be presented for payment after arrival of the goods, this amounts merely to a postponemen t of the payment under the C.I.F. contract and is not to be confused with the no arrival, no sale contract. If the goods are lost, delivery of the documents and payment against them are due when the goods should have arrived. The clause for payme nt on or after arrival is not to be construed as such a condition precedent to payment that if the goods are lost in transit the buyer need never pay and the seller must bear the loss.

(2) Under such a term unless otherwise agreed (a) the seller must discharge all liens arising out of the carriage and furnish the buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to deliver the goods; and (b) the risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ships tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 12, 19. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. The delivery term, ex ship as between seller and buyer, is the reverse of the f.a.s. term covered. 2. Delivery need not be made from any particular vessel under a clause calling for delivery ex ship, even though a vessel on which shipment is to be made originally is named in the contract, unless the agreement by appropriate language, restricts the clause to delivery from a named vessel. 3. The appropriate place and manner of unloading at the port of destination depend upon the nature of the goods and the facilities and usages of the port. 4. A contract fixing a price ex ship with payment cash against documents calls only for such documents as are appropriate to the contract. Tender of a delivery order and of a receipt for the freight after the arrival of the carrying vessel is adequate. The seller is not required to tender a bill of lading as a document of title nor is he required to insure the goods for the buyers benefit, as the goods are not at the buyers risk during the voyage.

(2) Where in a case within subsection (1) a tangible bill of lading has been issued in a set of parts, unless otherwise agreed if the documents are not to be sent from abroad the buyer may demand tender of the full set; otherwise only one part of the bill of lading ne ed be tendered. Even if the agreement expressly requires a full set: (a) due tender of a single part is acceptable within the provisions of this title on cure of improper delivery (subsection (1) of § 8.2-508); and (b) even though the full set is demanded, if the documents are sent from abroad the person tendering an incomplete set may nevertheless require payment upon furnishing an indemnity whic h the buyer in good faith deems adequate. (3) A shipment by water or by air or a contract contemplating such shipment is overseas insofar as by usage of trade or agreement it is subject to the commercial, financing or shipping practices characteristic of international deep water commerce.

For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 12, 22. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. Subsection (1) follows the American rule that a regular bill of lading indicating delivery of the goods at the dock for shipment is sufficient, except under a term F.O.B. vessel. See Section 2-319 and comment thereto. 2. Subsection (2) deals with the problem of bills of lading covering deep water shipments, issued not as a single bill of lading but in a set of parts, each part referring to the other parts and the entire set constituting in commercial practice and at law a single bill of lading. Commercial practice in international commerce is to accept and pay against presentation of the first part of a set if the part is sent from overseas even though the contract of the buyer requires presentation of a full set of bills of lading provided adequate indemnity for the missing parts is forthcoming. This subsection codified that practice as between buyer and seller. Article 5 (Section 5-113) authorizes banks presenting drafts under letters of credit to give i ndemnities against the missing parts, and this subsection means that the buyer must accept and act on such indemnities if he in good faith deems them adequate. But neither this subsection nor Article 5 decides whether a bank which has issued a letter of credit is similarly bound. The issuing banks obligation under a letter of credit is independent and depends on its own terms. See Article 5. Cross references: Sections 2-508(2), 5-113.

History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 12, 19, 30. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. The no arrival, no sale term in a destination overseas contract leaves risk of loss on the seller but gives him an exemption from liability for non-delivery. Both the nature of the case and the duty of good faith require that the seller must not interfere with the arrival of the goods in any way. If the circumstances impose upon him the responsibility for making or arranging the shipment, he mu st have a shipment made despite the exemption clause. Further, the shipment made must be a conforming one, for the exemption under a no arrival, no sale term applies only to the hazards of transportation and the goods must be proper in all other respects. The reason of this section is that where the seller is reselling goods bought by him as shipped by another and this fact is known to the buyer, so that the seller is not under any obligation to make the shipment himself, the seller is entitled under the no arrival, no sale clause to exemption from payment of damages for non-delivery if the goods do not arrive or if the goods which actually arrive are non- conforming. This does not extend to sellers who arrange shipment by their own agents, in which case the clause is limited to casualty due to marine hazards. But sellers who make known that they are contracting only with respect to what will be delivered to them by parties over whom they assume no control are entitled to the full quantum of the exemption. 2. The provisions of this Article on identification must be read together with the present section in order to bring the exemption into application. Until there i s some designation of the goods in a particular shipment or on a particular ship as being those to which the contract refers there can be no application of an exemption for their non-arrival. 3. The sellers duty to tender the agreed or declared goods if they do arrive is not impaired because of their delay in arrival or by their arrival after trans shipment. 4. The phrase to arrive is often employed in the same sense as no arrival, no sale and may then be given the same effect. But a to arrive term, added to a C.I.F. or C. &amp; F. contract, does not have the full meaning given by this section to no arrival, no sale. Such a to arrive term is usually intended to operate only to the extent that the risks are not covered by the agreed insurance and the loss or casualty is due to such uncovered hazards. In some instances the to arrive term may be regarded as a time of payment term, or, in the case of the reselling seller discussed in point 1 above, as negating responsibility f or conformity of the goods, if they arrive, to any description which was based on his good faith belief of the quality. Whether this is the intention of the parties is a question of fact based on all the circumstances surrounding the resale and in case o f ambiguity the rules of Sections 2-316 and 2-317 apply to preclude dishonor. 5. Paragraph (b) applies where goods arrive impaired by damage or partial loss during transportation and makes the policy of this Article on casualty to identifie d goods applicable to such a situation. For the term cannot be regarded as intending to give the seller an unforeseen profit through casualty; it is intended only to protect him from loss due to causes beyond his control.

(2) The delive ry to seller of a proper letter of credit suspends the buyers obligation to pay. If the letter of credit is dishonored, the seller may on seasonable notification to the buyer require payment directly from him. (3) Unless oth erwise agreed the term letter of credit or bankers credit in a contract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute. The term confirmed credit means that the credit must also carry th e direct obligation of such an agency which does business in the sellers financial market. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 12. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: To express the established commercial and banking understanding as to the meaning and effects of terms calling for letters of credit or confirmed credit: 1. Subsection (2) follows the general policy of this Article and Article 3 (Section 3-802) on conditional payment under which payment by check or other short-term instrument is not ordinarily final as between the parties if the recipient duly presents the instrument and honor is refused. Thus the furnishing of a letter of credit does not substitute the financing agencys obligation for the buyers, but the seller must first give the buyer reasonable notice of his intention to demand direct payment from him. 2. Subsection (3) requires that the credit be irrevocable and be a prime credit as determined by the standing of the issuer. It is not necessary, unless otherwise agreed, that the credit be a negotiation credit; the seller can finance himself by an assignment of the proceeds under Section 5-116(2). 3. The definition of confirmed credit is drawn on the supposition that the credit is issued by a bank which is not doing direct business in the seller s financial market; there is no intention to require the obligation of two banks both local to the seller.

CASE NOTES Not a sale or return transaction.  Evidence did not support a sale or return transaction, as there was no evidence of an obligation to pay for the goods; there was no evidence of an invoice being prepared, sent or paid. No terms of a sale or return were established, such as the time period within which the goods could be returned; further, there was a limited time period for the consignment, but the goods were never returned even t hough the time had expired. In re Niblett, 441 Bankr. 490, 2009 Bankr. LEXIS 3752 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2009). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 19(3), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten in this and the succeeding section. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. Both a sale on approval and sale or return should be distinguished from other types of transactions with which they frequently have been confus ed. A sale on approval, sometimes also called a sale on trial or on satisfaction, deals with a contract under which the seller undertakes a risk in order to satisfy its prospective buyer with the appearance or performance of the g oods that are sold. The goods are delivered to the proposed purchaser but they remain the property of the seller until the buyer accepts them. The price has already been agreed. The buyers willingness to receive and test the goods is the consideratio n for the sellers engagement to deliver and sell. A sale or return, on the other hand, typically is a sale to a merchant whose unwillingness to buy is overcome only by the sellers engagement to take back the goods (or any commercial unit of goods) in lieu of payment if they fail to be resold. A sale or return is a present sale of goods which may be undone at the buyers option. Accordingly, subsection (2) provides that goods delivered on approval are not subject to the prospective buy ers creditors until acceptance, and goods delivered in a sale or return are subject to the buyers creditors while in the buyers possession. These two transactions are so strongly delineated in practice and in general understanding that every presumption runs against a delivery to a consumer being a sale or return and against a delivery to a merchant for resale being a sale on approval. 2. The right to return the goods for failure to conform to the contract does not make the transaction a sale on approval or sale or return and has nothing to do with this section or section 2-327. This section is not concerned with remedies for breach of contract. It deals instead with a power given by the contract to turn back the goods even though they are wholly as warranted. This section never theless pre-supposes that a contract for sale is contemplated by the parties although that contract may be of the peculiar character that this section addresses (i.e., a sale on approval or a sale or return). If a buyers obligation as a buyer is conditioned not on his personal approval but on the articles passing a described objective test, the risk of loss by casualty pending the test is properly the sellers and proper return is at his expense. On the point of satisfaction as meaning reasonable satisfaction when an industrial machine is involved, this Article takes no position. 3. Subsection (3) resolves a conflict in the pre-UCC case law by recognizing that an or return provision is so definitely at odds with any ordinary contra ct for sale of goods that if a written agreement is involved the or return term must be contained in a written memorandum. The or return aspect of a sales contract must be treated as a separate contract under the Statute of Frauds section and as contradicting the sale insofar as questions of parole or extrinsic evidence are concerned. 4. Certain true consignment transactions were dealt with in former Sections 2-326(3) and 9-114. These provisions have been deleted and have been replaced by new p rovisions in Article 9. See, e.g., Sections 9-109(a)(4); 9-103(d); 9-319. Cross references: Point 2: Article 9. Point 3: Sections 2-201 and 2-202. Definitional cross references: Between merchants. Section 2-104. Buyer.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Under prior Virginia law, compliance with the Traders Act, Code 1950, § 55-152, was the exclusive method for persons who consigned goods for sale to obtain protection from the creditors of the consignee. Under the UCC, the consignor has two additional methods of protection, perfection of a security interest under Title 8.9 or establishing that the consignee is generally known by his creditors to be substan tially engaged in selling the goods of others.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-327"><akn:num>§ 8.2-327</akn:num><akn:heading>Special incidents of sale on approval and sale or return</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Under a sa le on approval unless otherwise agreed (a) alth ough the goods are identified to the contract the risk of loss and the title do not pass to the buyer until acceptance; and (b) use of the goods consistent with the purpose of trial is not acceptance but failure seasonably to notify the seller of election to return the goods is acceptance, and if the goods c onform to the contract acceptance of any part is acceptance of the whole; and (c) after due notification of election to return, the return is at the sellers risk and expense but a merchant buyer must follow any reasonable instructions. (2) Under a sa le or return unless otherwise agreed (a) the option to return extends to the whole or any commercial unit of the goods while in substantially their original condition, but must be exercised seasonably; and (b) the return is at the buyers risk and expense. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 12, 18, 19, 26. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 19(3), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten in preceding and this section. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. In the case of a sale on approval: If all of the goods involved conform to the contract, the buyers acceptance of part of the goods constitutes acceptance of the whole. Acceptance of part falls outside the normal intent of the parties in the on approval situation and the policy of this Article allowing partial acceptance of a defective delivery has no application here. A case where a buyer takes home two dresses to select one commonly involves two distinct contracts; if not, it is covered by the words unless otherwise agreed. 2. In the case of a sale or return, the return of any unsold unit merely because it is unsold is the normal intent of the sale or return provision, and th erefore the right to return for this reason alone is independent of any other action under the contract which would turn on wholly different considerations. On the other hand, where the return of goods is for breach, including return of items resold by t he buyer and returned by the ultimate purchasers because of defects, the return procedure is governed not by the present section but by the provisions on the effects and revocation of acceptance. 3. In the case of a sale on approval the risk rests on the seller until acceptance of the goods by the buyer, while in a sale or return the risk remains throughou t on the buyer. 4. Notice of election to return given by the buyer in a sale on approval is sufficient to relieve him of any further liability. Actual return by the buyer to the seller is required in the case of a sale or return contract. What constitutes due giving of notice, as required in on approval sales, is governed by the provisions on good faith and notice. Seasonable is used here as defined in Se ction 1-204. Nevertheless, the provisions of both this Article and of the contract on this point must be read with commercial reason and with full attention to good faith.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Subsection 8.2-327(1)(b) is in accord with prior Virginia law, although the Virginia court put the rule in affirmative languagea retention beyond a reasonable time constitutes an acceptance. Dimos v. Stowe, 193 Va. 831, 836-37, 71 S.E.2d 186 (1952); Brown v. Austin-Western Co., 111 Va. 209, 212, 68 S.E. 184 (1910). The UCC does not expressly state whether the buyers nonapproval is conclusive regardless of his good or bad faith, where he is to keep the goods if they are s atisfactory. Under prior Virginia law the buyer must act in good faith. Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co. v. Carpenter &amp; Co., 99 Va. 292, 293-97, 38 S.E. 143 (1901); Carpenter &amp; Co. v. Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co., 98 Va. 177, 182-85, 35 S.E. 358 (1900). A similar rule of good faith may be continued under the general obligation of good faith required by § 8.1-203.

(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner.

(3) Such a sal e is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer c alls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneers announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidders re traction does not revive any previous bid. (4) If the auc tioneer knowingly receives a bid on the sellers behalf or the seller makes or procures such a bid, and notice has not been given that liberty for such bidding is reserved, the buyer may at his option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of t he last good faith bid prior to the completion of the sale. This subsection shall not apply to any bid at a forced sale. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Law Review. For survey of Virginia commercial law for the year 1971-1972, see 58 Va. L.

CASE NOTES There is no rigidly prescribed prerequisite for the conclusion of an auction sale of real property.  The literal fall of the hammer, although commonly employed in practice and frequently alluded to in the decided cases, has never been regarded as essentia l to a valid sale. All that is necessary is that the auctioneer, after receiving the apparent last and highest bid, give clear notice of his or her intention to accept it if no higher bids are forthcoming, giving those present a fair opportunity to submi t higher bids and then, if none is forthcoming, announce in some clear and unequivocal manner that the highest bid is accepted and the sale completed.

However, to vest the auctioneer crying a sale of land with the same discretion to reopen bidding that he has in the sale of goods is to achieve uniformity and, of more importance, to recognize a rule which is both necessary and fair. Hoffman v. Horton, 212 Va. 565, 186 S.E.2d 79, 1972 Va. LEXIS 209 (1972). Auction with reserve.  Trial court erred in ruling that the auction was an absolute auction. As the auction remained an auction with reserve, Va. Code Ann. §§ 54.1-600, 8.2-328(2) , appellant was permitted to withdraw the property at any time prior to the fall of the hammer, which he clearly did by declaring that there would be no sale; therefore, no contract was formed between the parties because appellants declaration of no sale amounted to a rejection of appellees offer of $ 35,000 for the Property. Williams v. Janson, 878 S.E.2d 714, 2022 Va. LEXIS 71 (Va. 2022). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 21, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rewritten. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. The auctioneer may in his discretion either reopen the bidding or close the sale on the bid on which the hammer was falling when a bid is made at that moment. The recognition of a bid of this kind by the auctioneer in his discretion does not mean closing in favor of such a bidder, but only that the bid has been accepted as a continuation of the bidding. If recognized, such a bid discharges the bid on which the hammer was falling when it was made. 2. An auction with reserve is the normal procedure. The crucial point, however, for determining the nature of an auction is the putting up of the goods. This Article accepts the view that the goods may be withdrawn before they are actually put up, regardless of whether the auction is advertised as one without reserve, without liability on the part of the auction announcer to persons who ar e present. This is subject to any peculiar facts which might bring the case within the firm offer principle of this Article, but an offer to persons generally would require unmistakable language in order to fall within that section. The prior ann ouncement of the nature of the auction either as with reserve or without reserve will, however, enter as an explicit term in the putting up of the goods and conduct thereafter must be governed accordingly. The present section continued th e prior rule permitting withdrawal of bids in auctions both with and without reserve; and the rule is made explicit that the retraction of a bid does not revive a prior bid.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Subsection 8.2-328(4) is in accord with prior Virginia law in undertaking to protect buyers at auction sales from having the price bid up by the seller who has no t given notice of reserving liberty to make such bids. Edmunds v. Gwynn, 157 Va. 528, 541-44, 159 S.E. 205, 161 S.E. 892 (1931), like the UCC, allows the buyer to rescind the purchase where there has been illegal puffing on the sellers behalf. See al so Hinde v. Pendleton, Wythe 354, 355-57 (1799). The UCC does not cover unlawful combinations between the auctioneer and the purchaser, Brock v. Rice, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 812, 816-20 (1876), or unlawful combinati ons among purchasers, Underwood v. McVeigh, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 409, 428-29 (1873). PART 4.

Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this title and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply: (1) Titl e to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (§ 8.2-501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this act. Any retention or r eservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the title on secured transactions (Title 8.9A), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties. (2) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods , despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading: (a) if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but (b) if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there. (3) Unless other explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods, (a) if the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or (b) if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting. (4) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance, revests title to the goods in the seller . Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a sale. History History. 1964, c. 219; 2004, c. 200. Annotations The 2004 amendments.

Initial bona fid e sale occurred at time of shipping.  Coal mine operator was not shipping coal to its customers for the purpose of cleaning but for the purpose of selling the coal to the customers and thus, it was at that moment that the initial bona fide sale occurred. The fact that the coal mine operator was paid on some basis other than the tons of actual raw coal shipped does not change this conclusion; the customer owned all the coal including the impurities.

Payment arrang ement did not affect passage of title.  The arrangement that coal mine operator and its customers had for determining the amount owed to coal mine operator was only the method of payment and did not alt er the fact that when coal mine operator loaded its coal on trucks or other means of transportation the coal was identified to the contract and title passed because coal mine operator had completed physical delivery of the goods. United States v. Rapoca Energy Co., 751 F. Supp. 565, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16122 (W.D. Va. 1990). Title passed at time of sale.  Trustees right to proceeds of sale of collateral of debtor was superior to that of other creditors holding a lien created by reason of a judgment and a relate d garnishment because an account within the meaning of § 8.9A-102(a)(2) came into existence at the moment that debtor accepted third party purchase orders for the collateral, at which time title passed to the third party buyers by operation of § 8.2-401(3)(b), and the trustees security interest attached thereto by operation of § 8.9A-203. The resulting right to payment and the funds used as payment were proceeds within the meaning of § 8.9A-102(64) in which the trustee ha d an interest superior to that of the competing creditors, and § 8.9A-317 did not require a different result given these facts.

Davies v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 350, 423 S.E.2d 839, 9 Va. Law Rep. 586, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 285 (1992). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: See generally, Sections 17, 18, 19 and 20, Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: To make it clear that: 1. This Article deals with the issues between seller and buyer in terms of step by step performance or non-performance under the contract for sale and not in term s of whether or not title to the goods has passed. That the rules of this section in no way alter the rights of either the buyer, seller or third parties declared elsewhere in the Article is made clear by the preamble of this section. This sectio n, however, in no way intends to indicate which line of interpretation should be followed in cases where the applicability of public regulation depends upon a sale or upon location of title without further definition. The basic po licy of this Article that known purpose and reason should govern interpretation cannot extend beyond the scope of its own provisions. It is therefore necessary to state what a sale is and when title passes under this Article in case the courts de em any public regulation to incorporate the defined term of the private law. 2. Future goods cannot be the subject of a present sale. Before title can pass the goods must be identified in the manner set forth in Section 2-501. The parties, however, have full liberty to arrange by specific terms for the passing of title to goods which are existing. 3. The special property of the buyer in goods identified to the contract is excluded from the definition of security interest; its incidents are d efined in provisions of this Article such as those on the rights of the sellers creditors, on good faith purchase, on the buyers right to goods on the sellers insolvency, and on the buyers right to specific performance or replevin. 4. The factual situations in subsections (2) and (3) upon which passage of title turn actually base the test upon the time when the seller has finally committed h imself in regard to specific goods. Thus in a shipment contract he commits himself by the act of making the shipment. If shipment is not contemplated subsection (3) turns on the sellers final commitment, i. e. the delivery of documents or the making of the contract.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Subsection (2)Section 26, Uniform Sales Act; Subsections (1) and (3)none. Changes: Rep hrased. Purposes of changes and new matter: To avoid confusion on ordinary issues between current sellers and buyers and issues in the field of preference and hindrance by making it clear that: 1. Local law on questions of hindrance of creditors by the sellers retention of possession of the goods are outside the scope of this Article, but retention o f possession in the current course of trade is legitimate. Transactions which fall within the laws policy against improper preferences are reserved from the protection of this Article. 2. The retention of possession of the goods by a merchant seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification in current course is exempted f rom attack as fraudulent. Similarly, the provisions of subsection (3) have no application to identification or delivery made in the current course of trade, as measured against general commercial understanding of what a current transaction is.

A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though (a) the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser, or (b) the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored, or (c) it was agreed that the transaction was to be a cash sale, or (d) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law. (2) Any entrus ting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business. (3) Entrus ting includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessors dis position of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.

CASE NOTES Transfer of title.  The statute deals with the power of an owner with void or voidable title to pass good title to a bona fide purchaser for value, and not with the rights of lien cr editors. Thus, this section did not apply where a lien was omitted from a duplicate certificate of title by the owners fraud, and the lienholder attempted to enforce its security interest against a subsequent bona fide purchaser; the owner had good t itle which was not made void or voidable by a security interest, and she passed a good title to the purchaser.

Purchaser of a limited interest.  Purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to transfer, except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased; therefore, where plaintiff attempted to sell assets encumbered by a lien to defendants through an asset purchase agreement, plaintiff did not have the power to transfer the assets and thus could not convey clear title t o defendants.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 20(4), 23, 24, 25, Uniform Sales Act; Section 9, especially 9(2), Uniform Trust Receipts Act; Section 9, Uniform Conditional Sales Act. Changes: Con solidated and rewritten. Purposes of changes: To gather together a series of prior uniform statutory provisions and the case law thereunder and to state a unified and simplified policy on good faith purchase of goods. 1. The basic policy of our law allowing transfer of such title as the transferor has is generally continued and expanded under subsection (1). In this respect the provisions of the section are applicable to a person taking by any form of purchase as defined by this Act. Moreover the policy of this Act expressly providing for the application of supplementary general principles of law to sales transactions wherever appropriate joins with the present section to continue unimpaired all rights acquired under the law of agency or of apparent agency or ownership or other estoppel, whether based on statutory provisions or on case law principles. The section also leaves unimpaired the powers given to selling factors under the earlier Factors Acts. In addition subsection (1) provides specifically for the protection of the good faith purchaser for value in a number of specific situations which have been troublesom e under prior law. On the other hand, the contract of purchase is of course limited by its own terms as in a case of pledge for a limited amount or of sale of a fractional interest in goods. 2. The many particular situations in which a buyer in ordinary course of business from a dealer has been protected against reservation of property or other hidden interest are gathered by subsections (2)-(4) into a single principle protecting persons who buy in ordinary course out of inventory. Consignors have no reason to complain, nor have lenders who hold a security interest in the inventory, since the very pu rpose of goods in inventory is to be turned into cash by sale. The principle is extended in subsection (3) to fit with the abolition of the old law of cash sale by subsection (1) (c). It is also freed from any technic alities depending on the extended law of larceny; such extension of the concept of theft to include trick, particular types of fraud, and the like is for the purpose of helping conviction of the offender; it has no proper application to the long-standing policy of civil protection of buyers from persons guilty of such trick or fraud. Finally, the policy is extended, in the interest of simplicity and sense, to any entrusting by a bailor; this is in consonance with the explicit provisions of Section 7-205 on the powers of a warehouseman who is also in the business of buying and selling fungible goods of the kind he warehouses. As to entrusting by a secured party, subsection (2) is limited by the more specific provisions of Section 9-307(1), which deny pr otection to a person buying farm products from a person engaged in farming operations. 3. The definition of buyer in ordinary course of business (Section 1-201) is effective here and preserves the essence of the healthy limitations engrafted by the case law on the older statutes. The older loose concept of good faith and wide definition of value combined to create apparent good faith purchasers in many situations in which the result outraged common sense; the courts solution was to prot ect the original title especially by use of cash sale or of over-technical construction of the enabling clauses of the statutes. But such rulings then turned into limitations on the proper protection of buyers in the ordinary market. Section 1-20 1(9) cuts down the category of buyer in ordinary course in such fashion as to take care of the results of the cases, but with no price either in confusion or in injustice to proper dealings in the normal market. 4. Except as provided in subsection (1), the rights of purchasers other than buyers in ordinary course are left to the Articles on Secured Transactions, Documents of Title, and Bulk Sales.

VIRGINIA COMMENT By implication the UCC recognizes, as has prior Virginia law, that a person without title cannot transfer title, even though the buyer has paid value in good fait h without notice of the lack of title. First National Bank of Waynesboro v. Johnson, 183 Va. 227, 236, 31 S.E.2d 581 (1944). The rights of purchasers under prior Virginia law has been determined on the basis of where title to the goods has been l ocated. In Old Dom. Steamship Co. v. Burckhordt, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 664, 668-69 (1879), the Supreme Court of Appeals said: If the transaction was a sale which transferred both title and possession, although such title and possession was obtained by f alse and fraudulent representations . . . the goods cannot be recovered from . . . the bona fide purchaser, who paid value for them without notice of such fraud . . . . If, on the other hand, there was no sale which, upon delivery, passed the title, but it was intended to pass the bare possession only, then the sale . . . could pass no title . . . , and [the seller] not having parted with the title, could claim the goods in the hands of whomsoever they might be found. Oberdorfer v. Meyer, 88 Va. 384 , 386, 13 S.E. 756 (1891), is to the same effect. Under subsection 8.2-403(2) the entrusting of goods to a merchant gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of busines s, but the situation when the person entrusted with the goods is not a merchant does not seem to be covered by the UCC. See Williams v. Given, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 268, 270-77 (1849). The UCC leaves unchanged the result in Peshine v. Shepperson, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 472, 482 (1867), in which the buyer was denied good title where he had surreptiti ously, at night, bought goods from a clerk and carried them away in satisfaction of debts owed to the buyer by the insolvent owner of the goods. Such a transaction would not be in good faith under the UCC. See Virginia Comment to § 8.1-201. This section apparently leaves unchanged the result in Philip Greenberg, Inc. v. Dunville, 166 Va. 398, 185 S.E. 892 (1936). In this case, Greenberg, through Dunv ille, as salesman for the Allied Company, bought some fixtures on a conditional sale contract, trading in his old fixtures. Under the contract, Greenberg was to ship the old fixtures as soon as the new fixtures were delivered. On delivery of the new fixt ures, Greenberg claimed that they were defective and refused to ship the old fixtures until an adjustment ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-501"><akn:num>§ 8.2-501</akn:num><akn:heading>Insurable interest in goods; manner of identification of goods</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are nonconforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such identificati on can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs (a) when the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified; (b) if the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph (c), when goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which t he contract refers; (c) when the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within twelve months after contrac ting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within twelve months or the next normal harvest season after contracting whichever is longer. (2) The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification i s final substitute other goods for those identified. (3) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Research References.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2A M.J. Assignments, § 9; 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 99 . CASE NOTES Initial bona fid e sale occurred at time of shipping.  Coal mine operator was not shipping coal to its customers for the purpose of cleaning but for the purpose of selling the coal to the customers and thus, it was at that moment that the initial bona fide sale occurred. The fact that the coal mine operator was paid on some basis other than the tons of actual raw coal shipped does not change this conclusion; the customer owned all the coal including the impurities. United States v. Rapoca Energy Co., 751 F. Supp. 565, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16122 (W.D. Va. 1990). Payment arrang ement did not affect passage of title.  The arrangement that coal mine operator and its customers had for determining the amount owed to coal mine operator was only the method of payment and did not alt er the fact that when coal mine operator loaded its coal on trucks or other means of transportation the coal was identified to the contract and title passed because coal mine operator had completed physical delivery of the goods.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Manner of identification of goods.  As a corporations specifically manufactured goods were identified prior to the time that a store claimed the corporation breached a contract, the corporation was entitled to recover the price of the materials and any incidental damages. Metwood, Inc. v. True Value Home Ctr., 61 Va. Cir. 664, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 321 (Roanoke Sept. 30, 2002). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: See Sections 17 and 19, Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: 1. The present section deals with the manner of identifying goods to the contract so that an insurable interest in the buyer and the rights set forth in the next section will accrue. Generally speaking, identification may be made in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. The rules of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) apply only in the absence of such explicit agreement. 2. In the ordinary case identification of particular existing goods as goods to which the contract refers is unambiguous and may occur in one of many ways. It is possible, however, for the identification to be tentative or contingent. In view of the limited effect given to identification by this Article the general policy is to resolve all doubts in favor of identification. 3. The provision of this section as to explicit agreement clarifies the present confusion in the law of sales which has arisen from the fact that under pr ior uniform legislation all rules of presumption with reference to the passing of title or to appropriation (which in turn depended upon identification) were regarded as subject to the contrary intention of the parties or of the party appropriating. Such uncertainty is reduced to a minimum under this section by requiring explicit agreement of the parties before the rules of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are displacedas they would be by a term giving the buyer power to select the goods. An  explicit agreement, however, need not necessarily be found in the terms used in the particular transaction. Thus, where a usage of the trade has previously been made explicit by reduction to a standard set of rules and regulations currently i ncorporated by reference into the contracts of the parties, a relevant provision of those rules and regulations is explicit within the meaning of this section. 4. In view of the limited function of identification there is no requirement in this section that the goods be in deliverable state or that all of the sellers duties with respect to the processing of the goods be completed in order that identification occur. For example, despite identification the risk of loss remains on the seller under the risk of loss provisions until completion of his duties as to the goo ds and all of his remedies remain dependent upon his not defaulting under the contract. 5. Undivided shares in an identified fungible bulk, such as grain in an elevator or oil in a storage tank can be sold. The mere making of the contract with refere nce to an undivided share in an identified fungible bulk is enough under subsection (a) to effect an identification if there is no explicit agreement otherwise. The sellers duty, however, to segregate and deliver according to the contract is not affe cted by such an identification but is controlled by other provisions of this Article. 6. Identification of crops under paragraph (c) is made upon planting only if they are to be harvested within the year or within the next normal harvest season. Th e phrase next normal harvest season fairly includes nursery stock raised for normally quick harvest, but plainly excludes a timber crop to which the concept of a harvest season is inapplicable. Paragraph (c) is also applicable to a crop of wool or the young of animals to be born within twelve months after contracting. The product of a lumbering, mining o r fishing operation, though seasonal, is not within the concept of growing. Identification under a contract for all or part of the output of such an operation can be effected early in the operation. Cross references: Point 1: Section 2-502.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Both the UCC and prior Virginia law provide that identification, or appropriation as it is called in the Virginia cases, of existing goods to a contract may be ma de at any time and in any manner expressly agreed upon by the parties. American Hide &amp; Leather Co. v. Chalkley &amp; Co., 101 Va. 458, 464, 44 S.E. 705 (1903). The UCC, in the absence of express agreement, provides rules to be followed in determining whether goods have been identified to a contract. While the Virginia cases speak in terms of the passage of title, the UCC states results without reference to the location of title. The UCC is in accord with Ellis &amp; Meyers Lumber Co. v. Hubbard, 123 Va. 481, 494-96, 96 S.E. 754 (1918), in which it was held that delivery of lumber to the place agreed upon by the seller and buyer constituted an identification, although the buyer was still to inspect the lumbertesting, measuring, recounting, and acceptingand the seller was still to deliver the lumber to the shipping point. Similarly, Dr ewry, Treasurer v. Baugh and Sons, Inc., 150 Va. 394, 403-05, 143 S.E. 713 (1928), held that there had been an identification of the goods to the contract and title had passed, although the goods were still in possession of the seller, being ready for lo ading. See also Trigg Co. v. Bucyrus Co., 104 Va. 79, 83-84, 51 S.E. 174 (1905), holding that there had been an appropriation of specific goods to a contract so that ownership passed to the vendee. In accord with this section, Broad Street Bank v. Baker Motor Vehicle Co., 119 Va. 26, 31, 89 S.E. 110 (1916), recognized that the property in goods not ascertain ed by the contract does not pass until there has been an appropriation of specific goods to the contract. In this case a second buyer, who obtained a car, prevailed over a first buyer, who had ordered the car. Subsection 8.2-501(2) is consistent with Trigg Co. v. Bucyrus Co., 104 Va. 79, 85, 51 S.E. 174 (1905), in recognizing that a seller may have an insurable interest in a chattel, even though title or ownership has passed to the buyer.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-502"><akn:num>§ 8.2-502</akn:num><akn:heading>Buyers right to goods on sellers repudiation, failure to deliver, or insolvency</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a special property under the provisions of the immediately preceding section (§ 8.2-501) may on making an d keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if: (a) in t he case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract; or (b) in all cases, the seller becomes insolvent within ten days after receipt of the first installment on their price.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 18-20, 33, 36. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Compare Sections 17, 18 and 19, Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: 1. This section gives an additional right to the buyer as a result of identification of the goods to the contract in the manner provided in Section 2-501. The buy er is given a right to recover the goods conditioned upon making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of the price, in two limited circumstances. First, the buyer may recover goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes if the sell er repudiates the contract or fails to deliver the goods. Second, in any case, the buyer may recover the goods if the seller becomes insolvent within 10 days after the seller receives the first installment on their price. The buyers right to recover the goods under this section is an exception to the usual rule, under which the disappointed buyer must resort to an action to recover damages. 2. The question of whether the buyer also acquires a security interest in identified goods and has rights to the goods when insolvency takes place after the ten-d ay period provided in this section depends upon compliance with the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9). 3. Under subsection (2), the buyers right to recover consumer goods under subsection (1)(a) vests upon acquisition of a special property, which occurs upon id entification of the goods to the contract. See Section 2-501. Inasmuch as a secured party normally acquires no greater rights in its collateral that its debtor had or had power to convey, see Section 2-403(1) (first sentence), a buyer who acquires a righ t to recover under this section will take free of a security interest created by the seller if it attaches to the goods after the goods have been identified to the contract. The buyer will take free, even if the buyer does not buy in ordinary course and even if the security interest is perfected. Of course, to the extent that the buyer pays the price after the security interest attaches, the payments will constitute proceeds of the security interest. 4. Subsection (3) is included to preclude the possibility of unjust enrichment, which would exist if the buyer were permitted to recover goods even though they we re greatly superior in quality or quantity to that called for by the contract for sale.

The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement a nd this title, and in particular: (a) tend er must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but (b) unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods. (2) Where the case is within the next section [§ 8.2-504] respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions. (3) Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section. (4) Where good s are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved: (a) tend er requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyers right to possession of the goods; but (b) tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and, except as oth erwise provided in Title 8.9A, receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyers rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable docume nt of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender. (5) Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents: (a) he m ust tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this title with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of § 8.2-323); and (b) tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes nonacceptance or rejection.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 12, 18, 22, 25. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: See Sections 11, 19, 20, 43 (3) and (4), 46 and 51, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: The general policy of the above sections is continued and supplemented but subsection (3) changes the rule of prior section 19(5) as to what constitutes a destination contract and subsection (4) incorporates a minor correction as to tender of delive ry of goods in the possession of a bailee. Purposes of changes: 1. The major general rules governing the manner of proper or due tender of delivery are gathered in this section. The term tender is used in this Article in two different senses. In one sense it refers to due tender which contemplates an offer coupled with a present ability to fulfill all the conditions resting on the tendering party and must be followed by actual performance if the other party sh ows himself ready to proceed. Unless the context unmistakably indicates otherwise this is the meaning of tender in this Article and the occasional addition of the word due is only for clarity and emphasis. At other times it is used to ref er to an offer of goods or documents under a contract as if in fulfillment of its conditions even though there is a defect when measured against the contract obligation. Used in either sense, however, tender connotes such performance by the tende ring party as puts the other party in default if he fails to proceed in some manner. 2. The sellers general duty to tender and deliver is laid down in Section 2-301 and more particularly in Section 2-507. The sellers right to a receipt if he demands one and receipts are customary is governed by Section 1-205. Subsection (1) of the present section proceeds to set forth two primary requirements of tender: first, that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyers disposition  and, second, that he give the buyer any notice reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. In cases in which payment is due and demanded upon delivery the buyers disposition is qualified by the sellers right to retain control of the good s until payment by the provision of this Article on delivery on condition. However, where the seller is demanding payment on delivery he must first allow the buyer to inspect the goods in order to avoid impairing his tender unless the contract for sale i s on C.I.F., C.O.D., cash against documents or similar terms negating the privilege of inspection before payment. In the case of contracts involving documents the seller can put and hold conforming goods at the buyers disposition under subsection (1) by tendering documents which give the buyer complete control of the goods under the provisions of Article 7 on due negotiation. 3. Under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) usage of the trade and the circumstances of the particular case determine what is a reasonable hour for tender and what c onstitutes a reasonable period of holding the goods available. 4. The buyer must furnish reasonable facilities for the receipt of the goods tendered by the seller under subsection (1), paragraph (b). This obligation of the bu yer is no part of the sellers tender. 5. For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) there is omitted from this Article the rule under prior uniform legislation that a term requiring the seller to pay the freight or cost of transportation to the buyer is equivalent to an agreement by the seller to deliver to the buyer or at an agreed destination. This omission is with the specific intention of negating the rule, for under this Article the shipmen t contract is regarded as the normal one and the destination contract as the variant type. The seller is not obligated to deliver at a named destination and bear the concurrent risk of loss until arrival, unless he has specifically agreed so to deliver or the commercial understanding of the terms used by the parties contemplates such delivery. 6. Paragraph (a) of subsection (4) continues the rule of the prior uniform legislation as to acknowledgment by the bailee. Paragraph (b) of subsection (4) adopts the rule that between the buyer and the seller the risk of loss remains on the seller during a period reasonable for securing acknowledgment of the transfer from the bailee, while as against all other parties the buyers rights are fixed as of the tim e the bailee receives notice of the transfer. 7. Under subsection (5) documents are never required except where there is an express contract term or it is plainly implicit in the peculiar circumstance s of the case or in a usage of trade. Documents may, of course, be authorized although not required, but such cases are not within the scope of this subsection. When documents are required, there are three main requirements of this subsection: (1 ) All: each required document is essential to a proper tender; (2) Such: the documents must be the ones actually required by the contract in terms of source and substance; (3) Correct form: All documents must be in correct form. When a prescribed document cannot be procured, a question of fact arises under the provision of this Article on substituted performance as to whether the agreed m anner of delivery is actually commercially impracticable and whether the substitute is commercially reasonable.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 46, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: To continue the general policy of the prior uniform statutory provision while incorporating certain modifications with respect to the requirement that the contract with the carrier be made expressly on behalf of the buyer and as to the neces sity of giving notice of the shipment to the buyer, so that: 1. The section is limited to shipment contracts as contrasted with destination contracts or contracts for delivery at the place where the goods ar e located. The general principles embodied in this section cover the special cases of F.O.B. point of shipment contracts and C.I.F. and C. &amp; F. contracts. Under the preceding section on manner of tender of delivery, due tender by the seller requires that he comply with the requirements of this section in appropriate cases. 2. The contract to be made with the carrier under paragraph (a) must conform to all express terms of the agreement, subject to any substitution necessary because of failure of agreed facilities as provided in the later provision on substituted performance. However, under the policies of this Article on good faith and commercial standards and on buyers rights on improper delivery, the requirements of explicit provisions must be read in terms of their commercial and not their literal meaning. This policy is made express with respect to bills of lading in a set in the provision of this Article on form of bills of lading required in overseas shipment. 3. In the absence of agreement, the provision of this Article on options and cooperation respecting performance gives the seller the choice of any reasonable carr ier, routing and other arrangements. Whether or not the shipment is at the buyers expense the seller must see to any arrangements, reasonable in the circumstances, such as refrigeration, watering of livestock, protection against cold, the sending alo ng of any necessary help, selection of specialized cars and the like for paragraph (a) is intended to cover all necessary arrangements whether made by contract with the carrier or otherwise. There is, however, a proper relaxation of such requirements if the buyer is himself in a position to make the appropriate arrangements and the seller gives him reasonable notice of the need to do so. It is an improper contract under paragraph (a) for the seller to agree with the carrier to a limited valuation below the true value and thus cut off the buyers opportunity to recover from the carrier in the event of loss, when the risk of shipment is placed on the buyer by his contract with the seller. 4. Both the language of paragraph (b) and the nature of the situation it concerns indicate that the requirement that the seller must obtain and deliver promptly t o the buyer in due form any document necessary to enable him to obtain possession of the goods is intended to cumulate with the other duties of the seller such as those covered in paragraph (a). In this connection, in the case of pool car shipments a delivery order furnished by the seller on the pool car consignee, or on the carrier for delivery out of a larger quantity, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) unless the contract requires some other form of document. 5. This Article, unlike the prior uniform statutory provision, makes it the sellers duty to notify the buyer of shipment in all cases. The consequences of his failure to do so, however, are limited in that the buyer may reject on this ground only where material delay or loss ensues. A standard and acceptable manner of notification in open credit shipments is the sending of an invoice and in the case of documentary contracts is the prompt forw arding of the documents as under paragraph (b) of this section. It is also usual to send on a straight bill of lading but this is not necessary to the required notification. However, should such a document prove necessary or convenient to the buyer, as i n the case of loss and claim against the carrier, good faith would require the seller to send it on request. Frequently the agreement expressly requires prompt notification as by wire or cable. Such a term may be of the essence and the final clause of paragraph (c) does not prevent the parties from making this a particular ground for rejection. To have this vital and irreparable effect upon the sellers duties, such a term should be part of the dickered terms written in any form, or should otherwise b e called seasonably and sharply to the sellers attention. 6. Generally, under the final sentence of the section, rejection by the buyer is justified only when the sellers dereliction as to any of the requirements of this section in fact is followed by material delay or damage. It rests on the seller, so far as concerns matters not within the peculiar knowledge of the buyer, to establish that his error has not been followed by events which justify rejection.

Wallerstein Produce Co., 111 Va. 570, 69 S.E. 957 (1911), in which it was held to be improper for the seller to e nter into a private agreement with the carrier under which goods were not to go forward until the seller had heard that his draft had been paid. Since the last sentence of this section of the UCC provides that the failure to make a proper contract with t he carrier is not a ground for rejection unless material delay or loss ensues, it is not entirely clear whether the UCC changes the result in the Aspegren case. The contract in this case called for December delivery. A bill of lading was taken from the c arrier on December 26, but there is no evidence to indicate whether the delay occasioned in the shipment by the private agreement made by the seller with the carrier was material or not.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-505"><akn:num>§ 8.2-505</akn:num><akn:heading>Sellers shipment under reservation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before shipment: (a) his procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise reserves in him a security interest in the goods. His procurement of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the sellers expectati on of transferring that interest to the person named. (b) a nonnegotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession of the goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery (subsection (2) of § 8.2-507) a nonnegotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession or control of the bill of lading. (2) When shipm ent by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of the contract for sale it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the preceding section [§ 8.2-504] but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shi pment and identification of the goods to the contract nor the sellers powers as a holder of a negotiable document of title.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 20(2), (3), (4), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Com pletely rephrased, the powers of the parties in cases of reservation being emphasized primarily rather than the rightfulness of reservation. Purposes of changes: To continue in general the policy of the prior uniform statutory provision with certain modifications of emphasis and language, so that: 1. The security interest reserved to the seller under subsection (1) is restricted to securing payment or performance by the buyer and the seller is strictly limi ted in his disposition and control of the goods as against the buyer and third parties. Under this Article, the provision as to the passing of interest expressly applies despite any reservation of security title and also provides that the rig hts, obligations and remedies of the parties are not altered by the incidence of title generally. The security interest, therefore, must be regarded as a means given to the seller to enforce his rights against the buyer which is unaffected by and in turn does not affect the location of title generally. The rules set forth in subsection (1) are not to be altered by any apparent contrary intent of the parties as to passing of title, since the rights and remedies of the parties to the contract of sale, as defined in this Article, rest on the contract and its performance or breach and not on stereotyped presumptions as to the location of title. This Article does not attempt to regulate local procedure in regard to the effective maintenance of the sellers security interest when the action is in replev in by the buyer against the carrier. 2. Every shipment of identified goods under a negotiable bill of lading reserves a security interest in the seller under subsection (1) paragraph (a). It is frequently convenient for the seller to make the bill of lading to the order of a nominee such as his agent at destination, the financing agency to which he expects to negotiate the document or the bank issuing a credit to him. In many instances, also, the buyer is made the order party. This Article does not deal directly with the question as to whether a bill of lading made out by the seller to the order o f a nominee gives the carrier notice of any rights which the nominee may have so as to limit its freedom or obligation to honor the bill of lading in the hands of the seller as the original shipper if the expected negotiation fails. This is dealt with in the Article on Documents of Title (Article 7). 3. A non-negotiable bill of lading taken to a party other than the buyer under subsection (1) paragraph (b) reserves possession of the goods as security in the se ller but if he seeks to withhold the goods improperly the buyer can tender payment and recover them. 4. In the case of a shipment by non-negotiable bill of lading taken to a buyer, the seller, under subsection (1) retains no security interest or possession as aga inst the buyer and by the shipment he de facto loses control as against the carrier except where he right fully and effectively stops delivery in transit. In cases in which the contract gives the seller the right to payment against delivery, the seller, by making an immediate demand for payment, can show that his delivery is conditional, but this does not pr event the buyers power to transfer full title to a sub-buyer in ordinary course or other purchaser under Section 2-403. 5. Under subsection (2) an improper reservation by the seller which would constitute a breach in no way impairs such of the buyers rights as result from ident ification of the goods. The security title reserved by the seller under subsection (1) does not protect his holding of the document or the goods for the purpose of exacting more than is due him under the contract.

American Peanut Corp., 149 Va. 755, 767, 141 S.E. 759 (1928), that the seller s taking a bill of lading to his own order is not determinative of who has title to the goods, although Virginia has indicated that this is strong evidence that the seller did not intend for title to pass to the buyer.

(2) The right to reimbursement of a financing agency which has in good faith honored or purchased the draft under commitment to or authority from the buyer is not impaired by subsequent discovery of defects with reference to any relevant document which was apparently regular.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. Financing agency is broadly defined in this Article to cover every normal instance in which a party aids or intervenes in the financing of a sales tran saction. The term as used in subsection (1) is not in any sense intended as a limitation and covers any other appropriate situation which may arise outside the scope of the definition. 2. Paying as used in subsection (1) is typified by the letter of credit, or authority to pay situation in which a banker, by arrangement with the buyer or other consignee, pays on his behalf a draft for the price of the goods. It is immaterial whether the draft is formally drawn on the party paying or his principal, whether it is a sight draft paid in cash or a time draft paid in the first instance by acceptance, or whether the payment is viewed as absolute or conditional. All of these cases constitute payment under this subsection. Similarly, purchasing for value is used to indicate the whole area of financing by the sell ers banker, and the principle of subsection (1) is applicable without any niceties of distinction between purchase, discount, advance against collection or the like. But it is important to notice that the only right to have th e draft honored that is acquired is that against the buyer; if any right against any one else is claimed it will have to be under some separate obligation of that other person. A letter of credit does not necessarily protect purchasers of drafts. See Article 5. And for the relations of the parties to documentary drafts see Part 5 of Article 4. 3. Subsection (1) is made applicable to payments or advances against a draft which relates to a shipment of goods and this has been chosen as a term of ma ximum breadth. In particular the term is intended to cover the case of a draft against an invoice or against a delivery order. Further, it is unnecessary that there be an explicit assignment of the invoice attached to the draft to bring the transaction w ithin the reason of this subsection. 4. After shipment, the rights of the shipper in the goods are merely security rights and are subject to the buyers right to force delivery upon tender of the price. The rights acquired by the financing agency are similarly limited and, moreover, if the agency fails to procure any outstanding negotiable document of title, it may find its exercise of these rights hampered or even defeated by the seller s disposition of the document to a third party. This section does not attempt to create any new rights in the financing agency against the carrier which would force the latter to honor a stop order from the agency, a stranger to the shipment, or any new rights against a holder to whom a document of title has been duly negotiated under Article 7.

CASE NOTES Right of seller to reclaim goods.  This section gives the seller a right to reclaim his goods where a check, subsequently dishonored, has been accepted for payment in a cash transaction. However, t he right to reclaim is limited. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). This section and § 8.2-511 give the seller a right to reclaim his goods from the buyer where a cash transaction has occurred, and a check, taken in payment by the seller, was dishonored. However, the right to reclaim is limited to a ten day period from the delivery of the goods as provided by this section by virtue of its cross reference to § 8.2-702. If the right to reclaim has not been exercised within th at specified time period, the right is waived. The sellers remedy is then on the instrument as well as for breach of contract. This reduces the sellers rights to those of a general creditor. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. D ist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). The seller in a cash transaction, who accepts a check which the bank refuses to pay because of the intervening of bankruptcy proceedings, has the right to reclaim the goods sold and nothing in the Bankruptcy Act changes this. If the seller has a right to reclaim the goods, he stands in a position superior to any creditor. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). Check as proper method of payment.  The Uniform Commercial Code recognizes payment by check as a commercially normal and proper method of payment. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). The acceptance of a check does not change a cash sale into a credit transaction.  If the intention of the parties was to accomplish a cash transaction, which is the custom of the trade, then an acceptance of a check in place of actual cash does not change the transaction. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). Factors determinative of cas h transaction.  The customs and habits, plus the intention of the parties, are governing factors in determining whether there has been a cash transaction. In re Helms Veneer Corp ., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Right of seller to reclaim goods.  Since the unsecured creditor had an adequate remedy at law by a right to reclaim the amounts owed on certain dishonored checks of an insolvent company, the secure d creditor was entitled to payment of the insolvent companys debts from the companys remaining assets. Signet Bank v. Bradley, Inc., 56 Va. Cir. 207, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 451 (Richmond June 1, 2001). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: See Section 11, 41, 42 and 69, Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: 1. Subsection (1) continues the policies of the prior uniform statutory provisions with respect to tender and delivery by the seller. Under this Article the same rules in these matters are applied to present sales and to contracts for sale. But the provisions of this subsection must be read within the framework of the other sections of this Article which bear upon the question of delivery and payment. 2. The unless otherwise agreed provision of subsection (1) is directed primarily to cases in which payment in advance has been promised or a letter of cre dit term has been included. Payment according to the contract contemplates immediate payment, payment at the end of an agreed credit term, payment by a time acceptance or the like. Under this Act, contract means the total obligation in la w which results from the parties agreement including the effect of this Article. In this context, therefore, there must be considered the effect in law of such provisions as those on means and manner of payment and on failure of agreed means and mann er of payment. 3. Subsection (2) deals with the effect of a conditional delivery by the seller and in such a situation makes the buyers right as against the seller c onditional upon payment. These words are used as words of limitations to conform with the policy set forth in the bona fide purchase sections of this Article. Should the seller after making such a conditional delivery fail to follow up his rights, the co ndition is waived. The provision of this Article for a ten day limit within which the seller may reclaim goods delivered on credit to an insolvent buyer is also applicable here.

(2) Where the buyer rejects a nonconforming tender which the seller had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance the seller may if he seasonably notifies the buyer have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tende r. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 22, 25, 33. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. Subsection (1) permits a seller who has made a non-conforming tender in any case to make a conforming delivery within the contract time upon seasonable notific ation to the buyer. It applies even where the seller has taken back the non-conforming goods and refunded the purchase price. He may still make a good tender within the contract period. The closer, however, it is to the contract date, the greater is the necessity for extreme promptness on the sellers part in notifying of his intention to cure, if such notification is to be seasonable under this subsection. The rule of this subsection, moreover, is qualified by its underlying reasons. Thus if, after contracting for June delivery a buyer later makes known to the selle r his need for shipment early in the month and the seller ships accordingly, the contract time has been cut down by the supervening modification and the time for cure of tender must be referred to this modified time term. 2. Subsection (2) seeks to avoid injustice to the seller by reason of a surprise rejection by the buyer. However, the seller is not protected unless he had re asonable grounds to believe that the tender would be acceptable. Such reasonable grounds can lie in prior course of dealing, course of performance or usage of trade as well as in the particular circumstances surrounding the making of the contract. Th e seller is charged with commercial knowledge of any factors in a particular sales situation which require him to comply strictly with his obligations under the contract as, for example, strict conformity of documents in an overseas shipment or the sale of precision parts or chemicals for use in manufacture. Further, if the buyer gives notice either implicitly, as by a prior course of dealing involving rigorous inspections, or expressly, as by the deliberate inclusion of a no replacement clause in the contract, the seller is to be held to rigid compliance. If the clause appears in a form contract evidence that it is out of line with trade usage or the prior course of dealing and was not called to the sellers attention may be suffici ent to show that the seller had reasonable grounds to believe that the tender would be acceptable. 3. The words a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender are intended as words of limitation to protect the buyer. What is a reasonabl e time depends upon the attending circumstances. Compare Section 2-511 on the comparable case of a sellers surprise demand for legal tender. 4. Existing trade usages permitting variations without rejection but with price allowance enter into the agreement itself as contractual limitations of remedy and are not covered by this section.

Robertson, 141 Va. 123, 131-32, 126 S.E. 231 (19 25), recognized an exception when the seller has shipped the right quantity, but there has been a diminishment during transit. Then the buyer must notify the seller of the deficiency and give him a reasonable opportunity to make it good, at least if the time of delivery has not passed, and the buyer has no right to refuse flatly to accept a shipment because of a deficiency so caused.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-509"><akn:num>§ 8.2-509</akn:num><akn:heading>Risk of loss in the absence of breach</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier: (a) if i t does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier even though the shipment is under reservation (§ 8.2-505); but (b) if it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery. (2) Where the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the buyer: (a) on h is receipt of possession or control of a negotiable document of title covering the goods; or (b) on acknowledgement by the bailee of the buyers right to possession of the goods; or (c) after his receipt of possession or control of a nonnegotiable document of title or other direction to deliver in a record, as provided in subsection (4) (b) of § 8.2-503. (3) In any cas e not within subsection (1) or (2), the risk of loss passes to the buyer on his receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the buyer on tender of delivery.

The 2004 amendment by c. 200 inserted possession or control of in subdivisions (2)(a) and (2)(c); and in subdivision (2)(c), deleted written prece ding direction and inserted in a record. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 22. Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten, subsection (3) of this section modifying prior law. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. That underlying theory of these sections on risk of loss is the adoption of the contractual approach rather than an arbitrary shifting of the risk with the property in the goods. The scope of the present section, therefore, is limited strictly to those cases where there has been no breach by the seller. Where for any reason his delivery or tender fails to conform to the contract, the present section does not apply and the situation is governed by the provisions on effect of breach on risk of loss. 2. The provisions of subsection (1) apply where the contract requires or authorizes shipment of the goods. This language is intended to be construed paral lel to comparable language in the section on shipment by seller. In order that the goods be duly delivered to the carrier under paragraph (a) a contract must be entered into with the carrier which will satisfy the requirements of the section on s hipment by the seller and the delivery must be made under circumstances which will enable the seller to take any further steps necessary to a due tender. The underlying reason of this subsection does not require that the shipment be made after contractin g, but where, for example, the seller buys the goods afloat and later diverts the shipment to the buyer, he must identify the goods to the contract before the risk of loss can pass. To transfer the risk it is enough that a proper shipment and a proper id entification come to apply to the same goods although, aside from special agreement, the risk will not pass retroactively to the time of shipment in such a case. 3. Whether the contract involves delivery at the sellers place of business or at the situs of the goods, a merchant seller cannot transfer risk of loss and it remains upon him until actual receipt by the buyer, even though full payment has been made and the buyer has been notified that the goods are at his disposal. Protection is afforded him, in the event of breach by the buyer, under the next section. The underlying theory of this rule is that a merchant who is to make physical delivery at his own place continues meanwhile to control the goods and can be expect ed to insure his interest in them. The buyer, on the other hand, has no control of the goods and it is extremely unlikely that he will carry insurance on goods not yet in his possession. 4. Where the agreement provides for delivery of the goods as between the buyer and seller without removal from the physical possession of a bailee, the provisions on manner of tender of delivery apply on the point of transfer of risk. Due delivery of a negotiable document of title covering the goods or acknowledgment by the bailee that he holds for the buyer completes the delivery and passes the risk. 5. The provisions of this section are made subject by subsection (4) to the contrary agreement of the parties. This language is intended as the equivalent of the phrase unless otherwise agreed used more frequently throughout this Act. Contrary is in no way used as a word of limitation and the buyer and seller are left free to readjust their rights and risks as declared by this section in a ny manner agreeable to them. Contrary agreement can also be found in the circumstances of the case, a trade usage or practice, or a course of dealing or performance. Cross references: Point 1: Section 2-510(1).

VIRGINIA COMMENT Under the UCC risk of loss has been divorced from the passage of title whereas under prior Virginia law the risk of loss follows title. These different approaches , though, usually lead to the same results. Under both the UCC and prior Virginia law, where the seller is to ship the goods to the buyer F.O.B. the place of shipment, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are delivered to the carrier. F. A . Rausch &amp; Co. v. Graham Manufacturing Corp., 139 Va. 502, 506, 124 S.E. 427, 126 S.E. 2 (1924); L. J. Upton &amp; Co. v. Reeve, 123 Va. 241, 248, 96 S.E. 277 (1918); Haxall, Brothers &amp; Co. v. Willis, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 434, 440-54 (1859). Under both the UCC and prior Virginia law the risk of loss remains with the seller while he still has possession of the goods, with something to do in order to pu t the goods in a deliverable state, or to ascertain the price, as by enumeration, measurement, or weighing. Thus in Dixon v. Meyers &amp; Co., 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 240, 243-45 (1851), the risk of loss from fire was on the seller where tobacco stems in hogsheads had been put aside for the buyer, but they had not yet been marked or weighed. The decision in Haxall, Brothers &amp; Co. v. Barbour, unreported but noted 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 454, 455 (1851), is in accord with § 8.2-509(2) in holding that risk of loss has passed to the buyer where goods are in the possession of a bailee and the seller has given the buyer a delivery order, which the bailee has acknowledged. Similarly the UCC is in accord with Pleasants v. Pendleton, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 473, 483, 502 (1828), holding that risk of loss had passed to the buyer, the seller having given the buyer a delivery order on the bailee in possession. While the UCC does not expressly cover the point, it would seem that the fact that the bailee, a warehouseman, in this case had to separate 119 barrels out of 123 barrels of flour would not prevent the risk of loss from passing.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-510"><akn:num>§ 8.2-510</akn:num><akn:heading>Effect of breach on risk of loss</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Where a te nder or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the contract as to give a right of rejection the risk of their loss remains on the seller until cure or acceptance. (2) Where the buyer rightfully revokes acceptance he may to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of loss as having rested on the seller from the beginning. (3) Where the buyer as to conforming goods already identified to the contract for sale repudiates or is otherwise in breach before risk of their loss has passed to him, the seller may to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk o f loss as resting on the buyer for a commercially reasonable time. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: To make clear that: 1. Under subsection (1) the seller by his individual action cannot shift the risk of loss to the buyer unless his action conforms with all the conditions resting on him under the contract. 2. The cure of defective tenders contemplated by subsection (1) applies only to those situations in which the seller makes changes in goods already tender ed, such as repair, partial substitution, sorting out from an improper mixture and the like since cure by repossession and new tender has no effect on the risk of loss of the goods originally tendered. The sellers privilege of cure does not s hift the risk, however, until the cure is completed. Where defective documents are involved a cure of the defect by the seller or a waiver of the defects by the buyer will operate to shift the risk under this sectio n. However, if the goods have been destroyed prior to the cure or the buyer is unaware of their destruction at the time he waives the defect in the documents, the risk of the loss must still be borne by the seller, for the risk shifts only at the time of cure, waiver of documentary defects or acceptance of the goods. 3. In cases where there has been a breach of the contract, if the one in control of the goods is the aggrieved party, whatever loss or damage may prove to be unco vered by his insurance falls upon the contract breaker under subsections (2) and (3) rather than upon him.

Annotations CASE NOTES Right of seller to reclaim goods.  This section and § 8.2-507 give the seller a right to reclaim his goods from the buyer where a cash transaction has occurred, and a check, taken in payment by the seller, was dishonored. However, the right to reclaim is limited to a ten day period from the delivery of the goods as provided by § 8.2-507 by virtue of its cross reference to § 8.2-702. If the right to reclaim has not been exercised within th at specified time period, the right is waived. The sellers remedy is then on the instrument as well as for breach of contract. This reduces the sellers rights to those of a general creditor. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. D ist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). Check as proper method of payment.  The Uniform Commercial Code recognizes payment by check as a commercially normal and proper method of payment. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). The acceptance of a check does not change a cash sale into a credit transaction.  If the intention of the parties was to accomplish a cash transaction, which is the custom of the trade, then an acceptance of a check in place of actual cash does not change the transaction. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). Factors determinative of cas h transaction.  The customs and habits, plus the intention of the parties, are governing factors in determining whether there has been a cash transaction. In re Helms Veneer Corp ., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Right of seller to reclaim goods.  Since the unsecured creditor had an adequate remedy at law by a right to reclaim the amounts owed on certain dishonored checks of an insolvent company, the secure d creditor was entitled to payment of the insolvent companys debts from the companys remaining assets. Signet Bank v. Bradley, Inc., 56 Va. Cir. 207, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 451 (Richmond June 1, 2001). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 42, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten by this section and Section 2-507. Purposes of changes: 1. The requirement of payment against delivery in subsection (1) is applicable to noncommercial sales generally and to ordinary sales at retail although it has no application to the great body of commercial contracts which carry credit terms. Subsection (1) applies also to documentary contracts in general and to contracts which look to shipment by the seller but contain no term on time and manner of payment, in w hich situations the payment may, in proper case, be demanded against delivery of appropriate documents. In the case of specific transactions such as C.O.D. sales or agreements providing for payment against documents, the provisions of this subsection must be conside red in conjunction with the special sections of the Article dealing with such terms. The provision that tender of payment is a condition to the sellers duty to tender and complete any delivery integrates this section with the language and pol icy of the section on delivery in several lots which call for separate payment. Finally, attention should be directed to the provision on right to adequate assurance of performance which recognizes, even before the time for tender, an obligation on the b uyer not to impair the sellers expectation of receiving payment in due course. 2. Unless there is agreement otherwise the concurrence of the conditions as to tender of payment and tender of delivery requires their performance at a single pla ce or time. This Article determines that place and time by determining in various other sections the place and time for tender of delivery under various circumstances and in particular types of transactions. The sections dealing with time and place of de livery together with the section on right to inspection of goods answer the subsidiary question as to when payment may be demanded before inspection by the buyer. 3. The essence of the principle involved in subsection (2) is avoidance of commercial surprise at the time of performance. The section on substituted performance covers the peculiar case in which legal tender is not available to the commercial community. 4. Subsection (3) is concerned with the rights and obligations as between the parties to a sales transaction when payment is made by check. This Article recognize s that the taking of a seemingly solvent partys check is commercially normal and proper and, if due diligence is exercised in collection, is not to be penalized in any way. The conditional character of the payment under this section refers only to th e effect of the transaction as between the parties thereto and does not purport to cut into the law of absolute and conditional payment as applied to such other problems as the discharge of sureties or the responsibilities of a dr awee bank which is at the same time an agent for collection. The phrase by check includes not only the buyers own but any check which does not effect a discharge under Article 3 (Section 3-802). Similarly the re ason of this subsection should apply and the same result should be reached where the buyer pays by sign draft on a commercial firm which is financing him. 5. Under subsection (3) payment by check is defeated if it is not honored upon due presentment. This corresponds to the provisions of the Article on Commercial Pa per. (Section 3-802). But if the seller procures certification of the check instead of cashing it, the buyer is discharged. (Section 3-411). 6. Where the instrument offered by the buyer is not a payment but a credit instrument such as a note or a check postdated by even one day, the sellers accepta nce of the instrument insofar as third parties are concerned, amounts to a delivery on credit and his remedies are set forth in the section on buyers insolvency. As between the buyer and the seller, however, the matter turns on the present subsection and the section on conditional delivery and subsequent dishonor of the instrument gives the seller rights on it as well as for breach of the contract for sale.

Vim Motor Truck Co., 136 Va. 189, 203-04, 117 S.E. 834 (1923), in which it was held that the seller was in default when he refused to deliver a bill of lading against tender of payment. When §§ 8.2-507 and 8.2-511 are considered together, it would appear that the UCC requires the buyer to do the first act, that is, tender payment. Virginia has indicated that contrac ts for sale are mutual contracts and it is uncertain which party is to do the first act. Ragland &amp; Co. v. Butler, 59 Va.

(2) Payment pu rsuant to subsection (1) does not constitute an acceptance of goods or impair the buyers right to inspect or any of his remedies. History History. 1964, c. 219; 1997, c. 343. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None, but see Sections 47 and 49, Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: 1. Subsection (1) of the present section recognizes that the essence of a contract providing for payment before inspection is the intention of the parties to shif t to the buyer the risks which would usually rest upon the seller. The basic nature of the transaction is thus preserved and the buyer is in most cases required to pay first and litigate as to any defects later. 2. Inspection under this section is an inspection in a manner reasonable for detecting defects in goods whose surface appearance is satisfactory. 3. Clause (a) of this subsection states an exception to the general rule based on common sense and normal commercial practice. The apparent non-conformity referre d to is one which is evident in the mere process of taking delivery. 4. Clause (b) is concerned with contracts for payment against documents and incorporates the general clarification and modification of the case law contained in t he section on excuse of a financing agency. Section 5-114. 5. Subsection (2) makes explicit the general policy of the Uniform Sales Act that the payment required before inspection in no way impairs the buyers remedies or rights in the event of a default by the seller. The remedies reserved to the buyer are all of his remedies which include as a matter of reason the remedy for total non-delivery after payment in advance. The provision on performance or acceptance under reservation of rights does not apply to the situations contemplated here in which payment is made in due course u nder the contract and the buyer need not pay under protest or the like in order to preserve his rights as to defects discovered upon inspection. 6. This section applies to cases in which the contract requires payment before inspection either by the express agreement of the parties or by reason of the effec t in law of that contract. The present section must therefore be considered in conjunction with the provision on right to inspection of goods which sets forth the instances in which the buyer is not entitled to inspection before payment.

(3) Unless oth erwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this title on C.I.F. contracts (subsection (3) of § 8.2-321), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goods before payment of the price when the contract provides (a) for delivery C.O.D. or on other like terms; or (b) for payment against documents of title, except where such payment is due only after the goods are to become available for inspection. (4) A place or method of inspection fixed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwise expressly agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the contract. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 47(2), (3), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten, subsections (2) and (3) being new. Purposes of changes and new matter: To correspond in substance with the prior uniform statutory provision and to incorporate in addition some of the results of the better case law so that: 1. The buyer is entitled to inspect goods as provided in subsection (1) unless it has been otherwise agreed by the parties. The phrase unless otherwise agreed  is intended principally to cover such situations as those outlined in subsections (3) and (4) and those in which the agreement of the parties negates inspection before tender of delivery. However, no agreement by the parties can displace the entire right of inspection except where the contract is simply for the sale of this thing. Even in a sale of boxed goods as is inspection is a right to the buyer, since if the boxes prove to contain some other merchandise altogether the price ca n be recovered back; nor do the limitations of the provision on effect of acceptance apply in such a case. 2. The buyers right of inspection is available to him upon tender, delivery or appropriation of the goods with notice to him. Since inspection is available to him on tender, where payment is due against delivery he may, unless otherwise agreed, make his inspection before payment of the price. It is also available to him after receipt of the goods and so may be postponed after receipt for a reasonable time. Fa ilure to inspect before payment does not impair the right to inspect after receipt of the goods unless the case falls within subsection (4) on agreed and exclusive inspection provisions. The right to inspect goods which have been appropriated with notice to the buyer holds whether or not the sale was by sample. 3. The buyer may exercise his right of inspection at any reasonable time or place and in any reasonable manner. It is not necessary that he select the most approp riate time, place or manner to inspect or that his selection be the customary one in the trade or locality. Any reasonable time, place or manner is available to him and the reasonableness will be determined by trade usages, past practices between the par ties and the other circumstances of the case. The last sentence of subsection (1) makes it clear that the place of arrival of shipped goods is a reasonable place for their inspection. 4. Expenses of an inspection made to satisfy the buyer of the sellers performance must be assumed by the buyer in the first instance. Since the rule provides merely for an allocation of expense there is no policy to prevent the parties from providing otherwise in the agreement. Where the buyer would normally bear the expenses of the inspection but the goods are rightly rejected because of what the inspection reveals, demonstrable and reasonable costs of the inspection are part of his incidental damage caused by the sellers breach. 5. In the case of payment against documents, subsection (3) requires payment before inspection, since shipping documents against which payment is to be made will commonly arrive and be tendered while the goods are still in transit. This Article recognizes no exception in any peculiar case in which the goods happen to arrive before the documents. However, where by the agreement payment is to await the arrival of the goods, inspection before payment becomes proper since the goods are then available for inspection. Where by the agreement the documents are to be held until arrival the buyer is entitled to inspect before payment since the goods are then available for inspe ction. Proof of usage is not necessary to establish this right, but if inspection before payment is disputed the contrary must be established by usage or by an explicit contract term to that effect. For the same reason, that the goods are available for inspection, a term calling for payment against storage documents or a delivery order does not normally bar t he buyers right to inspection before payment under subsection (3) (b). This result is reinforced by the buyers right under subsection (1) to inspect goods which have been appropriated with notice to him. 6. Under subsection (4) an agreed place or method of inspection is generally held to be intended as exclusive. However, where compliance with such an agreed inspe ction term becomes impossible, the question is basically one of intention. If the parties clearly intend that the method of inspection named is to be a necessary condition without which the entire deal is to fail, the contract is at an end if that method becomes impossible. On the other hand, if the parties merely seek to indicate a convenient and reliable method but do not intend to give up the deal in the event of its failure, any reasonable method of inspection may be substituted under this Article. Since the purpose of an agreed place of inspection is only to make sure at that point whether or not the goods will be thrown back, the exclusive feature of the named place is satisfied under this Article if the buyers failure to inspect there is held to be an acceptance with the knowledge of such defects as inspection would have revealed within the section on waiver of buyers objections by failur e to particularize. Revocation of the acceptance is limited to the situations stated in the section pertaining to that subject. The reasonable time within which to give notice of defects within the section on notice of breach begins to run from the point of the acceptance. 7. Clauses on time of inspection are commonly clauses which limit the time in which the buyer must inspect and give notice of defects. Such clauses are therefore governed by the section of this Article which requires that such a time limitation must be reasonable. 8. Inspection under this Article is not to be regarded as a condition precedent to the passing of title so that risk until inspection remains on the selle r. Under subsection (4) such an approach cannot be sustained. Issues between the buyer and seller are settled in this Article almost wholly by special provisions and not by the technical determination of the locus of the title. Thus inspection as a c ondition to the passing of title becomes a concept almost without meaning. However, in peculiar circumstances inspection may still have some of the consequences hitherto sought and obtained under that concept. 9. Inspection under this section has to do with the buyers check-up on whether the sellers performance is in accordance with a contract previously made and is not to be confused with the examination of the goods or of a sample or model of them at the time of contracting which may affect the warranties involved in the contract.

History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provisions: None. Purposes: 1. To meet certain serious problems which arise when there is a dispute as to the quality of the goods and thereby perhaps to aid the parties in reaching a settle ment, and to further the use of devices which will promote certainty as to the condition of the goods, or at least aid in preserving evidence of their condition. 2. Under paragraph (a), to afford either party an opportunity for preserving evidence, whether or not agreement has been reached, and thereby to reduce uncertaint y in any litigation and, in turn perhaps, to promote agreement. Paragraph (a) does not conflict with the provisions on the sellers right to resell rejected goods or the buyers similar right. Apparent conflict between t hese provisions which will be suggested in certain circumstances is to be resolved by requiring prompt action by the parties. Nor does paragraph (a) impair the effect of a term for payment before inspection. Short of such defects as amount to fraud or su bstantial failure of consideration, nonconformity is neither an excuse nor a defense to an action for non-acceptance of documents. Normally, therefore, until the buyer has made payment, inspected and rejected the goods, there is no occasion or use for th e rights under paragraph (a). 3. Under paragraph (b), to provide for third party inspection upon the agreement of the parties, thereby opening the door to amicable adjustments based upon the f indings of such third parties. The use of the phrase conformity or condition makes it clear that the parties agreement may range from a complete settlement of all aspects of the dis pute by a third party to the use of a third party merely to determine and record the condition of the goods so that they can be resold or used to reduce the stake in controversy. Conformity, at one end of the scale of possible issues, includes th e whole question of interpretation of the agreement and its legal effect, the state of the goods in regard to quality and condition, whether any defects are due to factors which operate at the risk of the buyer, and the degree of non-conformity where tha t may be material. Condition, at the other end of the scale, includes nothing but the degree of damage or deterioration which the goods show. Paragraph (b) is intended to reach any point in the gamut which the parties may agree upon. The principle of the section on reservation of rights reinforces this paragraph in simplifying such adjustments as the parties wish to make in partial settlement while reserving their rights as to any further points. Paragraph (b) also suggests the use of arbitration, where desired, of any points left open, but nothing in this section is intended to repeal or amend any statute governing arbitration. Where any que stion arises as to the extent of the parties agreement under the paragraph, the presumption should be that it was meant to extend only to the relation between the contract description and the goods as delivered, since that is what a craftsman in the trade would normally be expected to report upon. Finally, a written and authenticated report of inspection or tests by a third party, whether or not sampling has been practicable, is entitled to be admitted as evidence under this Act, for it is a third p arty document.

For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 23, 26. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: No one general equivalent provision but numerous provisions, dealing with situations of non-conformity where buyer may accept or reject, including Sections 11, 44 and 69(1), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Par tial acceptance in good faith is recognized and the buyers remedies on the contract for breach of warranty and the like, where the buyer has returned the goods after transfer of title, are no longer barred. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. A buyer accepting a non-conforming tender is not penalized by the loss of any remedy otherwise open to him. This policy extends to cover and regulate the accep tance of a part of any lot improperly tendered in any case where the price can be reasonably be apportioned. Partial acceptance is permitted whether the part of the goods accepted conforms or not. The only limitation on partial acceptance is that good fa ith and commercial reasonableness must be used to avoid undue impairment of the value of the remaining portion of the goods. This is the reason for the insistence on the commercial unit in paragraph (c). In this respect, the test is not only what unit has been the basis of contract, but whether the partial acceptance produces so materially adverse an effect on the remainder as to constitute bad faith. 2. Acceptance made with the knowledge of the other party is final. An original refusal to accept may be withdrawn by a later acceptance if the seller has indicate d that he is holding the tender open. However, if the buyer attempts to accept, either in whole or in part, after his original rejection has caused the seller to arrange for other disposition of the goods, the buyer must answer for any ensuing damage sin ce the next section provides that any exercise of ownership after rejection is wrongful as against the seller. Further, he is liable even though the seller may choose to treat his action as acceptance rather than conversion, since the damage flows from t he misleading notice. Such arrangements for resale or other disposition of the goods by the seller must be viewed as within the normal contemplation of a buyer who has given notice of rejection. However, the buyers attempts in good faith to dispose o f defective goods where the seller has failed to give instructions within a reasonable time are not to be regarded as an acceptance.

VIRGINIA COMMENT To the extent that this section permits a buyer to accept any commercial unit of nonconforming goods and to reject the rest, the UCC is contrary to prior Virginia law as broadly laid down in Charles Syer &amp; Co. v. Lester, 116 Va. 541, 545-46, 82 S.E. 122 (1914). In this case the court said that if the buyer knows of the nonconformity of the goods he must either reject the whole or accept the whole under protest an d bring an action for damages, and that he has no right to accept part and to reject the remainder. Furthermore, the court said that an acceptance of a part of a shipment implies an agreement to accept the whole. In this case the buyer had actually taken possession of all the goods, sold part of them, and then endeavored to return those remaining on the ground that they were nonconforming. Later Virginia cases, however, have seemed to limit the rule. It was held inapplicable where the buyer accepted par t of the nonconforming goods in the belief that the nonconformity arose from the buyers own failure to make a timely inspection and acceptance. Rennolds v. Avery, 132 Va. 335, 340-41, 111 S.E. 123 (1922). The rule is also inapplicable where the selle r agrees to take back nonconforming goods. Lamborn &amp; Co. v. Bristol Grocery Co., 140 Va. 77, 81-82, 124 S.E. 184 (1924). The rule was also held not applicable where the buyer had accepted a part in order to avoid litigation. Gibney &amp; Co. v. Arlington Bre wing Co., 112 Va. 117, 121-22, 70 S.E. 487 (1917). Pettibone Wood Manufacturing Co. v. Pioneer Construction Co., 203 Va. 152, 159-60, 122 S.E.2d 885 (1961), held that in a sale on approval, an acceptance of nonconforming goods is finalthe buyer must either accept or reject the goods.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-602"><akn:num>§ 8.2-602</akn:num><akn:heading>Manner and effect of rightful rejection</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender.

CASE NOTES In order to be effective, notice of rejection must be given to the seller within a reasonable time.  If notice of rejection is given unreasonably late, the rejection is not effective, acceptance is implied by § 8.2-606(1)(b), and the burden of proof is on the buyer, pursuant to § 8.2-607(4), to establish any unconformity of the goods to the contract.

Flowers Baking Co. v. R-P Packaging, Inc., 229 Va. 370, 329 S.E.2d 462, 1985 Va. LEXIS 215 (1985). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 50, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. A tender or delivery of goods made pursuant to a contract of sale, even though wholly non-conforming, requires affirmative action by the buyer to avoid accepta nce. Under subsection (1), therefore, the buyer is given a reasonable time to notify the seller of his rejection, but without such seasonable notification his rejection is ineffective. The sections of this Article dealing with inspection of goods must be read in connection with the buyers reasonable time for action under this subsection. Contract provisions limiting the time for rejection fall within the rule of the section on Time and are effective if the time set gives the buyer a reasonab le time for discovery of defects. What constitutes a due notifying of rejection by the buyer to the seller is defined in Section 1-201. 2. Subsection (2) lays down the normal duties of the buyer upon rejection, which flow from the relationship of the parties. Beyond his duty to hold the goods with reasonable care for the buyers disposition, this section continues the policy of prior uniform legislation in generally relieving the buyer from any duties with respect to them, except when the circumstances impose the limited obligation of salvage upon him under the next section. 3. The present section applies only to rightful rejection by the buyer. If the seller has made a tender which in all respects conforms to the contract, the buyer has a positive duty to accept and his failure to do so constitutes a wrongful rejection which gives the seller immediate remedies for breach. Subsection (3) is included here to emphasize the sharp distinction between the rejection of an improper tender and the non-acceptance which is a breach by the buyer. 4. The provisions of this section are to be appropriately limited or modified when a negotiation is in process.

Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming. (2) When the b uyer sells goods under subsection (1), he is entitled to reimbursement from the seller or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling them, and if the expenses include no selling commission then to such commission as is usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten per cent on the gross proceeds. (3) In complyi ng with this section the buyer is held only to good faith and good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance nor conversion nor the basis of an action for damages. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. This section recognizes the duty imposed upon the merchant buyer by good faith and commercial practice to follow any reasonable instructions of the seller as t o reshipping, storing, delivery to a third party reselling or the like. Subsection (1) goes further and extends the duty to include the making of reasonable efforts to effect a salvage sale where the value of the goods is threatened and the sellers i nstructions do not arrive in time to prevent serious loss. 2. The limitations on the buyers duty to resell under subsection (1) are to be liberally construed. The buyers duty to resell under this section arises fr om commercial necessity and thus is present only when the seller has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection. A financing agency which is acting in behalf of the seller in handling the documents rejected by the buyer is sufficien tly the sellers agent to lift the burden of salvage resale from the buyer. (See provisions of Sections 4-503 and 5-112 on banks duties with respect to rejected documents.) The buyers duty to resell is extended only to goods in his possess ion or control, but these are intended as words of wide, rather than narrow, import. In effect, the measure of the buyers control is whether he can practically effect control without undue commercial burden. 3. The explicit provisions for reimbursement and compensation to the buyer in subsection (2) are applicable and necessary only where he is not acting under instru ctions from the seller. As provided in subsection (1) the sellers instructions to be reasonable must on demand of the buyer include indemnity for expenses. 4. Since this section makes the resale of perishable goods an affirmative duty in contrast to a mere right to sell as under the case law, subsection (3) makes it clear that the buyer is liable only for the exercise of good faith in determining whether the value of the goods is sufficiently threatened to justify a quick resale or whether he has waited a sufficient length of time for instructions, or what a reasona ble means and place of resale is. 5. A buyer who fails to make a salvage sale when his duty to do so under this section has arisen is subject to damages pursuant to the section on liberal administ ration of remedies.

Purposes: The basic purpose of this section is twofold: on the one hand it aims at reducing the stake in dispute and on the other at avoiding the pinning of a technical acceptance on a buyer who has taken steps towards realization on or preservation of the goods in good faith. This section is essentially a salvage section and the buyers right to act under it is conditioned upon (1) non-conformity of the good s, (2) due notification of rejection to the seller under the section on manner of rejection, and (3) the absence of any instructions from the seller which the merchant-buyer has a duty to follow under the preceding section. This section is designed to accord all reasonable leeway to a rightfully rejecting buying acting in good faith. The listing of what the buyer may do in the absenc e of instructions from the seller is intended to be not exhaustive but merely illustrative. This is not a merchants section and the options are pure options given to merchant and nonmerchant buyers alike. The merchant-buyer, however, may in s ome instances be under a duty rather than an option to resell under the provisions of the preceding section.

Commercial Law, §§ 3, 25, 26. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. The present section rests upon a policy of permitting the buyer to give a quick and informal notice of defects in a tender without penalizing him for omissions in his statement, while at the same time protecting a seller who is reasonably misled by the buyers failure to state curable defects. 2. Where the defect in a tender is one which could have been cured by the seller, a buyer who merely rejects the delivery without stating his objections to it is probably acting in commercial bad faith and seeking to get out of a deal which has become unprofitable. Subsection (1) (a), following the general policy of this Article which looks to preserving the deal wherever possible, therefore insists that the sell ers right to correct his tender in such circumstances be protected. 3. When the time for cure is past, subsection (1) (b) makes it plain that a seller is entitled upon request to a final statement of objections upon which he can r ely. What is needed is that he make clear to the buyer exactly what is being sought. A formal demand under paragraph (b) will be sufficient in the case of a merchant-buyer. 4. Subsection (2) applies to the particular case of documents the same principle which the section on effects of acceptance applies to the case of goods. The matt er is dealt with in this section in terms of waiver of objections rather than of right to revoke acceptance, partly to avoid any confusion with the problems of acceptance of goods and partly because defects in documents which are not taken as gro unds for rejection are generally minor ones. The only defects concerned in the present subsection are defects in the documents which are apparent on their face. Where payment is required against the documents they must be inspected before payment, and th e payment then constitutes acceptance of the documents. Under the section dealing with this problem, such acceptance of the documents does not constitute an acceptance of the goods or impair any options or remedies of the buyer for their improper deliver y. Where the documents are delivered without requiring such contemporary action as payment from the buyer, the reason of the next section on what constitutes acceptance of goods, applies. Their acceptance by nonobjection is therefore postponed until afte r a reasonable time for their inspection. In either situation, however, the buyer waives only what is apparent on the face of the documents. Cross references: Point 2: Section 2-508. Point 4: Sections 2-512(2), 2-606(1) (b) and 2-607(2).

Robertson, 141 Va. 123, 132-33, 126 S.E. 231 (1925), indicated that the statement of one ground of objection is a waiver of the tender on all other grounds that could have been given, but were not. The case actually held that a refusal of tender on the ground of delay in deliv ery was not a waiver of a deficiency in the quantity since this deficiency could not have been known at the time of the tender.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-606"><akn:num>§ 8.2-606</akn:num><akn:heading>What constitutes acceptance of goods</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer (a) afte r a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that he will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or (b) fails to make an effective rejection (subsection (1) of § 8.2-602), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or (c) does any act inconsistent with the sellers ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him.

Harvard Drug Group v. Health Spectrum, Inc., 60 Va. Cir. 301, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 396 (Roanoke County Oct. 30, 2002) . OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision. Section 48, Uniform Sales. Act. Changes: Rew ritten, the qualification in paragraph (c) and subsection (2) being new; otherwise the general policy of the prior legislation is continued. Purposes of changes and new matter: To make it clear that: 1. Under this Article acceptance as applied to goods means that the buyer, pursuant to the contract, takes particular goods which have been appropriated t o the contract as his own, whether or not he is obligated to do so, and whether he does so by words, action, or silence when it is time to speak. If the goods conform to the contract, acceptance amounts only to the performance by the buyer of one part of his legal obligation. 2. Under this Article acceptance of goods is always acceptance of identified goods which have been appropriated to the contract or are appropriated by the contrac t. There is no provision for acceptance of title apart from acceptance in general, since acceptance of title is not material under this Article to the detailed rights and duties of the parties. (See Section 2-401). The refinements of the older la w between acceptance of goods and of title become unnecessary in view of the provisions of the sections on effect and revocation of acceptance, on effects of identification and on risk of loss, and those sections which free the sellers and buyers remedies from the complications and confusions caused by the question of whether title has or has not passed to the buyer before breach. 3. Under paragraph (a), payment made after tender is always one circumstance tending to signify acceptance of the goods but in itself it can never be more than on e circumstance and is not conclusive. Also, a conditional communication of acceptance always remains subject to its expressed conditions. 4. Under paragraph (c), any action taken by the buyer, which is inconsistent with his claim that he has rejected the goods, constitutes an acceptance. However, th e provisions of paragraph (c) are subject to the sections dealing with rejection by the buyer which permit the buyer to take certain actions with respect to the goods pursuant to his options and duties imposed by those sections, without effecting an acce ptance of the goods. The second clause of paragraph (c) modifies some of the prior case law and makes it clear that acceptance in law based on the wrongful act of the acceptor is acceptance only as against the wrongdoer and then only at the optio n of the party wronged. In the same manner in which a buyer can bind himself, despite his insistence that he is rejecting or has rejected the goods, by an act inconsistent with the selle rs ownership under paragraph (c), he can obligate himself by a communication of acceptance despite a prior rejection under paragraph (a). However the sections on buyers rights on improper delivery and on the effect of rightful rejection, make it clear that after he once rejects a tender, paragraph (a) does not operate in favor of the buyer unless the seller has re-tendered the goods or has taken affirmative action indicating that he is holding the tender open. See also Comment 2 to Section 2-601 . 5. Subsection (2) supplements the policy of the section on buyers rights on improper delivery, recognizing the validity of a partial acceptance but insisting that the buyer exercise this right only as to whole commercial units.

(2) Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a nonconformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured but acc eptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this title for nonconformity. (3) Where a te nder has been accepted (a) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy; and (b) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of § 8.2-312) and the buyer is sued as a result of such a breach he must so notify the seller within a reasonable time after he receives notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation. (4) The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect to the goods accepted. (5) Where the buyer is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which his seller is answerable over (a) he m ay give his seller written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the seller may come in and defend and that if the seller does not do so he will be bound in any action against him by his buyer by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the seller after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend he is so bound. (b) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of § 8.2-312) the original seller may demand in writing that his buyer turn over to him control of the litigation including settlement or else be barred from any remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred. (6) The provis ions of subsections (3), (4) and (5) apply to any obligation of a buyer to hold the seller harmless against infringement or the like (subsection (3) of § 8.2-312).

C ole v. Keller Indus., Inc., 132 F.3d 1044, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 34 (4th Cir. 1998). Who must give notice.  Only buyers, that is, those who buy or contract to buy goods from a seller, must give notice of breach of warranty to the seller as a prerequisite to recovery. Ya tes v. Pitman Mfg., Inc., 257 Va. 601, 514 S.E.2d 605, 1999 Va. LEXIS 58 (1999). Court may rule as to adequacy of notic e.  Whether plaintiffs gave defendants reasonable notice of breach of warranty is ordinarily a question of fact reserved for the jury, however, if the evidence is cle ar, the court can rule as a matter of law that a party failed to give proper notice. Begley v. Jeep Corp., 491 F. Supp. 63, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13334 (W.D. Va. 1980). Acceptan ce implied where rejection unreasonably late.  If notice of rejection is given unreasonably late, the rejection is not effective, acceptance is implied by § 8.2-606(1) (b), and the burden of proof is on the buyer, pursuant to subsection (4), to establish any unconformity of the goods to the contract. Flowers Baking Co. v. R-P Packaging, Inc., 229 Va. 370, 329 S.E.2d 462, 1985 Va. LEXIS 215 (1985). Acceptance of partial shipment.  Having installed and accepted the fifteen (15) units, buyer was bound to pay for all nineteen (19) units contained in the first shipment. United States ex rel. Wh itaker's, Inc. v. C.B.C. Enters., Inc., 820 F. Supp. 242, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6207 (E.D. Va. 1993). Delay of two years in giving notice.  Plaintiffs violated the letter and spirit of subsection (3) (a) of this section by waiting over two years to give defendants notice and, therefore, its sanction o f dismissal should operate against them. Begley v. Jeep Corp., 491 F. Supp. 63, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13334 (W.D. Va. 1980). In the circumstances of the instant case, a two-year delay in giving notice under subsection (3) was unreasonable as a matter of law where no explanation for the delay was provided and actual prejudice was sustained. Hebron v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc., 60 F.3d 1095, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 20001 (4th Cir. 1995). Sufficient notice.  Factors constituted sufficient notice where a buyer of an air compressor communicated its dissatisfaction with compressor to seller and shipped it back to seller pursuant to sellers instructions and seller discovered evidence that compressor was overheating, and where buyer informed seller that compressor was continuing to overheat. Cancun Adventure Tours, Inc. v. Underwater Designer Co., 862 F.2d 1044, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 16367 (4th Cir. 1988). A determination of what constitutes reasonable notice is a question of fact for the jury. Virginia Transformer Corp. v. P.D. George Co., 932 F. Supp. 156, 1996 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 10255 (W.D. Va. 1996). Motion to dismiss was not the proper method of determining notice.  Sellers Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a breach of warranty action was denied because the motion was not the proper method of raising the fact que stions of whether the co-administrators or the deceased buyer were required to give the sellers reasonable notice of the product defect and could not prove such notice. Campbell v. Ethex Corp., 413 F. Supp. 2d 738, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4603 (W.D. Va. 20 06). Motion to dismiss was a premature stage in which to address the factual issue of whether a chassis supplier was given the required notice of an RVs defects un der §§ 8.2-607(3)(a) (the Virginia Uniform Commercial Code) and 59.1-207.13 (the Lemon law). Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Notice must be pled.  Manufacturers demurrer to builders amended cross-claim count seeking direct damages for breach of implied warranty was sustained where the builder failed to plead that it notified the manufacturer of a defect with its synthetic stucco material; the trial court held that because failure to give notice under subsection (3) was a bar to recovery, notice must be pled in order to properly state a cause of acti on for direct damages on a breach of implied warranty claim. Bindra v. Michael Bowman and Assoc., Inc., 58 Va. Cir. 47, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 28 (Fairfax County Feb. 11, 2002). Motion for judgment served as breach of warranty claim notification.  Builders instituting a cross-claim and third-party motion for judgment within three months of acquiring a breach of warranty claim served as reasonable notifi cation under subdivision (3)(a) to exterior wall cladding manufacturer and distributor of the breach of warranty claim. Bay Point Condo. Ass'n v. RML Corp., 57 Va. Cir. 295, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 10 (Norfolk Jan. 28, 2002). Acceptance found.  Buyer owed the seller the contract price for the goods, because the buyer clearly accepted the goods by failing to reject them not only after an opportunity to in spect them, but after its inspector inspected the goods and recommended that the buy...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-608"><akn:num>§ 8.2-608</akn:num><akn:heading>Revocation of acceptance in whole or in part</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose non-conformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it (a) on t he reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or (b) without discovery of such nonconformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the sellers assurances.

Buyers Use of Goods. I.General Consideration. The UCC has substituted a standard of commercial reasonableness for the stricter standar ds which formerly prevailed, but the guiding principles are clear. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Buyer must offer objective evidence showing: (1) that the goods fail to conform to the t erms of the contract of sale, and (2) that the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of the goods to the buyer. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Issues for trier of fa ct.  Whether substantial impairment of value to the particular buyer exists is an issue to be determined by the trier of fact. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). In deciding whether the remedy of revocation of acceptance is applicable, the fact finder must resolve additional issues: whether the buyer unreasonably delayed g iving notice of revocation, whether the condition of the goods had substantially changed, and whether the buyer had made unjustified use of the goods after giving notice of revocation. As to all these issues, the buyer has the burden of proving by a prep onderance of the evidence that his conduct was reasonable. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Revocation does not lie against remote manufacturer.  Limiting the remedy of revocation so that it does not lie against a remote manufacturer does not revive archaic doctrine of privity. A remote manufacturer is liab le to a buyer for damages arising from negligence or from breach of warranty, and the defense of lack of privity has been abolished as to such cases. But the remedy of revocation of acceptance under this section is conceptually inapplicable to any person s other than the parties to the contract of sale sought to be rescinded. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). The remedy of revocation of acceptance lies only against a seller of goods, not against a remote manufacturer. This is so because the remedy, where successful, ca ncels a contract of sale, restores both title to and possession of the goods to the seller, restores the purchase price to the buyer, and as fairly as possible, returns the contracting parties to the status quo ante. The remote manufacturer, having no pa rt in the sale transaction, has no role to play in such a restoration of former positions. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Action properly filed.  Purchaser of a car, who revoked her acceptance of the car and sought monetary damages as permitted by § 8.2-608, properly filed her motion for judgement on the law side of the court, as §§ 8.2-608 and 8.2-711 permit a buyer, such as the plaintiff, to recover monetary damages upon revocation of acceptance, which may include the purchase price. Hence, the circuit court erred in setting aside the jury verd ict that awarded damages to her. Love v. Kenneth Hammersley Motors, Inc., 263 Va. 45, 556 S.E.2d 764, 2002 Va. LEXIS 19 (2002). II.Impairment of Value. Value of goods must be substantially impaired.  A buyers right to revoke acceptance does not arise from every breach of warranty, notwithstanding the availability of damages for the breach; it arises only w here the value of the goods to the buyer is substantially impaired. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Test of impairment of value is not a diminution in value of the goods on the open market , or to the average buyer, but rather a substantial impairment of value to the particular buyer involved. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Buyer must carry the burden of proof on the issue of impairment of value by a prepondera nce of the evidence. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Standard of driveability as test of whether a cars value to the buyer was substantially impaired, while not of universal application, was not erroneous where the buyers failed to prove any need for the car beyond ordinary transportation. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Submitti ng claim to jury was proper.  Trial court did not err in submitting the car buyers § 8.2-608 revocation claim against an automobile dealer to the jury where the evidence demonstrated th at the buyers intended to buy a new vehicle and that the decrease in value caused by the dealer repainting the nonconforming condition was a substantial impairment. Manassas Autocars, Inc. v. Couch, 274 Va. 82, 645 S.E.2d 443, 2007 Va. LEXIS 88 (2007). III.Reasonable Time. Revocation of acceptance must be made promptly, or within a reasonable time after accept ance. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Reasonableness depends upon facts and circumstances.  What constitutes a reasonable time depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The time for revocation will ordinarily extend beyond the time for givin g notice of breach. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). Delay caused by giving seller opportunity to repair is not unreasonable.  Where the delay in notification of revocation is brought about because the buyer gave the seller repeated opportunities to correct the defects and the seller proc rastinated in accomplishing repairs, the delay is not unreasonable. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). IV.Buyers Use of Goods. Bu yers use of goods before revocation.  The buyer may not use the goods to a material degree and then attempt to revoke. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 ( 1984). Buyers use of goods after giving notice of revocation.  After giving notice of revocation, the buyer holds the goods as bailee for the seller. The buyer cannot continue to use them as his own and still have the benefit of rescission; his continued use becomes wrongful against the seller, unless induced by the sellers instructions or promises. Gasque v. Mooers Motor Car Co., 227 Va. 154, 313 S.E.2d 384, 1984 Va. LEXIS 276 (1984). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Consequential damages awarded when buyers revoked acceptance of damaged mobile home.  After buyers properly revoked acceptance of a structurally damaged mobile home, since they notified the sellers of their nonacceptance of the home due to its exte nsive damages immediately after receiving delivery of the home even though the buyers did not pick up the home until after the buyers had moved from it about 11 months later during which time the buyers were awaiting the sellers promised repairs. The sub stantial impairment of value was proven by building inspectors notifications to the seller of noncompliance with structural building codes. Oakwood Acceptance Corp. v. Pippin, 66 Va. Cir. 474, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 462 (Nelson County Mar. 27, 2002). Test of impairment of value.  In her action against a vehicle dealer, a consumer was entitled to a revocation of acceptance because she experienced problems within a month after she purchased the vehicle; in less than one year, the vehicle was taken to the dealer seven times for repair. Excessive use of oil, continuous smoke from the exhaust of the vehicle, and loss of power all constituted a breach of implied warranty that substantially impa ired the value of the vehicle. Love v. Kenneth Hammersley Motors, Inc., 66 Va. Cir. 447, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 647 (Lynchburg Oct. 30, 2000). Attorney fee award.  Auto buyers were not entitled to an attorney fee award on the claim that they properly revoked acceptance of the vehicle that they bought from the auto sellers. A n award of money damages was contemplated pursuant to the relevant statutes, §§ 8.2-608 and 8.2-711, but those statutes did not provide for an attorney fee award and the auto buyers did not show any other basis for awarding attorney fees to them de spite their success on the claim for revocation of acceptance. Couch v. Manassas Autocars, Inc., 77 Va. Cir. 30, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 130 (Prince William County July 17, 2008).

A...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-609"><akn:num>§ 8.2-609</akn:num><akn:heading>Right to adequate assurance of performance</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the others expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return. (2) Between me rchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards. (3) Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved partys right to demand adequate assurance of future performance. (4) After rece ipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Law Review. For article on mitigation of damages, see 69 Va. L. Rev. 967 (1983). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 3, 9, 24, 29, 32, 33. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: See Sections 53, 54(1) (b), 55 and 63(2), Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: 1. The section rests on the recognition of the fact that the essential purpose of a contract between commercial men is actual performance and they do not bargain merely for a promise, or for a promise plus the right to win a lawsuit and that a continuing sense of reliance and security that the promised performance will be forthcoming when due, is an important feature of the bargain. If either the willingness or t he ability of a party to perform declines materially between the time of contracting and the time for performance, the other party is threatened with the loss of a substantial part of what he has bargained for. A seller needs protection not merely agains t having to deliver on credit to a shaky buyer, but also against having to procure and manufacture the goods, perhaps turning down other customers. Once he has been given reason to believe that the buyers performance has become uncertain, it is an un due hardship to force him to continue his own performance. Similarly, a buyer who believes that the sellers deliveries have become uncertain cannot safely wait for the due date of performance when he has been buying to assure himself of materials for his current manufacturing or to replenish his stock of merchandise. 2. Three measures have been adopted to meet the needs of commercial men in such situations. First, the aggrieved party is permitted to suspend his own performance and any preparation therefor, with excuse for any resulting necessary delay, until the situation has been clarified. Suspend performance under this section means to hold up performance pending the outcome of the demand and includes also the hold ing up of any preparatory action. This is the same principle which governs the ancient law of stoppage and sellers lien, and also of excuse of a buyer from prepayment if the sellers actions manifest that he cannot or will not perform. (Original A ct, Section 63 (2).) Secondly, the aggrieved party is given the right to require adequate assurance that the other partys performance will be duly forthcoming. This principle is r eflected in the familiar clauses permitting the seller to curtail deliveries if the buyers credit becomes impaired, which when held within the limits of reasonableness and good faith actually express no more than the fair business meaning of any comm ercial contract. Third, and finally, this section provides the means by which the aggrieved party may treat the contract as broken if his reasonable grounds for insecurity are not cleared up within a reasonable time. This is the principle underlying the law of anticipatory breach, whether by way of defective part performance or by repudiation. The present section merges these three principles of law and commercial practice into a single theory of general application to all sales agreements looking to future performance. 3. Subsection (2) of the present section requires that reasonable grounds and adequate assurance as used in subsection (1) be defined by commercia l rather than legal standards. The express reference to commercial standards carries no connotation that the obligation of good faith is not equally applicable here. Under commercial standards and in accord with commercial practice, a ground for insecurity need not arise from or be directly related to the contract in question. The law as to dependence or independence of promises within a single contract does not control the application of the present section. Thus a buyer who falls behind in his account with the seller, even though the items involved have to do with separate and legally distinct contracts, impa irs the sellers expectation of due performance. Again, under the same test, a buyer who requires precision parts which he intends to use immediately upon delivery, may have reasonable grounds for insecurity if he discovers that his seller is making d efective deliveries of such parts to other buyers with similar needs. Thus, too, in a situation such as arose in Jay Dreher Corporation v. Delco Appliance Corporation, 93, F.2d 275 (C.C.A.2, 1937), where a manufacturer gave a dealer an exclusive franchis e for the sale of his product but on two or three occasions breached the exclusive dealing clause, although there was no default in orders, deliveries or payments under the separate sales contract between the parties, the aggrieved dealer would be entitl ed to suspend his performance of the contract for sale under the present section and to demand assurance that the exclusive dealing contract would be lived up to. There is no need for an explicit clause tying the exclusive franchise into the contract for the sale of goods since the situation itself ties the agreements together. The nature of the sales contract enters also into the question of reasonableness. For example, a report from an apparently trustworthy source that the seller had shipped defective goods or was planning to ship them would normally give the buyer reasonable grounds for insecurity. But when the buyer has assumed the risk of payment before inspection of the goods, as in a sales contract on C.I.F. or similar cash agai nst documents terms, that risk is not to be evaded by a demand for assurance. Therefore no ground for insecurity would exist under this section unless the report went to a ground which would excuse payment by the buyer. 4. What constitutes adequate assurance of due performance is subject to the same test of factual conditions. For example, where the buyer can make use of a defective delivery, a mere promise by a seller of good repute that he is giving the matter his attention and that the defect will not be repeated, is normally sufficient. Under the same circumstances, however, a similar statement by a known cornercutte r might well be considered insufficient without the posting of a guaranty or, if so demanded by the buyer, a speedy replacement of the delivery involved. By the same token where a delivery has defects, even though easily curable, which interfere with eas y use by the buyer, no verbal assurance can be deemed adequate which is not accompanied by replacement, repair, money-allowance, or other commercially reasonable cure. A fact situation such as arose in Corn Products Refining Co. v. Fasola, 94 N.J.L. 181, 109 A. 505 (1920) offers illustration both of reasonable grounds for insecu rity and adequate assurance. In that case a contract for the sale of oils on 30 days credit, 2% off for payment within 10 days, provided that credit was to be extended to the buyer only if his financial responsibility was satisfactory to the seller. The buyer had been in the habit of taking advantage of the discount but at the same time he failed to make his customary 10 day payment, the seller heard rumors, in fact false, that the buyers financial condition was shaky. Thereupon, the sel ler demanded cash before shipment or security satisfactory to him. The buyer sent a good credit report from his banker, expressed willingness to make payments when due on the 30 day terms and insisted on further deliveries under the contract. Under this Article the rumors, although false, were enough to make the buyers financial condition unsatisfactory to the seller under the contract clause. Moreover, the buyers practice of taking the cash discounts is enough, apart from the contract c lause, to lay a commercial foundation for suspicion when the practice is suddenly stopped. These matters, however, go only to the justification of the sellers demand for security, or his reasonable grounds for insecurity. The adequacy of the assurance given is not measured as in the type of satisfaction situation affected with intangibles, such as in personal service cases, cases involving a third partys judgment as final, or cases in which the whole contract is dependent on one partys satisfaction, as in a sale on approval. Here, the seller must exercise good faith and observe commercial standards. This Article th us approves the statement of the court in James B. Berrys Sons Co. of Illinois v. Monark Gasoline &amp; Oil Co., Inc. 32 F.2d 74 (C.C.A.8, 1929), that the sellers satisfaction under such a clause must be based upon reason and must not be arbitrary or capricious; and rejects the purely personal good faith test of the Corn Products Refining Co. case, which held that in the sellers sole judgment, if for any reason he was dissatisfied, he was entitled to revoke the credit. In the absence of the buyers failure to take the 2% discount as was his custom, the bankers report given in that case would have been adequate assurance under this Act, re...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-610"><akn:num>§ 8.2-610</akn:num><akn:heading>Anticipatory repudiation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When either party repudiates the contract with respect to a performance not yet due the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may (a) for a commercially reasonable time await performance by the repudiating party; or (b) resort to any remedy for breach (§ 8.2-703 or § 8.2-711), even though he has notified the repudiating party that he would await the latters performance and has urged retra ction; and (c) in either case suspend his own performance or proceed in accordance with the provisions of this title on the sellers right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding brea ch or to salvage unfinished goods (§ 8.2-704).

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: See Sections 63(2) and 65, Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: To make it clear that: 1. With the problem of insecurity taken care of by the preceding section and with provision being made in this Article as to the effect of a defective delivery un der an installment contract, anticipatory repudiation centers upon an overt communication of intention or an action which renders performance impossible or demonstrates a clear determination not to continue with performance. Under the present section when such a repudiation substantially impairs the value of the contract, the aggrieved party may at any time resort to his remedies for breach, or he may suspend his own performance while he negotiates with, or awaits performance by, the other party. But if he awaits performance beyond a commercially reasonable time he cannot recover resulting damages which he should have avoided. 2. It is not necessary for repudiation that performance be made literally and utterly impossible. Repudiation can result from action which reasonably indicates a rejection of the continuing obligation. And, a repudiation automatically results under the preceding section on insecurity when a party fails to provide adequate assurance of due future performance within thirty days after a justifiable demand therefor h as been made. Under the language of this section, a demand by one or both parties for more than the contract calls for in the way of counter-performance is not in itself a repudiation nor does it invalidate a plain expression of desire for future perform ance. However, when under a fair reading it amounts to a statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract, it becomes a repudiation. 3. The test chosen to justify an aggrieved partys action under this section is the same as that in the section is the same as that in the section on breach in installment contractsnamely the substantial value of the contract. The most useful test of substantial value is to determine whether material inconvenience or injustice will result if the aggrieved party is forced to wait and receive an ultimate ten der minus the part or aspect repudiated. 4. After repudiation, the aggrieved party may immediately resort to any remedy he chooses provided he moves in good faith (see Section 1-203). Inaction and silenc e by the aggrieved party may leave the matter open but it cannot be regarded as misleading the repudiating party. Therefore the aggrieved party is left free to proceed at any time with his options under this section, unless he has taken some positive act ion which in good faith requires notification to the other party before the remedy is pursued.

In Virginia Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Hughes, 140 Va. 249, 259, 124 S.E. 283 (1924), the court said that upon the seller being notified of the breach it is the sellers duty to accept the situation and terminate all relations and sue for the breach and prove his damages. The seller was, therefore, denied the price of the good s, and because he had failed to prove any damages, the seller was denied as well. In Baker-Matthews Lumber Co., Inc. v. Lincoln Furniture Co., Inc., 153 Va. 14, 149 S.E. 517 (1929), it was found that the seller was unreasonable in thinking that the buyer had made an anticipatory repudiation of the contract.

Purposes: To make clear that: 1. The repudiating partys right to reinstate the contract is entirely dependent upon the action taken by the aggrieved party. If the latter has cancelled the contract or materially changed his position at any time after the repudiation, there can be no retraction under this section. 2. Under subsection (2) an effective retraction must be accompanied by any assurances demanded under the section dealing with right to adequate assurance. A repud iation is of course sufficient to give reasonable ground for insecurity and to warrant a request for assurance as an essential condition of the retraction. However, after a timely and unambiguous expression of retraction, a reasonable time for the assura nce to be worked out should be allowed by the aggrieved party before cancellation.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 45(2), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: To continue prior law but to make explicit the more mercantile interpretation of many of the rules involved, so that: 1. The definition of an installment contract is phrased more broadly in this Article so as to cover installment deliveries tacitly authorized by the circumstances or by the option of either party. 2. In regard to the apportionment of the price for separate payment this Article applies the more liberal test of what can be apportioned rather than the test of what is clearly apportioned by the agreement. This Article also recognizes approximate calculation or apportionment of price subject to subsequent adjustment. A provision for separate payment for each lot delivered ordinarily means that the price is at l east roughly calculable by units of quantity, but such a provision is not essential to an installment contract. If separate acceptance of separate deliveries is contemplated, no generalized contrast between wholly entire and wholly di visible contracts has any standing under this Article. 3. This Article rejects any approach which gives clauses such as each delivery is a separate contract their legalistically literal effect. Such contracts nonetheless call for installment deliveries. Even where a clause speaks of a separate contract for all purposes, a commercial reading of the language under the section on good faith and commercial standards requires that the singleness of the doc ument and the negotiation, together with the sense of the situation, prevail over any uncommercial and legalistic interpretation. 4. One of the requirements for rejection under subsection (2) is non-conformity substantially impairing the value of the installment in question. However, an inst allment agreement may require accurate conformity in quality as a condition to the right to acceptance if the need for such conformity is made clear either by express provision or by the circumstances. In such a case the effect of the agreement is to def ine explicitly what amounts to substantial impairment of value impossible to cure. A clause requiring accurate compliance as a condition to the right to acceptance must, however, have some basis in reason, must avoid imposing hardship by surprise and is subject to waiver or to displacement by practical construction. Substantial impairment of the value of an installment can turn not only on the quality of the goods but also on such factors as time, quantity, assortment, and th e like. It must be judged in terms of the normal or specifically known purposes of the contract. The defect in required documents refers to such matters as the absence of insurance documents under a C.I.F. contract, falsity of a bill of lading, or one fa iling to show shipment within the contract period or to the contract destination. Even in such cases, however, the provisions on cure of tender apply if appropriate documents are readily procurable. 5. Under subsection (2) an installment delivery must be accepted if the non-conformity is curable and the seller gives adequate assurance of cure. Cure of non-con formity of an installment in the first instance can usually be afforded by an allowance against the price, or in the case of reasonable discrepancies in quantity either by a further delivery or a partial rejection. This Article requires reasonable action by a buyer in regard to discrepant delivery and good faith requires that the buyer make any reasonable minor outlay of time or money necessary to cure an overshipment by severing out an acceptable percentage thereof. The seller must take over a cure whi ch involves any material burden; the buyers obligation reaches only to cooperation. Adequate assurance for purposes of subsection (2) is measured by the same standards as under the section on right to adequate assurance of performance. 6. Subsection (3) is designed to further the continuance of the contract in the absence of an overt cancellation. The question arising when an action is brought a s to a single installment only is resolved by making such action waive the right of cancellation. This involves merely a defect in one or more installments, as contrasted with the situation where there is a true repudiation within the section on anticipa tory repudiation. Whether the non-conformity in any given installment justifies cancellation as to the future depends, not on whether such non-conformity indicates an intent or likelihood that the future deliveries will also be defective, but whether the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of the whole contract. If only the sellers security in regard to future installments is impaired, he has the right to demand adequate assurances of proper future performance but has not an immediate rig ht to cancel the entire contract. It is clear under this Article, however, that defects in prior installments are cumulative in effect, so that acceptance does not wash out the defect waived. Prior policy is continued, putting the rule as to buye rs default on the same footing as that in regard to sellers default. 7. Under the requirement of seasonable notification of cancellation under subsection (3), a buyer who accepts a non-conforming installment which substantially imp airs the value of the entire contract should properly be permitted to withhold his decision as to whether or not to cancel pending a response from the seller as to his claim for cure or adjustment. Similarly, a seller may withhold a delivery pending paym ent for prior ones, at the same time delaying his decision as to cancellation. A reasonable time for notifying of cancellation, judged by commercial standards under the section on good faith, extends of course to include the time covered by any reasonabl e negotiation in good faith. However, during this period the defaulting party is entitled, on request to know whether the contract is still in effect, before he can be required to perform further.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Subsection 8.2-612(3), which provides that an aggrieved party reinstates the contract by accepting a nonconforming installment without seasonably notifying the ot her party of cancellation, is in accord with prior Virginia law, at least where the nonconformity is a delay in delivery. The Virginia cases hold that a buyer who has the right to rescind the contract of sale upon the failure of the seller to deliver the subject matter at the time specified waives his right to rescind and the contract is kept alive against the buyer as well as against the seller, so that neither can maintain an action against the other, except for a breach thereafter occurring.

Aetna Hosiery Co., 124 Va. 221, 236-38, 98 S.E. 43 (1919). It is not entirely clear under prior Virginia law whether the buyer could, without giving notice, reject delayed deliveries after he accepted late deliveries whil e pressing for greater promptness. In Richmond Leather Manufacturing Co. v. Fawcett, 130 Va. 484, 508, 107 S.E. 800 (1921), it was said that the buyer was required to give notice . . . that thereafter he stood upon his legal rights, and the contracts must be discharged strictly according to their terms. See also Smith v. Snyder, 77 Va. 432, 440-43 (1883), 82 Va. 614 (1886). However, W. S. Forbes &amp; Co. v. Southern Cotton Oil Co., 130 Va. 245, 251-52, 108 S.E. 15 (1921), held that accepting late d elivery on one contract did not constitute a waiver of the requirement of delivery on time as to another contract. By accepting delayed payments, under prior Virginia law, the seller waived his right to insist on payment for future installments in strict accordance with the te rms of the contract. If the seller intended to require strict punctuality of payment in the future he had to give the buyer notice of that fact.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 7 and 8, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten, the basic policy being continued but the test of a divisible or indivisible sale or contract being abandoned in favor of adjustment in business terms. Purposes of changes: 1. Where goods whose continued existence is presupposed by the agreement are destroyed without fault of either party, the buyer is relieved from his obligation bu t may at his option take the surviving goods at a fair adjustment. Fault is intended to include negligence and not merely wilful wrong. The buyer is expressly given the right to inspect the goods in order to determine whether he wishes to avoid t he contract entirely or to take the goods with a price adjustment. 2. The section applies whether the goods were already destroyed at the time of contracting without the knowledge of either party or whether they are destroyed sub sequently but before the risk of loss passes to the buyer. Where under the agreement, including of course usage of trade, the risk has passed to the buyer before the casualty, the section has no application. Beyond this, the essential question in determi ning whether the rules of this section are to be applied is whether the seller has or has not undertaken the responsibility for the continued existence of the goods in proper condition through the time of agreed or expected delivery. 3. The section on the term no arrival, no sale makes clear that delay in arrival, quite as much as physical change in the goods, gives the buyer the optio ns set forth in this section.

History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 22, 23, 25, 30. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. Subsection (1) requires the tender of a commercially reasonable substituted performance where agreed to facilities have failed or become commercially impractic able. Under this Article, in the absence of specific agreement, the normal or usual facilities enter into the agreement either through the circumstances, usage of trade or prior course of dealing. This section appears between Section 2-613 on casualty to identified goods and the next section on excuse by failure of presupposed conditions, both of which deal with excuse and complete avoidance of the contract where the occurrence or non-occurrence of a contingency which was a basic assumption of the contract makes the expected performance impossible. The distinction between the present section and those sect ions lies in whether the failure or impossibility of performance arises in connection with an incidental matter or goes to the very heart of the agreement. The differing lines of solution are contrasted in a comparison of International Paper Co. v. Rocke feller, 161 App. Div. 180, 146 N.Y.S. 371 (1914) and Meyer v. Sullivan, 40 Cal. App. 723, 181 P. 847 (1919). In the former case a contract for the sale of spruce to be cut from a particular tract of land was involved. When a fire destroyed the trees grow ing on that tract the seller was held excused since performance was impossible. In the latter case the contract called for delivery of wheat f.o.b. Kosmos Steamer at Seattle. The war led to cancellation of that lines sailing schedule after sp ace had been duly engaged and the buyer was held entitled to demand substituted delivery at the warehouse on the lines loading dock. Under this Article, of course, the seller would also be entitled, had the market gone the other way, to make a substi tuted tender in that manner. There must, however, be a true commercial impracticability to excuse the agreed to performance and justify a substituted performance. When this is the case a reas onable substituted performance tendered by either party should excuse him from strict compliance with contract terms which do not go to the essence of the agreement. 2. The substitution provided in this section as between buyer and seller does not carry over into the obligation of a financing agency under a letter of credit si nce such an agency is entitled to performance which is plainly adequate on its face and without need to look into commercial evidence outside of the documents. See Article 5-109, 5-110 and 5-114. 3. Under subsection (2) where the contract is still executory on both sides, the seller is permitted to withdraw unless the buyer can provide him with a commercia lly equivalent return despite the governmental regulation. Where, however, only the debt for the price remains, a larger leeway is permitted. The buyer may pay in the manner provided by the regulation even though this may not be commercially equivalent p rovided that the regulation is not discriminatory, oppressive or predatory. Cross reference: Point 2: Article 5.

(b) Where the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only a part of the sellers capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under contract as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable. (c) The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or nondelivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph (b), of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 22, 30. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. This section excuses a seller from timely delivery of goods contracted for, where his performance has become commercially impracticable because of unforeseen s upervening circumstances not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. The destruction of specific goods and the problem of the use of substituted performance on points other than delay or quantity, treated elsewhere in this Art icle, must be distinguished from the matter covered by this section. 2. The present section deliberately refrains from any effort at an exhaustive expression of contingencies and is to be interpreted in all cases sought to be broug ht within its scope in terms of its underlying reason and purpose. 3. The first test for excuse under this Article in terms of basic assumption is a familiar one. The additional test of commercial impracticability (as contrasted with impossibility, frustration of performance or frustration of the venture) has been adopted in order to call attention to the commercial character of the criterion chosen by this Article. 4. Increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen contingency which alters the essential nature of the perform ance. Neither is a rise or a collapse in the market in itself a justification, for that is exactly the type of business risk which business contracts made at fixed prices are intended to cover. But a severe shortage of raw materials or of supplies due to a contingency such as war, embargo, local crop failure, unforeseen shutdown of major sources of supply or the like, which either causes a marked increase in cost or altogether prevents the seller from securing supplies necessary to his performance, is w ithin the contemplation of this section. (See Ford &amp; Sons, Ltd. v. Henry Leetham &amp; Sons, Ltd., 21 Com. Cas. 55 (1915, K.B.D.).) 5. Where a particular source of supply is exclusive under the agreement and fails through casualty, the present section applies rather than the provision on destr uction or deterioration of specific goods. The same holds true where a particular source of supply is shown by the circumstances to have been contemplated or assumed by the parties at the time of contracting. (See Davis Co. v. Hoffmann-LaRoche Chemical W orks, 178 App. Div. 855, 166 N.Y.S. 179 (1917) and International Paper Co. v. Rockefeller, 161 App. Div. 180, 146 N.Y.S. 371 (1914).) There is no excuse under this section, however, unless the seller has employed all due measures to assure himself that h is source will not fail. (See Canadian Industrial Alcohol Co., Ltd. v. Dunbar Molasses Co., 258 N.Y. 194, 179 N.E. 383, 80 A.L.R. 1173 (1932) and Washington Mfg. Co. v. Midland Lumber Co., 113 Wash. 593, 194 P. 777 (1921).) In the case of failure of production by an agreed source for causes beyond the sellers control, the seller should, if possible, be excused since production by an agreed source is without more a basic assumption of the contract. Such excuse should not result in relieving the defaulting supplier from liability nor in dropping into the sellers lap an unearned bonus of damages over. The flexible adjustment ma chinery of this Article provides the solution under the provision on the obligation of good faith. A condition to his making good the claim of excuse is the turning over to the buyer of his rights against the defaulting source of supply to the extent of the buyers contract in relation to which excuse is being claimed. 6. In situations in which neither sense nor justice is served by either answer when the issue is posed in flat terms of excuse or no excuse, adjus tment under the various provisions of this Article is necessary, especially the sections on good faith, on insecurity and assurance and on the reading of all provisions in the light of their purposes and the general policy of this Act to use equitable pr inciples in furtherance of commercial standards and good faith. 7. The failure of conditions which go to convenience or collateral values rather than to the commercial practicability of the main performance does not amount to a complete excuse. However, good faith and the reason of the present section and of the preceding one may properly be held to justify and even to require any needed delay involved in a good faith inquiry seeking a readjustment of the contract terms to me et the new conditions. 8. The provisions of this section are made subject to assumption of greater liability by agreement and such agreement is to be found not only in the expressed ter ms of the contract but in the circumstances surrounding the contracting, in trade usage and the like. Thus the exemptions of this section do not apply when the contingency in question is sufficiently foreshadowed at the time of contracting to be included among the business risks which are fairly to be regarded as part of the dickered terms, either consciously or as a matter of reasonable, commercial interpretation from the circumstances. (See Madeirense Do Brasil, S. A. v. Stulman-Emrick Lumber Co., 147 F.2d 399 (C.C.A., 2 Cir., 1945).) The exemption otherwise present through usage of trade under the present section may also be expressly negated by the language of the agreement. Generally, express agreements as to exemptions designed to enlarge upon or supplant the provisions of this section are to be read in the light of mercantile sense and reason, for this section itself sets up the commercial standard for normal and reasonable interpretation and provides a minimum beyond which agreement may not go . Agreement can also be made in regard to the consequences of exemption as laid down in paragraphs (b) and (c) and the next section on procedure on notice claiming excuse. 9. The case of a farmer who has contracted to sell crops to be grown on designated land may be regarded as falling either within the section on casualty to identi fied goods or this section, and he may be excused, when there is a failure of the specific crop, either on the basis of the destruction of identified goods or because of the failure of a basic assumption of the contract. Exemption of the buyer in the case of a requirements contract is covered by the Output and Requirements section both as to assumption and allocati on of the relevant risks. But when a contract by a manufacturer to buy fuel or raw material makes no specific reference to a particular venture and no such reference may be drawn from the circumstances, commercial understanding views it as a general deal in the general market and not conditioned on any assumption of the continuing operation of the buyers plant. Even when notice is given by the buyer that the supplies are needed to fill a specific contract of a normal commercial kind, commercial unde rstanding does not see such a supply contract as conditioned on the continuance of the buyers further contract for outlet. On the other hand, where the buyers contract is in reasonable commercial understanding conditioned on a definite and specif ic venture or assumption as, for instance, a war procurement sub-contract known to be based on a prime contract which is subject to termination, or a supply contract for a particular construction venture, the reason of the present section may well apply and entitle the buyer to the exemption. 10. Following its basic policy of using commercial practicability as a test for excuse, this section recognizes as of equal significance either a foreign or domes tic regulation and disregards any technical distinctions between law, regulation, order and the like. Nor does it make the present action of the seller depend upon the eventual judicial determination of the legality of the particu lar governmental action. The sellers good faith belief in the validity of the regulation is the test under this Article and the best evidence of his good faith is the general commercial acceptance of the regulation. However, governmental interference cannot excuse unless it truly supervenes in such a manner as to be beyond the sellers assumption of risk. And any action by the party claiming excuse which causes or colludes in inducing the governmental action preventing his performance wou ld be in breach of good faith and would destroy his exemption. 11. An excused seller must fulfill his contract to the extent which the supervening contingency permits, and if the situation is such that his customers are gener ally affected he must take account of all in supplying one.

Purposes: This section seeks to establish simple and workable machinery for providing certainty as to when a supervening and excusing contingency excuses the delay, discharges the contract, or may result in a waiver of the delay by the buyer. When the seller notifies, in accordance with the preceding section, claiming excuse, the buyer may acquiesce, in which case the contract is so modified. No considerati on is necessary in a case of this kind to support such a modification. If the buyer does not elect so to modify the contract, he may terminate it and under subsection (2) his silence after receiving the sellers claim of excuse operates as such a term ination. Subsection (3) denies effect to any contract clause made in advance of trouble which would require the buyer to stand ready to take delivery whenever the seller is excused from delivery by unforeseen circumstances.

For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Bankruptcy, § 60; 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § § 18, 24, 32. CASE NOTES Right of seller to reclaim goods.  Sections 8.2-507 and 8.2-511 give the seller a right to reclaim his goods from the buyer where a cash transaction has occurred, and a check, taken in payment by t he seller, was dishonored. However, the right to reclaim is limited to a 10-day period from the delivery of the goods as provided by § 8.2-507 by virtue of its cross reference to this section. If the right to reclaim has not been exercised within that specified time period, the right is waived. The sellers remedy is then on the instrument as well as for breach of contract. This reduces the sellers rights to those of a general creditor. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dis t. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). The seller in a cash transaction, who accepts a check which the bank refuses to pay because of the intervening of bankruptcy proceedings, has the right to reclaim the goods sold, and nothing in the Bankruptcy Act changes this. If the seller has a right to reclaim the goods, he stands in a position superior to any creditor. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 287 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). Conditions of right to reclaim goods.  Discovery of the buyers insolvency and demand within a 10-day period of receipt are conditions of the right to reclaim the goods. In re Helms Veneer Corp., 28 7 F. Supp. 840, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8424 (W.D. Va. 1968). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Right of seller to reclaim goods.  Since the unsecured creditor had an adequate remedy at law by a right to reclaim the amounts owed on certain dishonored checks of an insolvent company, the secure d creditor was entitled to payment of the insolvent companys debts from the companys remaining assets. Signet Bank v. Bradley, Inc., 56 Va. Cir. 207, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 451 (Richmond June 1, 2001). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Subsection (1)Sections 53(1) (b), 54(1) (c) and 57, Uniform Sales Act; Subsection (2)none; Subsection (3)Section 76(3), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten, the protection given to a seller who has sold on credit and has delivered goods to the buyer immediately preceding his insolvency being extended. Purposes of changes and new matter: To make it clear that: 1. The sellers right to withhold the goods or to stop delivery except for cash when he discovers the buyers insolvency is made explicit in subsection (1) regardless of the passage of title, and the concept of stoppage has been extended to include goods in the possession of any bailee who has not yet attorned to the buyer. 2. Subsection (2) takes as its base line the proposition that any receipt of goods on credit by an insolvent buyer amounts to a tacit business misrepresentation o f solvency and therefore is fraudulent as against the particular seller. This Article makes discovery of the buyers insolvency and demand within a ten day period a condition of the right to reclaim goods on this ground. The ten day limitation period operates from the time of receipt of the goods. An exception to this time limitation is made when a written misrepresentation of solvency has been made to the particular seller within three months prior to the delivery. To fall within the exception the statement of solvency must be in writing, addressed to the particular seller and dated within three months of the delivery. 3. Because the right of the seller to reclaim goods under this section constitutes preferential treatment as against the buyers other creditors, subsection (3 ) provides that such reclamation bars all his other remedies as to the goods involved.

VIRGINIA COMMENT The right given by subsection 8.2-702(2) to the seller to reclaim goods, when he discovers that the buyer is insolvent and makes demand for their return within te n days after delivery, changes Virginia law. In James v. Birds Admr, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 510, 513 (1837), the court said that the seller of personal property has no implied or equitable lien for the purchase money and that he must look solely to the personal responsibility of the buyer. In Trigg v. Bucyrus Co., 104 Va. 79, 81-88, 51 S.E. 174 (1905), the seller was not permitted to recover a chattel from an insolvent buyer, ownership having passed to the buyer, but since the insolvency apparently oc curred much more than ten days after the delivery of the chattel, the result would be the same under the UCC. Subsection 8.2-702(3) is in accord with Oberdorfer v. Meyer, 88 Va. 384, 386, 13 S.E. 756 (1891), which indicated that a seller could reclaim goods from a buyer w ho had fraudulently misrepresented his solvency, but denied reclamation because the goods had passed into the hands of a party who had taken them in good faith without notice of the sellers rights.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-703"><akn:num>§ 8.2-703</akn:num><akn:heading>Sellers remedies in general</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Where the buyer wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a payment due on or before delivery or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole , then with respect to any goods directly affected and, if the breach is of the whole contract (§ 8.2-612), then also with respect to the whole undelivered balance, the aggrieved seller may (a) with hold delivery of such goods; (b) stop delivery by any bailee as hereafter provided (§ 8.2-705); (c) proceed under the next section [§ 8.2-704] respecting goods still unidentified to the contract; (d) resell and recover damages as hereafter provided (§ 8.2-706); (e) recover damages for nonacceptance (§ 8.2-708) or in a proper case the price (§ 8.2-709); (f) cancel.

CASE NOTES Seller may resell goods and recover damages.  When a buyer wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods, an aggrieved seller is entitled to pursue certain remedies, including reselling the goods to a thi rd party and recovering damages from the buyer. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Earhart Petroleum, Inc., No. 99-2093, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 8674 (4th Cir. May 3, 2000). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: No comparable index section. See Section 53, Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: 1. This section is an index section which gathers together in one convenient place all of the various remedies open to a seller for any breach by the buyer. This Article rejects any doctrine of election of remedy as a fundamental policy and thus the remedies are essentially cumulative in nature and include all of the available remedies for breach. Whether the pursuit of one remedy bars another depends entirely on the facts of the individual case. 2. The buyers breach which occasions the use of the remedies under this section may involve only one lot or delivery of goods, or may involve all of the goods which are the subject matter of the particular contract. The right of the seller to pursue a remedy as to all the goods when the breach is as to only one or more lots is covered by the section on breach in installment contracts. The present section deal s only with the remedies available after the goods involved in the breach have been determined by that section. 3. In addition to the typical case of refusal to pay or default in payment, the language in the preamble, fails to make a payment due, is intended to cove r the dishonor of a check on due presentment, or the non-acceptance of a draft, and the failure to furnish an agreed letter of credit. 4. It should also be noted that this Act requires its remedies to be liberally administered and provides that any right or obligation which it declares is enforce able by action unless a different effect is specifically prescribed (Section 1-106).

VIRGINIA COMMENT For a comment on the sellers remedies under the UCC as compared with the remedies under prior Virginia law, see Rowe, Sellers Remedies and Article 2, 20 W ash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. (Fall 1963). The different sellers remedies under prior Virginia law were summarized in Rosenbaums v. Weeden, Johnson &amp; Co., 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 785, 790 (1868) as follows: If a vendee of goods refuse to accept them when tendered according to the contract of sale, the vendor may elect to rescind the contract and keep or dispose of the goods for his own use, or to let it remain in full force and hold the vendee liable f or the price of the goods and all damages arising from his breach of the contract. If he elects to let the contract remain in full force, he may either bring his action for the price of the goods when it is due and payable, or he may sell the goods, appl y the net proceeds of sale to the credit of the vendee on account of the money due by him, and bring an action against him to recover the balance. Although the Rosenbaums case referred to the remedy of cancellation, there appears to be no Virginia ca se involving the situation. For purposes of venue, Big Seam Coal Corp. v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co., 196 Va. 590, 594-95, 85 S.E.2d 239 (1955), held that a contract for coal F.O.B. mine was breached at the mine where the buyer refused to accept sh ipments. The UCC does not cover the point.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-704"><akn:num>§ 8.2-704</akn:num><akn:heading>Sellers right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) An aggriev ed seller under the preceding section [§ 8.2-703] may (a) iden tify to the contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time he learned of the breach they are in his possession or control; (b) treat as the subject of resale goods which have demonstrably been intended for the particular contract even though those goods are unfinished. (2) Where the goods are unfinished an aggrieved seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss and of effective realization either complete the manufacture and wholly identify the goods to the contract or cease manufactu re and resell for scrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reasonable manner. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations Law Review. For article on mitigation of damages, see 69 Va. L. Rev. 967 (1983). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 63(3) and 64(4). Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten, the sellers rights being broadened. Purpose of changes: 1. This section gives an aggrieved seller the right at the time of breach to identify to the contract any conforming finished goods, regardless of their resalabil ity, and to use reasonable judgment as to completing unfinished goods. It thus makes the goods available for resale under the resale section, the sellers primary remedy, and in the special case in which resale is not practicable, allows the action fo r the price which would then be necessary to give the seller the value of his contract. 2. Under this Article the seller is given express power to complete manufacture or procurement of goods for the contract unless the exercise of reasonable commerc ial judgment as to the facts as they appear at the time he learns of the breach makes it clear that such action will result in a material increase in damages. The burden is on the buyer to show the commercially unreasonable nature of the sellers acti on in completing manufacture. Cross references: Sections 2-703 and 2-706.

(2) As against such buyer the seller may stop delivery until: (a) rece ipt of the goods by the buyer; or (b) acknowledgment to the buyer by any bailee of the goods except a carrier that the bailee holds the goods for the buyer; or (c) such acknowledgment to the buyer by a carrier by reshipment or as a warehouse; or (d) negotiation to the buyer of any negotiable document of title covering the goods. (3) (a) To stop delivery the seller must so notify as to enable the bailee by reasonable d iligence to prevent delivery of the goods. (b) After such notification the bailee must hold and deliver the goods according to the directions of the seller but the seller is liable to the bailee for any ensuing charges or damage s. (c) If a negotiable document of title has been issued for goods the bailee is not obliged to obey a notification to stop until surrender of possession or control of the document.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 18, 32. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Sections 57-59, Uniform Sales Act; see also Sections 12, 14 and 42, Uniform Bills of Lading Act and Sections 9, 11 and 49, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act. Changes: Thi s section continues and develops the above sections of the Uniform Sales Act in the light of the other uniform statutory provisions noted. Purposes: To make it clear that: 1. Subsection (1) applies the stoppage principle to other bailees as well as carriers. It also expands the remedy to cover the situations, in addition to buyers insolvency, specified in the subsection. But since stoppage is a burden in any case to carriers, and might be a very heavy burden to them if it covered all small shipments in all these situations, the right to stop for reasons other than insolvency is limited to carload, truckload, planeload or larger shipments. The seller shipping to a buyer of doubtful credit can protect himself by shipping C.O.D. Where stoppage occurs for insecurity it is merely a suspension of performance, and if assurances are duly forthcoming from the buyer the seller is not entitled to resell or divert. Improper stoppage is a breach by the seller if it effectively interferes with the buyers right to due tender under the section on manner of tender of delivery . However, if the bailee obeys an unjustified order to stop he may also be liable to the buyer. The measure of his obligation is dependent on the provisions of the Documents of Title Article (Section 7-303). Subsection 3(b) therefore gives him a right of indemnity as against the seller in such a case. 2. Receipt by the buyer includes receipt by the buyers designated representative, the sub-purchaser, when shipment is made direct to him and the buyer himself never receives the goods. It is entirely proper under this Article that the seller, by making such direct shipment to the sub-purchaser, be regarded as acquiescing in the latters purchase and as thus barred from stoppage of the goods as agai nst him. As between the buyer and the seller, the latters right to stop the goods at any time until they reach the place of final delivery is recognized by this sectio n. Under subsection (3) (c) and (d), the carrier is under no duty to recognize the stop order of a person who is a stranger to the carriers contract. But the sel lers right as against the buyer to stop delivery remains, whether or not the carrier is obligated to recognize the stop order. If the carrier does obey it, the buyer cannot complain merely because of that circumstance; and the seller becomes obligate d under subsection (3) (b) to pay the carrier any ensuing damages or charges. 3. A diversion of a shipment is not a reshipment under subsection (2) (c) when it is merely an incident to the original contract of transportation. Nor is the procurement of exchange bills of lading which change only the name of the consignee to that of the buyers local agent but do not alter the destination of a reshipment. Acknowledgment by the carrier as a warehouseman within the meaning of this Article requires a contract of a truly different character from the original sh ipment, a contract not in extension of transit but as a warehouseman. 4. Subsection (3) (c) makes the bailees obedience of a notification to stop conditional upon the surrender of any outstanding negotiable document. 5. Any charges or losses incurred by the carrier in following the sellers orders, whether or not he was obligated to do so, fall to the sellers charge. 6. After an effective stoppage under this section the sellers rights in the goods are the same as if he had never made a delivery. Cross references: Sections 2-702 and 2-703.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Virginia has recognized the doctrine of stoppage in transit. In Howatt &amp; Co. v. Davis &amp; Chalmers, 19 Va. (5 Munf.) 34, 37-39 (1816), a seller was allowed a right of stoppage when the buyer became insolvent while the goods were still in the hands of the sellers agent, the court speaking of the goods as being in legal phrase, in transitu. The doctrine was discussed in Pleasants v. Pendleton, 27 Va.

Where the resale is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages allowed under the provisions of this title (§ 8.2-710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyers breach. (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not nece ssary that the goods be in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach. (3) Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell. (4) Where the resale is at public sale (a) only identified goods can be sold except where there is a recognized market for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind; and (b) it must be made at a usual place or market for public sale if one is reasonably available and except in the case of goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedi ly the seller must give the buyer reasonable notice of the time and place of the resale; and (c) if the goods are not to be within the view of those attending the sale the notification of sale must state the place where the goods are located and provide for their reasonable ins pection by prospective bidders; and (d) the seller may buy. (5) A purchase r who buys in good faith at a resale takes the goods free of any rights of the original buyer even though the seller fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this section. (6) The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale. A person in the position of a seller (§ 8.2-707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security i nterest, as hereinafter defined (subsection (3) of § 8.2-711).

CASE NOTES Buyer entitled to noti ce before private resale.  Following a buyers breach, the buyer was entitled to reasonable notice of the sellers intention to make a private sale so that it could protect itself whe n the seller attempted to sell the goods at a steep discount and then sue for the difference between the sale price and the contract price; the failure of the seller to give such notice barred it from asserting a claim for the difference between the sale price under its agreement with the buyer and the actual price at which it sold the goods to third parties.

Sellers duty to give not ice of private sale.  The breaching buyers mere failure to accept the goods does not place the buyer on notice that the seller will choose to make a private sale and seek cover as its remedy; even if the circumstances are such that the seller clearly has no remedy except resale, reasonable notification is necessary where the seller resorts to a private, rather than a public, sale.

Royster Co., 451 F.2d 3, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7419 (4th Cir. 1971). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 60, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: To simplify the prior statutory provision and to make it clear that: 1. The only condition precedent to the sellers right of resale under subsection (1) is a breach by the buyer within the section on the sellers remedies in general or insolvency. Other meticulous conditions and restrictions of the prior uniform statutory provision are disapproved by this Article and are replaced by standards of commercial reasonableness. Under this section the seller may resell the goods a fter any breach by the buyer. Thus, an anticipatory repudiation by the buyer gives rise to any of the sellers remedies for breach, and to the right of resale. This principle is supplemented by subsection (2) which authorizes a resale of goods which a re not in existence or were not identified to the contract before the breach. 2. In order to recover the damages prescribed in subsection (1) the seller must act in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner in making the re sale. This standard is intended to be more comprehensive than that of reasonable care and judgment established by the prior uniform statutory provision. Failure to act properly under this section deprives the seller of the measure of damages here provided and relegates him to that provided in Section 2-708. Under this Article the seller resells by authority of law, in his own behalf, for his own benefit and for the purpose of fixing his damages. The theory of a selle rs agency is thus rejected. 3. If the seller complies with the prescribed standard of duty in making the resale, he may recover from the buyer the damages provided for in subsection (1). Evi dence of market or current prices at any particular time or place is relevant only on the question of whether the seller acted in a commercially reasonable manner in making the resale. The distinction drawn by some courts between cases where the title had not passed to the buyer and the seller had resold as owner, and cases where the title had p assed and the seller had resold by virtue of his lien on the goods, is rejected. 4. Subsection (2) frees the remedy of resale from legalistic restrictions and enables the seller to resell in accordance with reasonable commercial practices so a s to realize as high a price as possible in the circumstances. By public sale is meant a sale by auction. A private sale may be effected by solicitation and negotiation conducted either directly or through a broker. In choosing between a public and private sale the character of the goods must be considered and relevant trade practices and usages must be observed. 5. Subsection (2) merely clarifies the common law rule that the time for resale is a reasonable time after the buyers breach, by using the language commer cially reasonable. What is such a reasonable time depends upon the nature of the goods, the condition of the market and the other circumstances of the case; its length cannot be measured by any legal yardstick or divided into degrees. Where a seller contemplating resale receives a demand from the buyer for inspection under the section of preserving evidence of goods in dispute, the time for resale may be appropriately lengthened. On the question of the place for resale, subsection (2) goes to the ultimate test, the commercial reasonableness of the sellers choice as to the place for an advantageous resale. This Article rejects the theory that the seller is required to resell at the agreed place for delivery and that a resale elsewhere can be permitted only in exceptional cases. 6. The purpose of subsection (2) being to enable the seller to dispose of the goods to the best advantage, he is permitted in making the resale to depart from the terms and conditions of the original contract for sale to any extent commercially reasonable in the circumstances. 7. The provision of subsection (2) that the goods need not be in existence to be resold applies when the buyer is guilty of anticipatory repudiation of a contract for future goods, before the goods or some of them have come into existence. In such a case the seller may exercise the right of resale and fix his damages by one or more contracts to sell the quantity of conforming future goods affected by the repudiation. The companion provision of subsection (2) that resale may be made although the goods were not identified to the contract prior to the buyers breach, likewise contemplates an anticipatory repudiation by the buyer but occurring after the g oods are in existence. If the goods so identified conform to the contract, their resale will fix the sellers damages quite as satisfactorily as if they had been identified before the breach. 8. Where the resale is to be by private sale, subsection (3) requires that reasonable notification of the sellers intention to resell must be given to the buy er. The length of notification or a private sale depends upon the urgency of the matter. Notification of the time and place of this type of sale is not required. Subsection (4) (b) requires that the seller give the buyer reasonable notice of the time and place of a public resale so that he ma...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-707"><akn:num>§ 8.2-707</akn:num><akn:heading>Person in the position of a seller</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p> Text (1) A pers on in the position of a seller includes as against a principal an agent who has paid or become responsible for the price of goods on behalf of his principal or anyone who otherwise holds a security interest or other right in goods similar to that of a seller.

Drug Fai r, Inc., 493 F.2d 251, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 9668 (4th Cir. 1974). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 64, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. The prior uniform statutory provision is followed generally in setting the current market price at the time and place for tender as the standard by which damag es for non-acceptance are to be determined. The time and place of tender is determined by reference to the section on manner of tender of delivery, and to the sections on the effect of such terms as FOB, FAS, CIF, C &amp; F. Ex Ship and No Arrival, No Sale. In the event that there is no evidence available of the current market price at the time and place of tender, proof of a substitute market may be made under the s ection on determination and proof of market price. Furthermore, the section on the admissibility of market quotations is intended to ease materially the problem of providing competent evidence. 2. The provision of this section permitting recovery of expected profit including reasonable overhead where the standard measure of damages is inadequate, togethe r with the new requirement that price actions may be sustained only where resale is impractical, are designed to eliminate the unfair and economically wasteful results arising under the older law when fixed price articles were involved. This section perm its the recovery of lost profits in all appropriate cases, which would include all standard priced goods. The normal measure there would be list price less cost to the dealer or list price less manufacturing cost to the manufacturer. It is not necessary to a recovery of profit to show a history of earnings, especially if a new venture is involved. 3. In all cases the seller may recover incidental damages.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Prior Virginia cases are in accord with subsection 8.2-708(1) in allowing the seller to retain the goods and maintain an action for damages, measured by the diffe rence between the contract price and the market price, at the time and place of tender, plus incidental damages incurred, and less any expenses the seller is saved by the breach. Sanitary Grocery Co. v. Wright, 158 Va. 312, 321-23, 163 S.E. 86 (1932); Fr ank v. East Carolina Lumber Co., 153 Va. 649, 151 S.E. 135 (1930) (no breach found); Wessel, Duval &amp; Co. v. Crozet Cooperage Co., 143 Va. 469, 477, 130 S.E. 393 (1925); J. B. Colt Co. v. Elam, 138 Va. 124, 131, 120 S.E. 857 (1924) (seller failed to prove any damages); James River Lumber Co., Inc. v.

Virginia has not specifically made an award of incidental damages as expressly authorized by the UCC. If this measure of damages, that is, the contract price less the market price is inadequate, then subsection 8.2-708(2) provides that the measure of damages shall be the profit lost. Virginia has also recognized that when the goods have not yet been manufactured, the measure of damages is either the profit lost or the contract price less the cost of manufacturing and delivery. A profit lost rule was appli ed in A.I.M. Percolating Corp. v. Ferrodine Chemical Corp., 139 Va. 366, 378-79, 124 S.E. 442 (1924).

Metwood, Inc. v. True Value Home Ctr., 61 Va. Cir. 664, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 321 (Roanoke Sept. 30, 2002). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 63, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten, important commercially needed changes being incorporated. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. Neither the passing of title to the goods nor the appointment of a day certain for payment is now material to a price action. 2. The action for the price is now generally limited to those cases where resale of the goods is impracticable except where the buyer has accepted the goods or wh ere they have been destroyed after risk of loss has passed to the buyer. 3. This section substitutes an objective test by action for the former not readily resalable standard. An action for the price under subsection (1) (b) ca n be sustained only after a reasonable effort to resell the goods at reasonable price has actually been made or where the circumstances reasonably indicate that such an effort will be unavailing. 4. If a buyer is in default not with respect to the price, but on an obligation to make an advance, the seller should recover not under this section for the price as such, but for the default in the collateral (though coincident) obligation to finance the seller. If the agreement between the parties contemplates that the buyer will acquire, on making the advance, a security interest in the goods, the buyer on mak ing the advance has such an interest as soon as the seller has rights in the agreed collateral. See Section 9-204. 5. Goods accepted by the buyer under subsection (1) (a) include only goods as to which there has been no justified revocation of acceptance, for such a re vocation means that there has been a default by the seller which bars his rights under this section. Goods lost or damaged are covered by the section on risk of loss. Goods identified to the contract under subsection (1) (b) are covered b y the section on identification and the section on identification notwithstanding breach. 6. This section is intended to be exhaustive in its enumeration of cases where an action for the price lies. 7. If the action for the price fails, the seller may nonetheless have proved a case entitling him to damages for non-acceptance. In such a situation, subsection ( 3) permits a recovery of those damages in the same action. Cross references: Point 4: Section 1-106. Point 5: Section 2-501, 2-509, 2-510 and 2-704.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Under prior Virginia law the location of the title has been determinative of the remedy available, so that an action for the price could only be maintained where title had passed to the buyer. Montauk Ice Cream Co. v. Daigger Co., 141 Va. 686, 695-705, 126 S.E. 681 (1925); J. B. Colt Co. v. Elam, 138 Va. 124, 131, 120 S.E. 857 (1924). The Montauk case distinguished earlier cases in which there had been some indic ations that an action for the price could be maintained even though title had not passed at the time of the buyers breach.

Couch v. Manassas Autocars, Inc., 77 Va. Cir. 30, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 130 (Prince William County July 17, 2008). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: No comparable index section; Subsection (3)Section 69(5), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: The prior uniform statutory provision is generally continued and expanded in Subsection (3). Purposes of changes and new matter: 1. To index in this section the buyers remedies, subsection (1) covering those remedies permitting the recovery of money damages, and subsection (2) covering those which permit reaching the goods themselves. The remedies listed here are those available to a buyer who has not accepted the goods or who has justifiably revoked his acceptance. The remedies available to a buyer with regard to goods finally accepte d appear in the section dealing with breach in regard to accepted goods. The buyers right to proceed as to all goods when the breach is as to only some of the goods is determined by the section on breach in installment contracts and by the section on partial acceptance. Despite the sellers breach, proper retender of delivery under the section on cure of improper tender or replacement can effectively preclude the buyers re medies under this section, except for any delay involved. 2. To make it clear in subsection (3) that the buyer may hold and resell rejected goods if he has paid a part of the price or incurred expenses of the type specif ied. Paid as used here includes acceptance of a draft or other time negotiable instrument or the signing of a negotiable note. His freedom of resale is coextensive with that of a seller under this Article except that the buyer may not keep any pr ofit resulting from the resale and is limited to retaining only the amount of the price paid and the costs involved in the inspection and handling of the goods. The buyers security interest in the goods is intended to be limited to the items listed i n subsection (3), and the buyer is not permitted to retain such funds as he might believe adequate for his damages. The buyers right to cover or to have damages for non-delivery, is not impaired by his exercise of his right of resale. 3. It should also be noted that this Act requires its remedies to be liberally administered and provides that any right or obligation which it declares is enforce able by action unless a different effect is specifically prescribed (Section 1-106).

The UCC does not have any p rovision covering the situation in Berlin v.

(2) The buyer may recover from the seller as damages the difference between the cost of cover and the contract price together with any incidental or consequential damages as hereinafter defined (§ 8.2-715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the sellers breach.

For article on mitigation of damages, see 69 Va. L. Rev. 967 (1983). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 33. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. This section provides the buyer with a remedy aimed at enabling him to obtain the goods he needs thus meeting his essential need. This remedy is the buyers equivalent of the sellers right to resell. 2. The definition of cover under subsection (1) envisages a series of contracts or sales, as well as a single contract or sale; goods not identical with t hose involved but commercially usable as reasonable substitutes under the circumstances of the particular case; and contracts on credit or delivery terms differing from the contract in breach, but again reasonable under the circumstances. The test of pro per cover is whether at the time and place the buyer acted in good faith and in a reasonable manner, and it is immaterial that hindsight may later prove that the method of cover used was not the cheapest or most effective. The requirement that the buyer must cover without unreasonable delay is not intended to limit the time necessary for him to look around and decide as to h ow he may best effect cover. The test here is similar to that generally used in this Article as to reasonable time and seasonable action. 3. Subsection (3) expresses the policy that cover is not a mandatory remedy for the buyer. The buyer is always free to choose between cover and damages for non-de livery under the next section. However, this subsection must be read in conjunction with the section which limits the recovery of consequential damages to such as could not have been obviated b y cover. Moreover, the operation of the section on specific performance of contracts for unique goods must be considered in this connection for availability of the goods to the particular buyer for his particular needs is the test for that remedy and inability to cover is made an express condition to the right of the buyer to replevy the goods. 4. This section does not limit cover to merchants, in the first instance. It is the vital and important remedy for the consumer buyer as well. Both are free to us e cover; the domestic or non-merchant consumer is required only to act in normal good faith while the merchant buyer must also observe all reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade, since this falls within the definition of good faith on his part.

VIRGINIA COMMENT This section is in accord with prior Virginia law in authorizing a buyer, upon learning of a sellers default in delivery, to use reasonable diligence to cover by the purchase of substitute goods, measuring his damages by the difference between the contract price and the cost of the substitute goods, plus incidental damages and less any expenses saved. Goldstein v. Old Dominion Peanut Corp., 177 Va. 716, 725, 15 S.E.2d 103 (1941); C. G. Blake Co., Inc. v. W. R. Smith and Son, Ltd., 147 Va. 960, 982-84, 133 S.E. 685 (1926); Hopkins v. LeCato, 142 Va. 769, 783-84, 123 S.E. 347 (1925); Manor v. Hindman, 123 Va. 767, 775, 97 S.E. 332, 334 (1918); Richardson Const ruction Co. v.

Reynolds &amp; Bros., 100 Va. 264, 269-74, 40 S.E. 919 (19 02). Under both the UCC and prior Virginia law, as long as the buyer acts reasonably and in good faith, proof that his method of obtaining cover was not the cheapest or best will not defeat his action for damages. In Triplett v. Nichols, 139 Va. 321, 329 -30, 123 S.E. 339 (1924), it was recognized that a buyer acted reasonably when he bought steel articles costing $1,509, plus $76 freight, as cover for timber, having a contract price of $467, which was unavailable.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-713"><akn:num>§ 8.2-713</akn:num><akn:heading>Buyers damages for nondelivery or repudiation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Subject to the provisions of this title with respect to proof of market price (§ 8.2-723), the measure of damages for nondelivery or repudiation by the seller is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the co ntract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this title (§ 8.2-715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the sellers breach.

Trover and Conversion, § 6. CASE NOTES An aggrieved buyers damages against a repudiating seller are ba sed on the market price on the date of performance.  Section 8.2-713 required that an aggrieved buyers damages against a repudiating seller be based on the market price on the date of performance, i.e., the date of delivery; the jurys apparent finding that the NYMEX price supplied the proper market price was supported by testimony indicating that that price represented the applicable price for natural gas that the purchaser would have expected to pay in pur chasing undelivered natural gas on the scheduled date of delivery, and the evidence as to the difference between the price the purchaser contractually agreed to pay and the market price of the undelivered natural gas on the date of delivery was provided to prove the purchasers actual damages. Hess Energy, Inc. v. Lightning Oil Co., 338 F.3d 357, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 15284 (4th Cir. 2003). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 67(3), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: To clarify the former rule so that: 1. The general baseline adopted in this section uses as a yardstick the market in which the buyer would have obtained cover had he sought that relief. So the plac e for measuring damages is the place of tender (or the place of arrival if the goods are rejected or their acceptance is revoked after reaching their destination) and the crucial time is the time at which the buyer learns of the breach. 2. The market or current price to be used in comparison with the contract price under this section is the price for goods of the same kind and in the same branch of trade. 3. When the current market price under this section is difficult to prove the section on determination and proof of market price is available to permit a showing of a comparable market price or, where no market price is available, evidence of spot sale prices is proper. Where the unavailability of a market price is caused by a scarcity of goods of the type involved, a good case is normally made for specific perfo rmance under this Article. Such scarcity conditions, moreover, indicate that the price has risen and under the section providing for liberal administration of the goods would be admissible in the absence of a market price and a liberal construction of al lowable consequential damages should also result. 4. This section carries forward the standard rule that the buyer must deduct from his damages any expenses saved as a result of the breach. 5. The present section provides a remedy which is completely alternative to cover under the preceding section and applies only when and to the extent that the buy er has not covered.

VIRGINIA COMMENT The prior Virginia cases are in accord with subsection 8.2-713(1). Sun Co. v. Burruss, 139 Va. 279, 286-87, 123 S.E. 347 (1924); Richmond Leather Manufacturing Co . v. Fawcett, 130 Va. 484, 490-91, 107 S.E. 800 (1921); Nottingham Coal &amp; Ice Co. v. Preas, 102 Va. 820, 822-23, 47 S.E. 823 (1904); Trigg v. Clay, 88 Va. 330, 332-36, 13 S.E. 434 (1891). Under subsection 8.2-713(2) it is not clear where the place for tender is when a seller is required to ship the goods to the buyer, but not required to de liver them at destination. See §§ 8.2-503, 8.2-504. Under Sun Co. v. Burruss, 139 Va. 279, 286-87, 123 S.E. 347 (1924), the market price is determined at the place of destination, even though the delivery point is the place of shipment.

CASE NOTES Effect upon valuation of use of defective goods.  There are cases where a buyers use of defective goods does not necessarily endow them with value for purposes of subsection (2) of this section. Twin Lakes Mf g. Co. v. Coffey, 222 Va. 467, 281 S.E.2d 864, 1981 Va. LEXIS 330 (1981). Proof of damages for breach of warranty of goods bought and sold on open market.  In proving damages for breach of warranty of goods that can be bought and sold on the open market, a party must present evidence of the fair market value at the t ime and place of acceptance of the goods accepted and of what they would have had if they had been as warranted. The difference in these two valuations is the measure of damages. Wharton, Aldhizer &amp; Weaver v. Savin Corp., 232 Va. 375, 350 S.E.2d 635, 3 V a. Law Rep. 1353, 1986 Va. LEXIS 268 (1986). Failure to mitig ate barred consequential damages.  Where a buyer of air compressor presented little evidence to the court as to why buyer did not attempt to mitigate its losses, buyers failure to minimize its losses in market barred buyer from receiving consequential damages. Cancun Adventure Tours, Inc. v. Underwater Designer Co., 862 F.2d 1044, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 16367 (4th Cir. 1988). Consequential damages awarded for sellers breach of express warranty.  Where a seller of an impedance pipe heating system breached an express warranty that bolts in pipe joints could be safely torqued to 60 foot-pounds and gaskets de teriorated inside pipes that transported low trans oil to various parts of a buyers bakery resulting in too much compressive force, the buyer was entitled to consequential damages for the loss of cookies that were destroyed because the potential dama ge to the buyers food products was within the contemplation of the parties and the buyer could not sell the cookies to the public in light of the danger of foreign substance contamination and choking hazards. Kraft Foods N. Am., Inc. v. Banner Eng'g &amp; Sales, Inc., 446 F. Supp. 2d 551, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61702 (E.D. Va. 2006). Statement that copier had no value to firm did not prove that it had no value.  Statements by two of a law firms partners that a copier that malfunctioned frequently had no value to them or their firm did not establish the fact that it ha d no value. Where no probative evidence of the defective copiers value was introduced, the firm, as a matter of law, failed to prove any damages for breach of warranty as required by subsection (2). Wharton, Aldhizer &amp; Weaver v. Savin Corp., 232 Va. 375, 350 S.E.2d 635, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1353, 1986 Va. LEXIS 268 (1986). Punitive damages giv en only if tort established.  Where buyer of an air compressor damages stemmed from sellers contractual breach of warranty, and not from alleged tort of fraud, no punitive damages were awa rded since punitive damages award must be based upon finding of actual damages in tort. Cancun Adventure Tours, Inc. v. Underwater Designer Co., 862 F.2d 1044, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 16367 (4th Cir. 1988). Cover price of procuring subst itute goods.  Where after accepting nonconforming goods that seller refused to cure or replace, buyer was forced to obtain substitute units, the proper measure of buyers da mages under subsection (1) was the cover price of procuring substitute goods. United States ex rel. Whitaker's, Inc. v. C.B.C. Enters., Inc., 820 F. Supp. 242, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6207 (E.D. Va. 1993). Capping damages at contract price.  Where defendant claimed that plaintiff was seeking excessive damages and asked the court to limit plaintiffs damages to no more than the contract price of the furnace, there was no reason to cap plaintiffs possible damages at the contract price, and defendants request was denied. Fournier Furniture, Inc. v. Waltz-Holst Blow Pipe Co., 980 F. Supp. 187, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17381 (W.D. Va. 1997). Cross-claimants claim for direct damages for breach of warranty, under § 8.2-714 (2), did not survive demurrer, as the allegations of the cross-claim leadi ng up to the request for damages disclosed the true nature of the cross-claimants damages as consequential, and the cross-claimants simply stating that the damages were direct did not make them direct; to recover for consequential damages, there had to be privity between the parties, which was not shown. Pulte Home Corp. v. Parex, Inc., 265 Va. 518, 579 S.E.2d 188, 2003 Va. LEXIS 51 (2003). Relevance of refusal to accept repair of defective part upon damages.  In consumers action against a manufacturer for alleged violations of the Virginia Motor Vehicle Warranty Enforcement Act (Act), § 59.1-207.9 et seq., and t he Virginia Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), arising from an allegedly defective valve in a motor home, the court would not reconsider its discovery order that directed the manufacturer to remove and replace the valve for testing purposes. Although it migh t be true that the consumers could not be forced to have the valve replaced after the expiration of the 18-month period for such repairs established by the Act, the refusal to allow the replacement could be relevant to the consumers UCC breach of war ranty claim because, if the motor home worked after the valve was replaced, its replacement was relevant to the level of damages to which the consumers would be entitled and mitigation under the UCC. Parks v. Newmar Corp., No. 6:04-CV-00013, 2005 U.S. Di st. LEXIS 18373 (W.D. Va. Aug. 26, 2005). Reasonable notice question o f fact for jury.  A determination of what constitutes reasonable notice is a question of fact for the jury. Virginia Transformer Corp. v. P.D. George Co., 932 F. Supp. 156, 1996 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 10255 (W.D. Va. 1996). Damages under jurisdictional amount.  Regardless of the section used to calculate damages, plaintiffs claims fell short of the jurisdictional amount; the total Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act claim cou ld not reach the required $50,000 jurisdictional requirement on the contract price alone. Therefore, the court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the action. Burtt v. Ford Motor Co., No. 4:07CV00038, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9657 (W.D. Va. Feb. 1 1, 2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Direct damages.  Homebuilder was not entitled to collect direct damages from finish manufacturer based on cross-claim it filed against finish manufacturer after homeowners sued ho mebuilder and alleged the finish was inherently defective and improperly installed as the homebuilder was not in privity with the finish manufacturer since it obtained the finish from a third party who had acquired it from the finish manufacturer. Bindra v. Michael Bowman &amp; Assocs., 58 Va. Cir. 47, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 373 (Fairfax County Sept. 19, 2001). Nonconformity of goods permitted builder to recover cost-of-repair damages.  The nonconformity referred to in subsection (1) includes that which arises from the breach of a warranty and allowed a builder-buyer to recover for the co st of repairs to condominiums clad with exterior cladding which violated the manufacturers and distributors implied warranty of merchantability. Bay Point Condo. Ass'n v. RML Corp., 57 Va. Cir. 295, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 10 (Norfolk Jan. 28, 2002). Consequential damages awarded when buyers revoked acceptance of damaged mobile home.  After buyers properly revoked acceptance of a structurally damaged mobile home under § 8.2-608, the court (1) allowed consequential damages to the buyers for a $500 down payment, $3,300 inventory fee, $100 to a welder to fix damaged I-beams, $730 for an undisclosed fee, and two mobile home house payments of $833, for a total of $6,297, (2) did not allow the buyers expenses that were incurred but we re not the sellers responsibility, at least some of which may have been incurred after the revocation, or arose to fix damage to the mobile home, which included foundation, carpet repair and other supplies, heat hookup, loan attorney fees, and site g rading, and (3) allowed the sellers fair market rent to off set the damages awarded to the buyers. Oakwood Acceptance Corp. v. Pippin, 66 Va. Cir. 474, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 462 (Nelson County Mar. 27, 2002). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 69(6) and (7), Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes: 1. This section deals with the remedies available to the buyer after the goods have been accepted and the time for revocation of acceptance has gone by.

Beard Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc. v. Thompson Plastics, Inc., 254 Va. 240, 491 S.E.2d 731, 1997 Va. LEXIS 79 (1997). Homebuilder failed to state a claim against a stucco manufacturer for breach of an implied warranty, as the damages to the builder were consequential, and privity was required to recover economic loss, under § 8.2-715 (2), due to an alleged breach of the implied warranty of merchantability; there was no contract between the parties, as the stucco was applied by a subcontractor that obtained the stucco from a s upplier, and consequential damages were not recoverable. Pulte Home Corp. v. Parex, Inc., 265 Va. 518, 579 S.E.2d 188, 2003 Va. LEXIS 51 (2003). Subsection (2) prevails over privity provisions in § 8.2-318.  The limited contract requirement of subsection (2) prevails over the general provisions relating to common law privity in Section 8.2-318. Beard Plumbing &amp; Heatin g, Inc. v. Thompson Plastics, Inc., 254 Va. 240, 491 S.E.2d 731, 1997 Va. LEXIS 79 (1997).

New Holland N. Am., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3759 (W.D. Va. 2000). Recovery for emotional disturbance.  In determining whether, at the pleading stage, allegations of mere mental suffering and emotional distress without bodily injury are sufficient to state a claim f or consequential damages under this section and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, the rule is that recovery for emotional disturbance will be excluded unless the breach also caused bodily harm or the contract or the breach was of such a kind that serious e motional disturbance was a particularly likely result. Wise v. GMC, 588 F. Supp. 1207, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15275 (W.D. Va. 1984). Failure to mitig ate barred consequential damages.  Where a buyer of an air compressor presented little evidence to the court as to why buyer did not attempt to mitigate its losses buyers failure to minimize it s losses in market barred buyer from receiving consequential damages. Cancun Adventure Tours, Inc. v. Underwater Designer Co., 862 F.2d 1044, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 16367 (4th Cir. 1988).

MacConkey v. F.J. Matter Design, Inc., 54 Va. Cir. 1, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 390 (Virginia Beach Feb. 8, 2000). Consequential damages awarded when buyers revoked acceptance of damaged mobile home.  After buyers properly revoked acceptance of a structurally damaged mobile home under § 8.2-608, the court (1) allowed consequential damages to the buyers for a $500 down payment, $3,300 inventory fee, $100 to a welder to fix damaged I-beams, $730 for an undisclosed fee, and two mobile home house payments of $833, for a total of $6,297, (2) did not allow the buyers expenses that were incurred that w ere not the sellers responsibility, at least some of which may have been incurred after the revocation to fix damage to the mobile home, which included foundation, carpet repair and other supplies, heat hookup, loan attorney fees, and site grading, a nd (3) allowed the sellers fair market rent to off set the damages awarded to the buyers. Oakwood Acceptance Corp. v. Pippin, 66 Va. Cir. 474, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 462 (Nelson County Mar. 27, 2002). Privity is required.  Homebuilder was not entitled to obtain consequential damages from finish manufacturer after the homebuilder was sued by the homeowners for allegedly using defecti ve finish and improperly installing it as privity was required before the homebuilder could recover consequential damages from the finish manufacturer and privity did not exist because the homebuilder obtained the finish from a third party who had acquir ed it from the finish manufacturer. Bindra v. Michael Bowman &amp; Assocs., 58 Va. Cir. 47, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 373 (Fairfax County Sept. 19, 2001). This section requires privity of contract for the recovery of consequential economic loss damages and the application of that statute is limited to cases where a plaintiff is claiming consequential economic loss damages due to a breach of warranty. RML Corp. v. Lincoln Window Prods., 67 Va. Cir. 545, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 363 (Norfolk Dec. 3, 2004). Window companys demurrer was sustained with respect to privity and damages because a property owner did not contract directly with the company and thus, lacke d privity; therefore, the owner was barred from recovering purely economic consequential damages in its warranty action. 139 Riverview, LLC v. Quaker Window Prods., 90 Va. Cir. 74, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 45 (Norfolk Mar. 2, 2015). Proper measure of damages.  Where a paving contractor that put asphalt paving on a parking lot violated the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, the proper measure of damages was th e repair cost of the parking lot as opposed to total replacement cost of the entire parking lot. Harrison's Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. Princess Anne Paving Corp., 60 Va. Cir. 303, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 266 (Portsmouth Nov. 4, 2002). Vehicle warranty and extended service contract.  Consumer was entitled to incidental and consequential damages against a vehicle dealer in her action for revocation of acceptance because of the three-month/3,000 mile warranty and the extended service contract. Dealer warranty did not exclude incidental or consequential damages. Love v. Kenneth Hammersley Motors, Inc., 66 Va. Cir. 447, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 647 (Lynchburg Oct. 30, 2000). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provisions: Subsection (2) (b)Sections 69(7) and 70, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rew ritten. Purposes of changes and new matter: 1. Subsection (1) is intended to provide reimbursement for the buyer who incurs reasonable expenses in connection with the handling of rightfully rejected goods o r goods whose acceptance may be justifiably revoked, or in connection with effecting cover where the breach of the contract lies in non-conformity or non-delivery of the goods. The incidental damages listed are not intended to be exhaustive but are merel y illustrative of the typical kinds of incidental damage. 2. Subsection (2) operates to allow the buyer, in an appropriate case, any consequential damages which are the result of the sellers breach. The tacit agr eement test for the recovery of consequential damages is rejected. Although the older rule at common law which made the seller liable for all consequential damages of which he had reason to know in advance is followed, the liberality of that rule is modified by refusing to permit recovery unless the buyer could not reasonably have prevented the loss by cover or otherwise. Subparagraph (2) carries forward...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-716"><akn:num>§ 8.2-716</akn:num><akn:heading>Buyers right to specific performance or detinue</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Specific p erformance may be decreed where the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances. (2) The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just. (3) The buyer has a right of detinue for goods identified to the contract if after reasonable effort he is unable to effect cover for such goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing or if the goods have been shipped under reserv ation and satisfaction of the security interest in them has been made or tendered. In the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the buyers right of detinue vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller h ad not then repudiated or failed to deliver.

CASE NOTES Specific performance inappropriate where damages are recoverable and adequate.  Virginias adoption of the U.C.C. does not abrogate the maxim that specific performance is inappropriate where damages are recoverable and adequate. Klein v. P epsiCo, Inc., 845 F.2d 76, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 5268 (4th Cir. 1988). Specific performance inappropriate where replacement would require increased cost.  Where plaintiff wanted aircraft for resale for profit and replacement aircraft would require increased cost, there was no room here for the equitable remedy of sp ecific performance. Klein v. PepsiCo, Inc., 845 F.2d 76, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 5268 (4th Cir. 1988). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Section 68, Uniform Sales Act. Changes: Rep hrased. Purposes of changes: To make it clear that: 1. The present section continues in general prior policy as to specific performance and injunction against breach. However, without intending to impair in any way the exercise of the courts sound discretion in the matter, this Article seeks to further a more liberal attitude than some courts have shown in connection with the specific performance of contracts of sale. 2. In view of this Articles emphasis on the commercial feasibility of replacement, a new concept of what are unique goods is introduced under this sec tion. Specific performance is no longer limited to goods which are already specific or ascertained at the time of contracting. The test of uniqueness under this section must be made in terms of the total situation which characterizes the contract. Output and requirements contracts involving a particular or peculiarly available source or market present today the typical commercial specific performance situation, as contrasted with contracts for the sale of heirlooms or priceless works of art which were u sually involved in the older cases. However, uniqueness is not the sole basis of the remedy under this section for the relief may also be granted in other proper circumstances and inability to cover is strong evidence of other proper circumst ances. 3. The legal remedy of replevin is given the buyer in cases in which cover is reasonably unavailable and goods have been identified to the contract. This is in ad dition to the buyers right to recover identified goods under Section 2-502. For consumer goods, the buyers right to replevin vests upon the buyers acquisition of a special property, which occurs upon identification of the goods to the contrac t. See Section 2-501. Inasmuch as a secured party normally acquires no greater rights in its collateral that its debtor had or had power to convey, see Section 2-403(1) (first sentence), a buyer who acquires a right of replevin under subsection (3) will take free of a security interest created by the seller if it attaches to the goods after the goods have been identified to the contract. The buyer will take free, even if the buyer does not buy in ordinary course and even if the security interest is perf ected. Of course, to the extent that the buyer pays the price after the security interest attaches, the payments will constitute proceeds of the security interest. 4. This section is intended to give the buyer rights to the goods comparable to the sellers rights to the price. 5. If a negotiable document of title is outstanding, the buyers right of replevin relates of course to the document not directly to the goods. See Article 7, especially Section 7-602.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Virginia has recognized in dictum that a buyer who has tendered the purchase money for goods and made a demand is entitled to maintain detinue or trover if he is refused. Chapman v. Campbell, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 105, 110 (1856). On refusal to deliver, the seller having made a subsequent sale to a second buyer, the first buyer may maintain an action for damages against the seller. Sweeney v. Foster, 112 Va. 499, 50 3, 71 S.E. 548 (1911). While the UCC does not refer to the rights of marketing cooperatives with reference to crops grown by their members, the section would seem to be in accord with L ayne v. Tobacco Growers Cooperative Association, 147 Va. 878, 881-82, 133 S.E. 358 (1926), which recognized that an injunction might issue in a proper case to restrain a grower from disposing of tobacco in violation of a contract. This section recognizes the acts of replevin, a form of action abolished in Virginia by Code 1950, § 8.01-218.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-717"><akn:num>§ 8.2-717</akn:num><akn:heading>Deduction of damages from the price</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The buyer on notifying the seller of his intention to do so may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any breach of the contract from any part of the pri ce still due under the same contract.

For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 33. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: See Section 69(1) (a), Uniform Sales Act. Purposes: 1. This section permits the buyer to deduct from the price damages resulting from any breach by the seller and does not limit the relief to cases of breach of war ranty as did the prior uniform statutory provision. To bring this provision into application the breach involved must be of the same contract number under which the price in question is claimed to have been earned. 2. The buyer, however, must give notice of his intention to withhold all or part of the price if he wishes to avoid a default within the meaning of the section on insecurity and right to assurances. In conformity with the general policies of this Article, no formality of notice is required and any language which reasonably indicates the buyers reason for holding up his payment is sufficient.

VIRGINIA COMMENT The UCC is in accord with prior Virginia law in allowing the buyer to deduct damages for a breach from any part of the price still due to the seller. Dexter-Portl and Cement Co. v. Acme Supply Co., 147 Va. 758, 770-74, 133 S.E. 788 (1926); Jeffries and Co., Inc. v. Kramer Brothers Co., 135 Va. 419, 116 S.E. 232 (1926); New Idea Spreader Co. v. R. M. Rogers &amp; Sons, 122 Va. 54, 65-66, 94 S.E. 351 (1917). This section does not affect the Virginia rules of set-off, as set forth in Code 1950, §§ 8-239, 16.1-88.01, and 16.1-88.02, and Rule 3:8. These statutes an d the rule of court change the law applied in earlier cases under which the buyers claims for unliquidated changes could not be set-off against the price claimed by the seller. See Dexter-Portland Cement Co. v. Acme Supply Co., Inc., 147 Va. 758, 768 , 133 S.E. 788 (1926); Joseph H. Baker &amp; Co., Inc. v. Hartman, 139 Va. 612, 613-14, 124 S.E. 425 (1924). The earlier rule was avoided in Richardson Construction Co. v. Whiting Lumber Co., 116 Va. 490, 491-94, 82 S.E. 87 (1914), in which the buyers da mages calculated on the basis of cover were found to be liquidated. See also F. A. Rausch &amp; Co. v. Graham Manufacturing Corp., 139 Va. 502, 505-06, 124 S.E. 427 (1924); 145 Va. 681, 134 S.E. 692 (1926), for a case involving set-off.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-718"><akn:num>§ 8.2-718</akn:num><akn:heading>Liquidation or limitation of damages; deposits</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Damages fo r breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of other wise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty. (2) Where the seller justifiably withholds delivery of goods because of the buyers breach, the buyer is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds (a) the amount to which the seller is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the sellers damages in accordance with subsection (1), or (b) in the absence of such terms, twenty per cent of the value of the total performance for which the buyer is obligated under the contract or $500, whichever is smaller. (3) The buyer s right to restitution under subsection (2) is subject to offset to the extent that the seller establishes (a) a ri ght to recover damages under the provisions of this title other than subsection (1), and (b) the amount or value of any benefits received by the buyer directly or indirectly by reason of the contract. (4) Where a se ller has received payment in goods their reasonable value or the proceeds of their resale shall be treated as payments for the purposes of subsection (2); but if the seller has notice of the buyers breach before reselling goods received in part perfo rmance, his resale is subject to the conditions laid down in this title on resale by an aggrieved seller (§ 8.2-706).

Rev. 431 (1981). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 17, 26, 31. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: 1. Under subsection (1) liquidated damage clauses are allowed where the amount involved is reasonable in the light of the circumstances of the case. The subsectio n sets forth explicitly the elements to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a liquidated damage clause. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is expressly made void as a penalty. An unreasonably small amount would be subject to similar criticism and might be stricken under the section on unconscionable contracts or clauses. 2. Subsection (2) refuses to recognize a forfeiture unless the amount of the payment so forfeited represents a reasonable liquidation of damages as determined und er subsection (1). A special exception is made in the case of small amounts (20% of the price of $500, whichever is smaller) deposited as security. No distinction is made between cases in which the payment is to be applied on the price and those in which it is intended as security for performance. Subsection (2) is applicable to any deposit or down or part payment. In the case of a deposit or turn in of goods resold before the breach, the amount actually received on the resale is to be viewed as the dep osit rather than the amount allowed the buyer for the trade in. However, if the seller knows of the breach prior to the resale of the goods turned in, he must make reasonable efforts to realize their true value, and this is assured by requiring him to co mply with the conditions laid down in the section on resale by an aggrieved seller.

For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, §§ 4, 17, 26, 31. CASE NOTES Limitations of liability.  This section provides that contractual agreements may include limitations of liability. This section only prohibits such limitations of liability in the sale of c onsumer goods. Fisher v. Monsanto Co., 863 F. Supp. 285, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14032 (W.D. Va. 1994). Limitation of conseq uential damages permitted.  A seller may by contract limit the remedies for breach of warranty and, in particular, may exclude consequential damages unless the exclusion is unconscionable. B levins v. New Holland N. Am., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3759 (W.D. Va. 2000). Virginia law prohibits the exclusion of consequential damages where such exclusion is un conscionable. Martin v. American Medical Sys., 116 F.3d 102, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 14787 (4th Cir. 1997). The essence of unconscionability in the context of a disclaimer of liability for consequ ential damages is an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party. Blevins v. New Holland N. Am., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3759 (W. D. Va. 2000). Burden of proof as to commercial goods on plaintiff.  Where the piece of equipment that caused the plaintiffs injuries was purchased and used in a commercial enterprise and thus was not consumer goods, an exclusi on of liability for consequential damages was not prima facie unconscionable and the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that the exclusion was unconscionable. Blevins v. New Holland N. Am., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3759 (W.D. Va . 2000). Plaintiff essentially argued that defendants fraud precluded them from enforcing the exclusion of consequential damages; however, plaintiff failed to prove fr aud. Accordingly, in addition to not proving causation, and because there was nothing unconscionable in the agreement between the sophisticated industrial parties, defendants effectively excluded consequential and incidental damages. Waytec Elecs. Corp. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Elec. Materials, LLC, 459 F. Supp. 2d 480, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77673 (W.D. Va. 2006), aff'd, 255 Fed. Appx. 754, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 28113 (4th Cir. 2007). Conspicuous language is not required in a writing to create a valid limitation of remedy . Flintkote Co. v. W.W. Wilkinson, Inc., 220 Va. 564, 260 S.E.2d 229, 1979 Va. LEXIS 298 (1979). Unlike § 8.2-316 (2) which requires conspicuous language to exclude or modify the implied warrantlessness of merchantability or of fitness for a particular pur pose, this section, which expressly recognizes that the contracting parties may bargain for a limitation of remedy, contains no such requirement. Flintkote Co. v. W.W. Wilkinson, Inc., 220 Va. 564, 260 S.E.2d 229, 1979 Va. LEXIS 298 (1979). There is no requirement that a contract provision imposing a limitation of remedy for breach of warranty be conspicuous in order to be effective. Flintkot e Co. v. W.W. Wilkinson, Inc., 220 Va. 564, 260 S.E.2d 229, 1979 Va. LEXIS 298 (1979). False misrepresentation and fraud in inducement may be shown despite limitation of liabilities.  While contracting parties may waive their contractual rights and disclaim or limit certain liabilities, a false representation of a material fact, constituting an inducement to the contract, on which the purchaser had a right to rely, is always ground for rescission of the contract by a court of equity, and fraud in the inducement of a contract is also ground for an action for damages in a court of law. George Ro bberecht Seafood, Inc. v. Maitland Bros. Co., 220 Va. 109, 255 S.E.2d 682, 1979 Va. LEXIS 241 (1979). Exclusion may be valid even as to personal injuries.  While this section itself indicates that personal injuries are a factor to be considered in determining whether an exclusion for consequential damages is unconsci onable, nevertheless, even considering the nature of a plaintiffs injury-that it is a personal injury rather than a commercial loss-such an exclusion may not be found unconscionable. Blevins v. New Holland N. Am., Inc., 97 F. Supp. 2d 7471, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3759 (W.D. Va. 2000). Limitation of damages in personal injury cases is prima facie unconscionable. Goodbar v. Whitehead Bros., 591 F. Supp. 552, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24746 (W.D. Va. 1984), aff'd, 769 F.2d 213, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 21195 (4th Cir. 1985). This section denounces as prima facie unconscionable the limitation of damages for personal injuries that are caused by consumer goods. Where defendant does not rebut this presumption, plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for his injuries. Matthews v. Ford Motor Co., 479 F.2d 399, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9835 (4th Cir. 1973). If the disclaimer in the manufacturers warranty is deemed to exclude the dealers implied warranty, the undertaking assumed by the dealer to fulfill the ma nufacturers warranty must also be considered. Its liability, therefore, is coextensive with manufacturers, and the attempt to limit its responsibility for damages to the repair or replacement of defective parts is also prima facie unconscionable under this section. Matthews v. Ford Motor Co., 479 F.2d 399, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9835 (4th Cir. 1973). It has been suggested that total disclaimer of warranties would be unconscionable with respect to personal injuries. Matthews v. Ford Motor Co., 479 F.2d 399, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9835 (4th Cir. 1973). Unconscionability and failure of essential purpose compared.  Unconscionability deals primarily with a grossly unequal bargaining power at the time the contract is formed, while failure of essential purpose relates to circum stances arising during performance of the agreement. From a practical standpoint, where, as here, experienced parties agree to allocate unknown or undeterminable risks, they should be held to their bargain; courts, or juries, should not be permitted to r ewrite the agreement. Envirotech Corp. v. Halco Eng'g, Inc., 234 Va. 583, 364 S.E.2d 215, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1545, 1988 Va. LEXIS 6 (1988). Failure of essential purpose of limited remedy does not automatically result in abrogati on of the consequential damages disclaimer. Envirotech Corp. v. Halco Eng'g, Inc., 234 Va. 583, 364 S.E.2d 215, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1545, 1988 Va. LEXIS 6 (1988). A number of logical, sound reasons mandate why, without more, the failure of a limited remedy of repair should not invalidate a wholly distinct clause of the cont ract excluding recovery for consequential damages. Envirotech Corp. v. Halco Eng'g, Inc., 234 Va. 583, 364 S.E.2d 215, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1545, 1988 Va. LEXIS 6 (1988). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Section inapplicable where the implied warranty has been disclaimed.  In plaintiffs suit alleging defendants rototiller breached the implied warranty of merchantability and implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpos e, the district court sustained defendants demurrers because the express warranty disclaimed all other warranties, express or implied, and Va. Code Ann. § 8.2-316 specifically permitted such disclaimers. Va. Code Ann. § 8.2-719 was inapplicab le, because the implied warranty had been effectively disclaimed. Santana v. Deere &amp; Co., 108 Va. Cir. 537, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 207 (Madison County Oct. 26, 2021). Limitation of conseq uential damages permitted.  Disclaimer provisions in a home inspection contract that excluded liability for consequential damages would not have violated subdivision 3 of § 8.2-719 (had i t been applicable to this personal services contract) because the disclaimer was in large, conspicuous, bold typeface and did not exclude liability for personal injuries. Howie v. Atl. Home Inspection, Inc., 62 Va. Cir. 164, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 298 (Norf olk June 17, 2003). Warranties.  Facts, combined with the course of dealings between a buyer and seller, were effective to limit the sellers liability to the cost of replacement concrete beca use although the seller did not deliver concrete that met the required specifications, the language limiting the sellers warranty was conspicuous and was not unconscionable; the pr...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.2-720"><akn:num>§ 8.2-720</akn:num><akn:heading>Effect of cancellation or rescission on claims for antecedent breach</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Unless the contrary intention clearly appears, expressions of cancellation or rescission of the contract or the like shall not be construed as a renunci ation or discharge of any claim in damages for an antecedent breach.

During t he period between identification and final acceptance (except in the case of revocation of acceptance) it is possible for both parties to have the right of action. Even after final acceptance both parties may have the right of action if the seller retain s possession or otherwise retains an interest. Definitional cross references: Action.

CASE NOTES Buyers damages again st a repudiating seller.  To give meaning to § 8.2-723 (1), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit concluded that, when the case does not come to trial before the per formance date, damages are not measured when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation. Hess Energy, Inc. v. Lightning Oil Co., 338 F.3d 357, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 15284 (4th Cir. 2003). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: To eliminate the most obvious difficulties arising in connection with the determination of market price, when that is stipulated as a measure of damages by some provision of this Article. Where the appropriate market price is not readily available the cour t is here granted reasonable leeway in receiving evidence of prices current in other comparable markets or at other times comparable to the one in question. In accordance with the general principle of this Article against surprise, however, a party inten ding to offer evidence of such a substitute price must give suitable notice to the other party. This section is not intended to exclude the use of any other reasonable method of determining market price or of measuring damages if the circumstances of the cas e make this necessary.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Virginia earlier recognized that if evidence of a prevailing price at the time and place to measure damages is not readily available, the price at a different pla ce may be used. In Cocoa Products Co. of America, Inc. v. Duche, 156 Va. 86, 99-101, 158 S.E. 719 (1931), there was no market price for cocoa butter at Norfolk, and so damages were ascertained by reference to market prices at Philadelphia, New York, and Chicago, plus freight to Norfolk. Other cases to the same effect are: Nottingham Coal &amp; Ice Co. v. Preas, 102 Va. 820, 823, 47 S.E. 823 (1904); McCormick &amp; Co. v. Hamilton, Wood &amp; Co., 64 Va.

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the notation to the Virginia Rules of Evidence was added to the catchline of this section. Acts 2012, cc. 688 an d 708, cl. 6 provides: That pursuant to the authority set forth in §§ 30-146 and 30-147 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission shall direct any party with whom the Virginia Code Commission contracts to publish the Code of Virgini a to include in the catchline of every section of the Code of Virginia from which any rule contained in the Rules of Evidence has been derived a notation specifying such rule. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 36. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: None. Purposes: To make market quotations admissible in evidence while providing for a challenge of the material by showing the circumstances of its preparation. No explicit provision as to the weight to be given to market quotations is contained in this section, but such quotations, in the absence of compelling challenge, offer an adequate basis for a verdict. Market quotations are made admissible when the price or value of goods traded in any established market is in issue. The reason of the section does not re quire that the market be closely organized in the manner of a produce exchange. It is sufficient if transactions in the commodity are frequent and open enough to make a market established by usage in which one price can be expected to affect another and in which an informed report of the range and trend of prices can be assumed to be reasonably accurate. This section does not in any way intend to limit or negate the application of similar rules of admissibility to other material, whether by action of the courts or by statute. The purpose of the present section is to assure a minimum of mercantile administration in this important situation and not to limit any liberalizing trend in modern law.

By the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it. (2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved partys lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the good s and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered. (3) Where an a ction commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six months after the te rmination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute. (4) This secti on does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of action which have accrued before this act becomes effective.

CASE NOTES Section 8.01-246 expressly provides that where this section is applicable, it shall be controlling.  Sprague &amp; Henwood v. Johnson, 606 F. Supp. 1564, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20385 (W.D. Va. 1985). Section 8.01-246 did not apply to products liability action arising before October 1, 1977.  Where plaintiffs home was damaged by fire on July 20, 1977, allegedly due to a defect in a portable refrigerator delivered to their residence on February 8, 1 975, the limitation period for the warranty claims was four years and the time began to run from February 8, 1975, when the refrigerator was delivered, pursuant to this section. Plaintiffs contention that their causes of action for breach of warranty accrued on July 20, 1977, when the fire occurred and that the limitation period of five years was misplaced, since § 8.01-246 was not effective until October 1, 1977. Stone v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 232 Va. 365, 350 S.E.2d 629, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1342, 1986 Va. LEXIS 266 (1986). Action for injury to goo ds or to subject of sale.  When a transaction is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, an action for injury to the goods, or to the subject of the sale by a party to the contract, is to be governed by this section whether the suit is in tort or in contract. APCO v. GE Co., 508 F. Supp. 530, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16628 (W.D. Va. 1980), aff'd, 665 F.2d 1038 (4th Cir. 1981). Where buyer filed an action against seller of a power transformer for negligently loading and shipping the transformer, the action sounded in tort, but the genesi s of the action was actually in contract because if not for the contract there would have been no duty by the seller to the buyer, and, therefore, the four-year statute of limitations governing sales contracts ruled in the action. APCO v. GE Co., 508 F. Supp. 530, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16628 (W.D. Va. 1980), aff'd, 665 F.2d 1038 (4th Cir. 1981). Buyers breach of contract claim against a sellers parent company was not barred by the four-year statute of limitations; the claims were brought against t he seller within four years from the date that the faulty goods were rebuilt by the seller, and any breach of contract claim against the parent company would have related back to the date of the buyers complaint if the buyer had been granted leave to file a second amended complaint that included the parent company as a party defendant. Rapoca Energy Co., LLP v. J.L. Mining Co., 368 F. Supp. 2d 541, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8155 (W.D. Va. 2005). Limitation on action for personal injury based on breach of warranty.  Where a cause of action to recover for personal injury is predicated upon a breach of warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code, § 8.01-243 is the proper stat ute of limitations to be applied. Tyler v. R.R. St. &amp; Co., 322 F. Supp. 541, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14571 (E.D. Va. 1971) (commented on in 6 U. Rich. L. Rev. 167 (1971)). Attempt to reduc e limitations period ineffective.  Manufacturers purported attempt in an express warranty to reduce the limitations period for enforcing limited or implied warranties to 90 days was ineffective under § 8.2-725(1) where the parties did not specifically agree to the period of limitation, not just the warranty in general. There was no indication that the buyer was even aware of the limitation period, let alone any indication of agreement by th e manufacturer and the buyer on the issue. Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). Where the parties did not agree to reduce the limitations period by the original agreement, § 8.2-725(1), the default Virginia Uniform Commercial Code statute of limitations applied, § 8.2-725(20), which was four years after the breach occurred. Even accepting the component manufacturers contention that its delivery of the components to the RV manufacturer was the pertinent tender of delivery for limita tions purposes, it failed to argue that delivery occurred four years before the buyer filed his claim. Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2013). Future performance exception inapplicable to implied warranties.  A buyer of a crane could not avail himself of the future performance exception to the rule that a cause of action for breach of warranty accrues when the breach occurs, since the buyers claims rested entirely on implied warranties. E.T. Gresham Co. v. Koehring Crane &amp; Excavator Group, 479 F. Supp. 132, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10157 (E.D. Va. 1979). Future performance.  Manufacturer of sprinkler heads, which allegedly failed to operate properly during a fire, was entitled to the protection of the statute of limitations under § 8.2-725 on insurers breach of warranty claims because there was not an express warranty of future performance regarding the sprinkler heads under § 8.2-313. Royal Indem. Co. v. Tyco Fire Prods., LP, 281 Va. 157, 704 S.E.2d 91, 2011 Va. LEXIS 24 ( 2011). Implied warranty of merchantability distinctly different from implied contract of indemnity.  The implied warranty of merchantability that generally arises upon the sale (or delivery) of goods and the implied contract of indemnity that flows from the warra nty are distinctly different and are governed by different statutes of limitation. Wingo v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 638 F. Supp. 107, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25214 (W.D. Va. 1986). This section did not govern action for indemnity brought by employer railway, found liable for asbestos-related injuries, against manufacturers. Wingo v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 638 F. Supp. 107, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25214 (W.D. Va. 1986). Applicability to claims against guarantor who was not a party to promissory note.  Where a guarantor, who was equally liable for duties owed by a buyer to a seller under an asset purchase agreement, did not sign a nonnegotiated promissory note f or the deferred purchase price for the assets, the guarantor was not a party to the note; thus, the four-year limitations period of § 8.2-725 applied to claims against him. Bizmark, Inc. v. Indus. Gas &amp; Supply Co., 358 F. Supp. 2d 518, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3112 (W.D. Va. 2005), dismissed in part, No. 2:04cv00109, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26707 (W.D. Va. Nov. 4, 2005). Seller s disclaimer of warranty against third parties.  Where a components manufacturer offered an express warranty to the original buyer (the RV manufacturer), that warranty did not extend to foreseeable users of the product (the purchaser of the RV) pursuant to § 8.2-318 because the components manufacturer specifically disclaimed warranties as to foreseeable users. Hoffman v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., LLC, 940 F. Supp. 2d 347, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53118 (W.D. Va. 2 013). Applicabilit y to breach of contract for sale of goods.  Virginia has a five-year period of limitations for written contracts generally, but if the action is for breach of a contract for the sale of goods, the shorter U niform Commercial Code period set forth in § 8.2-725 applies by operation of § 8.01-246. Bizmark, Inc. v. Indus. Gas &amp; Supply Co., 358 F. Supp. 2d 518, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3112 (W.D. Va. 2005), dismissed in part, No. 2:04cv00109, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26707 (W.D. Va. Nov. 4, 2005). Inapplicable to cause of action accruing prior to UCC.  The limitation period set forth in this section relating to warranties for future performance does not apply to causes of action which accrued before the Uniform Commercial Code became effective.
