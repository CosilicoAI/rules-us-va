No agricult ural operation or any of its appurtenances shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, if such operations are conducted in substantial compliance with any applicable best management practices in use by the operation at the time of the alleged nuisa nce and with any applicable laws and regulations of the Commonwealth relevant to the alleged nuisance. No action shall be brought by any person against any agricultural operation the existence of which was known or reasonably knowable when that person s use or occupancy of his property began.The provisions of this section shall apply to any nuisance claim brought against any party that has a business relationship with the agricultural operation that is the subject of the alleged nuisance. The prov isions of this section shall not apply to any action for negligence or any tort other than a nuisance.For the purposes of this subsection, substantial compliance means a level of compliance with applicable best management practices, laws, or regu lations such that any identified deficiency did not cause a nuisance that created a significant risk to human health or safety. Agricultural operations shall be presumed to be in substantial compliance absent a contrary showing. B. The provisi ons of subsection A shall not affect or defeat the right of any person to recover damages for any injuries or damages sustained by them on account of any pollution of, or change in condition of, the waters of any stream or on the account of any overflow of lands of any such person. C. Only person s with an ownership interest in the property allegedly affected by the nuisance may bring an action for private nuisance. Any compensatory damages awarded to any person for a private nuisance action not otherwise prohibited by this section, where the all eged nuisance emanated from an agricultural operation, shall be measured as follows: 1. For a permanent nuisance, by the reduction in fair market value of the persons property caused by the nuisance, but not to exceed the fair market value of the property; or 2. For a temporary nuisance, by the diminution of the fair rental value of the persons property.The combined recovery from multiple actions for private nuisance brought against any ag ricultural operation by any person or that persons successor in interest shall not exceed the fair market value of the subject property, regardless of whether any subsequent action is brought against a different defendant than any preceding action. D. Notwithstan ding subsection C, for any nuisance claim not otherwise prohibited by this section, nothing herein shall limit any recovery allowed under common law for physical or mental injuries that arise from such alleged nuisance and are shown by objective and docu mented medical evidence to have endangered life or health. E. Any and all ordinances of any unit of local government now in effect or hereafter adopted that would make the operation of any such agricultural operation or its appurtenances a nuisance or providing for abatement thereof as a nuisance in the circumstance set forth in this section are and shall be null and void.

As to exemptions from applicability of Housing Authorities Law to farm structures, see § 36-9.1. The 2018 amendments. The 2018 amendments by cc. 147 and 677 are identical, and rewrote subsection A, added subsections C and D, redesignated former subsection C as E; and in subsectio n E, deleted the former second sentence, which read, The provisions of this section shall not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation of any such agricultural operation or any of its appurtenances. CASE NOTES Nuisance claims not preempted.  Because the Right to Farm Act, § 3.1-22.28 et seq., does not apply whenever a nuisance results from the negligent or improper operation of any agricultural ope ration or its appurtenances, it did not preempt adjacent property owners state common-law claims brought against a tree farm and a biosolids recycler that was spraying sewage sludge on the tree farm. Wyatt v. Sussex Surry, LLC, 482 F. Supp. 2d 740, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17929 (E.D. Va. 2007) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Preemption.  In an action arising from an alleged unlawful disposal of sewage sludge, a nuisance claim was preempted by the Right to Farm Act, unless there was a showing of ne gligence or improperly managed agricultural operations, all of which were questions for the trier of fact.

Power confined to Virginia.  The Commissions power is confined by subdivision (c) [now subdivision 3] of this section to Virginia and is limited by these words granting it authority to re gulate the sale of milk for consumption within the State. When the grant of regulatory power was thus restricted to milk for consumption within the State, necessarily milk for consumption outside the State was excluded.

The phrase this section refers to former similar provisions. Se ction intended to benefit both distributor and consumer.  This section was intended, in accordance with the object and purposes of the entire article, to benefit both the distributor and the consumer. Safeway Stores, Inc . v. Milk Comm'n, 197 Va. 69, 87 S.E.2d 769, 1955 Va. LEXIS 197 (1955). There is no inherent power in the Milk Commission to fix the price of milk. Whatever pri ce-making power it has must be found in the statute. Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co. v. Milk Comm'n, 182 Va. 490, 29 S.E.2d 397, 1944 Va. LEXIS 199 (1944); Pet Dairy Prods. Co. v.

The Commission is not vested with discretion to ignore or transgress statutory limitations, even to accomplish what it may deem to be desirable ends. Safeway Stor es, Inc. v. Milk Comm'n, 197 Va. 69, 87 S.E.2d 769, 1955 Va. LEXIS 197 (1955). This section is the sole provision for fixing prices. Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co. v.

Lucerne Cream &amp; But ter Co. v. Milk Comm'n, 182 Va. 490, 29 S.E.2d 397, 1944 Va. LEXIS 199 (1944).

Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co. v. Milk Comm'n, 182 Va. 490, 29 S.E.2d 397, 1944 Va. LEXIS 199 (1944). Regulation of pric e of milk is within police power.  The authority of a state legislature in the exercise of the police power to regulate the price of milk through the agency of an administrative board is establishe d by the decision of the Supreme Court in Nebbia v. New York, 1934 U.S. LEXIS 962, 291 U.S. 502, 54 S. Ct. 505, 78 L. Ed. 940, 89 A.L.R. 1469 (1934); Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 16 F. Supp. 575, 1936 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1826 (D.

Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co . v. Milk Comm'n, 182 Va. 490, 29 S.E.2d 397, 1944 Va. LEXIS 199 (1944). Price restrictions affect only sales made within market area.  Sales of milk are not affected by any restriction as to price unless made within a designated market area.

State Milk Co mm'n, 195 Va. 396, 78 S.E.2d 645, 1953 Va. LEXIS 211 (1953). Although this section does not in terms restrict the authority of the Commission, this section is controlled by the provisions of subdivision (c) of § 3.1-430 [see now subdivision 3 of § 3.2-3204], which expressly limits the Commissions power to the regulation of the sale, etc., of milk for consumption within the State. Pet Dairy Prods. Co. v. State Milk Comm'n, 195 Va. 396, 78 S.E.2d 645, 1953 Va. LEXIS 211 (1953). Hence, Commission is without authority where milk is distributed outside State.  State Milk Commission does not have the power to fix the price paid to Virginia milk producers for milk sold and processed in Virginia for distribution outside th e Commonwealth. Pet Dairy Prods. Co. v. State Milk Comm'n, 195 Va. 396, 78 S.E.2d 645, 1953 Va. LEXIS 211 (1953). Milk sold in State by out- of-state distributor.  The Supreme Court in an unreported decision ruled that the Commission had jurisdiction to fix the minimum sale price of milk sold and delivered to consumers in Ar lington County by District of Columbia distributors. For a summary of the case, see County Bd. v. Milk Commn, 22 U.S.L. Week 3039. The ruling was upheld in County Bd. v. State Milk Commn, 1954 U.S. LEXIS 2506, 346 U.S. 932, 74 S. Ct. 374, 98 L. E d. 423 (1954). Basis of fixing minimum and ma ximum prices.  Under this section minimum prices may be fixed on the basis of representative reasonable total cost of the essential factors, and maximum prices allowed because o f single items of cost peculiar to some distributors. Thus, if minimum and maximum prices are fixed, the spread between them will allow the distributor who renders a service different from that of another to make a charge commensurate with the service re ndered. The consumer may choose whether he desires the extra service. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Milk Comm'n, 197 Va. 69, 87 S.E.2d 769, 1955 Va. LEXIS 197 (1955). There is no authority for the fixing of a minimum price alone. The only power granted is to fix minimum and maximum prices. The use of the word and connecting the words minimum and maximum points to the conclusion that it was the intention of the legislature that and should have its ordinary, literal conjunctive meaning. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Milk Comm'n, 197 Va. 69, 87 S.E.2d 769, 1955 Va. LEXIS 197 (1955). The grant of power to fix minimum and maximum prices, in the absence of any express legislative declaration to the contrary effect, must be held not to include au thority for the fixing of a price in the singular. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Milk Comm'n, 197 Va. 69, 87 S.E.2d 769, 1955 Va. LEXIS 197 (1955). Nor any provision for fixing minimum and maximum prices to be paid producers.  Had the legislature intended to provide for the fixing of minimum and maximum prices to be paid producers, it would have specifically provided therefor. Southside Coop. Milk Producers Ass'n v. State Milk Comm'n, 198 Va. 108, 92 S.E.2d 351, 1956 Va. LEXIS 181 (1956). The Commission has the power to fix different prices for different grades of milk, under this section. Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co. v. Milk Comm'n, 182 Va. 490, 29 S.E.2d 397, 1944 Va. LEXIS 199 (1944); Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Milk Comm'n, 197 Va. 69, 87 S.E.2d 769, 1955 Va. LEXIS 197 (1955). But not for milk of the same grade.  The Commission has not been given the power to fix different prices for the same grade of milk. Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co. v. Milk Comm'n, 182 Va. 490, 29 S.E.2d 397, 1944 Va. LEXIS 199 (1944); Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Milk Comm'n, 197 Va. 69, 87 S.E.2d 769, 1955 Va. LEXIS 197 (1955). Where the Commission adopted a regulation for a particular area which fixed the minimum price of the several grades of milk delivered in glass containers and adde d to that price one cent per quart for the same grades delivered in other than glass containers, it was held that the regulation was invalid insofar as it undertook to establish a difference in price for the same grade of milk, based upon the type of the container in which the milk was sold. Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co. v. Milk Comm'n, 182 Va. 490, 29 S.E.2d 397, 1944 Va. LEXIS 199 (1944). Cost of container is factor to be considered.  Under this section, in fixing the different prices for different grades of milk, it is mandatory that the Commission take into consideration all of the factors an d elements involved in its production, processing, storage and distribution, and necessarily included in these factors is the cost of some form of container. Lucerne Cream &amp; Butter Co. v. Milk Comm'n, 182 Va. 490, 29 S.E.2d 397, 1944 Va. LEXIS 199 (1944) .

In accordance with the Administrative Process Act, § 2.2-4000 et seq. and in particular § 2.2-400 2, the Commission may establish minimum retail prices on an emergency basis, prior to public hearing. The Commission, in establishing any minimum retail price when it deems it necessary to do so, shall impose a minimum retail price only for an area or political subdivis ion wherein the public interest as herein set forth justifies a minimum retail price being set and shall be guided by the same factors used in determining the reasonableness of prices under § 3.2-3208.

The phrases this section and this chapter refer to prior similar provisions. Purpose of license.  The obvious purpose of the license is to provide the Commission and the members of the local boards with a record of the distributors and producers subject to thi s chapter. Supervision and enforcement are thus likely to be easier. Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 549, 81 L. Ed. 835, 1937 U.S. LEXIS 83 (1937). License application constitutes agreement to conform.  For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the Commission, under this section, requires all distributors in any market designated by the Comm ission to be licensed by it. When a distributor applies for a license, he agrees to conform to the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations of the Commission. Granted a license he is at liberty to surrender it; but if he desires to operat e as a distributor, he must conform to the provisions of the chapter and the rules, regulations and orders of the Commission promulgated thereunder. Southside Coop. Milk Producers Ass'n v. State Milk Comm'n, 198 Va. 108, 92 S.E.2d 351, 1956 Va. LEXIS 181 (1956). Power of Commission to grant or refuse license is not absolute.  The license provisions of this chapter should not be interpreted to vest the Commission with the absolute power to grant or refuse licenses, if any other reasonab le construction can be adopted. Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 16 F. Supp. 575, 1936 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1826 (D. Va. 1936), aff'd, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 549, 81 L. Ed. 835, 1937 U.S. LEXIS 83 (1937). It was not the intent of the legislature to confer upon the administrative board the extraordinary power to determine at will who should and who should not engage in the distribution of milk, but rather to render available to the Milk Commission and the local boards a list of authorized distributors of milk and to enable the authorities more readily to supervise the business of distribution and to enforce the rul es, regulations, and orders promulgated by the board. Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 16 F. Supp. 575, 1936 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1826 (D. Va. 1936), aff'd, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 549, 81 L. Ed. 835, 1937 U.S. LEXIS 83 (1937). In the absence of provision to the contrary, it would appear to be the duty of the Commission to issue a license to any distributor complying with the statute and to preserve his license until some violation of the act or of a regulation or order had taken place. Highland Farms Dairy, Inc. v. Agnew, 16 F. Supp. 575, 1936 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1826 (D. Va. 1936), aff'd, 300 U.S. 608, 57 S. Ct. 549, 81 L. Ed. 835, 1937 U.S. LEXIS 83 (1937). The Virginia Milk Act does not contemplate that no new distributors may ever be licensed.  See Richmond Food Stores, Inc. v. State Milk Comm'n, 204 Va. 46, 129 S.E.2d 35, 1963 Va. LEXIS 114 (1963); Brown v. State Milk Comm'n, 205 Va. 18, 135 S.E.2d 98, 1964 Va. LEXIS 139 (1964); Beatrice Foods Co. v. State Milk Comm'n, 205 Va. 763, 139 S.E.2d 922, 1965 Va. LEXIS 132 (1965). Denial of license requires showing of destructive competition.  That an area is adequately served by a number of other licensed distributors is not a valid basis for the denial of an application in the absence of evidence that the issuance of a license would tend to a destructive competition in the market. Brown v. State Milk Comm'n, 205 Va. 18, 135 S.E.2d 98, 1964 Va. LEXIS 139 (1964). And evidence must be clear and c onvincing.  Clear and convincing evidence is required to show that granting of a distributors license will cause destructive competition on the milk market. Beatrice Food s Co. v. State Milk Comm'n, 205 Va. 763, 139 S.E.2d 922, 1965 Va. LEXIS 132 (1965). Effect of denying license.  By not granting a license to a distributor, the Commission created a monopoly for the existing distributors, stifled competition, and abolished free enterprise in the milk industry. Beatrice Foods Co. v. State Milk Comm'n, 205 Va. 763, 139 S.E.2d 922, 1965 Va. LEXIS 132 (1965). Improper denial of license.  It was arbitrary and capricious for the Commission to refuse a license to a dairy cooperative association on grounds that the operation of such a business constit utes a rebate in violation of a Commission regulation, where the evidence indicated that the Commission had licensed other such cooperatives. Richmond Food Stores, Inc. v. State Milk Comm'n, 204 Va. 46, 129 S.E.2d 35, 1963 Va. LEXIS 114 (1963). The Commission erred in denying a license to a prospective distributor on grounds that there were already two or more distributors in the market who were renderin g adequate service. Such action by the Commission creates a monopoly for existing distributors, stifles competition, and abolishes free enterprise. Richmond Food Stores, Inc. v. State Milk Comm'n, 204 Va. 46, 129 S.E.2d 35, 1963 Va. LEXIS 114 (1963). The Commission erred in denying a distributors license on grounds that the applicant did not, as required by the Commissions regulations, have facilit ies for pasteurizing and bottling his milk, since he did not own such facilities. He had them available through arrangement with other parties and was thus able to satisfy the purpose of the regulation, which was to assure proper handling of the milk . Brown v. State Milk Comm'n, 205 Va. 18, 135 S.E.2d 98, 1964 Va. LEXIS 139 (1964). The Commission erred in denying a license on grounds that the applicant had operated without a license prior to the date of the hearing. The applicant was distrib uting milk at the time the Commission enlarged the territory and embraced that in which he had been operating, he made timely application for a license effective in the area wherein he had been operating, and the delay in passing on his application was o ccasioned by no fault of his.

State Milk Comm'n, 204 Va. 46, 129 S.E.2d 35, 1963 Va. LEXIS 114 (1963). Subsection (4) of this section requires that the court give the order of the Commission the weight of a jury verdict on a fact found. This means that the evidence, and all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, must be resolved in favor of the facts found by the Commission, and that an order based thereon must be sustained if there is credible evidence to support it.

The distributor and the producer do not need for mal notice. They know at all times that an assessment will be made and they can, periodically, determine for themselves just how much it will be. In addition to this, it is quite clear that the assessment is not the levying of a tax, nor is the act a rev enue measure.

Statement of Purpose, Findings, and Declaration of Policy. § 1. Statement of purpose, findings, and declaration of policy. The purpose of this compact is to recognize the interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the prerogative of the states under the United States Constituti on to form an interstate commission for the southern region. The mission of the Commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the South, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pur e and wholesome milk. The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is an essential agricultural activity of the South. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors, and retailers, are an integral component of the regions economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region. The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential, and they are an integral part of the regions rural communities. The farms preserve land for ag ricultural purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural communities. By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price that southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essenti al to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy industry, with all the associated benefits. Recent dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the southern dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The system of federal orders, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices paid to producer s for raw milk, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established. In todays regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual state action is needed to more effectively address the market disarray. Under our constitu tional system, properly authorized states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in co mmon agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution. In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the regions fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that th is compact neither displace the system of federal orders nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle. Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the system of federal or ders be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission may regulate the marketplace in lieu of the system of federal orders. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the system of federal orders. ARTICLE II. Definitions and Rules of Construction. § 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this compact, and of any supplemental or concurring legislation enacted pursuant thereto, except as may be otherwise required by the context: Class I milk means milk disposed of in fluid form or as a fluid milk product, subject to further definition in accordance with the principles expressed in subsection (b) of § 3. Commission means the Southern Dairy Compact Commission established by this compact. Commission marketing order means regulations adopted by the Commission pursuant to §§ 9 and 10 of this compact in place of a terminated federal marketing order or state dairy regulation. Such order may apply throughout the region or in any part or parts thereof as defined in the regulations of the Commission. Such order may estab lish minimum prices for any or all classes of milk. Compact means this interstate compact. Compact over-order price means a minimum price required to be paid to producers for Cl ass I milk established by the Commission in regulations adopted pursuant to §§ 9 and 10 of this compact, which is above the price established in federal marketing orders or by state farm price regulation in the regulated area. Such price may apply throughout the region or in any part or parts thereof as defined in the regulations of the Commission. Milk means the lacteal secretion of cows and includes all skim, butterfat, or other co nstituents obtained from separation or any other process. The term is used in its broadest sense and may be further defined by the Commission for regulatory purposes. Partially regulated plant means a milk plant not located in a regulated area but havin g Class I distribution within such area. Commission regulations may exempt plants having such distribution or receipts in amounts less than the limits defined therein. Participating state means a state which has become a party to this compact by the enac tment of concurring legislation. Pool plant means any milk plant located in a regulated area. Region means the territorial limits of the states which are parties to this compact. Regulated area means any area within the region governed by and defined in regulations establishing a compact over-order price or commission marketing order. State dairy regulation means any state regulation of dairy prices and associated asses sments, whether by statute, marketing order, or otherwise. § 3. Rules of construction. (a) This compa ct shall not be construed to displace existing federal milk marketing orders or state dairy regulation in the region but to supplement them. In the event some or all federal orders in the region are discontinued, the compact shall be construed to provide the Commission the option to replace them with one or more commission marketing orders pursuant to this compact. (b) This compa ct shall be construed liberally in order to achieve the purposes and intent enunciated in § 1. It is the intent of this compact to establish a basic structure by which the Commission may achieve those purposes through the application, adaptation, and development of the regulatory techniques historically associated with milk marketing and to afford the Commission broad flexibility to devise regulatory mechanisms to achieve the purposes of this compact. In accordance with this intent, the technical ter ms which are associated with market order regulation and which have acquired commonly understood general meanings are not defined herein but the Commission may further define the terms used in this compact and develop additional concepts and define addit ional terms as it may find appropriate to achieve its purposes. ARTICLE III. Commission Established. § 4. Commission established. There is hereby created a commission to administer the compact, composed of delegations from each state in the region. The Commission shall be known as the Southern Dai ry Compact Commission. A delegation shall include not less than three nor more than five persons. Each delegation shall include at least one dairy farmer who is engaged in the production of milk at the time of appointment or reappointment, and one consum er representative. Delegation members shall be residents and voters of, and subject to such confirmation process as is provided for in, the appointing state. Delegation members shall serve no more than three consecutive terms with no single term of more than four years, and be subject to removal for cause. In all other respects, delegation members shall serve in accordance with the laws of the state represented. The compensation, if any, of the members of a state delegation shall be determined and paid by each state, but their expenses shall be paid by the Commission. § 5. Voting requirements. All actions taken by the Commission, except for the establishment or termination of an over-order price or commission marketing order, and the adoption, amendment, or r escission of the Commissions bylaws, shall be by majority vote of the delegations present. Each state delegation shall be entitled to one vote in the conduct of the Commissions affairs. Establishment or termination of an over-order price or commi ssion marketing order shall require at least a two-thirds vote of the delegations present. The establishment of a regulated area that covers all or part of a participating state shall require also the affirmative vote of that states delegation. A maj ority of the delegations from the participating states shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of the Commissions business. § 6. Administration and management. (a) The Commis sion shall elect annually from among the members of the participating state delegations a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, and a treasurer. The Commission shall appoint an executive director and fix his or her duties and compensation. The executive direc tor shall serve at the pleasure of the Commission, and, together with the treasurer, shall be bonded in an amount determined by the Commission.

In an action for damages by homeowners against a pesticide company and its employee, the trial court erred when it sustained demurrers to negligence counts becaus e the homeowners alleged that the company and the employee breached duties independent of the companys contractual duty to control pests, including allowing the employee to apply commercial pesticide without a commercial pesticide certification or wi thout first being registered as a pest control technician.

The cases annotated below were decided under former § 3.1-336.1. Constitutionality.  The statute does not violate the due process clause of the federal Constitution, notwithstanding the contention that the statute effectively aims to neutralize th e economic impact of the Master Settlement Agreement on participating cigarette manufacturers by placing equivalent financial burdens on nonparticipating manufacturers, who are competitors of the participating manufacturers, and that the statute deprives nonparticipating competitors of their property for 25 years either to force them to sign the Master Settlement Agreement or to impose on them a competitive disadvantage that they otherwise would not have suffered because they engaged in no wrongdoing, a s the statutes stated and legitimate purpose was to ensure that Virginia will be able to recover healthcare costs from cigarette manufacturers regardless of whether the manufacturer has signed on to the Master Settlement Agreement and the statute is rationally related to such purpose. Star Sci., Inc. v. Beales, 278 F.3d 339, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 872 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 818, 123 S. Ct. 93, 154 L. Ed. 2d 24, 2002 U.S. LEXIS 5557 (2002). The statute does not violate the equal protection clause of the federal Constitution, notwithstanding the argument that the statute treats tobacco companies diffe rently based on whether or not they joined the Master Settlement Agreement and that this differential treatment is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, as the distinctions are rationally related to Virginias legitimate purpose o f ensuring a source of recovery from all manufacturers for Virginias future costs related to cigarette smoking. Star Sci., Inc. v. Beales, 278 F.3d 339, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 872 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 818, 123 S. Ct. 93, 154 L. Ed. 2d 24, 2002 U.S. LEXIS 5557 (2002). The statute does not violate the commerce clause of the federal Constitution, even though it requires a cigarette manufacturer to make payments on cigarettes sold by it to independent distributors in other states if the cigarettes are later sold into Virginia, as the statute imposes a fee only for cigarettes actually sold within the state and has no effect on transactions undertaken by out-of-state distributors i n other states, and to the extent that the statute may affect the prices charged by out-of-state distributors, the effect is applicable only to prices charged on cigarettes sold within Virginia. Star Sci., Inc. v. Beales, 278 F.3d 339, 2002 U.S. App. LEX IS 872 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 818, 123 S. Ct. 93, 154 L. Ed. 2d 24, 2002 U.S. LEXIS 5557 (2002). The statute does not violate the compact clause of the federal Constitution, notwithstanding the assertion that the Master Settlement Agreement is in fact an inte rstate compact and is invalid because it has not been approved by Congress, as the Master Settlement Agreement does not increase the power of the states at the expense of federal supremacy and, therefore, is not an interstate compact requiring congressio nal approval. Star Sci., Inc. v. Beales, 278 F.3d 339, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 872 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 818, 123 S. Ct. 93, 154 L. Ed. 2d 24, 2002 U.S. LEXIS 5557 (2002). Authority of Attorney General.  Virginia Attorney General lacked the authority to preclude a tobacco manufacturer from doing business in the Commonwealth, by excluding it from the statutory dire ctory, solely on the ground that the manufacturer failed to pay statutory penalties proposed by the Attorney General, but not yet adjudicated by the courts; hence, the Attorney Generals power to insist upon a cure before listing a manufacturer in the directory did not include the power to impose a civil penalty for alleged past noncompliance. Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, 45 Va. App. 268, 610 S.E.2d 321, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 113 (2005). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Personal jurisdiction.  Two counts in the Commonwealths complaint against a tobacco company under the Virginia Tobacco Escrow Statute, §§ 3.1-336.1 and 3.1-336.2, were barred b y direct estoppel since the issue of personal jurisdiction as to two of the four years for which escrow payments under the act were sought had already been litigated in favor of the tobacco company. However, since the Commonwealth added two additional ye ars for which it sought the escrow payments for in the new suit filed, those claims were separate and independent causes of action that had not been previously litigated and plaintiffs were entitled to pursue them.

To the extent not released from escrow under subdivisions 1 or 2, funds shall be released from escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer 25 years after the date on wh ich they were placed into escrow.

CASE NOTES Authority of Attorney General.  Attorney General lacked the authority to preclude a tobacco manufacturer from doing business in the Commonwealth, by excluding it from the statutory web site dire ctory, solely on the ground that the manufacturer failed to pay statutory penalties proposed by the Attorney General, but not yet adjudicated by the courts; hence, the Attorney Generals power to insist upon a cure before listing a manufacturer in the directory did not include the power to impose a civil penalty for alleged past noncompliance.

However, since the Commonwealth added two additional ye ars for which it sought the escrow payments for in the new suit filed, those claims were separate and independent causes of action that had not been previously litigated and plaintiffs were entitled to pursue them.

Search warrant justified.  Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, pursuant to § 3.1-399, had free access to those places where food was being manufactured, and defendants refusal to allow inspection by agents justified the agents actions in obtaining a search warrant for defendants farm as the search warrant stated a valid offense; accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendants moti ons to suppress certain evidence. Solem v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 625 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 15, 2002). Search warrant was properly issued and was not the result of illegally obtained observations where an agent of the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture a nd Consumer Services went to defendants farm to investigate allegations that defendants were manufacturing goat cheese in violation of statutes involving the production of food, and thus, the agent was lawfully on defendants property when the age nt made the observations; accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendants motions to suppress. Solem v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 625 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 15, 2002). Federal abstention.  Federal district court declined to decide whether the warrantless state agricultural inspections of the individuals home goat cheese operation violated the Fo urth Amendment where the individuals had raised the same constitutional defense in their pending state criminal proceedings and the federal district courts decision regarding § 3.1-399 would have born directly on the state courts pending decis ion on the substantially identical question, namely whether subsection (e) of § 3.1-388 [now subdivision A 8 of § 3.2-5123] violated the Fourth Amendment by imposing a criminal penalty on citizens who refused to submit to a § 3.1-399 search. Hil l v. Courter, 344 F. Supp. 2d 484, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23007 (E.D. Va. 2004). Inspection of a facility that is also a home.  Husband and wifes misdemeanor convictions for violating the Virginia Food Act, § 3.1-388(e) [now subdivision A 8 of § 3.2-5123], that resulted from thei r refusal to submit to a warrantless inspection of their goat cheese manufacturing facilities, was upheld on appeal because the states significant interest in protecting the public health by inspecting facilities that manufacture and store food autho rized warrantless inspections to promote the specific enforcement needs of the Virginia Food Act. The fact that the couples home was also located on the farm did not cause a Fourth Amendment violation since property used for commercial purposes is tr eated differently for Fourth Amendment purposes from residential property and by operating their farm and home together, the couple opened themselves up to an intrusion that would not have been permissible in a purely private context.

Such regulation sha ll be effective upon filing with the Registrar of Regulations. The Board, at its next regular meeting, shall adopt the regulation after notice but without public hearing unless a petition is filed in accordance with subsection F. B. The Board m ay adopt any edition of the Food and Drug Administrations Food Code, or supplement thereto, or any portion thereof, as regulations, with any amendments as it deems appropriate. In addition, the Board may repeal or amend any regulation adopted pursuan t to this subsection. No regulations adopted or amended by the Board pursuant to this subsection shall establish requirements for any license, permit, or inspection unless such license, permit, or inspection is otherwise provided for in this title. The p rovisions of the Food and Drug Administrations Food Code shall not apply to farmers selling their own farm-produced products directly to consumers for their personal use, whether such sales occur on such farmers farm or at a farmers market, u nless such provisions are adopted in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.).

The provisi ons of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) shall not apply to the adoption of any regulation pursuant to subsection B if the Board of Health adopts the same edition of the Food and Drug Administrations Food Code, or the same portio ns thereof, pursuant to subsection C of § 35.1-14, and the regulations adopted by the Board and the Board of Health have the same effective date. In the event that the Board of Health adopts regulations pursuant to § 2.2-4012.1, the effective date of the Boards regulations may be any date on or after the effective date of the regulations adopted by the Board of Health.Notwithstanding any exemption to the contrary, a regulation adopted pursuant to subsection B shall be subject to the requiremen ts set out in §§ 2.2-4007.03, 2.2-4007.04, and 2.2-4007.05, and shall be published in the Virginia Register of Regulations.

Manufacturer of food liable to con sumer.  Where a manufacturer of food for human consumption sells such food in sealed containers or packages to a retailer, who in turn sells it to a consumer, and the con sumer upon eating it suffers damage in consequence of impurities in the product shown to have existed therein before it left the manufacturers hands, the manufacturer is liable to the consumer on its implied warranty of wholesomeness of the food, and the consumer may recover against the manufacturer for damages suffered, irrespective of a lack of privity of contract between the manufacturer and the consumer. This permits the placing of the loss occasioned upon the manufacturer who is in the best pos ition to prevent the production and sale of unwholesome food. Swift &amp; Co. v. Wells, 201 Va. 213, 110 S.E.2d 203, 1959 Va. LEXIS 214 (1959). Refusal to submit to inspection.  Husband and wifes misdemeanor convictions for violating the Virginia Food Act that resulted from their refusal to submit to a warrantless inspection of their goat cheese manufacturing facilities, was upheld on appeal because the states significant interest in protecting the public health by inspecting facilities that manufacture and store food authorized warrantless inspections to promote the specific enf orcement needs of the Virginia Food Act. The fact that the couples home was also located on the farm did not cause a Fourth Amendment violation since property used for commercial purposes is treated differently for Fourth Amendment purposes from resi dential property and by operating their farm and home together, the couple opened themselves up to an intrusion that would not have been permissible in a purely private context. Hill v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 442, 624 S.E.2d 666, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 1 6 (2006). Prohibited acts.  Trial court properly denied defendants motions to suppress evidence as defendants refusal to permit entry or inspection of defendants farm where goat cheese was being produced was prohibited by § 3.1-388 (e), and justified the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in obtaining a search warrant to search defendants farm for statutory violations involving the product ion of food. Solem v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 625 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 15, 2002).

McClellan v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 759, 576 S.E.2d 785, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 95 (2003). Federal abstention.  Federal district court declined to decide whether the warrantless state agricultural inspections of the individuals home goat cheese operation violated the Fo urth Amendment where the individuals had raised the same constitutional defense in their pending state criminal proceedings and the federal district courts decision regarding § 3.1-399 would have born directly on the state courts pending decis ion on the substantially identical question, namely whether subsection (e) of § 3.1-388 violated the Fourth Amendment by imposing a criminal penalty on citizens who refused to submit to a § 3.1-399 search.

The fact that the couples home was also located on the farm did not cause a Fourth Amendment violation since property used for commercial purposes is treated differently for Fourth Amendment purposes from residential property and by operating their farm and home together, the couple opened themselves up to an intrusion that would not have been permissible in a purely private context.

The phrase this section refers to former similar provisions. Departmental regulations, promulgated pursuant to this section, have the force and effect of law. Carbaugh v. Solem, 225 Va. 310, 302 S.E.2d 33, 1983 Va. LEXIS 222 (1983). The sale of unpasteurized milk, where prohibited by departmental regulation, is unlawful. A single sale is both a civil violation and a criminal offense. Carbaugh v. Solem, 225 Va. 310, 302 S.E.2d 33, 1983 Va. LEXIS 222 (1983). Distribution of goat milk held v iolation.  Where individual sold undivided interests in goats and charged maintenance fee for transfer of milk to goat owners, transfer of milk was sale of milk in violation of regulation where milk went into common container, and owner of twenty-four percent interest in goat received milk from all of goats producing milk on that day and where maintenance fee of three dollars per day, geared to amount of milk each owner rec eived, was nothing more than sham for payment for gallon of milk received by owner on that day.

Upon receiving written notification, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall forthwith file in the name of the Commonwealth any information against the detained product in the clerks office of th e circuit court of the county or city where the detention was made. Upon the filing of such information, the clerk of court shall forthwith issue a warrant directing the sheriff to seize the detained product and see to its transportation to a suitable pl ace of storage that, if necessary, may be outside of the county or city served by the sheriff. Should the attorney for the Commonwealth, for any reason, fail to file such information within five days after receipt of written notice of detention of the pr oduct, the same may, at any time within 30 days thereafter be filed by the Attorney General and the proceedings thereon shall be the same as if filed by the attorney for the Commonwealth.

After the filing of the information, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall apply to the judge of the court wherein the information was filed for a hearing on the matters contained in the information. The judge of the court shall move the cause to the head of the docket and the hearing shall b e had as soon as practical to do so.

Any livesto ck product or poultry product or any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased livestock or poultry that is being transported in intrastate commerce, or is otherwise subject to this chapter, or is held for sale in the Commonwealth after such transportation, and that: (i) is or has been prepared, sold, transported, or otherwise distributed or offered or received for distribution in violation of this chapter; (ii) is capable of use as human food and is adulterated or misbranded; or (iii) in any other way is in v iolation of this chapter, shall be liable to be proceeded against and seized and condemned.At any time prior to the expiration of the 20-day detention period provided by § 3.2-5413, the Commissioner shall notify the attorney for the Commonwealth for t he city or county where such detention was made in writing of said detention. Upon receiving such written notification, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall forthwith file in the name of the Commonwealth an information against the detained property in the clerks office of the circuit court of the county or city where detention was made. Upon the filing of such information, the clerk of court shall forthwith issue a warrant directing the sheriff to seize the detained property and see to its transp ortation to a suitable place of storage that, if necessary, may be outside of the county or city served by the sheriff. Should the attorney for the Commonwealth, for any reason, fail to file such information within five days after receipt of written noti ce of detention of articles or animals, the same may, at any time within 30 days thereafter be filed by the Attorney General and the proceedings thereon shall be the same as if filed by the attorney for the Commonwealth.Such information shall allege the seizure, and set forth in general terms the grounds of forfeiture of the seized property, and shall petition that the same be condemned and sold and the proceeds disposed of according to law, and that all persons concerned or interested be cited to appea r and show cause why such property should not be condemned and sold to enforce the forfeiture. After the filing of the information, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall apply to the judge of the court wherein the information was filed for a hearing on the matters contained in the information. The judge of the court shall move the matter to the head of the docket and such hearing shall be had as soon as practical to do so.The owner of and all persons in any manner then indebted or liable for the purch ase price of the article or animal, and any person having a lien thereon, if they be known to the attorney who files the information, shall be made parties defendant thereto, and shall be served with the notice hereinafter provided for, in the manner pro vided by law for serving a notice, at least ten days before the day therein specified for the hearing on the information, if they be residents of the Commonwealth; and if they be unknown or nonresidents, or cannot with reasonable diligence be found in th e Commonwealth, they shall be deemed sufficiently served by publication of the notice once a week for two successive weeks in some newspaper published in such county or city, or if none be published therein, then in some newspaper having general circulat ion therein, and a notice shall be sent by registered mail of such seizure to the last known address of the owner of such article or animal. If any such person be served by publication, then no hearing shall be had prior to the expiration of 10 days from the date of the record publication of the notice.Any person claiming to be the owner of such seized article or animal, or to hold a lien thereon, may appear at any time before final judgment of the trial court, and be made a party defendant to the infor mation so filed, which appearance shall be in person or by answer, under oath, in which shall be clearly set forth the nature of such defendants claim, whether as owner or as lienor, and if as owner, the right or title by which he claims to be such o wner, and if lienor, the amount and character of his lien, and the evidence thereof; and in either case, such defendant shall set forth fully any reason or cause that he may have to show against the forfeiture of the article or animal.If such article or animal is condemned, it shall, after entry of the decree, be disposed of by destruction or sale as the court may direct and the proceeds, if sold, less the court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses, shall be paid into the treasury of th e Commonwealth, but the article or animal shall not be sold contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Federal Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; provided, that upon th e execution and delivery of a good and sufficient bond conditioned that the article or animal shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of contrary to the provisions of this chapter, or the laws of the United States, the court may direct that such article or animal be delivered to a claimant thereof, who may have appeared in the proceedings, subject to such supervision by the Commissioner as is necessary to insure compliance with the applicable laws. When a decree of condemnation is entered against the ar ticle or animal and it is released under bond, or destroyed, court costs and fees, and storage and other proper expenses may as the court deems just, be awarded against the person, if any, intervening as claimant of the article or animal.If a claimant sh all deny for any reason that the article or animal to be condemned is subject to condemnation as provided by this section, and shall demand a trial by jury of the issue thus made, the court shall, under proper instructions, submit the same to a jury of f ive, to be selected and empanelled as prescribed by law, and if such jury shall find on the issue in favor of such claimant, or if the court, trying such issue without a jury, shall so find, the judgment of the court shall be to entirely relieve the prop erty from forfeiture, and no costs shall be taxed against such claimant. B. The provisi ons of this section shall in no way derogate from authority for condemnation or seizure conferred by other provisions of this chapter, or other laws.

The words this section and this article refer to former provisions. Constitutionality.  For cases holding that former provisions, providing for the prevention, control and eradication of contagious and infectious diseases of livestock and poultry, co nstitute a reasonable exercise of the States police power, and are not violative of the state or federal Constitution, see Stickley v. Givens, 176 Va. 548, 11 S.E.2d 631, 1940 Va. LEXIS 273 (1940) (see also Yoder v. Givens, 179 Va. 229, 18 S.E.2d 380 (1942)). Purpose.  This article was enacted for the prevention, control and eradication of contagious and infectious diseases in livestock and poultry. Yoder v. Givens, 179 Va. 229, 18 S.E.2d 380, 1942 Va. LEXIS 214 (1942). Method of control is within discretion of legislature.  It is within the discretion of the legislature to provide a method or methods of control and eradication of Bangs disease, and the fact that other methods mig ht be used to detect the disease or prevent its spread is immaterial. Stickley v. Givens, 176 Va. 548, 11 S.E.2d 631, 1940 Va. LEXIS 273 (1940). And legi slature has made agglutination test mandatory.  To a certain extent, the State Veterinarians duties are discretionary; but the method of the test for Bangs disease, the agglutination test, is mandatory. Neither he nor the Supreme Court has the power to substitute an alternative method. Yoder v. Givens, 179 Va. 229, 18 S.E.2d 380, 1942 Va. LEXIS 214 (1942). The owner of condemned property has a remedy in case of fraud, or where the provisions o f the statute are improperly followed, and he may test the validity of the statute. Stickley v. Givens, 176 Va. 548, 11 S.E.2d 631, 1940 Va. LEXIS 273 (1940). This section charges designated officers with the duty of discovering Bangs disease Discovery is necessarily a prerequisite to its successful control and eradication, and an examination is essential to discovery. Yoder v. Givens, 179 Va. 229, 18 S.E.2d 380, 1942 Va. LEXIS 214 (1942). Veterinarians authority depends on suspected existence of disease.  It is the reported or suspected existence of Bangs disease that confers upon the State Veterinarian the authority, and imposes upon him the duty, to make the test provided by law.

When there is sufficient reason to believe that the risk of exposure to rabies is elevated, the governing body of any locality may enact, and the local health director may recommend, an emergency ordinance that shall become effective immediately upon passage, requi ring owners of all dogs and cats therein to keep the same confined on their premises unless leashed under restraint of the owner in such a manner that persons or animals will not be subject to the danger of being bitten by a rabid animal. Any such emerge ncy ordinance enacted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be operative for a period not to exceed 30 days unless renewed by the governing body of such locality in consultation with the local health director. The governing body of any localit y shall also have the power and authority to pass ordinances restricting the running at large in their respective jurisdiction of dogs and cats that have not been inoculated or vaccinated against rabies and to provide penalties for the violation thereof. B. Any dog or cat showing active signs of rabies or suspected of having rabies that is not known to have exposed a person, companion animal, or livestock to rabies shall be confined under competent observation for such a time as may be necessary to determine a diagnos is. If, in the discretion of the local health director, confinement is impossible or impracticable, such dog or cat shall be euthanized by one of the methods approved by the State Veterinarian as provided in § 3.2-6546. The disposition of other animal s showing active signs of rabies shall be determined by the local health director and may include euthanasia and testing. C. Every perso n having knowledge of the existence of an animal that is suspected to be rabid and that may have exposed a person, companion animal, or livestock to rabies shall report immediately to the local health department the existence of such animal, the place wh ere seen, the owners name, if known, and the signs suggesting rabies. D. Any dog or cat for which no proof of current rabies vaccination is available and that may have been exposed to rabies through a bite, or through saliva or central nervous system tissue, in a fresh open wound or mucous membrane, by an animal suspected to be rabid sh all be isolated in a public animal shelter, kennel, or enclosure approved by the local health department for a period not to exceed six months at the expense of the owner or custodian in a manner and by a date certain as determined by the local health di rector. A rabies vaccination shall be administered by a licensed veterinarian prior to release. Inactivated rabies vaccine may be administered at the beginning of isolation. Any dog or cat so bitten, or exposed to rabies through saliva or central nervous system tissue, in a fresh open wound or mucous membrane with proof of current vaccination, shall be revaccinated by a licensed veterinarian immediately following the exposure and shall be confined to the premises of the owner or custodian, or other site as may be approved by the local health department at the expense of the owner or custodian, for a period of 45 days. If the local health director determines that isolation is not feasible or maintained, such dog or cat shall be euthanized by one of the methods approved by the State Veterinarian as provided in § 3.2-6546. The disposition of such dogs or cats not so confined shall be at the discretion of the local health director. E. At the disc retion of the local health director, any animal that may have exposed a person shall be confined under competent observation for 10 days at the expense of the owner or custodian, unless the animal develops active signs of rabies, expires, or is euthanize d before that time. A seriously injured or sick animal may be euthanized as provided in § 3.2-6546. When determining whether a dog that has bitten a person shall be so confined, the health director shall weigh any proof that the dog has current certif icates for both (i) rabies vaccination and (ii) special training for police work, military work, or work as a first responder. F. When any su spected rabid animal, other than a dog or cat, exposes or may have exposed a person to rabies through a bite, or through saliva or central nervous system tissue, in a fresh open wound or mucous membrane, decisions regarding the disposition of that animal shall be at the discretion of a local health director and may include euthanasia as provided in § 3.2-6546, or as directed by the state agency with jurisdiction over that species. When any animal, other than a dog or cat, is exposed or may have been exposed to rabies through a bite, or through saliva or central nervous system tissue, in a fresh open wound or mucous membrane, by an animal suspected to be rabid, decisions regarding the disposition of that newly exposed animal shall be at the discretio n of a local health director. G. When any an imal may have exposed a person to rabies and subsequently expires due to illness or euthanasia, either within an observation period, where applicable, or as part of a public health investigation, its head or brain shall be sent to the Division of Consoli dated Laboratory Services of the Department of General Services or be tested as directed by the local health department.

The court shall determine that the animal is a dangerous dog if the ev idence shows that it (i) killed a companion animal that is a dog or cat or inflicted serious injury on a companion animal that is a dog or cat, including a serious impairment of health or bodily function that requires significant medical attention, a ser ious disfigurement, any injury that has a reasonable potential to cause death, or any injury other than a sprain or strain or (ii) directly caused serious injury to a person, including laceration, broken bone, or substantial puncture of skin by teeth. Un less good cause is determined by the court, the appeal of a dangerous dog finding shall be heard within 30 days. I. If after he aring the evidence the court finds that the animal is a dangerous dog, the court: 1. Shall order the animals owner to comply with the provisions of this section and §§ 3.2-6540.01, 3.2-6542, and 3.2-6542.1; 2. May order the owner of the animal to pay restitution for actual damages to any person injured by the animal or whose companion animal was injured or killed by the animal. Such order sh all not preclude the injured person from pursuing civil remedies, including damages that accrue after the original finding that the animal is a dangerous dog; and 3. May order the owner to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for such dangerous dog from the time the animal is taken into custody until such time as the animal is disposed of or returned to the owner. J. If after he aring the evidence the court decides to defer further proceedings without entering an adjudication that the animal is a dangerous dog, it may do so, notwithstanding any other provision of this section. A court that defers further proceedings shall place specific conditions upon the owner of the dog, including the requirement that the owner provide documentation that the dog has been, or will be within three business days, implanted with electronic identification registered to the owner. The registration information shall be provided to the animal control officer. If the owner violates any of the conditions, the court may enter an adjudication that the animal is a dangerous dog and proceed as otherwise provided in this section. Upon fulfillment of the c onditions, the court shall dismiss the proceedings against the animal and the owner without an adjudication that the animal is a dangerous dog. K. No animal s hall be found by the court to be a dangerous dog: 1. Solel y because it is a particular breed; 2. If the threat, injury, or damage was sustained by a person who was (i) committing at the time a crime upon the premises occupied by the animals owner; (ii) committing at the time a willful trespass upon the premises occupied by the animals owner; or (iii) provoking, tormenting, or physically abusing the animal or can be shown to have repeatedly provoked, tormented, abused, or assaulted the animal at other times; 3. If the animal is a police dog that was engaged in the performance of its duties as such at the time of the act complained of; 4. If at the time of the acts complained of the animal was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself, its kennel, its offspring, a person, or its owners property; 5. As a result of killing or inflicting serious injury on a dog or cat while engaged with its owner as part of lawful hunting or participating in an organized, lawful dog handling event; or 6. If the court determines based on the totality of the evidence before it, or for other good cause, that the dog is not dangerous or a threat to the community. L. If the owne r of an animal found to be a dangerous dog is a minor, the custodial parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for complying with all requirements of this section and §§ 3.2-6540.01, 3.2-6540.02, 3.2-6540.03, 3.2-6540.04, 3.2-6542, and 3.2-6542 .1.

Any humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer may lawfully seize and impound any animal that has been abandoned, has been cruelly treated, or is suffering from an apparent violation of this chapter that has rendered the animal in such a condition as to constitute a direct and immediate threat to its life, safety or health. The seizure or impoundment of an equine resulting from a violation of clause (iv) of subsection A or clause (ii) of subsection B of § 3.2-6570 may be undertaken o nly by the State Veterinarian or State Veterinarians representative who has received training in the examination and detection of sore horses as required by 9 C.F.R. Part 11.7. B. Before seiz ing or impounding any agricultural animal, the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall contact the State Veterinarian or State Veterinarians representative, who shall recommend to the person the most appropriate a ction for effecting the seizure and impoundment. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall notify the owner of the agricultural animal and the local attorney for the Commonwealth of the recommendation. The humane in vestigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer may impound the agricultural animal on the land where the agricultural animal is located if: 1. The o wner or tenant of the land where the agricultural animal is located gives written permission; 2. A general district court so orders; or 3. The owner or tenant of the land where the agricultural animal is located cannot be immediately located, and it is in the best interest of the agricultural animal to be impounded on the land where it is located until the written permission of the owner or tenant of the land can be obtained. If there is a direct and immediate threat to an agricultural animal, the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer may seize the animal, in which case the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall file within five business days on a form approved by the State Veterinarian a report on the condition of the animal at the time of the seizure, the location of i mpoundment, and any other information required by the State Veterinarian. C. Upon seizin g or impounding an animal, the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer or animal control officer shall petition the general district court in the city or county where the animal is seized for a hearing. The hearing shall be not more than 10 business days from the date of the seizure of the animal. The hearing shall be to determine whether the animal has been abandoned, has been cruelly treated, or has not been provided adequate care. D. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal control officer shall cause to be served upon the person with a right of property in the animal or the custodian of the animal notice of the hearing. If such person or the custodian is known and residing w ithin the jurisdiction wherein the animal is seized, written notice shall be given at least five days prior to the hearing of the time and place of the hearing. If such person or the custodian is known but residing out of the jurisdiction where such anim al is seized, written notice by any method or service of process as is provided by the Code of Virginia shall be given. If such person or the custodian is not known, the humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal control officer shall cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction wherein such animal is seized notice of the hearing at least one time prior to the hearing and shall further cause notice of the hearing to be posted at least five days prior to th e hearing at the place provided for public notices at the city hall or courthouse wherein such hearing shall be held. E. The procedu re for appeal and trial shall be the same as provided by law for misdemeanors, except that unless good cause is determined by the court, an appeal shall be heard within 30 days. Trial by jury shall be as provided in Article 4 (§ 19.2-260 et seq.) of C hapter 15 of Title 19.2. The Commonwealth shall be required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. F. The humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, or animal control officer shall provide for such animal until the court has concluded the hearing. Any locality may require the owner of any animal held pursuant to this subsection for more than 30 days to post a bo nd in surety with the locality for the amount of the cost of boarding the animal for a period of time set by ordinance, not to exceed nine months. In any locality that has not adopted such an ordinance, a court may order the owner of an animal held pursuant to this subsection for more than 30 days to post a bond i n surety with the locality for the amount of the cost of boarding the animal for a period of time not to exceed nine months. The bond shall not be forfeited if the owner is found to be not guilty of the violation. If the court determines that the animal has been neither abandoned, cruelly treated, nor deprived of adequate care, the animal shall be returned to the owner. If the co urt determines that the animal has been (i) abandoned or cruelly treated, (ii) deprived of adequate care, as that term is defined in § 3.2-6500, or (iii) raised as a dog that has been, is, or is intended to be used in dogfighting in violation of § 3.2-6571, then the court shall order that the animal may be: (a) sold by a local governing body, if not a companion animal; (b) disposed of by a local governing body pursuant to subsection D of § 3.2-6546, whether such animal is a companion animal or an agricultural animal; or (c) delivered to the person with a right of property in the animal as provided in subsection G. G. In no case shall the owner be allowed to purchase, adopt, or otherwise obtain the animal if the court determines that the animal has been abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. The court shall direct that the animal be delivered to the person wit h a right of property in the animal, upon his request, if the court finds that the abandonment, cruel treatment, or deprivation of adequate care is not attributable to the actions or inactions of such person. H. The court s hall order the owner of any animal determined to have been abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in caring and providing for such animal from the time the animal is seized until such time that th e animal is disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this section, to the provider of such care. I. The court m ay prohibit the possession or ownership of other companion animals by the owner of any companion animal found to have been abandoned, cruelly treated, or deprived of adequate care. In making a determination to prohibit the possession or ownership of comp anion animals, the court may take into consideration the owners past record of convictions under this chapter or other laws prohibiting cruelty to animals or pertaining to the care or treatment of animals and the owners mental and physical condit ion. J. If the cour t finds that an agricultural animal has been abandoned or cruelly treated, the court may prohibit the possession or ownership of any other agricultural animal by the owner of the agricultural animal if the owner has exhibited a pattern of abandoning or c ruelly treating agricultural animals as evidenced by previous convictions of violating § 3.2-6504 or 3.2-6570. In making a determination to prohibit the possession or ownership of agricultural animals, the court may take into consideration the owner s mental and physical condition. K. Any person who is prohibited from owning or possessing animals pursuant to subsection I or J may petition the court to repeal the prohibition after two years have elapsed from the date of entry of the courts order. The court may, in its discretion, repeal the p rohibition if the person can prove to the satisfaction of the court that the cause for the prohibition has ceased to exist. L. When a sale occurs, the proceeds shall first be applied to the costs of the sale then next to the unreimbursed expenses for the care and provision of the animal, and the remaining proceeds, if any, shall be paid over to the owner of the animal. If the owner of the animal cannot be found, the proceeds remaining shall be paid into the Literary Fund. M. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the humane destruction of a critically injured or ill animal for humane purposes by the impounding humane investigator, law-enforcement officer, animal control officer, or licensed veterinarian.

For annual survey article, Animal Law, see 44 U. Rich. L. Rev. 185 (2009). CASE NOTES Evidence sufficient to suppo rt conviction.  Evidence supported defendants conviction for promoting or preparing for dog-fighting because (1) expert witnesses testified about the physical evidence seized from defendants property, which they described as items used in the breeding of fighting dogs; (2) defendant had numerous dog-fighting publications and journals, some of which publications contained defendants own advertisements using language r elating to dog-fighting; and (3) the jury found the prosecutions witnesses more credible than defendant. Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 360 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Evidence sufficient to suppo rt conviction.  In a case in which defendant was found guilty of dog fighting, in violation of former § 3.1-796.124 [now § 3.2-6571] and he filed a motion to set aside, he argued unsuccessfully that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The Commonwealth was not required to prove that defendant engaged in organized dog fighting, but could prove in the alternative that he possessed, owned, trained, transpo rted, or sold any dog with the intent that such dog engage in an exhibition of fighting with another dog; based upon the number of dogs that were there, the way they were restrained, the apparatus the dogs had on, the equipment that was found in the yard , the treadmill, the supplements, the medicine, and the literature that talked about how to train dogs to fight, which paralleled what was actually at the scene, the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the person in charge an d control of the premises when the alleged acts occurred. Commonwealth v. Taylor, 77 Va. Cir. 102, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 228 (Chesapeake Sept. 16, 2008). Untimely challenge to indictment.  In a case in which defendant was convicted of violating former § 3.1-796.124 [now this section] and he filed a motion to set aside based on alleged deficiencie s in the indictment, since he did not raise the issue of the validity of the indictment until 16 months after trial, defendant had waived his right to be more fully advised of the cause and nature of his accusation. Additionally, it was obvious that defe ndant, the Commonwealth, and the court all were fully aware of the cause and nature of the offense for which he was being tried and of which he was convicted.

Annotations CASE NOTES Damages for injuries relat ed to service dogs.  Although an injured dog owner claimed that her dog, which was also hurt in the accident in which she was injured, was a service dog under § 51.5-44, the trial court ruled that a jury instruction that allowed the jury to award the owner damages for the emotional distress she suffered in seeing the dog hurt was an impermissible instruction. As the court explained, dogs and cats were deemed to be personal propert y and no damages could be awarded for any emotional distress suffered due to an injury to personal property. Kondaurov v. Kerdasha, 271 Va. 646, 629 S.E.2d 181, 2006 Va. LEXIS 71 (2006) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Conversion.  Animal advocacy groups demurrer was overruled as to the dog owners conversion claim because, while the absence of a license for the dog was not stated in the complaint, it was not statutorily required, there was no precedential distinction between the measures of compensatory damages, and the General Assembly did not plainly manifest an intent to bar the recovery of punitive damages for the malicious kill ing of a dog.
