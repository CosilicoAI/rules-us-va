Annotations Transition provisions. In June 2002, the Virginia Code Commission undertook the revision of Title 25, establishing procedures for exercising the power of eminent domain. Title 25 had no t been revised since the adoption of the Code of Virginia in 1950. During the past 52 years, many changes have been made to the procedures applicable to the condemnation of property. The primary purpose of the Title 25 revision was to reorganize the laws in a logical manner and improve their structure and clarity, while seeking to remove or update archaic references and conform the provisions to current statutory drafting protocols, incorporating current practices, resolving confusion caused by conflict ing provisions and conforming certain provisions to other statutes. The revision, as amended and adopted by the General Assembly, became Acts 2003, c. 940, effective July 1, 2003. Title 25 was rewritten primarily as new Title 25.1, with certain sections relocated elsewhere. In addition, provisions in titles other than Title 25 that authori ze entities to acquire property by condemnation were also amended. Where appropriate, the historical citations to former sections of Title 25 have been added to corresponding new sections. The case notes appearing under new sections were decided under corresponding former sections or prior law. For tables of corresponding former and new sections, see the tables in Volume 10. Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 2, provides: That whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section or chapter of Title 25 or any oth er title of the Code of Virginia as such titles existed prior to July 1, 2003, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section or chapter of Title 25.1 or any other title of the Code and whenever any such former section or chapter is given a new number in Title 25.1 or any other title, all references to any such former section or chapter of Title 25 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section or chapter containing such conditions, requ irements, provisions, contents or portions thereof. Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 3, provides: That the regulations of any department or agency affected by the revision of Title 25 or such other titles in effect on th e effective date of this act shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations adopted under this act. Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 4, provides: That the provisions of § 30-152 of the Code of Virginia shall apply to the codification of Title 25.1 so as to give eff ect to other laws enacted by the 2003 Session of the General Assembly. Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 5, provides: That the repeal of Title 25 shall not affect any act or offense done or committed, or any penalty incurred, or any right e stablished, accrued or accruing on or before such date, or any proceeding, prosecution, suit or action pending on that day. Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 6, provides: That any notice given, recognizance taken, or process or writ issued before July 1, 2003, shall be valid although given, t aken or to be returned to a day after such date, in like manner as if Title 25.1 had been effective before the same was given, taken or issued. Acts 2003, c. 940, cl. 7, provides: That if any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision or section of Title 25.1 shall be adjudged in any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision or section thereof directly involved in the controversy in which the judgment shall have been rendered, and to this end the provisions of Title 25.1 are declared severable. Acts 2022, c. 734, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall not apply to condemnation proceedings in which the petitioner filed prior to July 1, 2022, (i) a petition in condemnation pursuant to Chapter 2 ( § 25.1-200 et seq.) of Title 25.1 of the Code of Virginia or (ii) a certificate of take or deposit pursuant to Chapter 3 ( § 25.1-300 et seq.) of Title 25.1 or Title 33.2 of the Code of Virginia. Any condemnation proceedings in which the petitioner filed a petition or certificate described in clause (i) or (ii) shall be governed by the provisions of the Code of Virginia in effect prior to July 1, 2022. Acts 2022, c. 735, cl. 3 provides: That the provisions of this act shall apply only to the taking of or damage to property that has occurred on or after July 1, 2022, or a condemnation proceeding that has been filed on or after July 1, 2022, as appropriate. Editors note. Acts 2010, c. 835, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall apply only to actions filed on or after July 1, 2010. Acts 2011, cc. 117 and 190, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall not apply to the acquisition of real property by a railroad, public service corporation, municipal corporation, local governmental unit, or political subdivision of the Commonwealth or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof, or two or more of the aforementioned, that is (i) the subject of a certificate recorded prior to July 1, 2011, in the clerks office where deeds are recorded; (ii) the subject of a petition for condemnation filed prior to July 1, 2011;...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_25.1-101"><akn:num>§ 25.1-101</akn:num><akn:heading>Condemnation by state institutions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Notwith standing anything herein to the contrary, a locality exercising the powers granted by § 15.2-2109 or § 15.2-2115 shall be subject to the provisions of this section to the same extent as are corporations, unless otherwise provided in § 15.2-1906 or § 15.2-2146.

The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Scope of section.  The right created by former similar section would not be extended by construction beyond the explicit requirements of the statute. Great Falls Power Co. v. Great Falls &amp; O.D.R.R., 104 Va. 416, 52 S.E. 172, 1905 Va. LEXIS 113 (1905). Construing together former similar section and §§ 56-17 through 56-22, it is seen that the section related to a condemnation proceeding under which, by forc e of the power of eminent domain, it was intended to condemn and take a fee simple interest in property belonging to another corporation, and not to the crossing of the tracks of one railroad company by another. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Virginian Ry., 110 Va. 631, 66 S.E. 863, 1910 Va. LEXIS 105 (1910). In proceedings before the State Corporation Commission on a petition by one railroad to prevent another from crossing at grade, there is no question of the exerci se of the power of eminent domain. One railroad has the absolute power to cross another, and the crossing is a privilege granted and is not a taking of property within the meaning of the condemnation statutes. Hence, former similar section did not apply. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Tidewater Ry., 11 Va. L. Reg. 518 (1905). All of the provisions in former § 25-233 as traditionally applied by the Commission applied to the condemnation of electrical utility distribution facilities u nder § 56-265.4:2 by a city or town. Town of Blackstone v. Southside Elec. Coop., 256 Va. 527, 506 S.E.2d 773, 1998 Va. LEXIS 141 (1998). A city cannot condemn the property of a public service corporation without complying with former similar section. The legislative history shows that the limitations imposed by former § 15.1-237 and the section applied to municipalities. Boulevard Bridge Corp. v. City of Richmond, 203 Va. 212, 123 S.E.2d 636, 1962 Va. LEXIS 130 (1962); Ci ty of Richmond v. Southern Ry., 203 Va. 220, 123 S.E.2d 641, 1962 Va. LEXIS 131 (1962). Public necessity or essential public convenience is required.  The true construction of former similar section required that when one public service corporation proposed to condemn the property of another there should be some greater reason than the general policy of the State. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Interstate R.R., 114 Va. 789, 76 S.E. 940, 1913 Va. LEXIS 143 (1913). To justify condemnation under former similar section it had to not only appear that the land sought to be condemned was for a public use, but it had to affirmativ ely appear that a public necessity, or an essential public convenience, required that the land be taken, and that such land was not essential to the purposes of such other corporation. Great Falls Power Co. v. Great Falls &amp; O.D.R.R., 104 Va. 416, 52 S.E. 172, 1905 Va. LEXIS 113 (1905). What constitutes public necessity or essential public convenience.  Where the proposed condemnation would permit the bringing closer together of passenger stations that were a mile apart and would increase the competition of railr oads by affording to large coal operators a new, better and enlarged market for their product, and where the owners of the land were only occupying about two-tenths of their holding and that proposed to be taken was not essential to their purpose, the ev idence in the case showed an essential public convenience, and the condemnation sought should be permitted. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Interstate R.R., 114 Va. 789, 76 S.E. 940, 1913 Va. LEXIS 143 (1913). Scenic advantages, however great, or however much they may increase the revenues of an electric railway company chartered to transport persons and property along its line, were not a public necessity, or an essential public convenience within the meaning of former similar section. Great Falls Power Co. v. Great Falls &amp; O.D.R.R., 104 Va. 416, 52 S.E. 172, 1905 Va. LEXIS 113 (1905). In a proceeding before the State Corporation Commission by a city for permission to condemn the property of a railroad company for a recreation park, the owners a nd lessors of the land sought to be condemned admitted that it was not essential to their purposes. The only question before the Commission, therefore, was whether a public necessity or an essential public convenience required the condemnation of the lan d. The city, after a careful survey of the situation, had declared that an essential public convenience or public necessity required that the property in question be taken. The Commission approved that conclusion, and the Supreme Court approved the actio n of the Commission. Page v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 325, 160 S.E. 33, 1931 Va. LEXIS 323 (1931). Acquisition and operation of franchisees plant and property.  With the permission of the State Corporation Commission, a city or town may institute eminent domain proceedings to acquire and operate the plant and property own ed by the franchisee. Potomac Edison Co. v. Town of Luray, 234 Va. 348, 362 S.E.2d 678, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1173, 1987 Va. LEXIS 264 (1987). The State Highway and Transportation Department (now Department of Transportation) was not a corporation possessing the power of eminent domain within the meaning of former similar section. Tiller v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 201 Va. 222, 110 S.E.2d 209, 1959 Va. LEXIS 215 (1959). Dismissal for failure to secure consent of State Corporation Commission.  The trial court dismissed the proceeding upon the ground that the petitioner had not applied for and secured from the State Corporation Commission a certificate o f public necessity and essential public convenience, as required by law, and its judgment was affirmed on appeal. City of Hopewell v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 154 Va. 19, 152 S.E. 537, 1930 Va. LEXIS 193 (1930). When failure to obtain c onsent must be alleged.  The failure of a railroad company to obtain the consent of the State Corporation Commission to condemn the lands of another railroad company, as required by forme r similar section, before entering thereon to make surveys preparatory to the institution of condemnation proceedings, could not be relied on in support of an injunction granted on other grounds, where no such failure was charged in the bill. South &amp; W. Ry. v. Virginia &amp; S.W. Ry., 104 Va. 323, 51 S.E. 843, 1905 Va. LEXIS 102 (1905). Action o f Corporation Commission as judicial in nature.  In the proceeding before the Commission under former similar section it is authorized to pass upon questions of public necessity and essential public convenience as well as whether the property was essential to corporations purposes. Here the Commission acted in the nature of an umpire for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of all parties affected, including the public, and its action w as judicial in nature. Hence it was appropriate, under the circumstances, to invoke the Commissions rule of practice pertaining to declaratory judgments. Boulevard Bridge Corp. v. City of Richmond, 203 Va. 212, 123 S.E.2d 636, 1962 Va. LEXIS 130 (196 2). Meaning of parties in interest.  Primarily, parties in interest, as used in former similar section, means the parties desiring to condemn, on the one hand, and the owner of the land, on t he other. Page v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 325, 160 S.E. 33, 1931 Va. LEXIS 323 (1931); Virginia Ass'n of Ins. Agents v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 249, 110 S.E.2d 223, 1959 Va. LEXIS 219 (1959).

After the a doption of a conservation or redevelopment plan pursuant to Article 7 (§ 36-48 et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 36, should any property located within the area of the conservation or redevelopment plan be downzoned without the expressed consent of the p roperty owner and should the locality initiate condemnation proceedings against that owner after any such downzoning, the date of valuation shall be the date of adoption of the conservation or redevelopment plan.

B. If property located within a conservation or redevelopment plan adopted pursuant to Article 7 (§ 36-48 et seq.) of Chapter 1 of Title 36 was downzoned without the expressed consent of the property owner within a period of five years prior to the adoption of the conservation or redevelopment plan and if such downzoning was not part of a comprehensive rezoning of the locality, then, if the locality should initiate condemnation proceedings within five years after the adoption of the conservation or redevelopment p lan against the same owner who owned the property at the time of the downzoning, the date of valuation shall be the day before the date the property was downzoned.

C. Where the d ate of valuation in condemnation proceedings governed by this section predates the date of any downzoning action, the locality may introduce into evidence before the body determining just compensation the estimated difference between the amount of real e state taxes that the owner would have paid had the downzoning not occurred and the amount of real estate taxes assessed against the property since the date of the downzoning and the body determining just compensation may offset the award by that amount.

Any decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which such property is acquired, or by the likelihood that the prope rty would be acquired for such improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, shall be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The state agency concerned shall provide the owne r of real property to be acquired with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount it established as just compensation, and, if an appraisal is required or obtained, such written statement and summary shall include a complete copy of all appraisals of the real property to be acquired that the state agency obtained prior to making an offer to acquire or initiating negotiations for the real property. The state agency shall provide its written statement of the amount it established as just compensation on its letterhead, which shall be signed by an authorized employee of such state agency. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated. 2. No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the state agency pays the agreed purchase price, or deposits with the state court in accordance with applicab le law, for the benefit of the owner, (i) an amount not less than the state agencys approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, if such an appraisal is required, or the current assessed value of such property for real estate tax pur poses, unless the property has physically changed in a material and substantial way since the current assessment date such that the real estate tax assessment no longer represents a fair valuation of the property, when the entire parcel for which the ass essment is made is to be acquired, whichever is greater, or (ii) the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for such property. F. Nothing in this section shall make evidence of tax assessments admissible as proof of value in an eminent domain proceeding. History History.

CASE NOTES Institution of proceedings by one condemnor precludes right of another to condemn same property.  Where two condemnors would otherwise have equal right to condemn the same property, the right of the one who first institutes condemnation proceedings is superior ; that is, the institution of condemnation proceedings by one condemnor precludes the right of the other to condemn the same property.

Description of adjoining parcel of land.  A power company sought to condemn easements across two tracts of land for the erection of transmission lines. Though one of the landowners showed that he owned an other parcel which adjoined that over which the power company sought its easements, it could not be said as a matter of law that this other parcel was likely to be damaged by construction of the transmission lines. Therefore, the court erred in requiring the company, at the landowners request, to include a description of it in its petition. VEPCO v. Webb, 196 Va. 555, 84 S.E.2d 735, 1954 Va.

Compliance by federal government.  Former similar statute, although procedural, could not apply to condemnation suits instituted by the federal government, insofar as it required the petition to se t forth compliance with a statute to which the federal government was not subject. United States v. Crary, 1 F. Supp. 406, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1750 (D. Va. 1932). Interest to be condemned l imited by petition.  If the petitioner in a condemnation proceeding asks, in its petition, to condemn the fee in lands, it has no right to ask later for a different interest or estate to be condemned for its purposes without an amendment of its petition or the consent of the owner of the property. City of Richmond v. Thompson's Heirs, 116 Va. 178, 81 S.E. 105, 1914 Va. LEXIS 20 (1914). Physical or function al unity of tracts involved.  A condemnor is required by statute to state the interest sought to be taken and to file a plat describing the land in which such interest is sought and the land l ikely to be damaged, and to pay for damage to the adjacent or other property of the landowner. In the application of these statutes the significant circumstance is the physical or functional unity of the tracts involved. VEPCO v. Webb, 196 Va. 555, 84 S. E.2d 735, 1954 Va. LEXIS 252 (1954). Descri ption of property by metes and bounds not required.  This section does not require that the petition contain a description of the property by metes and bounds, but requires only a description sufficient for its identification, and a plat of the land to be condemned attached to the petition as an exhibit. Schmidt v. City of Richmond, 206 Va. 211, 142 S.E.2d 573, 1965 Va. LEXIS 188 (1965). Reference to other documents.  Although the description in the petition of the property sought to be condemned, or of the location, route, and termini of the improvement, may in itself be insuf ficient, it may be made sufficient by reference to other documents, such as maps, plats, surveys, deeds, and the like, unless such maps, etc., are insufficient in themselves to aid or render certain the description given in the petition. Schmidt v. City of Richmond, 206 Va. 211, 142 S.E.2d 573, 1965 Va. LEXIS 188 (1965). Description of adjoining parcel of land.  A power company sought to condemn easements across two tracts of land for the erection of transmission lines. Though one of the landowners showed that he owned an other parcel which adjoined that over which the power company sought its easements, it could not be said as a matter of law that this other parcel was likely to be damaged by construction of the transmission lines. Therefore, the court erred in requiring the company, at the landowners request, to include a description of it in its petition. VEPCO v. Webb, 196 Va. 555, 84 S.E.2d 735, 1954 Va. LEXIS 252 (1954). Statement of compliance.  The averment of compliance with the statute requiring an effort to purchase the land need not be in the exact language of the statute if it affirmatively appears that the petitioner has been unable to agree with the owner in respect to the compensation to be paid. Dillon v. Davis, 201 Va. 514, 112 S.E.2d 137, 1960 Va. LEXIS 123 (1960). Sufficient petition.  Petition by school board alleging that it is necessary for the purposes of your petitioner that it acquire said lot was sufficient. School Bd. v. Alexande r, 126 Va. 407, 101 S.E. 349, 1919 Va. LEXIS 103 (1919). Where, although the condemnor incorrectly described by metes and bounds some of the parcels of land to be condemned in its petition, an inspection of the plat att ached to the petition would have readily revealed the inaccuracies, the description of the property sought to be condemned in the petition was sufficient for its identification and satisfied the requirements of the section. Schmidt v. City of Ric hmond, 206 Va. 211, 142 S.E.2d 573, 1965 Va. LEXIS 188 (1965). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Public use.  Natural gas company did not seek to condemn more property than necessary to achieve the stated public use because the proposed pipeline would go underground in an area already subject to a power easement; no evidence refuted that of the company that future access rights to the properties were needed for future maintenance and safety.

Coleman, 212 Va. 171, 183 S.E.2d 130, 1971 Va. LEXIS 323 (1971) (decided under prior law). Procedural requirements satisfied.  Where the route of the power line across the landowners property was fixed by survey, was described in the petition by metes and bounds, and was shown on a pl at attached as an exhibit to the petition, this was sufficient to satisfy the procedural requirements of pleading set forth in the section.

Land owners failed to meet burden of proof as to unity of use.  Trial court judgment confirming a commissions award of damages that included additional parcels was reversed in the Commonwealths appeal in a condemnation proceeding, because the landowners failed to sustain their burden of proof as to the element of unity of use with regard to having the additional parcels included in the proceeding. The court found that the landowners alleged business plan for devel opment of the additional parcels was speculative and such alleged commercial development was too remote to establish any unity of use between the three actual taken parcels and the eight parcels the landowners sought to have added to have justified any a ward of damages for the additional parcels.

CASE NOTES Determination of ownership.  When a city sought to quiet title to an asserted easement across a condominium associations beach property, the associations argument that the trial court had no jurisdiction due to the citys failure to enact an ordinance authorizing a quiet title action failed because (1) the statute did not apply to a quiet title suit, (2) the citys ordinance allowed any actions to protect the citys interest in the easement, and (3) the suit was, in fact, a condemnation action in which it was proper to determine the ownership of the subject land, under §§ 25.1-222 and 25.1-241. Lynnhaven Dunes Condo. Ass'n v. City of Va. Beach, 284 Va. 661, 733 S.E.2d 911, 2012 Va. LEXIS 194 (2012). Jurisdiction properly exerted.  Under §§ 25.1-222 and 25.1-241, not only did the circuit court have the jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the property as between the parties, but it was also required to do so. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in permitting the city to claim it already owned the easements or in determining the parties ownership rights as part of the condemnation proceedings. 3232 Page Ave. Condo.

The court, after 21 days following service of the petitioners application, and after a hearing thereon, may approve the petitioners application if it finds that: 1. A pub lic necessity or an essential public convenience requires such entry for such purposes; 2. An emergency exists justifying such entry before the time when just compensation can be determined and the amount so determined paid into court; and 3. The interests of the owners of such property will be adequately protected by (i) the payment into court for the benefit of the owners of the amount of the offer made in accordance with § 25.1-204 or (ii) if no offer is required by that section, by the payment into the court of the amount of a good faith estimate of the value of the property. B. In addition , the court may require the petitioner to give a surety bond in an amount and with such surety as the court may determine. C. Upon such f indings and payment and the giving of such bond, if any is required, with surety in the office of the clerk or with the court, conditioned as required by law and to the effect that the petitioner and its surety or sureties are bound to the owners of the property to be taken or damaged to secure to each of them payment of just compensation therefor as finally determined in the condemnation proceedings, the petitioner shall have the right to enter and construct its works or improvements upon or through th e property as described in its petition.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Right of immediate entry.  Evidence was sufficient to show the existence of an immediate necessity and pressing need to satisfy the emergency requirement of subdivision A 2, justify ing a natural gas companys early entry onto properties, because there were a number of interruptions to some of the companys larger customers; until the company completed the project, those same customers were at risk of both potential loss of se rvice or potential price fluctuations. Va. Natural Gas, Inc. v. Sumner, 98 Va. Cir. 167, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 21 (Chesapeake Feb. 23, 2018). Subdivisions A 1 and 3 had been met by a natural gas company because the supply of natural gas for heating, cooking, and the generation of electricity was clearly a public necessity and essential; as the property was already subject to an easement to a power company, an amount paid into court would adequately protect the interests of the property owners. Va. Natural Gas, Inc. v. Sumner, 98 Va. Cir. 167, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 21 (Chesapeake Feb. 23, 2018). Public necessity.  Project was a public necessity requiring entry onto respondents property for the purpose of constructing and operating the connector pipeline. Va. Natural Gas , Inc. v. Colonna's Ship Yard Inc., 101 Va. Cir. 501, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 707 (Norfolk Sept. 18, 2018). Emergency.  Severity or exigency of a given emergency will vary by degree depending upon the specific situation, the type of emergency, and the surrounding circumstances; for example, an emergency could be described as being a medical emergency, a public safety emergency, an emergency due to natural disaster or weather, a public health emergency, or constitute the basis or rationale for emergency legislation, etc. Va. Natura l Gas, Inc. v. Sumner, 98 Va. Cir. 167, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 21 (Chesapeake Feb. 23, 2018). Any project proposed by a condemning authority to enter upon property for the purpose of constructing works or improvements necessarily involves planning, designi ng, and funding; the inclusion of the term emergency in Title 25.1 of the Code suggests that it is not limited to tasks that must be completed in days or hours. In that context, there was an emergency or an immediate necessity or pressing need fo r petitioner to enter onto respondents property without further delay to complete construction of the project. Va. Natural Gas, Inc. v. Colonna's Ship Yard Inc., 101 Va. Cir. 501, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 707 (Norfolk Sept. 18, 2018). Impact to respondent.  Alleged impact to respondent upon immediate entry was not one of the statutory factors and was not relevant to the courts decision; moreover, the just compens ation trial would determine the amount of compensation petitioner was to pay respondent for the acquisition of the easement and damages, if any, by reason of such taking and use. Va. Natural Gas, Inc. v. Colonna's Ship Yard Inc., 101 Va. Cir. 501, 2018 V a. Cir. LEXIS 707 (Norfolk Sept. 18, 2018). Bona fide offer to purchase property.  Natural gas company made a bona fide effort to purchase properties because the company offered what it considered to be fair market values; the offers were reject ed by the property owners, which resulted in the company filing a petition condemnation and application for entry. Va. Natural Gas, Inc. v. Sumner, 98 Va. Cir. 167, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 21 (Chesapeake Feb. 23, 2018). No separate hearing.  Respondents interests would be protected by petitioners payment into court of $25,000, which represented the amount of its bona fide offer, and respondent s request to hold a separate hearing to determine the amount to be deposited was denied; the statute only refers to the amount of the bona fide offer and does not require a separate proceeding to determine the amount of the deposit, and there was no evidence that petitioner would be unable to pay the award to be determined.

Most of the cases cited below were decided under prior law. Taking  gives birth to right to just compensation.  With respect to both the land taken and damages to other property caused by the taking, it is the taking which gives birth to the right to just compen sation. Bristol Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Farmbest, Inc., 215 Va. 106, 205 S.E.2d 406, 1974 Va. LEXIS 239 (1974). When taking begins.  The taking begins when the condemnation petition is filed, not when taking is proposed. Bristol Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Farmbest, Inc., 215 Va. 106, 205 S. E.2d 406, 1974 Va. LEXIS 239 (1974). Damages to be considered.  The commissioners are required to take into consideration all damages incident to the construction of a railroad as designed, according to the maps and profiles f iled in the clerks office, and in determining whether this was done the testimony of the commissioners is receivable for the purpose of explaining their report. Lanford v. Virginia Air Line Ry., 113 Va. 68, 73 S.E. 566, 1912 Va. LEXIS 10 (1912). Damages not depe ndent on actual taking of property.  The legislature has full power to require any company exercising the power of eminent domain to make compensation to any person whose property is damaged by the p roposed improvement, whether any portion of the property is actually taken or not. To constitute damages there need be no physical invasion of the owners real property; the owner may recover if the construction and operation of the improvement would amount to a private nuisance at common law, or if it is the cause of substantial damage, though consequential. Tidewater Ry. v. Shartzer, 107 Va. 562, 59 S.E. 407, 1907 Va. LEXIS 73 (1907). The words other property embrace personal property. City of Richmond v. Williams, 114 Va. 698, 77 S.E. 492, 1913 Va. LEXIS 133 (1913). Expense of moving personal property.  The legislative intent is that the landowners right to damages for the costs of moving personalty from realty to be condemned is limited to costs incurred aft er the condemnation petition is filed. Bristol Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Farmbest, Inc., 215 Va. 106, 205 S.E.2d 406, 1974 Va. LEXIS 239 (1974). It is proper to instruct the commissioners to consider the expense of moving a stack of lumber stored by a tenant upon the land taken and also the expense of remo ving a fence upon said land. City of Richmond v. Williams, 114 Va. 698, 77 S.E. 492, 1913 Va. LEXIS 133 (1913). Whether proper ty is enhanced is not to be considered.  When property in the vicinity of the take is enhanced in value by reason of the take, sales of such property should not be used as evidence of the value of the pr operty taken. Enhancement is difficult to quantify, cause and effect may be conjectural, and commissioners are not at liberty to speculate on such matters. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Dennison, 231 Va. 239, 343 S.E.2d 324, 1986 Va. LEXIS 185 (1986). Whether a post-take sale has been enhanced by the take is a matter which should be determined by the trial court out of the presence of the commissioners. State H wy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Dennison, 231 Va. 239, 343 S.E.2d 324, 1986 Va. LEXIS 185 (1986). Commissioners were properly permitted to hear and consider evidence that the take eliminated a driveway formerly used as access. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Dennison, 231 Va. 239, 343 S.E.2d 324, 1986 Va. LEXIS 185 (1986). Before commissioners may consider the existence of mineral deposits as an element of market value, they must determine: (1) that the development of such mineral deposits is consistent with the highest and best use of the property; (2) that there is a market for such minerals in the area; (3) that the mineral deposits are of such quantity and character that they may economically be mined taking into consideration all relevant factors; and (4) that the presence of such mineral deposits on the property contributes to the market value of the property when compared with other land in the are a. East Tenn. Natural Gas Co. v. Riner, 239 Va. 94, 387 S.E.2d 476, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1039, 1990 Va. LEXIS 28 (1990). No burden of proof on issue of just compensation.  Because of the great responsibility and relative independence vested in condemnation commissioners to ascertain the value of the property to be taken, there is no burden of proof, in the common-law sense, on the issue of just compensation, and no ultimate risk of non-persuasion on the issue. Hamer v. School Bd., 240 Va. 66, 393 S.E.2d 623, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2582, 1990 Va. LEXIS 105 (1990). No burden rests on the landowner to prove damages to the residue and he need offer no ev idence to show them. VEPCO v. Webb, 196 Va. 555, 84 S.E.2d 735, 1954 Va. LEXIS 252 (1954). Pointing out ind ependent items of probable damage.  Independent items of probable damage should not be pointed out to the commissioners in such way as to prompt them to arrive at an award by adding up such items. V EPCO v. Webb, 196 Va. 555, 84 S.E.2d 735, 1954 Va. LEXIS 252 (1954). Evidence of the sum paid by a condemnor for similar land is not admissible, because it i s not a fair indication of market value, unless it is proved that such purchase of similar land was voluntary and not by way of compromise. Collins v. Pulaski County, 201 Va. 164, 110 S.E.2d 184, 1959 Va. LEXIS 207 (1959). Landowner failed to carry burden of proving amount of damage where the record was devoid of any evidence about the fair market value of the residue immediately before and immediately after the taking; there was no evidence in the record other than testimony that the taking hurt landowner $20,000, at least, from which the commissione rs could make such a determination without engaging in conjecture and speculation; and the record did not indicate that the commissioners even viewed the residual parcel. Town of Rocky Mount v. Hudson, 244 Va. 271, 421 S.E.2d 407, 9 Va. Law Rep. 253, 199 2 Va. LEXIS 92 (1992). Must prove unity of use when including damages to the residue of actual take parcels.  Trial court judgment confirming a commissions award of damages that included additional parcels was reversed in the Commonwealths appeal in a condemnation proceeding, because the landowners failed to sustain their burden of proof as to the element of unity of use with regard to having the additional parcels included in the proceeding. The court found that the landowners alleged business plan for devel opment of the additional parcels was speculative and such alleged commercial development was too remote to establish any unity of use between the three actual taken parcels and the eight parcels the landowners sought to have added to have justified any a ward of damages for the additional parcels.

Knowledge to be acquired form vi ew of land.  The commissioners are entitled to weigh the facts and circumstances and determine whether they fairly support the opinions of the witnesses, and in making that de termination, they may consider knowledge acquired on view. State Hwy. Comm'r v. Foster, 216 Va. 745, 222 S.E.2d 780, 1976 Va. LEXIS 197 (1976). If from a view of the land the commissioners believe property adjacent to that taken will be damaged, compensation for such damage should be awarded. VEPCO v. Web b, 196 Va. 555, 84 S.E.2d 735, 1954 Va. LEXIS 252 (1954). The statute stresses that in the performance of their duty to ascertain what is the just compensation for land taken, the commissioners shall themselves view the land. Richmond &amp; Petersburg Elec. Ry. v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 103 Va. 399, 49 S.E. 512, 1905 Va. LEXIS 8 (1905). Awards not to be based solely on view.  The 1962 amendment to former similar section which expressly required the commissioners to consider evidence from the testimony and from a view of the property in making their award was intended to forbid awards based solely on evidence acquired on view. State Hwy. Comm'r v. Foster, 216 Va. 745, 222 S.E.2d 780, 1976 Va. LEXIS 197 (1976). When peculiar benefits deducted.  For the land taken the owner is entitled to receive full compensation in money, without deduction for any benefits, but as to the land not taken, there is to be d educted from the damage sustained peculiar benefits received. Talbot v. City of Norfolk, 158 Va. 387, 163 S.E. 100, 1932 Va. LEXIS 263 (1932). Participation of tenant in proceed ings.  The trial court did not err in refusing to allow a billboard lessee to participate in the selection of commissioners, because former §§ 25-46.21 and 25-46.2 1:1 restricted the right of a tenant to participate in a valuation hearing.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Testimony of owner.  The opinion testimony of the owner of personal property is competent and admissible on the question of the value of such property, regardless of the owners kn owledge of property values; however, ownership of property by a corporation does not automatically qualify a company employee to testify about the value of company property. Where a foundation of knowledge by a witness for a corporation regarding the val ue of a particular piece of property is established, the witness lay opinion regarding the value of such property is admissible.

The report of the body determining just compensation may be confirmed or set aside forthwith by the court. B. However, wh en the report is so filed and before the court passes thereon, either party shall have the right to file written exceptions to the report, which shall be filed not later than 10 days after the rendering of the report by the body determining just compensa tion. The court shall have the same power over the reports of the body determining just compensation as it now has over verdicts of juries in civil actions. C. Upon hearin g of exceptions to the report the court shall not recall and question the members of the body determining just compensation as to the manner in which their report was determined unless there be an allegation in such written exceptions that fraud, collusi on, corruption or improper conduct entered into the report. If such allegation is made, the judge shall summon the members of the body determining just compensation to appear and he alone shall question them concerning their actions. If the court be sati sfied that fraud, collusion, corruption or improper conduct entered into the report of the body determining just compensation, the report shall be set aside and a new body to determine just compensation shall be empanelled to rehear the case. D. If the cour t be satisfied that no such fraud, collusion, corruption or improper conduct entered into the report of the body determining just compensation, or no other cause exists that would justify setting aside or modifying a jury verdict in civil actions, the re port shall be confirmed.

Annotations CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under prior law. Legislative intent.  The legislature did not intend that the statute be utilized to conduct a fishing expedition in the hope that upon recalling and questioning the commission ers, improper conduct might appear. VEPCO v. Shaffer, 209 Va. 418, 164 S.E.2d 590, 1968 Va. LEXIS 250 (1968). Factual allegation required.  The clear import of the statute was that there had to be some factual allegation of improper conduct which cast suspicion upon the integrity of the commissioners  report before the judge was required to recall the commissioners and question them. A mere allegation of improper conduct, without stating what actions of the commissioners constituted such, was a conclusion of law which furnished neither informatio n for the trial judge to determine the sufficiency of the exceptions nor a basis upon which he might frame questions to examine the commissioners. Whether misconduct entered into the report of the commissioners was a factual question, and good pleading r equired that such an allegation be supported by facts which, if proved, would amount to misconduct in fact. VEPCO v. Shaffer, 209 Va. 418, 164 S.E.2d 590, 1968 Va. LEXIS 250 (1968). The report of the commissioners is prima facie correct. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Ca rter, 216 Va. 639, 222 S.E.2d 776, 1976 Va. LEXIS 179 (1976). Improper conduct within the meaning of former similar section did not include gr anting an excessive award, misunderstanding the courts instructions, or proceeding under erroneous principles. VEPCO v. Shaffer, 209 Va. 418, 164 S.E.2d 590, 1968 Va. LEXIS 250 (1968). The finding of commissioners in condemnation proceedings is entitled to great weight and is not to be disturbed unless shown to be erroneous by clear proof that it is based upon erroneous principles, or that the amount allowed is so grossly inadequate or excessive as to show prejudice or corruption on their part. This is so because the comm issioners may base their finding upon facts obtained by their own view of the property, which do not appear in the record. Appalachian Elec. Power Co. v. Gorman, 191 Va. 344, 61 S.E.2d 33, 1950 Va. LEXIS 225 (1950); State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Carter, 216 Va. 639, 222 S.E.2d 776, 1976 Va. LEXIS 179 (1976). And their judgment should not be affected by extraneous matters.  Great weight is attached to the award of the commissioners and it is important that their judgment be not affected by relationship to the parties or other extrane ous matters. Collins v. Pulaski County, 201 Va. 164, 110 S.E.2d 184, 1959 Va. LEXIS 207 (1959). They may not take ar bitrary or capricious action.  While the commissioners are not bound by the opinion of experts, or by the apparent weight of the evidence, they may not take arbitrary or capricious action and r eturn awards not related to the value of the property. VEPCO v. Patterson, 204 Va. 574, 132 S.E.2d 436, 1963 Va. LEXIS 187 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 956, 84 S. Ct. 975, 11 L. Ed. 2d 974, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 1627 (1964). An award which bears no reasonable relationship to the testimonial evidence is arbitrary and capricious, for such an award raises an inference that the commissioners failed to consider that evidence and considered the facts observed on view as the sole evidence in the case. State Hwy. Comm'r v. Foster, 216 Va. 745, 222 S.E.2d 780, 1976 Va. LEXIS 197 (1976). Basis for setting aside awards.  If the commissioners award bears no reasonable relation to the testimonial evidence and show prejudice or corruption on the part of the commissioners, the tri al court or Supreme Court should set aside the award. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Carter, 216 Va. 639, 222 S.E.2d 776, 1976 Va. LEXIS 179 (1976). Determining whether award bears reasonable relationship to evidence.  Whether the commissioners award bears a reasonable relationship to the evidence, or whether it is based solely on the view of the commissioners, is to be dete rmined from the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Bunch v. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r, 217 Va. 627, 231 S.E.2d 324, 1977 Va. LEXIS 211 (1977). With respect to damages to the residue, the commissioners are not bound to accept the va lue opinions of the experts if they determine that they are not fairly supported by facts and circumstances. State Hwy. Comm'r v. Foster, 216 Va. 745, 222 S.E.2d 780, 1976 Va. LEXIS 197 (1976). Prejudice of commissioner may be presumed from occurrences involved. Collins v. Pulaski C ounty, 201 Va. 164, 110 S.E.2d 184, 1959 Va. LEXIS 207 (1959). Additional evidence as to the value of the property taken or damaged should not be admitted in passing upon exceptions to a report of the commissioners, since there would then be a trial de novo by the court itself of the very question which had been submitted to, and decided by, the commissioners. Commonwealth Natural Gas Corp. v. Horner, 200 Va. 824, 108 S.E.2d 403, 1959 Va. LEXIS 174 (1959). As to whether good cause be shown against the report, the main thing to be deter mined, there being no proof of bias or prejudice on the part of the commissioners, is whether or not the award was arrived at through a misconception of the principles of law which should have governed them in their action. APCO v. Johnson, 137 Va. 12, 1 19 S.E. 253, 1923 Va. LEXIS 135 (1923). Exceptions sustained.  When on exceptions to a report of the commissioners in condemnation proceedings, the question was whether good cause had been shown against the report, it appeare d from the testimony of the commissioners that four of them arrived at the award made through a misconception of their right to allow future apprehended damages due to negligent construction or operation of the works of the condemnor, and the fifth arriv ed at such award through a misconception of the rule that a present fair market value at the time of the taking was the just compensation contemplated, as the award was arrived at through a misconception of the principles of law, the exceptions w ere sustained. APCO v. Johnson, 137 Va. 12, 119 S.E. 253, 1923 Va. LEXIS 135 (1923). Must prove unity of use when including additional parcels.  Trial court judgment confirming a commissions award of damages that included additional parcels was reversed in the Commonwealths appeal in a condemnation proceeding, because the landowners failed to sustain their burden of proof as to the element of unity of use with regard to having the additional parcels included in the proceeding. The court found that the landowners alleged business plan for devel opment of the additional parcels was speculative and such alleged commercial development was too remote to establish any unity of use between the three actual taken parcels and the eight parcels the landowners sought to have added to have justified any a ward of damages for the additional parcels. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Glass, 270 Va. 138, 613 S.E.2d 411, 2005 Va. LEXIS 67 (2005). Requiring commissioners to testify.  Record held to present a situation in which the lower court should have exercised the discretion granted to it by statute and required the commissioners to appear and testify as to the manner in which awards were formulated. Commonwealth Natural Gas Corp. v. Horner, 200 Va. 824, 108 S.E.2d 403, 1959 Va. LEXIS 174 (1959). For a case holding that commissioners should have been called to testify as to formulation of award, see VEPCO v. Patterson, 204 Va. 574, 132 S.E.2d 436, 1963 Va. LEXIS 187 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 956, 84 S. Ct. 975, 11 L. Ed. 2d 974, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 1627 (1964). The trial court properly refused to question the commissioners, who had been recalled, o n matters not related to fraud, collusion, corruption or improper conduct. VEPCO v. Shaffer, 209 Va. 418, 164 S.E.2d 590, 1968 Va. LEXIS 250 (1968). In determining whether or not commissioners in condemnation proceedings took into consideration all the damages incident to the construction of a railroad through the lands of a proprietor, the testimony of the commissioners was receivable for the purpose of explaining and making clear their report.

Any tenant under a lease with a term of 12 months or longer may participate in the proceedings to determine just compensation to the same extent as his landlord or the owner, if, not less than 10 days prior to the date for the trial of the issue of just compensatio n, such tenant shall file his petition for intervention, in the manner provided in § 25.1-221. Such petition for intervention shall include (i) a verified copy of the lease under which he is in possession and (ii) an affidavit by the tenant or his dul y authorized agent or attorney, stating: 1. That he claims an interest in the award; and 2. That he desires to offer admissible evidence concerning the value of the property being taken or damaged. B. For the pur poses of this section, the term of a tenants lease shall include any renewals or extensions for which the tenant has an enforceable written option. The term tenant shall include the assignee of the original tenant, as well as any sublessee of the entire demised premises of the owner for the full unexpired term of the sublessor. C. Nothing in this section shall be construed, however, as authorizing such tenant to offer any evidence in the proceedings to determine just compensation concerning the value of his leasehold interest in the property involved therein or as authorizing the body determ ining just compensation to make any such determination in formulating its report. D. As used in this section, proceedings to determine just compensation means proceedings described in §§ 25.1-231, 25.1-232, and 25.1-233.

No. 6-413 Answer and Grounds of Defense; No. 16-294 Eminent Domain. CASE NOTES Where proceedings had not begun, right of compensation did not exist.  The Virginia Condemnation Act did not entitle a franchisee to compensation from the purchase price paid to a franchisor by the state for leasehold property becaus e the code sections provided merely a procedural right once a condemnation proceeding had begun, and no condemnation proceedings had been initiated. Bajwa v. Sunoco, Inc., 320 F. Supp. 2d 454, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10187 (E.D. Va. 2004). Parties in interest at valuation sta ge.  Former statute provided for a two-stage proceeding. In the first stage, the court determined the fair market value of the land taken and the damage, if any, to th e remaining land. The only parties having an interest in the valuation stage were the condemning authority, the owner of the land and certain tenants who had an interest in the award. Williams v. Fairfax County Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 227 Va. 309, 3 15 S.E.2d 202, 1984 Va. LEXIS 248 (1984) (decided under prior law). Participation of tenant in proceed ings.  The trial court did not err in refusing to allow a billboard lessee to participate in the selection of commissioners because former §§ 25-46.21 and 25-46.21 :1 restricted the right of a tenant to participate in a valuation hearing.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Tenants right to intervene.  Municipal authority was not entitled to dismiss a condemnation proceeding because § 25.1-248 was not applicable and the dismissal, as a matter of right, could not be used as a tool to deny a tenants right, as an intervener, to be heard as defined in § 25.1-234. Moreover, the municipal authority had a lesser interest by virtue of its inchoate or executory contract right pursuant to a memorandum of settle ment with the owners of the property. City of Roanoke v. Stegall, 81 Va. Cir. 256, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 112 (Roanoke Oct. 1, 2010). Lease did not limit the tenants potential claims and the lease protected certain portions of the award for the tenant from the landlord attempting to claim th em during the proceeding. The lease did not specifically state that the tenant was limited or prohibited from requesting or arguing for portions of the award beyond what the landlord was proscribed from claiming against the tenant and thus, it was appare nt that the lease expressed the clear intent of the parties to not limit the tenants claims during a condemnation proceeding and the tenant could use Virginias statutory framework to seek an award.

Liberal construction.  Former similar section should be liberally construed, because if the contract under this section is not given effect, the landowner will be deprived of full compe nsation. M.M. Crockin Co. v. Portsmouth Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 437 F.2d 784, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 12089 (4th Cir. 1971). Former similar section was a most useful enactment, and cases coming within its terms should receive favorable consideration from the courts; and where one interp retation of the language of the report would give it effect under the statute and the other nullify it, the former should be preferred. Southern Ry. v. Powell, 124 Va. 65, 97 S.E. 357, 1918 Va. LEXIS 76 (1918). Failure to set forth contract will not necessarily nullify report.  Report of commissioners in condemnation proceeding should not have been set aside for failure to set forth contract by life tenant conveying land in question to C ommonwealth, where circumstances showed that parties did not rely on contract but abandoned it and did not desire it to be set forth in the commissioners report. Grubb v. Shirley, 174 Va. 204, 5 S.E.2d 475, 1939 Va. LEXIS 155 (1939). The legislature never intended that the failure of the commissioners to set forth any contract that might have been entered into between the parties should nullif y the report. Grubb v. Shirley, 174 Va. 204, 5 S.E.2d 475, 1939 Va. LEXIS 155 (1939). But to preserve rights under contracts they must be set forth in report.  If there are contracts relating to fencing, culverts, etc., prior to condemnation proceedings, and the parties desire to preserve these rights and have them run a s covenants with the land, it is incumbent upon them to bring such matters to the attention of the commissioners and to see that their contracts are set forth in the commissioners report. Grubb v. Shirley, 174 Va. 204, 5 S.E.2d 475, 1939 Va. LEXIS 15 5 (1939). In condemnation proceeding, a contract by a life tenant conveying the land in question to the Commonwealth, if valid, and if it was not waived by the highway comm issioner (now Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner), should have been set forth in the report of the commissioners as affecting the interest of the life tenant. Grubb v. Shirley, 174 Va. 204, 5 S.E.2d 475, 1939 Va. LEXIS 155 (1939). Understandin g as to crossing embodied in report.  The action of the commissioners in setting forth in their report, as a part of it, an understanding as to the building of a crossing by the railroad for t he landowners was authorized by former similar section. Southern Ry. v. Powell, 124 Va. 65, 97 S.E. 357, 1918 Va. LEXIS 76 (1918). The commissioners manifestly had this section in mind, and the language adopted to apply that provision to the subject matter was not inappropriate. Southern Ry. v.

The cases cited below were decided under prior law. A judgment of condemnation of land for a right-of-way for a railroad is not void where i t appears that the proceeding was before the proper court, all proper parties were before the court, and all acts required as preliminary to the application were done or alleged in the petition to have been done, and the right of the petitioner to condem n was put in issue and tried by the court. Entry under such judgment, pending an appeal, is not without legal right. New River, H. &amp; W.R.R. v. Honaker, 119 Va. 641, 89 S.E. 960, 1916 Va. LEXIS 139 (1916). Injunction to restrain condemnation.  If the trial court has erred in its judgment that the use for which the land is sought to be condemned is a public use, then it follows as a corollary that the co mpany is transcending its authority, and injunction will lie to restrain the condemnation of private property for private use. Nichols v. Central Va. Power Co., 143 Va. 405, 130 S.E. 764, 1925 Va. LEXIS 276 (1925). A use, to be public, must be fixed and definite. It must be one in which the public, as such, has an interest, and the terms and manner of its enjoyment must be within the control of the State, independent of the rights of the private owner of the property appropriated to the use. The use of property cannot be said to be public if it be gai nsaid, denied, or withdrawn by the owner. The public interest must dominate the private gain. Nichols v. Central Va. Power Co., 143 Va. 405, 130 S.E. 764, 1925 Va. LEXIS 276 (1925). The mere recognition of the corporation in its charter as an internal improvement company does not make it so, and bring it within the operation of the general laws of the State governing such companies and controlling their operation. Nichols v. Central Va. Power Co., 143 Va. 405, 130 S.E. 764, 1925 Va. LEXIS 276 (1925). Improvements placed by petitioner should not be considered by commissioners.  When a railroad company has entered upon land under a judgment of condemnation, and placed its roadbed and track upon the land, but the judgment is reversed on ap peal, and a second application is made by the same company to condemn the same land, the value of the improvements placed upon the land by the company acting under the former judgment should not be taken into consideration by the commissioners in estimat ing the damages to be paid to the owner for the land taken.

Right to withdraw the proceedings limited to a point before time for noting appeal.  Unlike condemnation acts in other states that extend a condemnors right to withdraw the proceedings after it has lost an appeal to a higher court, Virginia li mits the right to withdraw the proceeding at a point before the time for noting an appeal.

Mann, 119 Va. 630, 89 S.E. 897, 1916 Va. LEXIS 137 (1916). The purpose of former similar section was to transfer the title to the acquired land to the condemnor free of liens, and to transfer the liens with full force and effect to the fund paid into court. Manufacturers Trust Co. v. Roanoke Water Works Co., 172 Va. 242, 1 S.E.2d 318, 1939 Va. LEXIS 234 (1939). In condemnation proceedings to acquire a waterworks system which was covered by a mortgage securing bonds, it was held that former similar section clearly negativ ed the theory of the trial court that the rights of the bondholders in the compensation paid into court, beyond the right to collect the principal and interest to the time of the award, were condemned in the proceedings. Manufacturers Trust Co. v. Roanok e Water Works Co., 172 Va. 242, 1 S.E.2d 318, 1939 Va. LEXIS 234 (1939). Construction with other law.  Former § 25-46.28, along with §§ 33.1-124, 33.1-128, and former Sup. Ct. R. 3:9A [now Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:12], authorized a taxpayer availing himself of § 33.1-124 to petition the court to join the lienholder as a party and petition the court either to order the check made payable to the lienholder or to make specific provisions for the lienholders liability for refund of any excess withdrawal. Th us, where the taxpayer did not so petition the court, but simply requested that the court impose liability upon the person to whom the excess was paid, he was, within the meaning of the section, paid and therefore was liable for refunding the amo unt of excess withdrawn that exceeded the actual condemnation award.

Due process of law.  The mere fact that the respective titles of rival claimants to land sought to be condemned by the government will not be tested by jury trial, but by reference to a special master, is not a denial of due process of law. United States v. Graham, 250 F. 499, 1917 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 795 (D. Va. 1917). Scope of award.  It was never intended to substitute the finding of a commissioner in chancery for that of the commissioners in determining the value of the respective properties. Commissioners in condemnation proceedings cannot make a valid joint award of a given sum in favor of parties to the proceedings and of persons who are not parties and who are strangers in title to the parties and their property. Swann v. Washington-Sout hern Ry., 108 Va. 282, 61 S.E. 750, 1908 Va. LEXIS 32 (1908). Commissioners appointed to assess the damages for land to be taken for a public use have no power, where there is a controversy or doubt as to who is entitled to such compensation or damage, or in what proportions, to pass upon or determine who is entitled to the same. If, in their report of the damages assessed, they also attempt to apportion the damages amongst those entitled, the apportionment should be strick en out as surplusage. Carson v. City of Richmond, 113 Va. 527, 75 S.E. 119, 1912 Va. LEXIS 67 (1912). Co urt, not commissioners, decides compensation to tenant.  Under former similar section, there was no merit in the contention that the commissioners should report what compensation should be awarded the tenant of the prop erty. That was a duty which the statute imposed upon the court. Fonticello Mineral Springs Co. v. City of Richmond, 147 Va. 355, 137 S.E. 458, 1927 Va. LEXIS 307 (1927). Jurisdiction properly exercised.  Under §§ 25.1-222 and 25.1-241, not only did the circuit court have the jurisdiction to determine the ownership of the property as between the parties, but it was also required to do so. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in permitting the city to claim it already owned the easements or in determining the parties ownership rights as part of the condemnation proceedings. 3232 Page Ave. Condo. Unit Owners Ass'n v. City of Va. Beach, 284 Va. 639, 735 S.E.2d 672, 2012 Va. LEXIS 195 (2012). Former section did not authorize an arbitrary distribution of the fund, but meant that t he fund was to be distributed as to the court might seem proper, giving due regard to the rights of the parties as fixed by law or by contract. Manufacturers Trust Co. v. Roanoke Water Works Co., 172 Va. 242, 1 S.E.2d 318, 1939 Va. LEXIS 234 (1939). How rival claimants regarded.  In any condemnation case, where rival claims to a fund have been filed, each claimant is to be regarded as a plaintiff in respect to his own claim, and as a defen dant in respect to the claim of his rival. United States v. Hoblitzell, 2 F. Supp. 832, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1552 (D. Va. 1932). Claims are liberally construed.  Claims to a fund paid into court in a proceeding to expropriate forested lands should be liberally construed. United States v. Hoblitzell, 2 F. Supp. 832, 1932 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 1552 (D. Va. 1932). Determination of ownership.  When a city sought to quiet title to an asserted easement across a condominium associations beach property, the associations argument that the trial court had no jurisdiction due to the citys failure to enact an ordinance authorizing a quiet title action failed because (1) the statute did not apply to a quiet title suit, (2) the citys ordinance allowed any actions to protect the citys interest in the easement, and (3) the suit was, in fact, a condemnation action in which it was proper to determine the ownership of the subject land, under §§ 25.1-222 and 25.1-241. Lynnhaven Dunes Condo. Ass'n v. City of Va. Beach, 284 Va. 661, 733 S.E.2d 911, 2012 Va. LEXIS 194 (2012). The time at which holders of deeds of trust must establish their connection with the litigation by evidence is not fixed by the statute, which apparently leaves such determination to the discretion of the court. United States v. Parcel of Land, 54 F. Supp. 901, 1944 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2515 (D. Va. 1944). Until title vests in the condemnor, a lienholder has not been prejudiced by the condemna tion proceeding. Williams v. Fairfax County Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 227 Va. 309, 315 S.E.2d 202, 1984 Va. LEXIS 248 (1984). Rights of lienholders in any award do not accrue until the award is paid into court. If payment occurs, the second stage of the proceeding is commenced, and the court determines the rights and claims of all persons entitled to the fund or to any interest or share therein. Williams v. Fairfax County Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 227 Va. 309, 315 S.E.2d 202, 1984 Va. LEXIS 248 (1984). Where part of the condemned property is subject to a lease, the tenants rights shoul d be asserted and established in accord with the statute. May v. Dewey, 201 Va. 621, 112 S.E.2d 838, 1960 Va. LEXIS 138 (1960). The value of a lease should be determined by the court in another proceeding and deducte d from the amount of the award made to the landlord for the fee. Stanpark Realty Corp. v. City of Norfolk, 199 Va. 716, 101 S.E.2d 527, 1958 Va. LEXIS 117 (1958). The value of a lessees interest first should be determined and deducted from the award, and the balance then allocated to the landowner. Exxon Corp. v. M &amp; Q Holding Corp., 221 Va. 274, 269 S.E.2d 371, 1980 Va. LEXIS 245 (1980). The lessee is entitled to compensation for its removable improvements damaged by the condemnation. Exxon Corp. v. M &amp; Q Holding Corp., 221 Va. 274, 269 S.E.2d 371, 1980 Va. LEXIS 245 (1980). Franchis ee not entitled to compensation under statute.  The Virginia Condemnation Act did not entitle a franchisee to compensation from the purchase price paid to a franchisor by the state for leasehold property becaus e the code sections provided merely a procedural right once a condemnation proceeding had begun, and no condemnation proceedings had been initiated. Bajwa v. Sunoco, Inc., 320 F. Supp. 2d 454, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10187 (E.D. Va. 2004). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Condemnation proceeds were paid according to the lienholders priority.  However, a portion of the settlement earmarked as compensation for destroyed property was paid to the property owner, and not to the deed holder, despite their de ed of trust.

B.

At any time after payment into court of the sum ascertained in the report of the award of just compensation, notwithstanding the fact that another trial of the issue of just compensation has been ordered or an appeal has been taken from a final order upon the repor t as provided in subsection B of § 25.1-239, a party whose property or interest therein is to be taken or damaged may apply to the court, in the manner provided in this section, for the withdrawal pendente lite of all, or any portion of his pro rata s hare, of the amount deposited for his interest in the property to be taken or damaged, together with his pro rata share of any interest accrued thereon. B. If such app lication requests withdrawal of an amount in excess of 50 percent of such owners pro rata share of the amount deposited, exclusive of interest, the court may require the applicant, before withdrawing any of such excess, to give or file a bond with th e court for the return of the amount withdrawn that exceeds the amount to which the owner is entitled as finally determined in the condemnation proceeding, together with interest from the date of the withdrawal of the amount in excess of 50 percent of su ch owners pro rata share of such amount deposited. Such bond shall be with surety approved by the court or clerk, conditioned as required by law to the effect that they are bound to the petitioner in such amount as fixed by the court, but not to exce ed double the amount of such excess. Interest accruing prior to July 1, 1970, shall be paid at the rate of five percent annually; interest accruing thereafter and prior to July 1, 1981, shall be paid at the rate of six percent annually; interest accruing thereafter and prior to July 1, 2003, shall be paid at the rate of eight percent annually; and interest accruing thereafter shall be paid at the general accounts primary liquidity portfolio rate, compiled by the Department of the Treasury. C. Such applic ation shall be verified and shall set forth the owners interest in the property to be taken or damaged and request withdrawal of a stated amount. A copy of such application for withdrawal shall be served upon the petitioner or its counsel of record. No order permitting such withdrawal shall be entered until at least 21 days after service of such application upon the petitioner without its consent. Within such 21-day period the petitioner may object to such withdrawal by filing written objections the reto with the court on the grounds that the amount of, or the sureties upon the proposed bond are insufficient or that other persons are known or believed to have interests in such property. A copy of any such objections shall be served upon the applican t and such other persons as have appeared or answered, or their attorneys of record. D. If any pers on appears and objects to the proposed withdrawal, or if the petitioner so requests, the court shall determine the amount to be withdrawn, if any, and the persons entitled thereto. Upon such determination, no other person so served shall have any claim a gainst the petitioner to the extent of the amount so withdrawn. The court may follow the procedure prescribed in § 25.1-241 for the determination of any controversy among any claimants to the funds or to the ownership of the property subject to the co ndemnation, and may tax the costs thereof as therein provided.

Such interest shall be paid for the period from the time of such entry by the petitioner until the time the fund paid into court on account of the final award of just compensation to such owner is available for distribution. Interest accruing prior to July 1, 1970, shall be paid at the rate of five percent annually; interest accruing thereafter and prior to July 1, 1981, shall be paid at the rate of six percent annually; interest accruing thereafter and prior to July 1, 2003 , shall be paid at the rate of eight percent annually; and interest accruing thereafter shall be paid at not less than the judgment rate of interest as set forth in § 8.01-382.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Actual entry on property.  Former § 25-46.31 (b) (see now § 25.1-244 B) contemplates actual entry upon the property as a prerequisite to payment of interest. It is applied to a condem nor who has asked for the right of immediate entry and has established, to the satisfaction of the court, that immediate entry is necessary. City of Richmond v. Old Dominion Iron &amp; Steel Corp., 212 Va. 611, 186 S.E.2d 30, 1972 Va. LEXIS 218 (1972). Interest from time of entry.  Former § 25-46.31 (b) (see now § 25.1-244 B) provides for the payment of interest from the time of such entry. City of Richmond v. Old Dominion Iron &amp; Steel Corp., 212 Va. 611, 186 S.E.2d 30, 1972 Va. LEXIS 218 (1972). The phrase from the time of such entry refers to the time at which entry is auth orized, namely, upon such payment and giving of such bond. City of Richmond v. Old Dominion Iron &amp; Steel Corp., 212 Va. 611, 186 S.E.2d 30, 1972 Va. LEXIS 218 (1972). Permitting owner to retain possession of property rent-free and continue business operations.  Where the city has permitted the owner to retain possession of the property rent-free and to continue its business operations, the city has never exercised th e right pendente lite to enter into and take possession of the land as required before liability for interest may be imposed. City of Richmond v. Old Dominion Iron &amp; Steel Corp., 212 Va. 611, 186 S.E.2d 30, 1972 Va. LEXIS 218 (1972). Supersede as affects only the enforceability, not the finality, of an appealable order in a civil case and, consequently, it does not postpone the origin of the 30-day withdrawal time limit in a condemnation case. Board of Supvrs. v. Parsons, 245 Va. 489, 428 S.E.2d 905, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1252, 1993 Va. LEXIS 57 (1993). Expiration of condemnors right to withdraw eminent domain proceedings.  Reading the language of former § 25-46.34 (see now § 25.1-249) in conjunction with the definition of the term final order and the language of former § 25-46.34 (d) (see now § 25.1-244 D) requiring a trial court to enter a money judgment, one subject to levy by the land owner, when the condemnor has failed to pay for a period of 30 days after the time for noting an appeal, the condemnor s right to withdraw eminent domain proceedings expires upon the lapse of 30 days following entry of the final order upon a report of just compensation. At that time, if the condemnor has not exercised its right to note an appeal, the respective right s of the parties vest, title passes to the condemnor, and the landowner becomes entitled to payment of the award. Board of Supvrs. v. Parsons, 245 Va. 489, 428 S.E.2d 905, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1252, 1993 Va. LEXIS 57 (1993). Interest under former statute.  See VEPCO v. Call, 195 Va. 454, 78 S.E.2d 670, 1953 Va.

F. This sectio n is to be liberally construed to effect its purpose of ensuring that owners receive the full measure of just compensation to which they are constitutionally entitled, without that amount being reduced by the costs of asserting their constitutional right to just compensation.

CASE NOTES Trial court erred in making the county liable for interest from the time of the entry of the order until payment was made since the county did not assert any indications of taking or dominion over the landowners property until legal title passed, and former § 25-46.34 (b) (see now § 25.1-249) affords the condemnor 30 days after the trial court sets the final amount of the compensation award to accept or reject the compensation amount without any penalty and the county exercised its option to pay for the property at the set price within the 30-day time period; therefore, t here was no statutory or constitutional basis for the trial court to require the county to pay any interest on the compensation award.

Effect of suspension of order confirming award pending decision on appeal.  No sum had been finally ascertained by the court, so as to require the condemning party to pay the award into court, where the order of the court confirming the l ast award was suspended pending decision of the condemnors appeal to the Supreme Court from this order and a prior order setting aside the first award.

Chapter enacted to provide assurance of assistance to displaced persons.  The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. § 4601 et seq., by its terms binds only federal agencies; but a federal agency may not provide funds for state projects involving condemnation without first receiving satisfactory assurances that displaced persons will be given such relocation payments and assistance as are required to be provided by a F ederal agency under the act. In order to qualify for federal funds, therefore, Virginia adopted former Chapter 6 (§§ 25-235 et seq.) of Title 25 [see now Chapter 4 (§§ 25.1-400 et seq.) of Title 25.1].

Statutory and constitu tional rights separate.  Rights and benefits under former Chapter 6 (§§ 25-235 et seq.) of Title 25 [see now Chapter 4 (§§ 25.1-400 et seq.) of Title 25.1] are entirely separa te and distinct from the landowners constitutional right to just compensation and damages in a condemnation proceeding.

If a state agency acquires real property in connection with any programs or projects, such acquisition shall be conducted, to the greatest extent practicable, in accordance with the following provisions: 1. The s tate agency shall make every reasonable effort to acquire expeditiously real property by negotiation. 2. Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, and the owner or his designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during h is inspection of the property; however, the requirements of this subdivision shall not apply if the state agencys official who is responsible for the acquisition determines that the value of the property being acquired is less than $25,000, based on assessment records or other objective evidence. Whenever the value of the property being acquired is determined to be between $10,000 and $25,000, the state agency, at the time an offer is made initiating negotiations, shall disclose to the owner or his designated representative that the offer has been established based on assessment records or other objective evidence and not an appraisal and that he may request that an appraisal be prepared and used as the basis for establishing just compensation purs uant to this section. 3. Before making an offer to acquire or initiating any related negotiations for real property, the state agency shall establish an amount which it believes to be just compensation therefo r and shall make a prompt offer to acquire the property for the full amount so established. In no event shall such amount be less than the state agencys approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, if such an appraisal is required, o r the current assessed value of such property for real estate tax purposes, unless the property has physically changed in a material and substantial way since the current assessment date such that the real estate tax assessment no longer represents a fai r valuation of the property, when the entire parcel for which the assessment is made is to be acquired, whichever is greater. Any decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improveme nt for which such property is acquired, or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for such improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, shall be disregarded in determining the compe nsation for the property. The state agency concerned shall provide the owner of real property to be acquired with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount it established as just compensation and, if an appraisal is required or obt ained, such written statement and summary shall include a complete copy of all appraisals of the real property to be acquired that the state agency obtained prior to making an offer to acquire or initiating any related negotiations for the real property. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated. 4. No owner shall be required to surrender possession of real property before the state agency pays the agreed purchase price, or deposits with the state court in accordance with applicab le law, for the benefit of the owner, (i) an amount not less than the state agencys approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, if such an appraisal is required, or the current assessed value of such property for real estate tax pur poses, unless the property has physically changed in a material and substantial way since the current assessment date such that the real estate tax assessment no longer represents a fair valuation of the property, when the entire parcel for which the ass essment is made is to be acquired, whichever is greater, or (ii) the amount of the award of compensation in the condemnation proceeding for such property. 5. The construction or development of a public improvement shall be so scheduled that, to the greatest extent practicable, no person lawfully occupying real property shall be required to move from a dwelling, assuming a replacement dwelling will be available, or to move his business or farm operation, without at least 90-days written notice from the state agency, of the date by which such move is required. 6. If the state agency permits an owner or tenant to occupy the real property acquired on a rental basis for a short term for a period subject to termination by the state agency on a shor t notice, the amount of rent required shall not exceed the fair rental value of the property to a short-term occupier. 7. In no event shall the state agency either advance the time of condemnation, or defer negotiations or condemnation and the deposit of funds in court for the use of the owner, or take an y other action coercive in nature, in order to compel an agreement on the price to be paid for the property. 8. If any interest in real property is to be acquired by exercise of the power of eminent domain, the state agency shall institute formal condemnation proceedings. No state agency shall i ntentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his real property. 9. If the acquisition of only part of a property would leave its owner with an uneconomic remnant, the state agency concerned shall offer to acquire the entire property. 10. A person whose real property is being acquired in accordance with this article may, after the person has been fully informed of his right to receive just compensation for such prope rty, donate such property, and part thereof, any interest therein, or any compensation paid therefor to a state agency, as such person shall determine. B. The provisi ons of this section create no rights or liabilities and shall not affect the validity of any property acquisitions by purchase or condemnation. C. Nothing in this section shall make evidence of tax assessments admissible as proof of value in an eminent domain proceeding.
