OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Sc hool resource officers for the countys private schools.  The local board of supervisors may provide school resource officers for the countys private schools as well as the countys public schools. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Michael W. Taylor, Sheriff, Pittsylvania County, 13-042, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 60 (7/19/13). But see opinion 19-005, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS 26 (8/23/19), which states that to the extent this conclusion is inconsistent with that o f a prior opinion of the Attorney General, the conclusion of the prior opinion is overruled. A sheriff is not authorized to assign on-duty deputies to provide dedicated security for a private school, but a locality may adopt an ordinance that allows deput y sheriffs to engage in off-duty employment that occasionally requires the exercise of police powers. Then under such an ordinance, a private school may employ off-duty deputy sheriffs to provide security at the school, subject to rules as may be adopted by the locality or promulgated by the sheriff pursuant to § 15.2-1712.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Intentional unauthorized access and use of a criminal record.  Although a deputy and a sheriff (by way of respondeat superior) might have violated § 9.1-135 for an intentional unauthorized access and use of a plaintiff s criminal record, none of the defendants were allegedly charged with the responsibility of servicing and maintaining criminal background information; therefore, the pleas in bar and demurrers were sustained on that claim.

CASE NOTES Testimony regarding whether child should be returned to parent.  In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, it was not error to allow a former court appointed special advocate to testify whether she believed the child should be returned to the mother since such testimony did not intrude on the trial courts obligation to decide whether to terminate the mothers parental rights. Padilla v. Norfolk Division of Social Services, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 2 6, 1999) (decided under prior law). Trial court did not err in permitting the testimony of a court-appointed special advocate (CASA) for the children, regarding her opinion as to the childrens b est interests, as the CASA worker was not required to be reappointed by the circuit court after having been appointed by the juvenile court. Nelson v. Petersburg Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 72 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2005). Court appointed special advocate reports properly admitted.  Trial court did not err in admitting Court Appointed Special Advocate reports into evidence in a termination case. Seibert v. Alexandria Div. of Soc. Servs., 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 521 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 21, 2006). Trial court did not err in considering the CASA reports in a mothers termination of parental rights case as there was no evidence to show that CASA was reliev ed of its duty on appeal from the juvenile court to the circuit court. The guardian ad litem was involved in the termination of parental rights case; therefore, CASA was involved in the circuit court case, so its reports could be properly considered. Her nandez v. Chesterfield-Colonial Heights Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 221 (Va. Ct. App. May 12, 2009). Evidence regarding whether child should be returned to parent.  Trial court did not err in admitting, as evidence in a termination of parental rights proceeding, the court-appointed special advocates reports and their atta chments, which discussed what was best for the sons welfare, as statutory law permitted the court-appointed special advocate to submit such a report and permitted the trial court in considering it in determining whether the fathers parental right s should be terminated; accordingly, the fathers objection that the reports and attachment violated the hearsay rule had to be rejected.

Except as p rovided in subsection N, no cigarettes may be sold or offered for sale in the Commonwealth or offered for sale or sold to persons located in the Commonwealth unless: 1. The c igarettes have been tested in accordance with the test method and meet the performance standard specified in this section; 2. The manufacturer has filed a written certification in accordance with § 9.1-211; and 3. The cigarettes have been marked in accordance with § 9.1-212. B. The perform ance standard for cigarettes sold or offered for sale in the Commonwealth is stated in subdivision E 1. C. Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted in accordance with the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard E2187-04 Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes. The Director, in consultation with the State Fire Mars hal, may adopt a subsequent ASTM Standard Test Method for Measuring the Ignition Strength of Cigarettes on a finding that the subsequent method does not result in a change in the percentage of full-length burns exhibited by any tested cigarette when comp ared to the percentage of full-length burns the same cigarette would exhibit when tested in accordance with ASTM standard E2187-04 and the performance standard of this section. D. Testing of cigarettes shall be conducted on 10 layers of filter paper. E. 1. No more than 25 percent of the cigarettes tested in a test trial shall exhibit full- length burns. 2. Forty replicate tests shall comprise a complete test trial for each cigarette tested. F. The perform ance standard required by this section shall only be applied to a complete test trial. G. Written cer tifications shall be based upon testing conducted by a laboratory that has been accredited pursuant to Standard ISO/IEC 17025 of the International Organization for Standardization or other comparable accreditation standard required by the Director. H. Each labora tory that conducts tests in accordance with this section shall implement a quality control and quality assurance program that includes a procedure to determine the repeatability of the testing results. The repeatability value shall be no greater than 0.1 9. I. Each cigare tte listed in a certification that uses lowered permeability bands in the cigarette paper to achieve compliance with the performance standard of this section shall have at least two nominally identical bands on the paper surrounding the tobacco column. A t least one complete band shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. For a cigarette on which the bands are positioned by design, at least two bands shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end and 10 millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column. For an unfiltered cigarette, the two complete bands shall be located at least 15 millimeters from the lighting end and 10 millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column. J. If the Dire ctor determines that a cigarette cannot be tested in accordance with the test method required by this section, the manufacturer of the cigarette shall propose to the Director a test method and performance standard for that cigarette. The Director, in con sultation with the State Fire Marshal, may approve a test method and performance standard that the Director determines is equivalent to the requirements of this section, and the manufacturer may use that test method and performance standard for certifica tion in accordance with § 9.1-211. If the Director determines that another state has enacted reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards that include a test method and performance standard that are the same as those contained in this chapter, and the Director finds that the officials responsible for implementing those requirements have approved the proposed alternative test method and performance standard for a particular cigarette proposed by a manufacturer as meeting the reduced cigarette ignit ion propensity standards of that states law or regulation under a legal provision comparable to this section, then the Director shall authorize that manufacturer to employ the alternative test method and performance standard to certify that cigarette for sale in the Commonwealth, unless the Director demonstrates a reasonable basis why the alternative test should not be accepted under this chapter. All other applicable requirements of this section shall apply to the manufacturer. K. This sectio n does not require additional testing for cigarettes that are tested in a manner consistent with the requirements of this section for any other purpose. L. Each manufa cturer shall maintain copies of the reports of all tests conducted on all cigarettes offered for sale for a period of three years, and shall make copies of these reports available to the Director, State Fire Marshal, and Attorney General on written reque st.

Disabled pe rsons, eligible spouses, and eligible dependents shall be afforded continued health insurance coverage as provided in this section, the cost of which shall be paid by the nonparticipating employer to the Department of Human Resource Management or from th e Fund on behalf of a participating employer, as applicable. If any disabled person or eligible spouse is receiving the benefits described in this section and would otherwise qualify for the health insurance credit described in Chapter 14 (§ 51.1-1400 et seq.) of Title 51.1, the amount of such credit shall be deposited into the Line of Duty Death and Health Benefits Trust Fund or paid to the nonparticipating employer, as applicable, from the health insurance credit trust fund, in a manner prescribed by VRS. B. 1.

The Plans shall comply with all applicable federal a nd state laws and shall be modeled upon state employee health benefits program plans. Funding of the Plans reserves and contingency shall be provided through a line of credit, the amount of which shall be based on an actuarially determined estimate o f liabilities.

In the event that temporary health care insurance coverage is needed for disabled persons, eligible spouses, and eligible dependents during the period of transition into the LODA Healt h Benefits Plans, the Department of Human Resource Management is authorized to acquire and provide temporary transitional health insurance coverage. The type and source of the transitional health plans shall be within the sole discretion of the Departmen t of Human Resource Management.

CASE NOTES Eligibility.  Retired firefighter was not a disabled person under the Virginia Line of Duty Death and Disability Act, § 9.1-400 et seq., and thus not entitled to continued h ealth coverage under subsection B of § 9.1-401, where he was retired when he was determined to be physically incapacitated due to throat cancer, and his incapacity did not prevent the further performance of his duties as a firefighter because he no lo nger had firefighting duties to perform.

Acts 2016, c. 677, cl. 5 provides: That the provisions of this act shall become effective on July 1, 2017, except the provisions of the fourth enactment of th is act, which shall become effective on July 1, 2016. The 2006 amendments. The 2006 amendment by c. 878 inserted on or before December 31, 2005 in subsection A; inserted subsection B; and redesignated former subsection B as subse ction C. The 2016 amendments. The 2016 amendment by c. 677, effective July 1, 2017, substituted paid by the nonparticipating employer or from the Fund on behalf of a participating employer , as applicable for payable out of the general fund of the state treasury in subsections A through C; and made minor stylistic changes. CASE NOTES Award reversed.  Because the evidence presented by a surviving spouse failed to prove the required subsection A of § 9.1-402 condition precedent that the decedents performa nce of his law-enforcement duty was the direct or proximate cause of his death, and there was simply no nexus between a § 65.2-402 presumption of a statutory medical condition as a cause of death and whether the death was the proximate result of the p erformance of a duty, a $75,000 award to the spouse thereunder was reversed. But, she was entitled to $25,000 pursuant to subsection B of § 9.1-402, as well as an award of health insurance benefits. Commonwealth v. Barker, 275 Va. 529, 659 S.E.2d 502, 2008 Va. LEXIS 48 (2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction.  By its plain meaning, in the course of his employment as used in clause (i) of subsection C, means that the death occurred at some point during the time o f the decedents employment; thus, for a beneficiary to receive the $25,000 benefit, the decedents death must fall within one of the specified existing Virginia Code presumptions and have either (1) arisen out of and occurred during his or her emp loyment or (2) have occurred within five years from his or her date of retirement. Broyles v. Commonwealth ex rel. Moll, 99 Va. Cir. 381, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 137 (Chesapeake July 25, 2018). Death benefits properly denied.  Office of the Comptroller of the Commonwealth of Virginia did not err in denying a widow death benefits pursuant to the Line of Duty Act for the death of her husb and, a retired firefighter, because his death occurred due to lung cancer and ten years and seven months following his disability retirement. Broyles v. Commonwealth ex rel. Moll, 99 Va. Cir. 381, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 137 (Chesapeake July 25, 2018). § 9.1-402.1. Payments for burial expenses. Text It is the intent of the General Assembly that expeditious payments for burial expenses be made for deceased persons whose death is determined to be a direct and proxima te result of their performance in the line of duty as defined by the Line of Duty Act. Upon the approval of VRS, at the request of the family of a person who may be subject to the line of duty death benefits, payments shall be made to a funeral service p rovider for burial and transportation costs by the nonparticipating employer or from the Fund on behalf of a participating employer, as applicable. These payments would be advanced from the death benefit that would be due to the beneficiary of the deceas ed person if it is determined that the person qualifies for line of duty coverage. Expenses advanced under this provision shall not exceed the coverage amounts outlined in § 65.2-512. In the event a determination is made that the death is not subject to the line of duty benefits, VRS or other Virginia governmental retirement fund of which the deceased is a member will deduct from benefit payments otherwise due to be paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased payments previously paid for burial and rel ated transportation expenses and return such funds to the nonparticipating employer or to the Fund on behalf of a participating employer, as applicable.

CASE NOTES Violation of guarantees does not necessarily compel finding of due process violation.  Police departments violation of the Law-Enforcement Officers Procedural Guarantees does not necessarily compel a finding of a due process violation. Ricci o v. County of Fairfax, 907 F.2d 1459, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 11819 (4th Cir. 1990) (decided under prior law). Stat utory procedures exceed requirements of due process.  While this state law provides those to whom it applies with a property interest in employment, it also provides for more process than what the constitution would otherwise require and, for this reason, the specific procedures it establishes need not be complied with fully to satisfy federal due process. Mansoor v. County of Albemarle, 124 F. Supp. 2d 367, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18612 (W.D. Va. 2000) (decided under prior law). Deprivatio n of property interest without due process.  After police officers were suspended for statements about a female officers performance, and then resumed their duties, their claim for deprivation of a prope rty interest without due process survived; they sufficiently alleged that the chief of police was biased in bringing disciplinary charges against them as he was also a defendant in a separate suit by the female officer, thus rebutting the presumption tha t he acted impartially.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Where defendant was convicted of rape and malicious wounding, and as part of defendants sentence, defendant was requested to register with local law-enforceme nt officers as a sex offender pursuant to former § 19.2-298.1, and where former § 19.2-298.1 was enacted after the offenses occurred, the trial court did not violate defendants federal and state constitutional rights against the imposition of a n ex post facto law. Kitze v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 213, 475 S.E.2d 830, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 612 (1996), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 817, 118 S. Ct. 66, 139 L. Ed. 2d 28, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 4709 (1997) (decided under former § 19.2-298.1). Inmates challenge to the Virginia Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act (Sex Offender Act), § 9.1-900 et seq., was dismissed because the Sex Offender Act was civil in nature and did not violate the Ex Post Facto law and the protections against Double Jeopardy; the inmates due process rights were not violated because the only issue that could be asserted at a hearing would be a challenge t o the conviction, which was not contested, and the inmate did not have a protected liberty interest in precluding truthful information about his conviction being disseminated over the internet. Ballard v. Chief of FBI, No. 7:03cv00354, 2004 U.S. Dist. LE XIS 1095 (W.D. Va. Jan. 20, 2004). Imposing a more restrictive sex-offender classification for indecent liberties with a child than for carnal knowledge of a child did not violate equal protection because carnal knowledge can involve juvenile offenders, while indecent liberties is a crime committed only by adults, and the distinction is rationally related to the states legitimate interest in affording juveniles more leniency. A cruel-and-unusu al punishment claim also failed because sex-offender registration is not a punishment. United States v. Broadway, 791 Fed. Appx. 887, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 2691 (11th Cir. 2020). Purpose.  Sex offender registration requirement is not penal, and the General Assembly intended to facilitate law enforcement and protection of children. Kitze v. Commonwe alth, 23 Va. App. 213, 475 S.E.2d 830, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 612 (1996), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 817, 118 S. Ct. 66, 139 L. Ed. 2d 28, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 4709 (1997) (decided under former § 19.2-298.1). Where plaintiff, having been reclassified as a sexually violent offender and thus being required to be on the sex offender registration list for life, sued defend ant state police official alleging a procedural due process violation in connection with the reclassification and publicizing her status as a sexually violent offender on the registry without affording her a procedure through which to challenge that acti on, the claim failed because Conn. Dept of Pub. Safety v. Doe precluded such a claim; while the mothe r sought to distinguish the Connecticut statute from the Virginia statute, arguing that § 9.1-900, unlike Connecticuts statute, made an offenders dangerousness a material part of the statute, the cases were not distinguishable on that ground b ecause the United States Supreme Court had recognized that the Connecticut statute was likewise designed to protect its communities from sex offenders. Doe v. Va. Dep't of State Police, 713 F.3d 745, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 7403 (4th Cir. 2013), cert. denie d, 572 U.S. 1015, 134 S. Ct. 1538, 188 L. Ed. 2d 556, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 2190 (2014). It was the General Assemblys intent for the Virginia Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act to be civil and non-punitive in nature. Baugh v. Comm onwealth, 68 Va. App. 437, 809 S.E.2d 247, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Prosecutorial function and discret ion.  Trial court lacked authority under the separate branches of government of Va. Const., Art. VII, § 4 to enjoin the Commonwealths Attorney from prosecuting u nnamed defendants for their failure to abide by the reporting requirements of the sex offender registry pursuant to § 9.1-900 et seq., as such a decision was within the prosecutors executive function and sole discretion; the fact that there was a lawsuit pending as to whether they were required to report to the registry did not impede the prosecutors decision.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Statutes do not give trial courts discretion to determine eligibility to petition for removal from the registry; The language of the statute is unambiguous and pl ain: for Tier I offenders, only someone convicted of a single offense may petition the court no earlier than fifteen] years from the date of initial registration. Tuthill v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 550, 878 S.E.2d 41, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 480 (2 022). No ambiguity exists in the language of subsection (A), and therefore the courts apply its plain meaning; the plain meaning of the statutory language requires anyo ne convicted of multiple Tier I offenses to remain on the registry, regardless of the temporal proximity of the crimes. Tuthill v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 550, 878 S.E.2d 41, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 480 (2022). Reclassification of status.  Where plaintiff, having been reclassified as a sexually violent offender and thus being required to be on the sex offender registration list for life, sued defend ant state police official alleging a procedural due process violation in connection with the reclassification and publicizing her status as a sexually violent offender on the registry without affording her a procedure through which to challenge that acti on, the claim failed because Conn. Dept of Pub. Safety v. Doe precluded such a claim. Doe v. Va. Dep' t of State Police, 713 F.3d 745, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 7403 (4th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1015, 134 S. Ct. 1538, 188 L. Ed. 2d 556, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 2190 (2014). Petition for removal from sex offender registry denied.  Circuit court properly granted the Virginia State Polices motion to dismiss a sex offenders request to have her name and information removed from the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry because the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act provided specific procedural requirements for removal from the Registry that allowed no discretion to the State Police regarding such removal and did not implicate the Virginia Administrative Process Act in doing so, and the State Police could not grant the offenders ex parte request to be removed from the Registry without an order from a circuit court. Esposito v. Va. State Police, 7 4 Va. App. 130, 867 S.E.2d 59, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 1 (2022). Because appellant was convicted of two Tier I offenses, he was ineligible to petition for removal of his name from the Virginia Sex Offender Registry. Tuthill v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 550, 878 S.E.2d 41, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 480 (2022). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction.  General Assembly used the phrase initial registration to intend that the statute apply to the registrants first date of registration in the Sex Offend er Registry; a sex offender is required to re-register with the Registry on an annual basis, and the General Assembly included the word initial to have the statute apply to the first of the offenders registrations with the Registry. Miller v. Commonwealth, 88 Va. Cir. 177, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 17 (Fairfax County Apr. 14, 2014). Petiti on for removal from sex offender registry granted.  Petitioner met the statutorily proscribed fifteen year registration requirement to be removed from the Sex Offender Registry because his initial registration was complete in 1998 when he submitted all necessary documents for registration, even though the Department later agreed with petitioner that he was not required to register.

A certifyin g official shall (i) respond to requests for completion of certification forms received by the agency, as required by this section, and (ii) make information regarding the agencys procedures for certification requests publicly available for victims o f qualifying criminal activity and their representatives. B. Any person seeking completion of a certification form shall first submit a request for completion of the certification form to any certifying official for the certifying agency that detected, investigated, or prosecuted the criminal activity upon which the request is based. C. A request f or completion of a certification form under this section may be submitted by the victim of qualifying criminal activity or a representative of the person seeking the certification form. Such representative of the person may include an attorney, a license d clinical social worker, a guardian ad litem, or an employee of a crime victim and witness assistance program or a domestic violence or sexual assault services provider. D. Upon receiv ing a request for completion of a certification form, a certifying official shall provide a response to the request within 120 days. Within such time, the certifying official shall complete the certification except (i) if the person making the request fo r completion of the certification form is in federal immigration removal proceedings or detained, the certifying official shall complete and provide the certification form to the person no later than 21 business days after the request is received by the certifying agency; (ii) if the twenty-first birthdate of the applicants children or the eighteenth birthdate of the applicants sibling is within 120 days of the date of the request, the certifying official shall respond within 30 days; (iii) if t he persons children, parents, or siblings under clause (ii) would become ineligible for benefits under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p) and 1184(o) in less than 21 business days of receipt of the certification request, the certifying official shall complete and provide a certification form to the person within seven days; or (iv) a certifying official may extend the time period by which it must complete and provide the certification form to the person as required under this subsection upon written agreement wi th the person or persons representative. If the certifying official cannot determine whether the applicant is a victim of qualifying criminal activity or determines that the applicant does not qualify, the certifying official shall provide a written explanation to the person or the persons representative setting forth reasons why the available evidence does not support a finding that the person is a victim of qualifying criminal activity.Requests for expedited completion of a certification form under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) shall be affirmatively raised by the person or that persons representative in writing to the certifying agency and shall establish that the person is eligible for expedited review. E. A certifyin g official who issued an initial certification form shall complete and reissue a certification form within 90 business days of receiving a request from a victim to reissue the certification form. If the victim seeking recertification has a deadline to re spond to a request for evidence from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the certifying official shall complete and issue the form no later than 21 business days after the request is received by the certifying official. Requests for exped ited recertification shall be affirmatively raised by the victim or victims representative in writing and shall establish that the victim is eligible for expedited review. A certifying official may extend the deadline by which he will complete and re issue the certification form only upon written agreement with the victim or victims representative. F. Notwithstan ding any other provision of this section, a certifying officials completion of a certification form shall not be considered sufficient evidence that an applicant for a U or T visa has met all eligibility requirements for that visa, and completion of a certification form by a certifying official shall not be construed to guarantee that the victim will receive federal immigration relief. It is the exclusive responsibility of federal immigration officials to determine whether a person is eligible for a U or T visa. Completion of a certification form by a certifying official merely verifies factual information relevant to the federal immigration benefit sought, including information relevant for federal immigration officials to determine eligibility fo r a U or T visa. By completing a certification form, the certifying official attests that the information is true and correct to the best of the certifying officials knowledge. No provision in this chapter limits the manner in which a certifying offi cial or certifying agency may describe whether the person has cooperated or been helpful to the agency or provide any additional information the certifying official or certifying agency believes might be relevant to a federal immigration officers adj udication of a U or T visa application. If, after completion of a certification form, the certifying official later determines that the person was not the victim of qualifying criminal activity or the victim unreasonably refuses to assist in the investig ation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity of which he is a victim, the certifying official may notify United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in writing. G. A certifyin g official or agency receiving requests for completion of certification forms shall not disclose the immigration status of a victim or person requesting the certification form, except to comply with federal or state law or a legal process or if authorize d by the victim or person requesting the certification form.

A certifyin g agency or certifying official acting or failing to act in good faith in compliance with this chapter shall have immunity from civil or criminal liability that may otherwise occur as a result of so acting or failing to act, except for gross negligence o r willful or wanton misconduct. B. If a certif ying agency fails to respond within the statutory timeframes or refuses to certify that an applicant was a victim of qualifying criminal activity, the applicant may petition a circuit court to review the determination of the certifying agency within 30 d ays of such determination or within 30 days of the expiration of the statutory timeframe in subsection D. The circuit court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing on such petition within 30 days of the filing of the petition. Upon conducting a hearing and the circuit court being satisfied that the applicant having proven their eligibility for completion of a certification form by a preponderance of the evidence and the circuit court having found that the certifying agencys refusal to sign was unreason able, a circuit court judge may execute the certification form. In assessing the reasonableness of the certifying agencys decision or failure to respond, the circuit court may consider whether the applicant has complied with the terms of this section and whether circumstances exist that would justify a deferral of a decision including whether a certification would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation or prosecution or the safety of an individual, cause a suspect to flee or evade detection, r esult in the destruction of evidence, or the applicants cooperation is not complete.Upon finding that the certifying agency denied the application without a factual or legal justification, or failed to respond to the applicant, the circuit court shal l make an award of reasonable costs and attorney fees to a prevailing applicant. Such determination shall be without prejudice to any future proceeding premised upon a material change in circumstances. C. Any petitio n filed pursuant to subsection B, along with the record of all hearings and all other pleadings and papers filed, and orders entered in connection with such petition shall be kept under seal by the clerk unless otherwise ordered by the court. D. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter or diminish the duties and requirements of a law-enforcement officer, as defined in § 9.1-101, the attorney for the Commonwealth, or the Attorney General from disclosing exculpatory information to a defendant i n a criminal case.
