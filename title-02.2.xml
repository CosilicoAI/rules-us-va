In accordance with § 9-77.10 (now § 30-149), the Virginia Code Commission, in 1998, undertook a three-year recodification of Titles 2.1 and 9. Title 2.1 had last been recodified in 1966 and Title 9 had never been recodified. The Commissions draft of this revision, which was published as House Document 51 of the 2001 Session, was sent to the Governor and General Assembly in January, 2001. The revision, a s amended by the General Assembly, became Acts 2001, c. 844, effective October 1, 2001. Title 2.1 was rewritten primarily as new Title 2.2, with certain material now incorporated into Titles 6.1, 9.1, 17.1, 30, 37.1 and 51.1, and Title 9 was rewritte n primarily as new Title 9.1, with certain material now incorporated into Titles 3.1, 2.2, and 30. In addition, the Virginia Public Procurement Act, §§ 11-35 to 11-80, was rewritten as § 2.2-4300 et seq., and §§ 53.1-180 to 53.1-185.3, th e Comprehensive Community Corrections Act for Local-Responsible Offenders, was rewritten as § 9.1-173 to 9.1-183. In addition to revision by Acts 2001, c. 844, Titles 2.1 and 9, § 11-35 et seq. and § 53.1-183 [see now § 9.1-178] were also amended by other acts passe d at the 2001 Session. As required by § 9-77.11 (see new § 30-152), the Code Commission has incorporated the majority of these amendments into the new sections. Where appropriate, the historical citations to former sections have been added to corresponding new sections. The case notes appearing under new sections were decided under corresponding former sections or under prior law. For tables of corresponding former and new sections, see the tables in Volume 10. Acts 2001, c. 844, cl. 2, provides: That whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section or chapter of Title 2.1 or Title 9 or any other title of the Code of Virginia as such titles existed prior to October 1, 2001, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section or chapter of Title 2.2 or Title 9.1 or any other title of the Code and whenever any such former s ection or chapter is given a new number in Title 2.2 or Title 9.1 or any other title, all references to any such former section or chapter of Title 2.1 or Title 9 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, contents or portions thereof. Acts 2001, c. 844, cl. 3, provides: That the regulations of any department or agency affected by the revision of Title 2.1, Title 9 or such other titles in ef fect on the effective date of this act shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations adopted under this act. Acts 2001, c. 844, cl. 4, provides: That this title revision of Title 2.1 as Title 2.2 and Title 9 as Title 9.1 and the repeal of Chapter 7 (§ 11-35 et seq .) of Title 11 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any member of a board, council, committee or other appointed body referred to in Title 2.2 or Title 9.1 and each such officer and member shall continue to serve for the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 2.1, Title 9, or Chapter 7 (§ 11-35 et seq.) of Title 11.

The Virginia Department of Health is not a corporate citizen of the State, maint aining a separate identity from the State. Medicenters of Am., Inc. v. Virginia, 373 F. Supp. 305, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9329 (E.D. Va. 1974). Rather, it is merely an arm of the State, i.e., the States alter ego. Medice nters of Am., Inc. v. Virginia, 373 F. Supp. 305, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9329 (E.D. Va. 1974). And does not have ce rtain powers apart from State.  The Virginia Department of Health has not the power to raise capital, engage in other financial and contractual relationships, or sue and be sued, in its own righ t, as an entity separate and distinct from the State. Medicenters of Am., Inc. v. Virginia, 373 F. Supp. 305, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9329 (E.D. Va. 1974). Legislature cannot withhold from Attorney General the salary prescribed by law, nor can it delegate such power to the Auditor of Public Accounts (now Comptroller), and he may recover his salary by mandamus. Blair v. Marye, 80 Va. 485, 1885 Va. LEXIS 87 (1885). Attorney Generals salary not subject to attachment, detention for debt, etc.  The salary of the Attorney General is of constitutional grant, and of public official right, and the doctrine of offset cannot be applied to it. It is not liable to attachment, garnishment, nor assignment in bankruptcy, and upon principles of public policy it has absolute immunity from detention for debt or counterclaims. Blair v. Marye, 80 Va. 485, 1885 Va. LEXIS 87 (1885). But the State may re cover fees paid him by mistake.  The Commonwealth may recover from the Attorney General fees paid him by the Auditor of Public Accounts (now Comptroller) under the mistaken belief that he was ent itled thereto as part of his compensation.

As used in this section, unless the context requires otherwise:New job means employment of an indefinite dur ation, created as the direct result of the private investment, for which the firm pays the wages and standard fringe benefits for its employee, requiring a minimum of either (i) 35 hours of the employees time a week for the entire normal year of the firms operations, which normal year must consist of at least 48 weeks or (ii) 1,680 hours per year.Seasonal or temporary positions, positions created when a job function is shifted from an existing location in the Commonwealth to the location of the economic development project, positions with suppliers, and multiplier or spin-off jobs shall not qualify as new jobs. The term new job shall include positions with contractors provided that all requirements included within the definition of the term are met.New teleworking job means a new job that is held by a Virginia resident, for which the majority of the work is performed remotely, and that pays at least 1.2 times the Virginia minimum wage, as provided by the Virginia Minimum Wage Act (§ 40.1-28.8 et seq.). Prevailing average wage means that amount determined by the Virginia Employment Commission to be the average wage paid workers in the city or county of the Com monwealth where the economic development project is located. The prevailing average wage shall be determined without regard to any fringe benefits.Private investment means the private investment required under this section. B. There is cr eated the Commonwealths Development Opportunity Fund (the Fund) to be used by the Governor to attract economic development prospects and secure the expansion of existing industry in the Commonwealth. The Fund shall consist of any funds appropriated t o it by the general appropriation act and revenue from any other source, public or private. The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller, and any funds remaining in the Fund at the end of a biennium shall not revert to the general fund b ut shall remain in the Fund. Interest earned on the Fund shall be credited to the Fund. The Governor shall report to the Chairmen of the House Committees on Appropriations and Finance and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations as funds are aw arded in accordance with this section. C. Funds shall be awarded from the Fund by the Governor as grants or loans to political subdivisions. The criteria for making such grants or loans shall include (i) job creation, (ii) private capital investment, and (iii) anticipated additional state tax revenue expec ted to accrue to the state and affected localities as a result of the capital investment and jobs created. Loans shall be approved by the Governor and made in accordance with guidelines established by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership and app roved by the Comptroller. Loans shall be interest-free unless otherwise determined by the Governor and shall be repaid to the Fund. The Governor may establish the interest rate to be charged; otherwise, any interest charged shall be at market rates as de termined by the State Treasurer and shall be indicative of the duration of the loan. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership shall be responsible for monitoring repayment of such loans and reporting the receivables to the Comptroller as required.Be ginning with the five fiscal years from fiscal year 2006-2007 through fiscal year 2010-2011, and for every five fiscal years period thereafter, in general, no less than one-third of the moneys appropriated to the Fund in every such five-year period s hall be awarded to counties and cities having an annual average unemployment rate that is greater than the final statewide average unemployment rate for the calendar year that immediately precedes the calendar year of the award. However, if such one-thir d requirement will not be met because economic development prospects in such counties and cities are unable to fulfill the applicable minimum private investment and new jobs requirements set forth in this section, then any funds remaining in the Fund at the end of the five-year period that would have otherwise been awarded to such counties and cities shall be made available for awards in the next five fiscal years period. D. Funds may b e used for public and private utility extension or capacity development on and off site; public and private installation, extension, or capacity development of high-speed or broadband Internet access, whether on or off site; road, rail, or other transpor tation access costs beyond the funding capability of existing programs; site acquisition; grading, drainage, paving, and any other activity required to prepare a site for construction; construction or build-out of publicly or privately owned buildings; t raining; or grants or loans to an industrial development authority, housing and redevelopment authority, or other political subdivision for purposes directly relating to any of the foregoing. However, in no case shall funds from the Fund be used, directl y or indirectly, to pay or guarantee the payment for any rental, lease, license, or other contractual right to the use of any property.It shall be the policy of the Commonwealth that moneys in the Fund shall not be used for any economic development proje ct in which a business relocates or expands its operations in one or more Virginia localities and simultaneously closes its operations or substantially reduces the number of its employees in another Virginia locality, unless the procedures set forth in § 30-310 are followed. The Secretary of Commerce and Trade shall enforce this policy and for any exception thereto shall, pursuant to § 30-310, submit such projects to the MEI Project Approval Commission established pursuant to § 30-309. E. 1. a. Except as provided in this subdivision, no grant or loan shall be awarded from th e Fund unless the project involves a minimum private investment of $5 million and creates at least 50 new jobs for which the average wage, excluding fringe benefits, is no less than the prevailing average wage. For projects, including but not limited to projects involving emerging technologies, for which the average wage of the new jobs created, excluding fringe benefits, is at least twice the prevailing average wage for that locality or region, the Governor shall have the discretion to require no less than one-half the number of new jobs as set forth for that locality in this subdivision. b. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a, a grant or loan may be awarded from the Fund if the project involves a minimum private investment of $100 million and creates at l east 25 new jobs for which the average wage, excluding fringe benefits, is no less than the prevailing average wage. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1 a, in localities (i) with an annual unemployment rate for the most recent calendar year for which such data is available that is greater than the final statewide average unemployment rate for that calendar year or (ii) with a poverty rate for the most recent calendar year for which such data is available that exceeds the statewide average poverty rate for that year, a grant or loan may b e awarded from the Fund pursuant to subdivision 1 a if the project involves a minimum private investment of $2.5 million and creates at least 25 new jobs for which the average wage, excluding fringe benefits, is no less than 85 percent of the prevailing average wage. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions 1 a and 2, in localities (i) with an annual unemployment rate for the most recent calendar year for which such data is available that is greater than the final statewide average unemployment rate for that calendar year and (ii) with a poverty rate for the most recent calendar year for which such data is available that exceeds the statewide average poverty rate for that year, a grant or lo an may be awarded from the Fund pursuant to such subdivisions if the project involves a minimum private investment of $1.5 million and creates at least 15 new jobs for which the average wage, excluding fringe benefits, is no less than 85 percent of the p revailing average wage. 4. For projects that are eligible under subdivision 2 or 3, the average wage of the new jobs, excluding fringe benefits, shall be no less than 85 percent of the prevailing average wage. I n addition, for projects in such localities, the Governor may award a grant or loan for a project paying less than 85 percent of the prevailing average wage but still providing customary employee benefits, only after the Secretary of Commerce and Trade h as made a written finding that the economic circumstances in the area are sufficiently distressed (i.e., high unemployment or underemployment and negative economic forecasts) that assistance to the locality to attract the project is nonetheless justified . However, the minimum private investment and number of new jobs required to be created as set forth in this subsection shall still be a condition of eligibility for an award from the Fund. Such written finding shall promptly be provided to the chairs of the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations and the House Committee on Appropriations. 5. A business beneficiary may count new teleworking jobs toward the minimum number of new jobs required under subdivision 1, 2, or 3, if so permitted in the contract required by subdivisi on F 2. 6. The minimum private investment required under subdivision 1, 2, or 3 may be reduced or waived if at least 75 percent, measured against the minimum number of new jobs required, of jobs created by the business beneficiary are new teleworking jobs, if so permitted in the contract required by subdivision F 2.

GO VERNORS EXECUTIVE RE ORGANIZATION PLAN. NO VEMBER 25, 2011. The Commonwealth Competition Council was created in 1995 as independent advisory body within the executive branch with the goal of finding opportunities for privatization of state government functions. At the time, Virginia was on the cutting edge of privatization of government functions. Today, privatization is frequently discussed throughout government, and the Commonwealth Competition Council is often circumvented as vendors work directly with agencies and take advantage of the PPTA and PPEA processes. The Competition Council meets approximately once a year and, in recent years, has primarily monitored actions happening elsewhere in state government rather than taking the lead role on these efforts. The Commission on Government Reform and Restructuring recommended elimination of the Council in 2011. The Com monwealth Competition Council was created with a laudable goal of promoting privatization. In the years since, it has succeeded in making privatization a common theme in state government and has served its purpose. Elimination of the Council is now appro priate. The Interagency Dispute Resolution Council should be elimin ated, and the Department of Human Resource Management should be authorized to perform agency training seminars and educational programs on the use of dispute resolution proceedings. The Interagency Dispute Resolution Council was created in 1 992 to conduct training seminars, publish educational materials, and report on the use of dispute resolution. The Council is made up of state employees and citizens. Costs of staffing and administration of this board were estimated at almost $3,000 for F Y2011 despite being unfunded by the General Assembly and without offering travel reimbursements to members. Many seats remain unfilled and participation is low. While Alternative Dispute Resolution is an important tool that can greatly increase efficienc ies and effectiveness across state government, the Council is not necessary to promote its use. It will be more efficient for the Department of Human Resource Management to manage this function directly. The Commission on Government Reform and Restructuring recom mended elimination of the Council in 2011. The Virginia Public Buildings Board should be eliminated an d the responsibility to assist and advise the Governor and the Department of General Services in the preparation and maintenance of a long-range site plan at the seat of government should be transferred to the Capitol Square Preservation Council. Virginia Public Buildings Board is an advisory board made u p of legislators, citizens, and the Director of the Department of General Services. The Board advises on the preparation and maintenance of a long-range site plan at the seat of government, and in the determination of the need for the acquisition of land , buildings and improvements at the seat of government. The responsibilities of the Board overlap with the Capitol Square Preservation Council, a legislative branch body, which develops and reviews plans for architectural, historical, archeological and l andscape maintenance and enhancements in Capitol Square. The Boards responsibility for advising on long-range planning should transfer to the Capitol Square Preservation Council. The Board has met four times in the last seven years. The Commission on Government Reform and Restructuring recom mended elimination of the Council in 2011. The Virginia Council on Human Resources should be eliminate d, and the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management should be statutorily empowered to convene ad hoc working groups to address issues regarding the state workforce. The Virginia Council on Human Resources was created as a st atutory means of communicating employee issues and feedback across the enterprise of state government. Funding for the costs of expenses is incurred by the Department of Human Resource Management as mandated by Code. In order to get feedback on specific issues related to state employees, the Department of Human Resource Management already forms state employee feedback workgroups on issues on an as-needed basis. The functions of the Council can be performed through ad hoc working groups convened by the D epartment of Human Resource Management. The Commission on Government Reform and Restructuring recommended elimination of the Council in 2011. The Virginia Council on Human Resources should be eliminated, and the Department of Human Resource Management sh ould be statutorily empowered to exercise this power and responsibility. The Department of Employment Dispute Resolutions primar y function is to administer the state personnel grievance process. The Department (DEDR) has eight employees and a budget of over $1,000,000. The Department of Human Resource Management is also involved in the employment grievance process. Merger of the two agencies would result in operational efficiencies and cost savings. In order to preserve the integrity and legal standing of the employment dispute process, the new office within the Department of Human Resource Management will have a level of indepe ndence to protect the dispute hearing process. Governor Tim Kaine recommended this merger in 2009 in his i ntroduced budget. The functions performed by the Human Rights Council should be transferred to the Department of Law (Office of the Attorney General), and the Council should be eliminated. The Human Rights Council is an agency of the Commonwealth t hat accepts complaints of discrimination from the citizens of the Commonwealth and seeks to resolve those complaints. The agency has a budget of approximately $400,000 and a staff of four. The Office of the Attorney General is already involved in the wor k of the Council. For example, the Council can only seek prevention of or relief from an alleged unlawful discriminatory practice with the approval of the Attorney General and Assistant Attorneys General review determinations to ensure they are compliant with the law. The Council does not need to be a stand-alone agency. The Office of the Attorney General can take on this respons...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-133"><akn:num>§ 2.2-133</akn:num><akn:heading>Effect on other laws, pending legal proceedings, and unexpended appropriations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Annotations CASE NOTES Office of Secret ary of Commonwealth not abolished.  So much of Acts 1927, p. 105, as provided for the abolition of the office of Secretary of the Commonwealth was unconstitutional, and Acts 1930, p. 82, was inconsi stent with any intent to abolish the office. Nor did the fact that for several years after 1930 the General Assembly made no direct appropriation to the office evidence any intent to abolish it by implication pursuant to the power given by § 80 of the Virginia Constitution of 1902.

Duties of circuit court clerks.  While a clerk of court is governed by the federal and state constitutions, he has no authority to deem unconstitutional a statute imposing on him a ministerial du ty. The duties of a clerk of court are ministerial, and decisions relating to constitutionality are discretionary, not ministerial. Nevertheless, a clerk who in good faith performs his ministerial duties in the absence of clear judicial authority directing him not to do so has not engaged in malfeasance.

LEXIS 241 (1984) (decided under former Title 2.1). Attorney General represents state in criminal appeals.  Appellate court lacked jurisdiction over defendants appeal of his driving under the influence conviction because defendants notice of appeal listed the st ate as the prosecuting body when the city was prosecuting body, and defendant thus failed to join an indispensable party; the trial courts order, entered while the appeal was pending, purporting to show that the state was the prosecuting body, was im proper because defendants counsel failed to notify the Attorney General of the trial courts hearing. The Attorney General represented the state in all criminal appeals and had already participated on behalf of the state in the case. Roberson v. City of Va. Beach, 53 Va.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Auth ority of Attorney General to reduce or eliminate lien.  Under the authority of this section, the Attorney General may reduce or eliminate a claim of the Commonwealth, and the amount of the Commonwealths lien create d by § 8.01-66.9 would be reduced or eliminated correspondingly. Commonwealth v. Huynh, 262 Va. 165, 546 S.E.2d 677, 2001 Va. LEXIS 68 (2001). Amendment to § 8.01-66.9 vested judge with authority vested in department head.  The effect of the 1981 amendment of § 8.01-66.9 was to vest in the trial judge, in the circumstances specified by the statute, the authority, otherwise vested in the Attorney General, the Governor, and the appropriate department head by former § 2.1-127 (now § 2.2-514), to compromise and reduce the Commonwealths lien. The purpose of the amendment was to reduce expense and delay, to avoid litigation, and to promote settlements. Commonwealth v. Smith, 239 Va. 108, 387 S.E.2d 767, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1056, 1990 Va. LEXIS 20 (1990). Offer of judgment was no t ultra vires contract.  Where the amount in dispute in claim was well under $50,000, and the Commonwealth had not argued that the head of the institution involved did not approve the set tlement, the assistant Attorney General involved had the statutory authority to enter into this settlement, and her offer of judgment was not an ultra vires contract that was void ab initio. Said v. Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College, 130 F.R.D. 60, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2406 (E.D. Va. 1990). First Amendment retaliation claim.  Where an employee was working as an Assistant Attorney General when the employee was forced to resign after the employee denied posting a comment on a newspaper s website that criticized the Attorney General and supported an opponent in a gubernatorial election, the employees First Amendment retaliation claims failed because the correct application of the Elrod-Branti exception was not clearly establishe d; also, application of the Elrod-Branti exception showed that Assistant Attorneys General in positions such as the employees could be fired for their political affiliation. Vanterpool v. Cuccinelli, 998 F. Supp. 2d 451, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16428 ( E.D. Va. 2014). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Authority to reduce Medicaid lien and apportion settlement proceeds.  In a medical malpractice case, where the patients attorney had made a good faith effort to negotiate a compromise, the court had the authority to, and did red uce the amount of Medicaid lien and apportion the balance of the settlement recovery between the patient and his attorney. Diaz v. Arlington Anesthesia, Inc., 56 Va. Cir. 329, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 466 (Arlington County Aug. 9, 2001). Department of Transportations motion for judgment did not impair contractors rights.  Department of Transportation could recover on a performance bond it had on a project to be completed by its contractor, as: (1) nothing within a contract, or the resulting settlement, served as an alteration discharging the surety; (2) its settlement with its contractor reduced the amount the contractor owed, which benefitted the surety; and (3) the contractor retained its rights under § 33.1-386 [see now § 33.2-1101]. Commonwealth, DOT v. Selective Ins. Co., 68 Va. Cir. 451, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 225 (Loudoun County Sept. 12, 2005).

It is the p olicy of the Commonwealth of Virginia to provide for equal opportunities throughout the Commonwealth to all its citizens, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, sexual orientat ion, gender identity, disability, familial status, marital status, or status as a veteran and, to that end, to prohibit discriminatory practices with respect to employment, places of public accommodation, including educational institutions, and real esta te transactions by any person or group of persons, including state and local law-enforcement agencies, in order that the peace, health, safety, prosperity, and general welfare of all the inhabitants of the Commonwealth be protected and ensured. B. To carry ou t this policy, there is created in the Department of Law an Office of Civil Rights (the Office ) to assist in the prevention of and relief from alleged unlawful discriminatory practices.

All right, title, and interest in and to any real or tangible personal property vested in the Human Rights Council as of July 1, 2012, shall be transferred to and taken as standing in the name of the Division of Human Rights of the Department of Law. Acts 2012, cc. 803 and 835, cl. 16 provides: That the Governor may transfer an appropriation or any portion thereof within a state agency established, abolish ed, or otherwise affected by the provisions of the 13th enactment of this act, or from one such agency to another, to support the changes in organization or responsibility resulting from or required by the provisions of the 13th enactment of this act, pr ovided that any such transfer shall be limited to salary and fringe benefits for any personnel transferred and reasonable administrative overhead and costs. Acts 2012, cc. 803 and 835, cl. 17 provides: That all rules and regulations adopted by the Human Rights Council that are in effect as of July 1, 2012, shall r emain in full force and effect until altered, amended, or rescinded by the Division of Human Rights of the Department of Law. Acts 2020, c. 901, cl. 1 provides: That the Division of Human Rights of the Department of Law (the Division) is directed to develop recommendations regarding the type of information about businesses and their employees and the accompanying methodology that would be required for the Division to proactively enforce the provisions of § 40.1-28.6 of the Code of Virginia requiring equal pay of similarly situate d employees irrespective of sex.

CASE NOTES The Virginia Council on Human Rights is a qualifying deferral agency for purposes of Title VII because it has the authority to seek relief from unlawful employment practices, and therefore, discrimination claims filed with the EEOC in Virginia are subject to a longer limitations period than would apply if Virginia had no deferral agency. Tinsley v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 155 F.3d 435, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 21407 (4th Cir. 1998) (decided under prior law). Notice not required.  While the council is given the authority to investigate and make findings and recommendations regarding complaints of discrimination, it does not have the power t o grant or seek relief from such practice as required by 42 U.S.C. § 2000a-3(c). Therefore, because no local or state law of the type contemplated by § 2000a-3(c) exists in Virginia, plaintiff was not required to provide notice as a prerequ isite to filing suit under the federal statute.

CASE NOTES Authority of director.  Circuit court did not err in refusing to reverse a decision by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management upholding an employees termination because the director was permitted to assign tasks to agency personnel to carry out the directors duties; the tripartite review procedure had been undisturbed because the employee received a review of the facts by the hearing officer, a review of the policy by the department, and a review of the law by the court of appeals.

In enacting this chapter, the General Assembly employs its legislative authority to establish that the people of Virginia, acting through their elected officials in Virginia government, have the responsibility and authority to establish policy in and for Virginia p ertaining to federal programs mandated in federal statutes. B. The intent of the General Assembly is to assure the primacy of the Commonwealths legal and political authority to implement in and for Virginia the policy mandated by federal statutes and to vigorously challenge and scrutinize the extent and scope of authority asserted by federal executive branch agencies when federal agency actions and interpretations are inconsistent with Virginia policy and exceed the lawful authority of the federal government or are not required by federal law. C. In this con nection the General Assembly finds and declares that: 1. The p ower to implement federal policies in and for Virginia is central to the ability of the people of Virginia to govern themselves under a federal system of government; and 2. Any implementation of federal policies in and for Virginia by federal executive branch agencies that is contrary to fundamental notions of federalism and self-determination must be ide ntified and countered. D. The General Assembly further finds and declares that: 1. There is an urgent need to modify federal mandates because the implementation of these mandates by the Commonwealth wastes the financial resources of local governments, the citizens of Virginia and the Commonwealth and does not properly respect the rights of the Commonwealth, local governments, and citizens. 2. The state government has an obligation to the public to do what is necessary to protect the rights of Virginia citizens under federal law while minimizing or eliminating any additional cost or regulatory burden on any citizen of the Commonwealth. 3. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution directs that powers that are not delegated to the United States are reserved to the states or to the people. Virginia, as one of t he sovereign states within the Union, has constitutional authority to enact laws protecting the environment of the Commonwealth and safeguarding the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Virginia. However, this authority has too often bee n ignored by the federal government, as the federal government has intruded more and more into areas that must be left to the states. It is essential that the dilution of the authority of state and local governments be halted and that the provisions of t he Tenth Amendment be accorded proper respect. 4. Current federal regulatory mandates, as reflected in federal administrative regulations, guidelines, and policies, often do not reflect the realities of Virginia and federal regulators frequently do not understand the needs and priorities of the citizens of Virginia. 5. The citizens of the Commonwealth can create and wish to create innovative solutions to Virginias problems, but the current manner in which legal challenges to state policies and fe deral programmatic substitutions of state programs are handled does not allow the Commonwealth the flexibility it needs. It is not possible for the Commonwealth of Virginia to effectively and efficiently implement the provisions of federal statutes unles s the burden to prove the insufficiency of the Commonwealths efforts to implement federal requirements is shifted to the person or agency who asserts such insufficiency. 6. The provisions of this chapter will better balance the exercise of the powers of the federal government and the powers reserved to the states. In addition, the application of this chap ter ultimately will bring about greater protection for the Commonwealth and the nation because it will direct the Commonwealth to implement federal statutes at the least possible cost, thereby freeing more moneys for other needs. 7. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that federal mandates implemented in Virginia comply with state policy as established by the General Assembly.

All systems so developed shall require the approval and certification of th e Auditor of Public Accounts that they are adequate for purposes of audit and financial control.As to the collection of debts owed, the system of bookkeeping and accounting shall permit any state agency to refrain from collecting any amount owed to it if the administrative cost of collection likely would exceed the amount owed. The Comptroller shall develop other policies and procedures to reduce the costs of collecting debts owed to state agencies.As to the operation of merchandising activities, or oth er centralized support services provided by one state agency to other state agencies for which charges are made, the system of accounting shall be designed to reflect all charges properly allocable so that the net profit or loss therefrom shall be reflec ted. In the furtherance of this objective the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission may direct the Comptroller to establish under such terms and conditions as they may determine internal service fund accounts on his books and record therein the r eceipts and expenditures of these several functions. The Comptroller shall provide the agencies responsible for the operations of these functions with working capital advances with which to finance the operations pursuant to appropriations made by law. T he Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission may direct the Comptroller to transfer excess fund balances to the general fund or to remove from his books internal service fund accounts that are no longer considered appropriate and record the necessary transfer of funds.Unit prices of services rendered by internal service funds shall be fixed so that all costs properly allocable to providing the service shall be fully recoverable. C. The Comptro ller shall maintain a full explanation of all systems of accounting devised and adopted in furtherance of this section, but no copyright system shall be adopted that shall entail additional cost upon the Commonwealth by reason of such copyright. The syst ems of accounting shall be communicated by the Comptroller to the officials affected thereby, and he shall as soon as possible instruct the officials as to the systems of accounting. D. Should any of the state offices, departments, boards, commissions, agencies, or institutions refuse or neglect to adopt the systems of accounting developed by the Comptroller, then upon suit of the Attorney General a writ of mandamus will lie to the Supreme Court t o compel the adoption. It shall be the duty of the Attorney General to promptly institute such suit in any such case. History History. 1975, c. 323, § 2.1-196.1; 1976, c. 533; 1984, c. 612; 2001, c . 844; 2006, c. 340.

Ogden, 226 Va. 234, 307 S.E.2d 891, 1983 Va. LEXIS 311 (1983). Former § 14.1-52 (see now § 15.2-1636.9) and this section clearly speak to the same subject and are in conflict. To allow the plaintiff to sue under the general statute would render the specific statute meaningless. Thus, former § 14.1-52 (see now § 15.2-1636.9) would prevail in plaintiffs case and act to deny her any due process remedy. The defendants argument that the plaintiff had a state procedure in which to seek a remedy and that their defense of sovereign immunity did not deny due process did not, as a result, apply to the case because the plaintiff did not hav e an opportunity to raise her salary claims in state court. Brewster v. Pike, 608 F. Supp. 1163, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19897 (D. Va. 1985), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 788 F.2d 985, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 23844 (4th Cir. 1986). This section and former §§ 8-38 (9), 8-40 and 8-752 dealt with claims payable out of the state treasury in pursuance of appropriations made by law. Hence, these sections were not applicable to a claim against a tunnel district which would not have been payable out of the state treasury. Morris v. Elizabeth River Tunnel Dist., 203 Va. 196, 123 S.E.2d 398, 1962 Va. LEXIS 127 (1962). Procurement act prevails ove r this section.  The procurement act (see § 2.2-4300 et seq.) is a specific statute relating to the acquisition of services by public bodies and prevails over the more general statutes relating to the presentation of pecuniary claims against the commonwealth, such as those found in this section. Dr. William E.S. Flory Small Bus. Dev. Ctr., Inc. v. Commonwealth, 261 Va. 230, 541 S.E.2d 915, 2001 Va. LEXIS 39 (2001). Quasi-contractual claims barred.  Neither this section nor § 8.01-192 establishes a claimants right to lodge a claim against the sovereign or the sovereigns liability for claims based o n quasi-contract, quantum meruit and contract implied in law. Regardless of the requirements of the procurement act, a claimant cannot recover against the commonwealth on these theories in the absence of a statute abrogating the commonwealths soverei gn immunity.

Claim presentation.  Professors breach of contract claim against a state university and its provost for failure to reappoint him as department chair was barred by the Eleventh Ame ndment and the university, as a branch of the state, did not waive its sovereign immunity to such suit because the professor failed to comply with the procedures set forth in § 2.2-814 for pursuit of a pecuniary claim against the Commonwealth. Amaram v. Va. State Univ., 476 F. Supp. 2d 535, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15389 (E.D. Va. 2007), aff'd, 261 Fed. Appx. 552, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 224 (4th Cir. 2008). Plaintiff employee could not state a claim for wrongful termination or breach of contract because he never presented his pecuniary claim to the president of Unive rsity of Virginia (the president was the head of the institution of the Commonwealth responsible for the alleged act giving rise to the employees claim). Cominelli v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 589 F. Supp. 2d 706, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9 9428 (W.D. Va. 2008), aff'd, 362 Fed. Appx. 359, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 1562 (4th Cir. 2010). University employees wrongful termination in breach of contract claim against the university was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim because the e mployee failed to present a pecuniary claim to the President of the University, as required by § 2.2-814. Cominelli v. Rector &amp; Bd. of Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 362 Fed. Appx. 359, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 1562 (4th Cir. 2010). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Claim presentation.  Although a student alleged fraud, a loss of property, and an actual contract, and the Commonwealth waived its sovereign immunity, a community college was not an i ndependent legal entity and the student failed to comply with the procedures for presenting a contract claim against the Commonwealth; therefore, sovereign immunity did not bar the students tort claim, but did bar the students contract claim. Gof f v. J. Sargeant Reynolds Cmty. College, 68 Va. Cir. 382, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 245 (Richmond Aug. 16, 2005). Universitys plea in bar was overruled as the developers complied with the basic statutory requirements for filing a pecuniary claim against the Commonwealth o f Virginia; while a demand failed to make a demand for damages, an affiant averred that the developers discussed their damages claims with the universitys president, who disallowed the claims. The developers motion to amend their complaint to add the Virginia Comptroller as a necessary party was granted. Geographic Network Affiliates-International, Inc. v. Enter. for Empowerment Found., 69 Va. Cir. 428, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 94 (Norfolk Jan. 12, 2006). Students claims against the Commonwealth for the negligence of its employees did not fail, even though the students did not give a § 2.2-814 notice as § 2.2-814 was inapplicable since the Virginia Tort Claims Act, specifically § 8.01-195.6 contained its own notice provision. Long v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 78 (Norfolk Apr. 13, 2007).

The Departm ent shall identify real property assets that are surplus to the current and reasonably anticipated future needs of the Commonwealth and may dispose of surplus assets as provided in this section, except when a department, agency or institution notifies th e Department of a need for property that has been declared surplus, and the Department finds that stated need to be valid and best satisfied by the use of the property. B. After it de termines the property to be surplus to the needs of the Commonwealth and that such property should be sold, the Department shall request the written opinion of the Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources as to whether the property is a significant co mponent of the Commonwealths natural or historic resources, and if so how those resources should be protected in the sale of the property. The Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources shall provide this review within 15 business days of receipt of full information from the Department. C. Upon receip t of the Secretarys review under subsection B and prior to offering the surplus property for sale to the public, the Department shall notify the chief administrative officer of the locality within which the property is located as well as any economic development entity for such locality of the pending disposition of such property. The chief administrative officer or local economic development entity shall have up to 180 days from the date of such notification to submit a proposal to the Department f or the use by the locality or the local economic development entity of such property in conjunction with a bona fide economic development activity. The Department shall review such proposal, and if the Department determines that such proposal is viable a nd could benefit the Commonwealth, the Department may negotiate with the chief administrative officer or the local economic development entity for the sale of such property to the locality or economic development entity. If no agreement is reached betwee n the Department and the chief administrative officer or the local economic development entity for the sale of the property, or if no proposal for the use of the property is submitted to the Department by the chief administrative officer or the local eco nomic development entity within 180 days of notification of the pending disposition of the property, the Department, with the prior, written approval of the Governor, may proceed to dispose of the property as provided in this section. D. If the surp lus property is not disposed of pursuant to subsection C, the sale shall be by public auction, or sealed bids, or by marketing through one or more real estate brokers licensed by the Commonwealth. Notice of the date, time and place of sale, if by public auction or sealed bids shall be given by advertisement in at least one newspaper published and having general circulation in the county or city in which the property to be sold is located and be posted on the Departments website. At least 30 days sha ll elapse between publication of the notice and the auction or the date on which sealed bids will be opened. E. The Depar tment may reject any and all bids or offers when, in the opinion of the Department, the price is inadequate in relation to the value of the property, the proposed terms are unacceptable, or if a need has been found for the property. F. In lieu o f the sale of any such property, or in the event the Department determines there is space within a building owned by the Commonwealth or any space leased by the Commonwealth in excess of current and reasonably anticipated needs, the Department may, with the approval of the Governor, lease or sublease such property or space to any responsible person, firm or corporation on such terms as shall be approved by the Governor, provided, however, that the authority herein to sublease space leased by the Commonw ealth shall be subject to the terms of the original lease. The Department may with the approval of the Governor permit charitable organizations exempt from taxation under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that provide addiction recovery service s to lease or sublease such property or space at cost and on such terms as shall be approved by the Governor, provided such use is deemed appropriate. The Department shall post reports from the Commonwealths statewide electronic procurement system, known as eVA, on the Departments website. The report shall inc lude, at a minimum, current leasing opportunities and sales of surplus real property posted on the eVAs Virginia Business Opportunities website. Such reports shall also be made available by electronic subscription. The provisions of this section requ iring disposition of property through the medium of sealed bids, public auction, or marketing through licensed real estate brokers shall not apply to any lease thereof, although such procedures may be followed in the discretion of the Department. G. The deed, lease, or sublease conveying the property or excess space shall be executed in the name of the Commonwealth and shall be in a form approved by the Attorney General. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary and notwithstanding how title to the property wa s acquired, the deed or lease may be executed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Director of the Department or his designee, and such action shall not create a cloud on the title to the property. In the event that the Department determines that a boundary line of a surplus property requires adjustment, the Department may work with the adjacent landowner to adjus t the boundary line and to transfer property to, or acquire property from, such adjacent landowner. In the event the Department determines that granting or accepting an easement over surplus property or the property of the adjacent landowner would facili tate the transfer of the surplus property, the Department may enter into any such easement on behalf of the department, agency, or institution in possession or control of the property, provided, however, that any such easement shall be in a form approved by the Attorney General and subject to the written approval of the Governor. The terms of the sale, lease, or sublease shall be subject to the written approval of the Governor. H. An except ion to sale by sealed bids, public auction, or listing the property with a licensed real estate broker may be granted by the Governor if the property is landlocked and inaccessible from a public road or highway. In such cases, the Department shall notify all adjacent landowners of the Commonwealths desire to dispose of the property. After the notice has been given, the Department may begin negotiations for the sale of the property with each interested adjacent landowner. The Department, with the app roval of the Governor, may accept any offer that it deems to be fair and adequate consideration for the property. In all cases, the offer shall be the best offer made by any adjacent landowner. The terms of all negotiations shall be public information. I. Subject t o any law to the contrary, 50 percent of the proceeds from all sales or leases, or from the conveyance of any interest in property under the provisions of this article, above the costs of the transaction, which costs shall include fees or commissions, if any, negotiated with and paid to auctioneers or real estate brokers, shall be paid into the State Park Acquisition and Development Fund, so long as the sales or leases pertain to general fund agencies or the property involved was originally acquired thr ough the general fund, except as provided in Chapter 180 of the Acts of Assembly of 1966. The remaining 50 percent of proceeds involving general fund sales or leases, less a pro rata share of any costs of the transactions, shall be deposited in the gener al fund of the state treasury. The Department of Planning and Budget shall develop guidelines that allow, with the approval of the Governor, any portion of the deposit in the general fund to be credited to the agency, department or institution having con trol of the property at the time it was determined surplus to the Commonwealths needs. Any amounts so credited to an agency, department or institution may be used, upon appropriation, to supplement maintenance reserve funds or capital project appropr iations, or for the acquisition, construction or improvement of real property or facilities. Net proceeds from sales or leases of special fund agency properties or property acquired through a gift for a specific purpose shall be retained by the agency or used in accordance with the original terms of the gift. Notwithstanding the foregoing, income from leases or subleases above the cost of the transaction shall first be applied to rent under the original lease and to the cost of maintenance and operation of the property. The remaining funds shall be distributed as provided herein. J. When the Department deems it to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth, it may, with the approval of the Governor, authorize the department, institution or agency in possession or control of the property to dispose of surplus property in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.

By Octob er 1, 2022, the Department shall identify a publicly available total cost of ownership calculator that will be used to assess and compare the total cost to purchase, own, lease, and operate light-duty internal combustion-engine vehicles (ICEVs) versus co mparable electric vehicles (EVs). Beginning on January 1, 2023, the Department and all agencies of the Commonwealth shall utilize the calculator prior to purchasing or leasing any light-duty vehicles and shall purchase or lease an EV unless the calculato r clearly indicates that purchasing or leasing an ICEV has a lower cost of ownership. 1. Th e calculator shall, at a minimum, account for the vehicles make, model, and age; the average miles traveled per year for similarly used vehicles; the expected life expectancy of the vehicle and average annual depreciation; the upfront and annual cost s of purchasing such vehicle and all other costs of vehicle ownership or lease; and all costs the agency must incur to add chargers or other fueling facilities to support such vehicles. The calculator shall be updated at least annually to account for upd ates in information, including information on the latest light-duty vehicle models available. 2. The Department shall make the calculator available to all state and local public bodies and transit agencies. The Department shall also provide technical assistance to such public bodies utilizing the calculator upon request.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. Authority of grievance panel to promote should be left to General Assembly.  The determination whether a grievance panel has the authority to promote clearly is best left to the wisdom of the General Assembly and the state officials charge d with the administration of the grievance procedure. Therefore, the board was without authority to award a policeman, denied promotion, a retroactive promotion and compensation for back pay. Jones v. Carter, 234 Va. 621, 363 S.E.2d 921, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1 591, 1988 Va. LEXIS 9 (1988). Legislative intent t o preclude judicial review.  The final authority language in subdivision (7) of former § 2.1-114.5:6, which stated: To make and disseminate interpretations of the grievance pr ocedure, supported and was consistent with a legislative intent shown throughout the act to preclude judicial review in certain areas. Murray v. Stokes, 237 Va. 653, 378 S.E.2d 834, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2396, 1989 Va. LEXIS 75 (1989). Judicial review of the interpretation of a personnel policy regarding employee compensat ion by the Director of the Department of Personnel and Training (now Department of Human Resource Management) is precluded under the Virginia Personnel Act, and therefore, the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain a bill of complaint seeking revie w of the interpretation of Rule 8.3(d) of the Departments rules by the director of that department. Murray v. Stokes, 237 Va. 653, 378 S.E.2d 834, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2396, 1989 Va. LEXIS 75 (1989). Court lacked authority to treat petition as notice of grievance.  Where the trial court correctly determined that the employees demotion upon reinstatement was an issue that had to be grieved separately and was not enforceab le as part of the panels reinstatement decision without exhausting the administrative grievance procedure, the trial court lacked authority to treat the petition filed pursuant to subsection F of former § 2.1-114.5:1 as filing notice of a grievanc e with an agency.

Such certification programs shall allow applications for certification to be submitted by electronic means as authorized by § 59.1-496 and the appli cant to affix thereto his electronic signature, as defined in § 59.1-480. Such certification programs shall deny certification to vendors from states that deny like certifications to Virginia-based small, women-owned, or minority-owned businesses and employment services organizations or that provide a preference for small, women-owned, or minority-owned businesses and employment services organizations based in that state that is not available to Virginia-based businesses. The regulations shall (i) es tablish minimum requirements for certification of small, women-owned, and minority-owned businesses and employment services organizations; (ii) provide a process for evaluating existing local, state, and private sector certification programs that meet th e minimum requirements; and (iii) mandate certification without any additional paperwork of any small, women-owned, or minority-owned business that has obtained (a) certification under any federal certification program or (b) certification under any othe r certification program that is determined to meet the minimum requirements established in the regulations, and of any employment services organization that has been approved by the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services. All employment service s organization certifications shall remain in effect until the Department is notified by the Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services that such organization is no longer approved. The regulations shall also require as a prerequisite for approval that any out-of-state business applying for certification in Virginia as a small, women-owned, or minority-owned business have the equivalent certification in the businesss state of origin. An out-of-state business located in a state that does not ha ve a small, women-owned, or minority-owned business certification program shall be exempt from the requirements of this provision. The regulations shall establish a process for businesses that are denied initial certification as a small, women-owned, or minority-owned business to appeal such denial on the basis that the Department made a mistake in denying the businesss application for certification. 9. Establish an interdepartmental board in accordance with § 2.2-1608 to supply the Director with information useful in promoting minority business activity.

Effective J uly 1, 1986, every collegial body established by law or executive order within the executive branch of state government shall be classified according to its level of authority as follows: Advisory  A board, commission or council shall be classified as advisory when its purpose is to provide advice and comment to an executive branch agency or office. An advisory board, commission or council serves as a formal liaison between the agency or office and the public to ensure that the agency or office understands public concerns and that the activities of the agency or office are communicated to t he public. An advisory board, commission or council does not serve a regulatory or rule-making purpose. It may participate in the development of public policy by providing comment and advice. Policy  A board, commission or council shall be classified as policy if it is specifically charged by statute to promulgate public policies or regulations. It may also be charged with adjudicating violations of those policies or regulations. Specific functions of the board, commission or council may include, but are not limited to, rate setting, distributing federal funds, and adjudicating regulatory or st atutory violations, but each power shall be enumerated by law. Policy boards, commissions or councils are not responsible for supervising agencies or employing personnel. They may review and comment on agency budget requests. Supervisory  A board, commission, or council shall be classified as supervisory if it is responsible for agency operations including approval of requests for appropriations. A supervisory board, commission, or council appoints the agency director and ensures that the agency director complies with all board and statutory directives. The agency director is subordinate to the board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Education shall be considered a supervisory board. B. Each execut ive branch board, commission or council shall be assigned only one of the above classifications. The classification for boards and councils that are created by law shall be designated by the enabling legislation. The classification for commissions that a re created by executive order shall be designated by the executive order. History History. 1985, c. 419, § 9-6.25; 2001, c. 844.

The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds provided in this article for such payment. Any bonds of the Authority issued pursuant to this article shall not constitu te a debt of the Commonwealth, or any political subdivision thereof other than the Authority, and shall so state on their face. Neither the members of the Authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally by reason of the issuance t hereof. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest, shall mature at such time not exceeding forty years from their date as determined by the Authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Authority, at such p rice and under such terms and conditions as determined by the Authority, prior to the issuance of the bonds. The Authority shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denominations of the bonds and the places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the Commonwealth. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bo nds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of the bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The bonds may be issued in c oupon or in registered form or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Authority may sell such bonds in a manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it determines will best effect the purposes of th is article. The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the projects for which such bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbu rsed in the manner and under the restrictions, if any, the Authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or ot herwise, is less than the cost, additional bonds may be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, shall be deemed to be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or may be applied to the payment of the cost of any additional projects. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeabl e for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds that shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost.

A state tourism development authority is therefore necessary to stimulate the tourism segment of the economy by promoting, advertising, and marketing the Commonwealths many tourist attractions and by coordinating other private and public efforts to do the same; and 5. The film industry is a legitimate and important part of economic development in the Commonwealth.The General Assembly determines that the creation of an authority for this purpose is i n the public interest, serves a public purpose and will promote the health, safety, welfare, convenience or prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth. C. The Virgini a Tourism Authority is created, with the duties and powers set forth in this article, as a public body corporate and as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. The Authority is constituted a public instrumentality exercising public and essential gov ernmental functions, and the exercise by the Authority of the duties and powers conferred by this article shall be deemed and held to be the performance of an essential governmental function of the Commonwealth. The exercise of the powers granted by this article shall be in all respects for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth and the increase of their commerce and prosperity. The Authority may do business as the Virginia Tourism Corporation, and any references in the Code of Virgi nia or in any regulations adopted thereunder that refer to the Virginia Tourism Corporation shall, whenever necessary, be deemed to refer to the Authority.

This articl e shall be known and may be cited as the Fort Monroe Authority Act. B. The General Assembly finds and declares that: 1. Fort Monroe, located on a barrier spit at Hampton Roads Harbor and the southern end of Chesapeake Bay where the Old Point Comfort lighthouse has been welcoming ships since 1802, is one of the Commonwealths most important cultural treasures. Strategically located near Virginias Historic Triangle of Williamsburg, Yorktown, and Jamestown, the 565-acre site has been designated a National Historic Landmark District; 2. As a result of decisions made by the federal Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission (known as the BRAC Commission), Fort Monroe will cease to be an army base in 2011, and at t hat time most of the site will revert to the Commonwealth; 3. The planning phase of Fort Monroes transition from use as a United States Army base was managed by the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority (FMFADA), originally establish ed by the City of Hampton pursuant to legislation enacted by the General Assembly in 2007. The Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority, a partnership between the City and the Commonwealth, has fulfilled its primary purpose of formulating a reuse p lan for Fort Monroe; 4. It is the policy of the Commonwealth to protect the historic resources at Fort Monroe, provide public access to the Forts historic resources and recreational opportunities, exercis e exemplary stewardship of the Forts natural resources, and maintain Fort Monroe in perpetuity as a place that is a desirable one in which to reside, do business, and visit, all in a way that is economically sustainable; 5. Fort Monroes status is unique. Municipal services will need to be provided to Fort Monroes visitors, residents, and businesses. Both the Commonwealth and the FMFADA are signato ries to a Programmatic Agreement under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act that requires several specific actions be taken, including the enforcement of design standards to be adopted by the FMFADA or its successor to govern any new dev elopment or building restoration or renovation at Fort Monroe. There exists a need for an entity that can manage the property for the Commonwealth and ensure adherence to the findings, declarations, and policies set forth in this section; and 6. The creation of an authority for this purpose is in the public interest, serves a public purpose, and will promote the health, safety, welfare, convenience, and prosperity of the peopl e of the Commonwealth. C. The Fort Mo nroe Authority is created, with the duties and powers set forth in this article, as a public body corporate and as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. The Authority is constituted as a public instrumentality exercising public functions, and the exercise by the Authority of the duties and powers conferred by this article shall be deemed and held to be the performance of an essential governmental function of the Commonwealth. The exercise of the powers granted by this article and its public purpo se shall be in all respects for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth. D. The Fort Mo nroe Authority is the successor in interest to that political subdivision formerly known as the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority. As such, the Authority stands in the place and stead of, and assumes all rights and duties formerly of, the Fo rt Monroe Federal Area Development Authority, including but not limited to all leases, contracts, grants-in-aid, and all other agreements of whatsoever nature; holds title to all realty and personalty formerly held by the Fort Monroe Federal Area Develop ment Authority; and may exercise all powers that might at any time past have been exercised by the Fort Monroe Federal Area Development Authority, including the powers and authorities of a Local Redevelopment Authority under the provisions of any and all applicable federal laws, including the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 2005. E. The Fort Mo nroe Authority shall be subject to the Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ 2.2-4300 et seq.) and the Board shall adopt procedures consistent with that Act to govern its procurement processes. F. Employees o f the Fort Monroe Authority shall be eligible for membership in the Virginia Retirement System and all of the health and related insurance and other benefits, including premium conversion and flexible benefits, available to state employees as provided by law. G. The provisi ons of the Virginia Personnel Act (§ 2.2-2900 et seq.) shall not apply to the Fort Monroe Authority. History History. 2011, c. 716; 2020, cc. 269, 800. Annotations Editors note.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Fort Monroe Authority Board of Trustees members hold public office.  Because there is no available exemption to the prohibitions of Article VII, § 6 of the Constitution of Virginia and § 15.2-1535, neither the Mayor, Vice May or, or any other city council member may be appointed by the city council to serve as a member of the Fort Monroe Authority Board. Members of the Fort Monroe Authority Board, as individuals holding public office, stand in a fiduciary relationship with th e authority and thus are subject to the common-law duties of loyalty, care, obedience, and disclosure that are generally applicable to those in such a fiduciary relationship.

This articl e shall be known and may be cited as the Commonwealth of Virginia Innovation Partnership Act. B. It is found and determined by the General Assembly that there exists in the Commonwealth a need to support the life cycle of innovation, from translational research; to entrepreneurship; to pre-seed and seed stage funding; and to acceleration, growth, and commercia lization, resulting in the creation of new jobs and company formation. A collaborative, consistent, and consolidated approach will assist the Commonwealth in identifying its entrepreneurial strengths, including the identification of talents and resources that make the Commonwealth a unique place to grow and attract technology-based businesses. It is also found and determined by the General Assembly that there exists in the Commonwealth of Virginia a need to (i) promote the technology-based economic deve lopment of the Commonwealth by building, attracting, and retaining innovation and high-technology jobs and businesses in Virginia; (ii) increase industry competitiveness by supporting the application of innovative technologies that improve productivity a nd efficiency; (iii) attract and provide additional private and public funding in the Commonwealth to enhance and expand the scientific and technological research and commercialization at state and federal research institutions and facilities, including by supporting and working with technology transfer offices to advance research from proof-of-concept to commercialization resulting in new business and job creation; (iv) attract and provide additional private and public funding to support and enhance in novation-led entrepreneurship ecosystems and coordination of existing activities and programs throughout the Commonwealth to create new job opportunities and diversify the economy; (v) ensure promotion and marketing of Virginias statewide innovation economy and support and coordinate regional marketing efforts to align local and statewide objectives; and (vi) close the Commonwealths support gap through pre-seed and seed stage investments, coordination of private investor networks, and shared due diligence research. C. To achieve the objectives set forth in subsection B, there is created and constituted a political subdivision of the Commonwealth to be known as the Commonwealth of Virginia Innovation Partnership Authority. The Authoritys exercise of powers conferred by this a rticle shall be deemed to be the performance of an essential governmental function and matters of public necessity for which public moneys may be spent and private property acquired. Nothing in this article shall be construed to diminish or limit the pow ers and responsibilities of institutions of higher education or other educational or cultural institutions set forth in Title 23.1, including but not limited to such institutions authority to establish its own independent policies and technology tran sfer offices.

The case cited in the notes below was decided under former Title 9. Former § 9-11 not unconstitutional.  See Silvette v. Art Comm'n, 413 F. Supp. 1342, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14837 (E.D. Va. 1976). The duty to advise and counsel includes the right to state the reasons therefor, and suggesting changes in a portrait intended as a gift to the State did not viol ate an artists First Amendment right of free artistic expression. Silvette v. Art Comm'n, 413 F. Supp. 1342, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14837 (E.D. Va. 1976). Former §§ 9-11 and 9-12 delineated only the means by which the Commonwealth might acquire works of art by purchase or otherwise. Silvette v. Art Comm'n, 413 F. Supp. 1342, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14837 (E.D. Va. 1976). Clear and exact acquisition proced ures.  The procedures for acquiring works of art by the Commonwealth by purchase, gift or otherwise have been spelled out with exactitude and clarity. Silvette v. Art Co mm'n, 413 F. Supp. 1342, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14837 (E.D. Va. 1976). The advisory function of the former Art Commission involved an assessment of judgment, a n artistic judgment, a conclusion which delights the chosen and offends the rejected. Silvette v. Art Comm'n, 413 F. Supp. 1342, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14837 (E.D. Va. 1976). An artist cannot compel the acceptance of his painting any more than an author can force the publication of his article. Silvette v. Art Comm'n, 413 F. Supp. 1342, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14837 (E.D. Va. 1976). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Practice and procedure.  Citizens challenge to the Governor of Virginias announcement that the Governor was to remove and relocate a statue of Robert E. Lee failed as a matter of law because the citizen had no statutory standing and no private right of action to bring suit. Gregory v. Northam, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 182 (Richmond Aug. 3, 2020), aff'd, 300 Va. 226, 862 S.E.2d 273, 2021 Va. LEXIS 95 (2021). When citizens challenged the Governor of Virginias announced intention to remove a Civil War monument from its location the citizens could not proceed with a claim based upon the statute because the statute provided no statutory standing and it provided no right of action under which any member of the general public with statutory standing could proceed.

A regional council shall review such plan not less than biennially while the regional council is receiving grants from the Fund. C. The Board s hall only consider those regional activities endorsed by a regional council in its application for grants from the Fund. For any regional activity included in a regional councils application, the regional council shall identify (i) the amount of gran ts requested and the number of years for which grants are sought; (ii) the participating business, education, and government entities and their respective roles and contributions; (iii) the private, local, and other sources of nonstate funding that the g rant from the Fund will assist in generating, including specific amounts pledged by such sources as of the application date; (iv) how the regional activity addresses the skills gaps identified in the councils economic growth and diversification plan; and (v) the economic impact or other outcomes that are reasonably expected to result from the proposed regional activity, including timetables and means of measurement. D. Regional ac tivities eligible for grants from the Fund shall be focused on high-impact, collaborative projects in a region that promote new job creation, entrepreneurship, and new capital investment; leverage nonstate resources to enhance collaboration; foster resea rch, development, and commercialization activities; encourage cooperation among public bodies to reduce costs and duplication of government services; and promote other economic or workforce development activities consistent with this article that are aut horized by the Board.

The fiscal resources from non-Fund sources that will be committed to the activity, including local or federal funds, private contributions, and cost savings expected to be achieved thr ough regional collaboration; 3. The number and percentage of localities, including political subdivisions and bodies corporate and politic, within the region that are participating in the activity, the portion of the regions population represented by the participating localities, and the participation of localities that are outside of the applicant region; 4. The compatibility with other projects, programs, or existing infrastructure in a region to maximize the leverage of grants from the Fund to encourage new collaborative activities; 5. The expected economic impact and outcomes of the project and the complexity of the project relative to the size of the economy of the region or to the population of the participating l ocalities; 6. The projected cost savings and other efficiencies generated by the proposed activity, and the local resources generated by collaboration that have been or will be repurposed to support the activity; 7. The character of the regional collaboration, including the nature and extent of the regional effort involved in developing and implementing the proposed activity, the complexity of the activity, the prospective impact on relations between and among the affected localities, and the prospective impact on collaboration between and among business, education, and government entities in the region; 8. Interstate, inter-regional, and other beneficial forms of collaboration, if any, that will accompany, result from, or be encouraged by the activity; 9. Efficiency in the administration and oversight of regional activities; and 10. Other factors deemed to be appropriate by the Board. F. Each region al council awarded a grant from the Fund shall issue an annual report that shall include, at a minimum, an assessment of the impact and outcomes from regional activities supported by grants from the Fund and the regions overall progress in addressing the goals and strategies identified in the regions plan for economic growth and diversification. Such assessment shall address performance criteria prescribed in the program guidelines and procedures. G. Subject to the provisions of § 2.2-2488 and this section, once a regional council becomes eligible for grants from the Fund, the regional council may continue to apply for and receive grants from the Fund to support economic activities consistent with the region al councils economic growth and diversification plan in such amounts and for such duration as the Board may determine in accordance with its guidelines and procedures. The Board may terminate any payments to regional councils that fail to perform in accordance with this article, the Boards guidelines or procedures, or any conditions expressly agreed upon as part of a grant award, or for malfeasance. The Board may require the refund of moneys from the Fund upon such termination. Grants that are t erminated shall revert to the Fund for distribution on an unallocated competitive basis. H. In making F und recommendations and awards, the Board may consider regional activities that commenced prior to the enactment of this article, provided that the grant-funded program or project will expand the scope of, or increase the number of localities participati ng in, such preexisting activity.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. Legislative history.  For a full discussion of the legislative history of this section, see Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va. LEXIS 223 (1952). Constitutionality.  This section is not special and private legislation violative of Va. Const., Art. II, § 5 and Art. IV, § 15. It is legislation, general in character, and up on a subject well within the field of general legislation. It applies alike to all officeholders. Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va. LEXIS 223 (1952). The long continued sanction of this section by its repeated reenactment from time to time by the General Assembly, the positive application and enforcement of its mandate by the court, and the continued acquiescence in and adherence to its restrictions by the departments of the state government, impel the belief and confirm the conclusion that it does not infringe upon Va. Const., Art. II, § 5 and Art. IV, § 15, declaring the eligibility to any public office of every qualified voter. Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va. LEXIS 223 (1952). Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to prevent a conflict of interest in those who would serve both the federal and state governments. Joy v. Green, 194 Va. 1003, 76 S .E.2d 178, 1953 Va. LEXIS 169 (1953). The object sought to be accomplished by this section was, and is, to safeguard and protect the states independent sovereignty by requiring strict and undivide d allegiance to the duties and obligations of a public office by its incumbent. Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va. LEXIS 223 (1952). The rule forbidding the holding of two offices at the same time, whether at common law o r under constitutions and statutes, never contemplated a disability to be elected to the second office, but, on the contrary, conclusively affirms the legality and efficiency of such election. It is only the holding, that is, the occupation, of two offic es at the same time that offends public policy, and is therefore forbidden by law. Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va. LEXIS 223 (1952). Charter provisions as except ion to section.  The General Assembly may grant new charters, or amendments to existing charters, which contain provisions permitting certain federal employees to hold specified o ffices from which they might otherwise be barred by this section under the authority of Art. VII, § 2, of the Constitution of Virginia.Pierce v. Dennis, 205 Va. 478, 138 S.E.2d 6, 1964 Va. LEXIS 206 (1964). Resignation from federal office accepted after commencement of state office.  Where a federal official was elected to the office of sheriff, which commenced on July 1, and resigned his federal office before his state office began, but perfo rmed certain federal duties on the morning of July 1, and his resignation was not formally accepted until July 2, his office as sheriff was thereby vacated and he was not entitled to qualify as such. Bunting v. Willis, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 144, 1876 Va. LE XIS 12 (1876). Service in state and in military.  Trial court was authorized, pursuant to § 19.2-156, to appoint an attorney-at-law to fulfill the duties of the duly-elected Commonwealths attorney while he was serving with his military unit in Iraq and, thus, petitioners application for writ of mandamus and/or prohibition was denied; although this section would prohibit petitioner from serving both the federal government and the state government at th e same time, § 2.2-2802 contained an exception for Virginia office holders who were called into active military service and prevented him from vacating or forfeiting his title as the Commonwealths attorney. In re Hannett, 270 Va. 223, 619 S.E.2d 4 65, 2005 Va. LEXIS 82 (2005). A district attorney for the Home Owners Loan Corporation, an instrumentality of the United States, receiving, besides his salary as such district attorney, other emoluments under the government of the United States, vacates his office as attorney for the Commonwealth under this section. Commonwealth ex rel. Kelly v. Rouse, 163 Va. 841, 178 S.E. 37, 1935 Va. LEXIS 244 (1935). Where county board member was employed by the United States when he first assumed his du ties on the board and his claimed exemption from the provisions of this section appearing in former § 2.1-33 (see now § 2.2-2801) was held unconstitutional, board member was from the first incapable of holding office because of the provisions of th is section. Though duly elected, he never became a de jure officer and the trial court should have declared office vacated and restrained treasurer from paying his salary. Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. Legislative history.  For a full discussion of the legislative history of this section, see Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va. LEXIS 223 (1952). Exception for federal clerk.  Subdivision 10 of former § 2.1-33 (see now subdivision A 10 of this section) is constitutional and is not invalid as special legislation. Hanes v. Fox, 196 Va. 51, 82 S.E.2d 495, 1954 Va. LEXIS 200 (1954). Hence, fed eral clerk may hold office of police justice.  A federal clerk is not disqualified because of his occupation to hold the office of police justice of a Virginia town. Hanes v. Fox, 196 Va. 51, 82 S.E.2d 495, 19 54 Va. LEXIS 200 (1954). Federal employee on school board.  Subdivision 14 of former § 2.1-33 (see now subdivision A 11 of this section) meets the requirements for a general act and is not violative of Art. IV, § 15, of the Virginia Constitution.Joy v. Green, 194 Va. 1003, 76 S.E.2d 178, 1953 Va. LEXIS 169 (1953). And is not suspended by § 22.1-30.  Section 22.1-30 does not prescribe the exclusive qualifications for members of county school boards and does not supersede the provisions of subdivision 14 of for mer § 2.1-33 (see now subdivision A 11 of this section) with respect to the qualification of federal employees to sit on county school boards. These two statutory provisions are complementary and should be read together. Joy v. Green, 194 Va. 1003, 76 S.E.2d 178, 1953 Va. LEXIS 169 (1953). The history of § 22.1-30 and subdivision 14 of former § 2.1-33 (see now subdivision A 11 of this section) shows that the General Assembly has determined tha t there is no conflict of interest in the service by clerks and employees of the federal government engaged in the departmental service in Washington and their service on county school boards. Joy v. Green, 194 Va. 1003, 76 S.E.2d 178, 1953 Va. L EXIS 169 (1953). As to unconstitutionality of former subdivision 11 of former § 2.1-33, preventing Uni ted States government employees from holding any office under the government of counties with a certain population or of cities or counties adjoining counties with a certain population, see Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va. LEXIS 2 23 (1952). Members of regular army or natio nal guard.  The provision of subdivision 3 of former § 2.1-33 (see now subdivision B 2 of this section) applies to any actual duty in the service of the United Sta tes to which officers and soldiers of the National Guard may be called out under the acts of Congress, passed pursuant to the authority granted it in the federal Constitution.

Law Review. For 2006 survey article, Election Law, see 41 U. Rich. L. Rev. 121 (2006). CASE NOTES Position not forfeited or vacated.  Trial court was authorized, pursuant to § 19.2-156, to appoint an attorney-at-law to fulfill the duties of the duly-elected Commonwealths attorney while he was serving with his military unit in Iraq and, thus, petitioners application for writ of mandamus and/or prohibition was denied; although § 2.2-2800 would prohibit petitioner from serving both the federal government and the state government at t he same time, this section contained an exception for Virginia office holders who were called into active military service and prevented from vacating or forfeiting title as the Commonwealths attorney and § 15.2-1627 provided that the attorney app ointed to act in his absence had the power to carry out the duties of the office. In re Hannett, 270 Va. 223, 619 S.E.2d 465, 2005 Va. LEXIS 82 (2005).

I and XIV, rights from the two-office restriction was reasonable, nondiscriminatory, and relat ively minimal as the restriction only required him to focus his efforts on two races; (2) the state had a regulatory interest in limiting the size of the ballot; (3) the two-office restriction was rationally related to measuring the seriousness of the ca ndidates desire and motivation for seeking public office; (4) the two-office restriction was intended to avoid voter confusion; and (5) the states prohibition under § 2.2-2807 of a candidate holding two offices was a legitimate end.

The cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. The acts of a public officer de facto are valid and binding just as if he were an office r de jure. Monteith v. Commonwealth, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 172, 1859 Va. LEXIS 10 (1859); Griffin's Ex'r v. Cunningham, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 31, 1870 Va. LEXIS 3 (1870); Bolling v. Lersner, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 36, 1875 Va.

Upon grounds of public policy.  The rule which declares that the acts of an officer de facto are as valid and binding as if he were an officer de jure, is founded on the soundest principles of p ublic policy, and is absolutely essential to the protection of the best interests of society. McCraw v. Williams, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 510, 1880 Va. LEXIS 59 (1880). A duly elected judge who held court before his term of office began was a judge de facto , and his judgments were as valid and binding as if he had been judge de jure. McCraw v. Williams, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 510, 1880 Va. LEXIS 59 (1880). Where a clerk of court before being duly qualified administered the oath to the grand jury, it was held that his act in administering such oath was as valid as though he were a clerk de jure. Hord v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 674, 1833 Va. LEXIS 69 (1833). Where a justice of the peace accepts the office of coroner, such acceptance does not vac ate his subsequent acts as justice done before his disqualification was established by some proper judicial proceeding for that purpose instituted. Maddox v. Ewell, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 59 (1817). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL De facto officer doctrine.  Where a member of a local governmental body vacates his position by acceptance of an incompatible office, the de facto officer doctrine applies to official acts t aken by such an individual after he has vacated the first position and thus decisions made by an electoral board during the time of vacancy due to a members acceptance of the position of part-time town attorney are valid.

Acts 2001, c. 227 amended § 2.1-20.3, from which this section is derived. Pursuant to § 30-152, Acts 2001, c. 227 has been given effect in this section as s et out above. The 2001 amendment by c. 227 inserted by statute in present subsection B, and in present subsection D, rewrote the first sentence, which formerly read: No person shall receive total compensation of more than fifty dollars per da y for services performed on any one day, and in the last sentence, inserted performs services or, and inserted for two or more boards, commissions, etc. Acts 2011, c. 495, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall apply to nonlegislative members of boards, commissions, committees, councils, or othe r collegial bodies who are appointed or reappointed at the state level on or after July 1, 2011. The 2003 amendments.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL [M]embers of collegial bodies, who are appointed at the state level are those persons who are appointed by an authorized state official or entity, or as set forth in the collegial bodies enabling legislation and the phrase state level refers only to those collegial bodies established or authorized by the General Assembly to function at the state level and does not include such bodies that operate at a local government level.

Construction with other law.  Members of the Litter Control and Recycling Fund Advisory Board are not entitled to compensation or reimbursement of expenses under this section. See opinion of A ttorney General to The Honorable Stephen H. Martin, Member, Senate of Virginia, 03-032, 2003 Va. AG LEXIS 36 (9/11/03). Because § 23-9.3 is silent as to compensation and expense reimbursement for members of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, there is no conflict with this section; the two statutes may be read together in harmony, with the provisions of this section providing the method and amount of compensation and expense reimbursement. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Stephen H. Martin, Membe r, Senate of Virginia, 03-032, 2003 Va. AG LEXIS 36 (9/11/03). Because § 46.2-1503 pertaining to reimbursement of actual and necessary expenses of members of the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board is silent as to compensation, the compensation provisions of this section apply; as to expenses, to the extent the two statutes are in conflict or it is unclear which of the two statutes applies, the specific provisions of subsection E of § 46.2-1503 dictate the method and amount of such reimbursement. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Stephen H. Martin, Member, Senate of Virginia, 03-032, 2003 Va. AG LEXIS 36 (9/11/03). It does not matter whether this section or specific enabling legislation of a collegial body is the later enacted statute; only in those instances where the provi sions of this section and the statute in question are so irreconcilably repugnant or inconsistent would the timing of enactment be implicated. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Stephen H. Martin, Member, Senate of Virginia, 03-032, 2003 Va . AG LEXIS 36 (9/11/03). Entitlement to compensation.  Only members of collegial bodies that are established or authorized to be established by the General Assembly are entitled to compensation or reimbursement for ex penses under this section.

In accordan ce with the statewide telecommuting and alternative work schedule policy, to be developed by the Secretary of Administration pursuant to § 2.2-203.1, the head of each state agency shall establish a telecommuting and alternative work policy under which eligible employees of such agency may telecommute, participate in alternative work schedules, or both, to the maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance or service delivery. The policy shall identify types of employees eligible for telecommuting and alternative work schedules, the broad categories of positions determined to be ineligible for telecommuting and the justification therefor, any benefits of telecommuting including the use of alternate work locations that are separate fr om the agencys central workplace, and any benefits of using alternative work schedules. The policy shall promote use of Commonwealth information technology assets where feasible but may allow for eligible employees to use computers, computing devices , or related electronic equipment not owned or leased by the Commonwealth to telecommute, if such use is technically and economically practical, and so long as such use meets information security standards as established by the Virginia Information Techn ologies Agency, or receives an exception from such standards approved by the CIO of the Commonwealth or his designee.

Law upheld.  Although Virginia public university professors claimed they were entitled to access sexually explicit material in their capacity as state employees by using equip ment owned or leased by the state, they acknowledged that the challenged aspect of this section did not affect speech by them in their capacity as private citizens speaking on matters of public concern; thus, the Act did not infringe the First Amendment rights of state employees. Urofsky v. Gilmore, 216 F.3d 401, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 14484 (4th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1070, 121 S. Ct. 759, 148 L. Ed. 2d 662, 2001 U.S. LEXIS 134 (2001). Since declaring that public employees, including teachers, do not forfeit First Amendment rights upon accepting public employment, the Supreme Court has focused i ts discussions of academic freedom solely on issues of institutional autonomy; because this section did not infringe the constitutional rights of public employees in general, it also did not violate the rights of professors.

The act regulates the speech of individuals speaking in their capacity as Commonwealth employees, not as citizens, and thus the act does not touch upon a matter o f public concern. Consequently, the speech may be restricted consistent with the First Amendment. Urofsky v. Gilmore, 167 F.3d 191, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 1937 (4th Cir. 1999). Plaintiffs claim that this act violates their First Amendment right to academic freedom is foreclosed by this courts en banc decision in Boring. See Boring v. Buncombe County Bd. of Educ., 136 F.3d 364 (4th Cir.) en banc , cert. denied, 142 L. Ed. 2d 36, 119 S. Ct. 47 (1998). Urofsky v. Gilmore, 167 F.3d 191, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 19 37 (4th Cir. 1999).

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. Virginias layoff-rights scheme and rules on exemptions circums cribe property interest in continued employment.  Although a nonprobationary employee has a property interest in continued employment that is created by the state, the scope of this interest is circumscribed by V irginias rules on exemptions from the classified employment scheme and from access to the grievance procedure and by Virginias layoff-rights scheme. Mandel v. Allen, 889 F. Supp. 857, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8403 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, 81 F.3d 478 , 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 8268 (4th Cir. 1996). No property interest when statute makes exercise of classification power non-grievable.  Where, as in the relevant Virginia statutes, the state statute vests the power to classify solely in management and then makes the exercise of that power non-grie vable, there can be no property interest in the classification. Mandel v. Allen, 889 F. Supp. 857, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8403 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, 81 F.3d 478, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 8268 (4th Cir. 1996). This section specifically grants state officials the power to take actions that directly or indirectly cause changes in the classification status of state employe es. Accordingly, plaintiffs possessed no entitlement and thus no property right to a continued classification. Mandel v. Allen, 81 F.3d 478, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 8268 (4th Cir. 1996). Appropriate to presume change in reporting line is for legitimate reasons.  The appropriate course is to presume that a change in an employees reporting line occurs for legitimate systemic reasons absent a showing of pretext by the em ployee. Mandel v. Allen, 889 F. Supp. 857, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8403 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, 81 F.3d 478, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 8268 (4th Cir. 1996).

It shall be the policy of the Commonwealth, as an employer, to encourage the resolution of employee problems and complaints. To that end, employees shall be able to discuss freely, and without retaliation, their concerns with their immediate supervisors and managem ent. To the extent that such concerns cannot be resolved informally, the grievance procedure shall afford an immediate and fair method for the resolution of employment disputes that may arise between state agencies and those employees who have access to the procedure under § 2.2-3001. B. To fully ac hieve the objectives of this chapter and to create uniformity, each agency in the executive branch of state government shall: 1. Requi re supervisory personnel to be trained in the grievance procedure, personnel policies, and conflict resolution; 2. Familiarize employees with their grievance rights and promote the services of the Department of Human Resource Management; 3. Cooperate with investigations conducted pursuant to the authority granted by clause (iii) of subdivision 4 of § 2.2-1202.1; 4. Participate in the mediation program; 5. Evaluate supervisors on the effectiveness of employee relations management, including, but not limited to, their handling of grievances; and 6. Recognize the right of employees to fully participate in the grievance process without retaliation. C. The Departm ent of Human Resource Management shall monitor agencies activities under this section.

The 2012 amendments by cc. 803 and 835, cl. 8, are identical, and in subdivision B 2 and in subsection C, substituted Department of Human Resource Management  for Department of Employment Dispute Resolution; and updated the section reference in subdivision B 3. CASE NOTES Federal court jurisdiction.  Employees action, which alleged disciplinary action by the employer was retaliation for engaging in protected communications, was dismissed because the Rooker -Feldman doctrine applied to Virginias grievance procedure under § 2.2-3000 et seq. and dictated a conclusion that the court was without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the employees claims; the factual basis for the constitutional cl aims under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 did not differ, in any substantial part, from those essential facts presented in the state proceedings. Horner v. Dep't of Mental Health, No. 5:02CV00099, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10094 (W.D. Va. June 17, 2003), vacated, 156 Fed. Appx. 595, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 26303 (4th Cir. 2005). State grievance process subject to Rooker-Feldman doctrine.  In an action by a former state employee against his former state employer and former supervisors, a magistrate correctly found that the court lacked subject matte r jurisdiction over the employees complaint based on the Rooker-Feldman doctrine because, although 28 U.S.C.S. § 1257 did not explicitly mention decisions by lower state courts or administrative agencies, the state grievance process under § 2.2-3000 et seq., which the employee had invoked, was an adjudicatory process subject to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Horner v. Dep't of Mental Health, No. 5:02CV00099, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26935 (W.D. Va. Ma y 1, 2003), vacated, 156 Fed. Appx. 595, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 26303 (4th Cir. 2005). Grievance procedure.  Circuit court erred in reversing a hearing officers decision that granted an employees request for relief and reinstatement to his former position, becaus e the employees grievance went through every procedural step available and policy to which he was entitled, the hearing officer had jurisdiction to take the necessary action, the position was a statutory creation, the hearing officers findings of fact generally reflected positively on the employee, and the Department of Juvenile Justice reassigned the employee arbitrarily or as a form of unwarranted punishment. Va. Dep't of Juvenile Justice v. Milner, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 223 (Va. Ct. App. July 2 1, 2015). Reme dy by immediate supervisor precludes further review.  The language Each level of management review shall have the authority to provide the employee with a remedy, meant that the decision of the employees immediate supervisor that the employee should be reinstated, after the employee had committed offenses while working for the state employer that called for immediate dismissal, was not a mere recommendation, and precluded subsequent review by the state e mployers higher-level management. Horner v. Dep't of Mental Health, Mental Retardation, &amp; Substance Abuse Servs., 268 Va. 187, 597 S.E.2d 202, 2004 Va. LEXIS 83 (2004), overruled in part, Woolford v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 294 Va. 377, 806 S.E.2d 398 , 2017 Va. LEXIS 168 (2017). Mediation.  Circuit court properly affirmed a decision by a hearing officer in an employees grievance against the Virginia Department of State Police (VDSP) because the e mployee failed to state how the hearing officers rulings were contradictory to law and outside of the scope of judicial review where the employee, there was insufficient evidence that the disciplinary action was based on a dislike of the empl oyee rather than his work performance, VDSPs General Orders were not laws for the purposes of judicial review, and VDSP was not statutorily required to mediate an employee dispute whenever he or she requested it. Passaro v. Va. Dep't of State Police, 67 Va. App. 357, 796 S.E.2d 439, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 39 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Local government employees are exemp t.  Charlottesville Redevelopment and Housing Authority is not subject to the state grievance procedure. Although grievance-hearing decisions are grievable under the state grievance procedure, § 2.2-3002 and the Virginia Personnel Act, § 2.2-2905, expressly exempt local government employees. Crawley-Evans v. Charlottesville Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 73 Va. Cir. 494, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 209 (Charlottesville Aug. 7, 2007). Discipline requiring grievance h earing.  State employment resolution department erred in determining that e-mail that an office director sent to petitioner was not disciplinary action that qualified for a hearing on petitioners grievance regarding an altercation with a fellow employee over what material could be posted at work; the trial court determined that petitioner was entitled to a grievance hearing because the e-mail outlined a course of cond uct that was to be followed and how future conduct regarding the issue would be handled, and, thus, qualified as a formal disciplinary action that entitled petitioner to a grievance hearing.

CASE NOTES Agencys alleged failure to comply with grievance procedures.  When an employee contesting the employees termination asserted that the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services did not follow procedures i n the applicable grievance procedures manual, such alleged failure did not require reversal of the departments decision because: (1) under subsection A of § 2.2-3001, the Director of the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution policed complian ce with grievance procedures; and (2) courts ensured an administrative decision was not contradictory to law, under subsection B of § 2.2-3006, but the grievance procedures manual was not law.

As part of the Commonwealths program of employee relations management, the Department of Human Resource Management shall develop a grievance procedure that includes not more than three successively higher grievance resolution steps and a formal hearing as provi ded in this chapter. However, grievances involving dismissals due to formal discipline or unsatisfactory job performance shall proceed directly to a formal hearing, omitting the grievance resolution steps, the face-to-face meeting specified in subsection D, and the agency head qualification determination specified in subsection D of § 2.2-3004. B. Prior to in itiating a written grievance, the employee shall be encouraged to pursue an informal complaint with his immediate supervisor. The supervisor shall have authority to resolve the complaint if it involves actions within his control. C. An employee may pursue a formal written grievance through the grievance resolution steps if the complaint has been presented to management within 30 calendar days of the employees knowledge of the event that gave rise to the complaint. Employees rights to p ursue grievances shall not be used to harass or otherwise impede the efficient operations of government. D. Except as p rovided in subsection A, upon receipt of a timely written complaint, management shall review the grievance and respond to the merits thereof. Each level of management review shall have the authority to provide the employee with a remedy, subject to the a gency heads approval. At least one face-to-face meeting between the employee and management shall be required. The persons who may be present at this meeting are the employee, the appropriate manager, an individual selected by the employee, and an in dividual selected by the manager. Witnesses may be called by either party. E. Absent just cause, all documents, as defined in the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, relating to the actions grieved shall be made available, upon request from a party to the grievance, by the opposing party, in a timely fashion. Upon such request a party sh all have a duty to search its records to ensure that all such relevant documents are provided. Documents pertaining to nonparties that are relevant to the grievance shall be produced in such a manner as to preserve the privacy of the individuals not pers onally involved in the grievance. A party shall not be required to create a document if the document does not exist. F. All time li mitations prescribed in the grievance procedure, including, but not limited to, submission of an initial complaint and employee appeal of management decisions, shall be reasonable, specific, and equally applicable to the agency and the employee. Expedite d grievance procedures shall be established for terminations, demotions, suspensions, and lost wages or salaries. G. Within five workdays of the receipt of a written notice of noncompliance, failure of the employee or the agency to comply with a substantial procedural requirement of the grievance procedure without just cause may result in a decision against the noncomplying party on any qualified issue. Written notice of noncompliance by the agency shall be made to the agency head. The Director of the Department of Human Resource Management shall render all decisions related to procedural compliance, and such decisions shall con tain the reasons for such decision and shall be final. H. Grievances qualified pursuant to § 2.2-3004 that have not been resolved through the grievance resolution steps shall advance to a hearing that shall be the final step in the grievance procedure.

Dep't of Taxation, 294 Va. 377, 806 S.E.2d 398 , 2017 Va. LEXIS 168 (2017). Application of issue preclusion to hearing officers findings of fact.  Issue preclusion applied to a former hospital employees action that alleged retaliation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.S. § 794(a), and t he First Amendment because the employee had previously litigated all of the issues presented in the instant case surrounding his termination in an impartial forum, the Virginia Department of Employment Dispute Resolution. There was no basis to find that the decisions of the hearing officer on the factual issues surrounding the discharge were contradictory to law or policy; thus, the hearing officers findings that the employee was terminated for failing to follow a supervisors instructions and fa iling to comply with written policy, not because of retaliation, were final and binding under Virginia law.

Circuit court did not err in refusing to reverse a decision by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management upholding an employees termination because the director was permitted to assign tasks to agency personnel to carry out the directors duties; the tripartite review procedure had been undisturbed because the employee received a review of the facts by the hearing officer, a review of the policy by the department, and a review of the law by the court of appeals. Murphy v. Va. Dep't of State Police, 68 Va. App. 716, 813 S.E.2d 21, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 123 (2018). Virginias layoff-rights scheme and rules on exemptions circums cribe property interest in continued employment.  Although a nonprobationary employee has a property interest in continued employment that is created by the state the scope of this interest, is circumscribed by V irginias rules on exemptions from the classified employment scheme and from access to the grievance procedure and by Virginias layoff-rights scheme. Mandel v. Allen, 889 F. Supp. 857, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8403 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, 81 F.3d 478 , 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 8268 (4th Cir. 1996). No property interest when statute makes exercise of classification power non-grievable.  Where, as in the relevant Virginia statutes, the state statute vests the power to classify solely in management and then makes the exercise of that power non-grie vable, there can be no property interest in the classification. Mandel v. Allen, 889 F. Supp. 857, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8403 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, 81 F.3d 478, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 8268 (4th Cir. 1996). A nonprobationary employee does not serve at the will of the agency that employs him. Det weiler v. Virginia Dep't of Rehabilitative Servs., 705 F.2d 557, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 28817 (4th Cir. 1983). Nonprobationary employees of state have property interest in continued employment.  Former § 2.1-114.5:1s distinction between probationary employees and nonprobationary employees, its distinction between disciplinary discharges and dischar ges for reduction in work force, the specifications in the Policy Standards of Conduct for state employees concerning breaches of discipline for which an employee could be discharged, and the authority conferred on an impartial panel to reverse t he agencys decision and to order reinstatement with back pay (pursuant to The Rules for the Conduct of Panel Hearings), established that a nonprobationary employee had a property interest in continued employment that was created by the State. Detweiler v. Virginia Dep't of Rehabilitative Servs., 705 F.2d 557, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 28817 (4th Cir. 1983). Probationary employee had no right to grievance procedures and no property interest in her job, and thus the protections of due process were not triggered by her firing. Assa'ad-Faltas v. Virginia, 738 F. Supp. 982 (E.D. Va. 1989), aff'd, 902 F.2d 1564, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 6416 (4th Cir. 1990).

A grievance qualifying for a hearing shall involve a complaint or dispute by an employee relating to the following adverse employment actions in which the employee is personally involved, including (i) formal disciplinary actions, including suspensions, demotions, transfers and assignments, and dismissals resulting from formal discipline or unsatisfactory job performance; (ii) the application of all written personnel policies, procedures, rules and regulations where it can be shown that policy was misapplied or un fairly applied; (iii) discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, political affiliation, age, disability, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or militar y status; (iv) arbitrary or capricious performance evaluations; (v) acts of retaliation as the result of the use of or participation in the grievance procedure or because the employee has complied with any law of the United States or of the Commonwealth, has reported any violation of such law to a governmental authority, has sought any change in law before the Congress of the United States or the General Assembly, or has reported an incidence of fraud, abuse, or gross mismanagement; and (vi) retaliation for exercising any right otherwise protected by law. B. Management reserves the exclusive right to manage the affairs and operations of state government. Management shall exercise its powers with the highest degree of trust. In any employment matter that management precludes from proceeding to a grievance hearing, manag ements response, including any appropriate remedial actions, shall be prompt, complete, and fair. C. Complaints relating solely to the following issues shall not proceed to a hearing: (i) establishment and revision of wages, salaries, position classifications, or general benefits; (ii) work activity accepted by the employee as a condition of employment or which ma y reasonably be expected to be a part of the job content; (iii) contents of ordinances, statutes or established personnel policies, procedures, and rules and regulations; (iv) methods, means, and personnel by which work activities are to be carried on; ( v) termination, layoff, demotion, or suspension from duties because of lack of work, reduction in work force, or job abolition; (vi) hiring, promotion, transfer, assignment, and retention of employees within the agency; and (vii) relief of employees from duties of the agency in emergencies.

Except as p rovided in subsection A of § 2.2-3003, decisions regarding whether a grievance qualifies for a hearing shall be made in writing by the agency head or his designee within five workdays of the employees request for a hearing. A copy of the decision shall be sent to the employee. The employee may appeal the denial of a hearing by the agency head to the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management (the Director). Upon receipt of an appeal, the agency shall transmit the entire grievance rec ord to the Department of Human Resource Management within five workdays. The Director shall render a decision on whether the employee is entitled to a hearing upon the grievance record and other probative evidence. E. The hearing pursuant to § 2.2-3005 shall be held in the locality in which the employee is employed or in any other locality agreed to by the employee, employer, and hearing officer. The employee and the agency may be represented by legal counsel or a lay advocat e, the provisions of § 54.1-3904 notwithstanding. The employee and the agency may call witnesses to present testimony and be cross-examined. F.

Annotations The 2012 amendments. The 2012 amendments by cc. 56 and 349 are nearly identical, and added the exception at the beginning of subsection D, deleted former subsection E, redesignated fo rmer subsection F as E, and c. 56 made a minor stylistic change. The 2012 amendments by cc. 803 and 835, cl. 8, are identical, and in subsection D, twice substituted Department of Human Resource Management for Depar tment of Employment Dispute Resolution; and made minor stylistic changes. The 2020 amendments. The 2020 amendment by c. 1137 inserted sexual orientation, or gender identity in clause (iii) of subsection A. The 2020 amendment by c. 1140, in subsection A, deleted but not limited to following including in the introductory language, and substituted s ex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or status as a veteran for or sex in clause (iii). The 2021 Sp. Sess. I amendments. The 2021 amendments by Sp. Sess.

The 2022 amendment by c. 799 added subsection F. CASE NOTES Applicability.  This section had no relevance to a medical centers appeal of a decision finding that a registered nurses actions in accessing her ex-husbands medical records for his benefit did not violate the centers policies where the content of the policies was not in dispute, but rather their application. Univ. of Va. Med. Ctr. v. Jordan, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 2, 2016). The judgment of the city court had no preclusive effect because, under Virginia law, sub sequent actions are not barred by res judicata if the court in the first action did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the proceedings; the city court dismissed plaintiffs first action without reaching the merits because plaintiff had not exha usted his administrative remedies. Pignato v. Virginia Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 948 F. Supp. 532, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3570 (E.D. Va. 1996), aff'd, No. 96-1379, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 3341 (4th Cir. Feb. 25, 1997) (decided under former Title 2.1). Court deference to adminis trative decision.  Where an agency failed to show that a hearing officers decision contradicted any law, the circuit courts ruling, unduly limiting the officers authorit y and overturning the officers decision, was reversed to reinstate the officers decision. Tatum v. Va. Dep't of Agric. Consumer Servs., 41 Va. App. 110, 582 S.E.2d 452, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 356 (2003) (reversing 59 Va. Cir. 262 (2002)). Letters not a case decision.  Two letters, one written by an employees attorney, and another written by the Department of Corrections, did not meet the definition of a case decision,  as defined in § 2.2-4001, as neither letter involved the application of law to the facts in an agency proceeding, the first amounted to merely a request for clarification of the Departments position concerning a grievance matter, and the Depa rtments response to the same acknowledged that it had responded to the merits during the grievance process and that denial of a grievance hearing was affirmed; further, the letter written by the employees attorney did not have the effect of filin g a claim for retirement benefits. Garraghty v. Va. Ret. Sys., 45 Va. App. 1, 608 S.E.2d 477, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 44 (2005). Agency decision not subject to review.  In a case involving Virginias State Grievance Procedure, specifically §§ 2.2-3003, 2.2-3004, and 2.2-3006, the Department of Employment Dispute Resoluti ons decision was not subject to review by the circuit court because it involved an interpretation of agency procedures created pursuant to subdivision 2 of § 2.2-1001 rather than an issue of law; also, the delay by the Department of Human Resource Management (DHRM) in rendering its decision on the request for review did not nullify its ruling because subsection A of § 2.2-3006 contained no prohibitory or limiting language preventing the DHRM from ruling after the expiration of 60 days. Va. Dep 't of Taxation v. Brailey, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 19 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Severity of discipline.  University was in its rights when it imposed a discipline upon a campus police officer following an auto accident that was more severe than the discipline it had imposed upon other police officers for similar conduct, but conduct that caused less damage; therefore, a hearing officers decision in a grievance proceeding that the university could not impose a more severe discipline on the officer than what other officers had received for similar conduct was contradictory to law. Siewert v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 58 Va. Cir. 212, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 143 (Richmond Feb. 14, 2002). Hearing officer misapplied subdivision C 6 of § 2.2-3005 in mitigating the termination of a grievant for patient abuse as mitigation was reserved by policy to a training centers management and subsection B of § 2.2-3004 reserved to the management of the center the right to manage the centers affairs and operations. Woodson v. Cent. Va. Training Ctr., 66 Va. Cir. 480, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 457 (Amherst County July 12, 2002). Discipline requiring a hearing.  State employment resolution department erred in determining that e-mail that an office director sent to petitioner, was not discipline that qualified for a hearin g on petitioners grievance regarding an altercation with a fellow employee over what material could be posted at work; the trial court determined that petitioner was entitled to a grievance hearing because the e-mail outlined a course of conduct that was to be followed and how future conduct regarding the issue would be handled, and, thus, qualified as a formal disciplinary action that entitled petitioner to a g...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-3005"><akn:num>§ 2.2-3005</akn:num><akn:heading>Hearing officers; duties</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Nothing in this chapter shall create, nor shall be construed to create, a property interest in selection or assignment to serve as a hearing officer for grievance hearings. B. The Directo r of the Department of Human Resource Management shall assign a hearing officer to conduct the grievance hearing. All hearing officers shall be selected, on a rotating basis, (i) from the list of administrative hearing officers maintained by the Supreme Court of Virginia pursuant to § 2.2-4024 or (ii) from attorneys hired as classified employees by the Department through a competitive selection process. Hearing officer fees shall be reasonable, in accordance with compensation guidelines developed by the Department of Human Resource Management. In addition to the training requirements imposed by the Supreme Court, each hearing officer shall meet the criteria established by the Director pursuant to subdivision 6 of § 2.2-1202.1 and attend annually at least one day of training in employment law or state personnel policies and organizations. The training shall be conducted by the Department of Human Resource Management or an organization approved by the Virginia State Bar for continuing legal educat ion. C. Hearing off icers shall have the following powers and duties: 1. Hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of issues; 2. Dispose of procedural requests; 3. Issue orders requiring testimony or the production of evidence; 4. Administer oaths and affirmations; 5. Receive probative evidence; exclude irrelevant, immaterial, insubstantial, privileged, or repetitive proofs, rebuttals, or cross-examinations; rule upon offers of proof; and oversee a verbatim recording of the evidence; 6. Receive and consider evidence in mitigation or aggravation of any offense charged by an agency in accordance with rules established by the Department of Human Resource Management pursu ant to § 2.2-1202.1; and 7.

CASE NOTES Duty to receiv e and consider evidence in mitigation.  Circuit court erred in finding a violation of subsection C 6 because the hearing officer complied with the duty to receive and consider evidence in mitigation of a corrections officers fraternization offense; the hearing officer received evidence that the corrections officer served as a loyal employee for twenty years as a corrections officer, and the hearing officers decision clearly referenced evidence of the corrections officers positive job performance history. Va. Dep't of Corr. v. Montgomery, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 58 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 3, 2020). Locality procedure decisions.  Decision rendered under a locality procedure is not a decision issued pursuant to § 2.2-3005 or a final grievance hearing decision issued pursuant to subsectio n B of § 2.2-3007; thus, a city managers decision refusing to abide by a personnel board decision that a police officer should be reinstated to his job could not be considered by a Virginia appellate court. Styles v. City of Colonial Heights, 43 V a. App. 588, 600 S.E.2d 174, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 378 (2004). Reversal of hearing officers decision in error.  Upon judicial review of a hearing officers decision to amend a disciplinary notice against two penitentiary employees, the trial court erred by concluding tha t the hearing officer had no authority to amend the disciplinary notice and, therefore, dismissed the Group II disciplinary notice. Because the hearing officers amendment of the disciplinary notice did not violate any statute, judicial precedent, or accepted legal principal, it was proper and should have been upheld. Commonwealth v. Doyle, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (Va. Ct. App. July 5, 2005). Under the State Grievance Procedure, an appeal from a hearing officers interpretation of policy went to the director of the Department of Human Resource Manag ement, not the circuit court. The hearing officers decision contained the findings of fact as to the material issues in the case, as required by subsection C of § 2.2-3005.1 and the circuit court was only to review the administrative record. Commo nwealth v. Needham, 55 Va. App. 316, 685 S.E.2d 857, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 538 (2009). Circuit court erred in reversing a hearing officers decision that granted an employees request for relief and reinstatement to his former position, becaus e the employees grievance went through every procedural step available and policy to which he was entitled, the hearing officer had jurisdiction to take the necessary action, the position was a statutory creation, the hearing officers findings of fact generally reflected positively on the employee, and the Department of Juvenile Justice reassigned the employee arbitrarily or as a form of unwarranted punishment. Va. Dep't of Juvenile Justice v. Milner, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 223 (Va. Ct. App. July 2 1, 2015). Hearing officer did not ex ceed his authority.  Hearing officer acted within the scope of the authority conferred when he held that a corrections officers conduct, though apparently insufficient to sustain a conviction for assault, was enough to mandate termination for cause. Va. Dep't of Corr. v. Compton, 47 Va. App. 202, 623 S.E.2d 397, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 517 (2005). Jurisdiction of court of appeals.  When a party petitioned the circuit court pursuant to subsection D of § 2.2-3006, it did not seek a review of the hearing officers decision on the merits, nor did it seek a modification of the hearing officers decision; rather, those implementation proceedings recognized that the hearing officers decision was final and binding, and the circuit court proceeding was analogous to a proceeding to domes ticate and enforce a foreign judgment. The court found the analytical framework holding that enforcement proceedings were not appeals to trial courts over which the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction convincing; accordingly the petition to the c ircuit court under subsection D of § 2.2-3006 was not an appeal of the grievance panel decision, and because the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction, the court of appeals ordered the appeal transferred to the Supreme Court of Virginia pursuant to § 8.01-677.1.Va. Dep't of Corr. v. Estep, 55 Va. App. 386, 685 S.E.2d 891, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 549 (2009), transferred, No. 092501, 2010 Va. LEXIS 125 (Va. Mar. 16, 2010). Due process rights not violated.  State employees due process rights were not violated in a disciplinary matter because, considering pre-termination and post-termination proceedings that occur red, the employee had adequate notice and the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses who formulated the grounds for the state agencys action against the employee. The hearing officer, in findings that were not contrary to law, complied with the s tatutory directive and considered the agencys delay in disciplining the employee and decided not to mitigate the state agencys discipline. Carpenter v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 108 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 24, 2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Hearing officer exceeded his autho rity.  Hearing officer misapplied subdivision C 6 in mitigating the termination of a grievant for patient abuse as mitigation was reserved by policy to a training center s management and subsection B of § 2.2-3004 reserved to the management of the center the right to manage the centers affairs and operations. Woodson v. Cent. Va. Training Ctr., 66 Va. Cir. 480, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 457 (Amherst County July 12, 2002). Hearing officers decision approved .  State administrative agency employer was entitled to judgment against an employee because, although the employee was aggrieved by a hearing officers finding t hat a written notice was properly issued by the employer to the employee for the employee inadvertently missing a meeting, the employee did not specify any law violated. Furthermore, the hearing officer specifically considered mitigation and gave the app ropriate deference to the agencys determination on the issue. Arceo v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 90 Va. Cir. 135, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 22 (Richmond Mar. 26, 2015), aff'd, No. 0083-16-2, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 191 (Va. Ct. App. July 5, 2016). § 2.2-3005.1.

Upon the re quest of a party to a grievance hearing for an administrative review of the hearing decision, the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management shall determine, within 30 days of the conclusion of any other administrative reviews, whether the h earing decision is consistent with policy. B. Within 30 d ays of a final decision, a party may appeal on the grounds that the determination is contradictory to law by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the circuit court in the jurisdiction in which the grievance arose. The agency shall request and rece ive prior approval of the Director before filing a notice of appeal. After a notice of appeal has been filed by either party, the agency shall then transmit a copy of the grievance record to the clerk of the court. The court, on motion of a party, shall issue a writ of certiorari requiring transmission of the record on or before a certain date. Within 30 days of receipt of the grievance record, the court, sitting without a jury, shall hear the appeal on the record. The court may affirm the decision or m ay reverse or modify the decision. The decision of the court shall be rendered no later than the fifteenth day from the date of the conclusion of the hearing. The circuit court hearing shall be at no cost to the Commonwealth or the grievant. C. The hearing officers final decision shall be effective from the latter of the date issued or the date of the conclusion of any administrative review and judicial appeal, and shall be implemented immediately thereafter, unless circumstances beyond the control of the agency delay such implementation. D. Either part y may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction in the locality in which the grievance arose for an order requiring implementation of the final decision of a hearing officer. E. The court s hall award reasonable attorneys fees and costs to the employee if the employee substantially prevails on the merits of a case brought under subsection B or D.

Acts 2001, cc. 393 and 420 amended § 2.1-116.07:1, from which this section is derived. Pursuant to § 30-152, Acts 2001, cc. 393 and 420 have been give n effect in this section as set out above. The 2001 amendments by cc. 393 and 420 are identical, and deleted the former second sentence of subsection A, which read: In grievances arising out of the Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services that challenge allegations of patient abuse, the Director of the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution shall determine within sixty days of the decision whether the decision is consistent with law. The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 252, in subsection A, substituted 60 for sixty, and deleted the last sentence, which read: The hearing officers d ecision shall be effective from the date issued and shall be implemented immediately unless circumstances beyond the control of the agency delay such implementation; twice substituted 30 for thirty in subsection B; inserted the presen t subsection C; redesignated former subsections C and D as subsections D and E; and substituted subsection B or D for subsection B or C in subsection E.

CASE NOTES The decision must be contradicto ry to law.  State trooper failed to identify a specific statute, constitutional provision, regulation, or judicial decision that was violated by a hearing officers suspen sion of the trooper for three days, and under § 2.2-3006 the trial court had no jurisdiction over the troopers appeal of the hearing officers decision. Va. Dep't of State Police v. Barton, 39 Va. App. 439, 573 S.E.2d 319, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 7 56 (2002). Where an agency failed to show that a hearing officers decision contradicted any law, the circuit courts ruling, unduly limiting the officers authorit y and overturning the officers decision, was reversed to reinstate the officers decision. Tatum v. Va. Dep't of Agric. Consumer Servs., 41 Va. App. 110, 582 S.E.2d 452, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 356 (2003) (reversing 59 Va. Cir. 262 (2002)). When an employee contesting the employees termination asserted that the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services did not follow procedures i n the applicable grievance procedures manual, such alleged failure did not require reversal of the departments decision because: (1) under subsection A of § 2.2-3001, the Director of the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution policed complian ce with grievance procedures; and (2) courts ensured an administrative decision was not contradictory to law, under subsection B of § 2.2-3006, but the grievance procedures manual was not law. Burke v. Catawba Hosp., 59 Va. App. 828, 722 S.E.2 d 684, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2012). Circuit court erred in determining that a hearing officers decision was contradictory to law and misapplied the appropriate standard of review in reaching tha t decision because it acted as the fact finder and substituted its judgment for that of a hearing officer when it determined that mitigation based on inconsistent application of discipline was inappropriate in the case, and the hearing officers decis ion was final and not subject to judicial review as a matter of law.

Circuit court properly affirmed a decision by a hearing officer in an employees grievance against the Virginia Department of State Police (VDSP) because the e mployee failed to state how the hearing officers rulings were contradictory to law and outside of the scope of judicial review where the employee, there was insufficient evidence that the disciplinary action was based on a dislike of the empl oyee rather than his work performance, VDSPs General Orders were not laws for the purposes of judicial review, and VDSP was not statutorily required to mediate an employee dispute whenever he or she requested it. Passaro v. Va. Dep't of State Police, 67 Va. App. 357, 796 S.E.2d 439, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 39 (2017). State employees due process rights were not violated in a disciplinary matter because, considering pre-termination and post-termination proceedings that occur red, the employee had adequate notice and the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses who formulated the grounds for the state agencys action against the employee. The hearing officer, in findings that were not contrary to law, complied with the s tatutory directive and considered the agencys delay in disciplining the employee and decided not to mitigate the state agencys discipline. Carpenter v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 108 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 24, 2018). As an appeal presented a question of pure law requiring a de novo review of the hearing officers final decision, it was unnecessary to address the circuit cou rts legal conclusions; therefore, the court of appeals conducted an independent review of the record to determine whether the hearing officers third and final determination was contradictory to law. Osterloh v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 351 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2018). Find ings of fact and evidence issues not subject to review.  State employees appeal from a hearing officers decision was properly dismissed because the employee failed to state how that decision was contradictory to law and what law was contradicted, as required by subsection C of § 2.2-3005.1. Issues relating to evidence, witness credibility, and findings of fact were beyond the scope of review of the trial court pursuant to subsection B of § 2.2-3006. Kone v. Va. Dep't of State Police, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 517 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2009). Several of a former employees questions presented were not subject to judicial review in her appeal of a judgment affirming a hearing officers finding tha t the Virginia Department of Veterans Services did not discriminate against her because the questions involved either factual determinations made by the hearing officer or policy determinations made by the the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management; Veterans Services retaliatory motives in deciding to eliminate the employees position and lay her off and the discriminatory nature of the layoff were factual questions, and whether Veterans Services misapplied the layoff policy invo lved a determination of whether the hearing officers decision was consistent with policy and was not subject to judicial review. Earman v. Va. Dep't of Veterans Servs., 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 424 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2010). Remand to the agency when the record is insufficient.  Circuit courts order remanding an employment matter to a hearing officer for a new hearing because a tape of the grievance proceedings had been lost, precludi ng its review of the hearing officers decision, and was not a final order a...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-3007"><akn:num>§ 2.2-3007</akn:num><akn:heading>Certain employees of the Departments of Corrections and Juvenile Justice</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. Applicability.  Since a majority of council members did not vote on the retailers applications for rezoning and special use permits, the town councils vote, by less than a majority of council members, meant that a quorum had not voted on the applications, and, thus, the three council members vote to approve the applications was invalid; too, it did not matter that some of the missing council members had absented themselv es pursuant to the State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act (COIA), § 2.2-3100 et seq., since COIA did not apply the laws involving Meetings of Governing Bodies since those laws had nothing to do with conflicts of interests. Jakabc in v. Town of Front Royal, 271 Va. 660, 628 S.E.2d 319, 2006 Va. LEXIS 49 (2006). Conflicts of interest are proscribed precisely because they may compromise or affect judgment of public servants at the expense of private citizens. If, at the time the transaction is pending, it is reasonably foreseeable that the public servants personal interest could benefit or suffer from his participation in that transactio n, the conflict and the danger it poses to the public interest arise at the moment the transaction occurs. West v. Jones, 228 Va. 409, 323 S.E.2d 96, 1984 Va. LEXIS 318 (1984). Public servants interest may not exceed that as member of public at large.  A public servant whose interest is involved in a transaction may participate in that transaction only when his interest is one limited to that which he sh ares in common with other members of the public at large. West v. Jones, 228 Va. 409, 323 S.E.2d 96, 1984 Va. LEXIS 318 (1984). High school principal may not nominate or appoint school board members.  The former Comprehensive Conflict of Interests Act of 1984 prohibited school principal from participating in the nomination and appointment of members of the scho ol board so long as he was employed by the board. West v. Jones, 228 Va. 409, 323 S.E.2d 96, 1984 Va. LEXIS 318 (1984). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Public disclosure of bus iness relationships.  Trial court properly dismissed the owners amended complaint against a town council because public disclosure of business relationships with persons having int erests in lands subject to a zoning application was statutorily required and the Conflicts of Interest Act made voting members of a city council and zoning commission subject to prosecution for malfeasance, removal from office, forfeitures to local gover nment and other penalties, but did not provide parties appearing before such bodies, a member of which had a conflict of interest, to recover compensatory or punitive damages against the governing body and did not give rise to a civil cause of action. Bu zzell v. Town Council of Kilmarnock, 96 Va. Cir. 425, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 2079 (Lancaster County June 30, 2009). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Member of County Board of Supervisors employed by public service authority.  Member of a county board of supervisors is not prohibited from retaining his or her position on the board upon the acceptance of employment as executive director of a public service authority; however acceptance of such a position will increase likelihood of conflicts of interest.

See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. William A. Bell, Jr., Secretary, Isle of Wight County Elect oral Board, 11-070, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 41 (9/30/11).

See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. William A. Bell, Jr., Secretary, Isle of Wight County Electoral Board, 11-070, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 41 (9/30/11).

CASE NOTES Appointment of agency officers by agency employee not authorized by this section.  Former § 2.1-606 (see now this section) has two effects. It forbids a member of a local governing body to have a personal interest in certain contracts with a governmental agency if the majority of the officers of that agency are appointed by the local governing body. And, by way of exception, it permits a member of a local governing body to hold a job with such an agency. Nothing in the section authorizes suc h a person who works for such an agency to participate in the appointment of the officers of that agency. West v. Jones, 228 Va. 409, 323 S.E.2d 96, 1984 Va.

No requirement that resolution be approved by unanimous vote.  Subdivision B 3 of this section does not state that the resolution must be approved by a unanimous vote of the remaining members of the governing body. It simply provides that only those members who do not have a personal interest in the contract may vote on the resolution. Harris v. Ingram, 240 Va. 46, 392 S.E.2d 816, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2562, 1990 Va.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  Since a majority of council members did not vote on the retailers applications for rezoning and special use permits, the town councils vote, by less than a majority of council members, meant that a quorum had not voted on the applications, and, thus, the three council members vote to approve the applications was invalid; too, it did not matter that some of the missing council members had absented themselv es pursuant to the State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act (COIA), § 2.2-3100 et seq., since COIA did not apply the laws involving Meetings of Governing Bodies since those laws had nothing to do with conflicts of interests.

CASE NOTES Exemption not applicable.  Where the exemption applies to one who has been employed prior to a relative becoming a member of the school board, since the verb form used is the presen t perfect tense, which denotes an action beginning in the past and continuing to the present, and teachers interpretation of the exemption, namely, employment at any time before the conflict arose, would require use of a verb form in the past perfect tense, that is, had been employed, i.e., an event beginning and ending in the past, the exemption contained in this section was not applicable to teacher because she was not regularly employed by the board at the time her brother-in-law was appo inted to the board. Williams v. Augusta County Sch. Bd., 248 Va. 124, 445 S.E.2d 118, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1496, 1994 Va. LEXIS 85 (1994) (decided under prior law). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Subsection E exception.  Subsection E of § 2.2-3119 can be harmonized with other statutes that require the school board to retain ultimate authority for hiring decisions. Subsection E does not require that the school board forfeit that authority; rather, it requires that the superintendent independently reaches a determination about the qualifications of an applicant who is married to or related to a school board member and to do so w ithout any involvement of the school board in that hiring decision. Upon receiving the superintendents recommendation, the non-conflicted school board members then can vote on the applicant. The requirements of subsection E are satisfied when a schoo l board member recuses himself and certifies on the record that he had no involvement in the decision to hire his spouse or relative. Section 2.2-3126 authorizes a Commonwealths Attorney or citizens to file suits for violations of the Conflicts Act, such a suit would be unsuccessful when the strictures of subsection E of § 2.2-3119 are followed because no violation of the Act would have occurred.

Virginia Personnel Act, § 2.2-2400 et seq., exempted from coverage officers and employees for whom the constitution directed the manner of selection; this incl uded the attorney general and, derivatively, any of his appointed employees, and, thus, those employees were ineligible for severance benefits under the Worker Transition Act, § 2.2-3203 et seq.

B. It is the p olicy of the Commonwealth that all covered entities shall conduct themselves in accordance with the following principles: (i) individuals who are blind or visually impaired have the right to full participation in the life of the Commonwealth, including t he use of advanced technology that is provided by such covered entities for use by employees, program participants, and members of the general public, and (ii) technology purchased in whole or in part with funds provided by the Commonwealth to be used fo r the creation, storage, retrieval, or dissemination of information and intended for use by employees, program participants, and members of the general public shall be adaptable for access by individuals who are blind or visually impaired.

Since the s pirit of volunteerism has long animated generations of Americans to give of their time and abilities to help others, the Commonwealth would be wise to make use of volunteers in state service wherever practically possible.

This chapte r may be cited as The Virginia Freedom of Information Act. B. By enacting this chapter, the General Assembly ensures the people of the Commonwealth ready access to public records in the custody of a public body or its officers and employees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is bei ng conducted. The affairs of government are not intended to be conducted in an atmosphere of secrecy since at all times the public is to be the beneficiary of any action taken at any level of government. Unless a public body or its officers or employees specifically elect to exercise an exemption provided by this chapter or any other statute, every meeting shall be open to the public and all public records shall be available for inspection and copying upon request. All public records and meetings shall be presumed open, unless an exemption is properly invoked.The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote an increased awareness by all persons of governmental activities and afford every opportunity to citizens to witness the oper ations of government. Any exemption from public access to records or meetings shall be narrowly construed and no record shall be withheld or meeting closed to the public unless specifically made exempt pursuant to this chapter or other specific provision of law. This chapter shall not be construed to discourage the free discussion by government officials or employees of public matters with the citizens of the Commonwealth.All public bodies and their officers and employees shall make reasonable efforts t o reach an agreement with a requester concerning the production of the records requested.Any ordinance adopted by a local governing body that conflicts with the provisions of this chapter shall be void.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. Constitutionality.  Although the Virginias Freedom of Information Act, § 2.2-3700 et seq., discriminates against noncitizens of Virginia, it does not discriminate against inte rstate commerce or out-of-state economic interests; the object of the Freedom of Information Act is to provide a mechanism for access and copying of public records to Virginia citizens to reflect that the affairs of government are not conducted in an atm osphere of secrecy, subsection B of § 2.2-3700. The Freedom of Information Act is wholly silent as to commerce or economic interests, both in and out of Virginia; therefore, the Freedom of Information Act does not facially, or in its effect, discrimin ate against interstate commerce or out-of-state economic interests. McBurney v. Young, 667 F.3d 454, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 1872 (4th Cir. 2012), aff'd, 569 U.S. 221, 133 S. Ct. 1709, 185 L. Ed. 2d 758, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 3317 (2013). The policy expressly stated in this section is that this chapter shall be liberally cons trued to enable citizens to observe the operations of government and that the exemptions shall be narrowly construed in order that nothing which should be public may be hidden from any person. City of Danville v. Laird, 223 Va. 271, 288 S.E.2d 429, 1982 Va. LEXIS 199 (1982). Purpose of this chapter is to remove any necessity for a reporter seeking access to a re port or document in an agencys file to resort to subornation on the part of public employees, by providing him with a prompt and easy remedy to secure access to such document. If the agency refused access improperly, the reporter would have his remed y and would be awarded in addition attorneys fees and costs against the agency. There is accordingly no need for the reporter to engage in protracted pressure to induce a public employee to engage in subornation in violation of his duty under the reg ulations governing his employment. Jurgensen v. Fairfax County, 745 F.2d 868, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 17956 (4th Cir. 1984). Section 2.2-3704, restricting access to information under Virginias Freedom of Information Act to Virginia citizens did not abridge the ability of petitioner, an out-of-state searcher for his title company clients, to engage in a common calling in the sense the Privileges and Immunities Clause prohibited and there was no constitutional violation by defendant state officials in denying the information sought; the state Freedom of Information Act essentially represented a mechanism by which those who ultimately held sovereign power (i.e., the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia) could obtain an accounting from the public officials to whom they delegate th e exercise of that power as provided by Va. Const. art. I, § 2 and subsection B of § 2.2-3700. McBurney v. Young, 569 U.S. 221, 133 S. Ct. 1709, 185 L. Ed. 2d 758, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 3317 (2013). Definitions.  There is no practical distinction between the terms exemption and exclusion within the context of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Am. Tra dition Inst. v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 287 Va. 330, 756 S.E.2d 435, 2014 Va. LEXIS 54 (2014). Circuit court erred in its interpretation and application of the personnel information exemption under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act because the circuit court allowed the Town to withhold the entirety of all five documents at issue without any redactions, using definitions of personnel record under a prior version of this provision. Hawkins v. Town of South Hill, 878 S.E.2d 408, 2022 Va. LEXIS 7 2 (Va. 2022).

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  The prisoner exclusion provision in subsection C is not subject to a facial overbreadth challenge because it does not carry the threat of prosecution for violatin g the statute and it does not restrict expressive speech but simply regulates access to information in the possession of Virginia state agencies. Fisher v. King, 232 F.3d 391, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 28962 (4th Cir. 2000)(decided under prior provisions). The First Amendment did not provide a prisoner, as a member of the general public, a right of physical access to an audio tape that was played in open court in a criminal trial, admitted into evidence, and for which he possessed a complete verbatim transcript. Fisher v. King, 232 F.3d 391, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 28962 (4th Cir. 2000)(decided under prior provisions). Prisoner exclusion provision of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, subsection C of § 2.2-3703, was not facially unconstitutional as there were numerous r ational reasons for it, such as preventing frivolous requests that would unduly burden state resources, and it was not unconstitutional as applied to an inmate, who sought records regarding his medical condition to determine if he had a viable claim agai nst various state department of correction officials, because even if the inmates request was not frivolous, he was not thereby denied equal protection, and the exclusion did not deny the inmates access to the courts as it did not obstruct his ab ility to file suit challenging his medical treatment. Giarratano v. Johnson, 456 F. Supp. 2d 747, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74882 (W.D. Va. 2006), aff'd, 521 F.3d 298, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 6144 (4th Cir. 2008). Prisoner exclusion from the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, subsection C of § 2.2-3703, did not violate equal protection, due process, or the right of acc ess to the courts because an inmates conclusory allegation that this provision was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest was insufficient to overcome the presumption of rationality of the law; while the inmate did not file frivolous c omplaints, his conclusory allegation also failed to show an as-applied equal protection violation; and denial of the inmates information request under subsection C did not obstruct his capability to file suit. Giarratano v. Johnson, 521 F.3d 298, 200 8 U.S. App. LEXIS 6144 (4th Cir. 2008). Standing.  District court dismissed an action which a state inmate filed under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983, alleging that Virginia officials violated his rights under the U.S. Con stitution when they denied his request under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act for police reports and other information that pertained to his conviction on charges of abduction and spousal rape. The court found that the inmate did not have standing to challenge § 2.2-3703(C), the statute that allowed Commonwealth officials to deny requests for information they received from prisoners. Patterson v. Mundy, No. 7:05CV00474, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38216 (W.D. Va. Dec. 16, 2005), aff'd, 183 Fed. Appx . 340, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 13449 (4th Cir. 2006). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Inmates request for records.  None of an inmates constitutionally protected rights were denied as a result of a police officials exercise of an exemption pursuant to the Virginia Freed om of Information Act (FOIA) nor did the inmate point to any such rights; in addition, the FOIA did not clearly establish any right on the part of the inmate to access the criminal investigative reports in the custody of the police department. Chavez v. Manger, 62 Va. Cir. 146, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 98 (Fairfax County June 10, 2003).

Except as o therwise specifically provided by law, all public records shall be open to citizens of the Commonwealth, representatives of newspapers and magazines with circulation in the Commonwealth, and representatives of radio and television stations broadcasting i n or into the Commonwealth during the regular office hours of the custodian of such records. Access to such records shall be provided by the custodian in accordance with this chapter by inspection or by providing copies of the requested records, at the o ption of the requester. The custodian may require the requester to provide his name and legal address. The custodian of such records shall take all necessary precautions for their preservation and safekeeping. B. A request f or public records shall identify the requested records with reasonable specificity. The request need not make reference to this chapter in order to invoke the provisions of this chapter or to impose the time limits for response by a public body. Any publ ic body that is subject to this chapter and that is the custodian of the requested records shall promptly, but in all cases within five working days of receiving a request, provide the requested records to the requester or make one of the following respo nses in writing: 1. The r equested records are being entirely withheld. Such response shall identify with reasonable particularity the volume and subject matter of withheld records, and cite, as to each category of withheld records, the specific Code section that authorizes the w ithholding of the records. 2. The requested records are being provided in part and are being withheld in part. Such response shall identify with reasonable particularity the subject matter of withheld portions, and cite, as to each category of withheld records, the specific Code section that authorizes the withholding of the records. 3. The requested records could not be found or do not exist. However, if the public body that received the request knows that another public body has the requested records, the response s hall include contact information for the other public body. 4. It is not practically possible to provide the requested records or to determine whether they are available within the five-work-day period. Such response shall specify the conditions t hat make a response impossible. If the response is made within five working days, the public body shall have an additional seven work days or, in the case of a request for criminal investigative files pursuant to § 2.2-3706.1, 60 work days in which to provide one of the four preceding responses. C. Any public body may petition the appropriate court for additional time to respond to a request for records when the request is for an extraordinary volume of records or requires an extraordinarily lengthy search, and a response by the public body within the time re quired by this chapter will prevent the public body from meeting its operational responsibilities. Before proceeding with the petition, however, the public body shall make reasonable efforts to reach an agreement with the requester concerning the product ion of the records requested. D. Subject to the provisions of subsection G, no public body shall be required to create a new record if the record does not already exist. However, a public body may abstract or summarize information under such terms and conditions as agreed between the requester and the public body. E. Failure to respond to a request for records shall be deemed a denial of the request and shall constitute a violation of this chapter. F. Except with regard to scholastic records requested pursuant to subdivision A 1 of § 2.2-3705.4 that must be made available for inspection pursuant to the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. § 1232g) and such requests for scholastic re cords by a parent or legal guardian of a minor student or by a student who is 18 years of age or older, a public body may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, or searching for the requested records and shall make all reasonable efforts to supply the requested records at the lowest possible cost. No public body shall impose any extraneous, intermediary, or surplus fees or expenses to recoup the general costs associated with creating or maint aining records or transacting the general business of the public body. Any duplicating fee charged by a public body shall not exceed the actual cost of duplication. The public body may also make a reasonable charge for the cost incurred in supplying reco rds produced from a geographic information system at the request of anyone other than the owner of the land that is the subject of the request. However, such charges shall not exceed the actual cost to the public body in supplying such records, except th at the public body may charge, on a pro rata per acre basis, for the cost of creating topographical maps developed by the public body, for such maps or portions thereof, which encompass a contiguous area greater than 50 acres. Prior to conducting a searc h for records, the public body shall notify the requester in writing that the public body may make reasonable charges not to exceed its actual cost incurred in accessing, duplicating, supplying, or searching for requested records and inquire of the reque ster whether he would like to request a cost estimate in advance of the supplying of the requested records. The public body shall provide the requester with a cost estimate if requested. The period within which the public body shall respond under this se ction shall be tolled for the amount of time that elapses between notice of the cost estimate and the response of the requester. If the public body receives no response from the requester within 30 days of sending the cost estimate, the request shall be deemed to be withdrawn. Any costs incurred by the public body in estimating the cost of supplying the requested records shall be applied toward the overall charges to be paid by the requester for the supplying of such requested records. G. Public reco rds maintained by a public body in an electronic data processing system, computer database, or any other structured collection of data shall be made available to a requester at a reasonable cost, not to exceed the actual cost in accordance with subsectio n F. When electronic or other databases are combined or contain exempt and nonexempt records, the public body may provide access to the exempt records if not otherwise prohibited by law, but shall provide access to the nonexempt records as provided by th is chapter. Public bodies shall produce nonexempt records maintained in an electronic database in any tangible medium identified by the requester, including, where the public body has the capability, the option of posting the records on a website or delivering the records through an electronic mail address provided by the requester, if that medium is used by the public body in the regular course of business. No public body shall b e required to produce records from an electronic database in a format not regularly used by the public body. However, the public body shall make reasonable efforts to provide records in any format under such terms and conditions as agreed between the req uester and public body, including the payment of reasonable costs. The excision of exempt fields of information from a database or the conversion of data from one available format to another shall not be deemed the creation, preparation, or compilation o f a new public record. H. In any case where a public body determines in advance that charges for producing the requested records are likely to exceed $200, the public body may, before continuing to process the request, require the requester to pay a deposit not to exceed the amount of the a dvance determination. The deposit shall be credited toward the final cost of supplying the requested records. The period within which the public body shall respond under this section shall be tolled for the amount of time that elapses between notice of t he advance determination and the response of the requester. I. Before proc essing a request for records, a public body may require the requester to pay any amounts owed to the public body for previous requests for records that remain unpaid 30 days or more after billing. J. In the even t a public body has transferred possession of public records to any entity, including but not limited to any other public body, for storage, maintenance, or archiving, the public body initiating the transfer of such records shall remain the custodian of such records for purposes of responding to requests for public records made pursuant to this chapter and shall be responsible for retrieving and supplying such public records to the requester. In the event a public body has transferred public records for storage, maintenance, or archiving and such transferring public body is no longer in existence, any public body that is a successor to the transferring public body shall be deemed the custodian of such records. In the event no successor entity exists, t he entity in possession of the public records shall be deemed the custodian of the records for purposes of compliance with this chapter, and shall retrieve and supply such records to the requester. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to apply t o records transferred to the Library of Virginia for permanent archiving pursuant to the duties imposed by the Virginia Public Records Act (§ 42.1-76 et seq.). In accordance with § 42.1-79, the Library of Virginia shall be the custodian of such per manently archived records and shall be responsible for responding to requests for such records made pursuant to this chapter.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS E-mail communications not meeting.   E-mails sent by county school board members in the days leading up to the vote to close an elementary school did not involve sufficient simultaneity to constitute a meeting under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, § 2.2-3701, because the e-mails were used consecutively, rather than co-operatively, and the members never reached any sort of group consensus or discussed business as if they were sitting in a room, virtual or real, chatting with each other; individual attempts to ascertain other members positions on the issue did not violate the Acts open meeting provisions because there was no evidence of a collective intent on behalf of any three m embers or the board as a whole to move toward a decision outside of the context of a public meeting.

No closed m eeting shall be held unless the public body proposing to convene such meeting has taken an affirmative recorded vote in an open meeting approving a motion that (i) identifies the subject matter, (ii) states the purpose of the meeting as authorized in sub section A of § 2.2-3711 or other provision of law and (iii) cites the applicable exemption from open meeting requirements provided in subsection A of § 2.2-3711 or other provision of law. The matters contained in such motion shall be set forth in d etail in the minutes of the open meeting. A general reference to the provisions of this chapter, the authorized exemptions from open meeting requirements, or the subject matter of the closed meeting shall not be sufficient to satisfy the requirements for holding a closed meeting. B. The notice provisions of this chapter shall not apply to closed meetings of any public body held solely for the purpose of interviewing candidates for the position of chief administrative officer. Prior to any such closed meeting for the purpose of interviewing can didates, the public body shall announce in an open meeting that such closed meeting shall be held at a disclosed or undisclosed location within 15 days thereafter.

Any member of the public body who believes that there was a departure from the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii), shall so state prior to the vote, indicating the substance of the departure that, in his j udgment, has taken place. The statement shall be recorded in the minutes of the public body. E. Failure of the certification required by subsection D to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the public body present during a meeting shall not affect the validity or confidentiality of such meeting with respect to matters considered therei n in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The recorded vote and any statement made in connection therewith, shall upon proper authentication, constitute evidence in any proceeding brought to enforce the provisions of this chapter. F. A public bo dy may permit nonmembers to attend a closed meeting if such persons are deemed necessary or if their presence will reasonably aid the public body in its consideration of a topic that is a subject of the meeting. G. A member of a public body shall be permitted to attend a closed meeting held by any committee or subcommittee of that public body, or a closed meeting of any entity, however designated, created to perform the delegated functions of or to advise that public body.

In addition to the requirements of § 2.2-3707, the minutes of the committee or other entity shall include the identity of the member of t he parent public body who attended the closed meeting. H. Except as s pecifically authorized by law, in no event may any public body take action on matters discussed in any closed meeting, except at an open meeting for which notice was given as required by § 2.2-3707.

CASE NOTES Nonmember attendance.  Doctor involved in medical license revocation proceeding did not have the doctors due process rights violated when the board allowed people who were not membe rs of the state board of medicine to attend the boards closed session. The board, pursuant to subsection F of § 2.2-3712, was specifically authorized to permit nonmembers to attend a closed meeting if such persons were deemed necessary or if their presence would reasonably aid the public body in its consideration of a topic, and the doctor did not show prejudice from that decision. Vuyyuru v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2008). Closed meeting to discuss previously awarded public contract improper.  Subdivision A 30 [now A 29] of § 2.2-3711 does not allow a public body to close a meeting in order to discuss the application or enforcement of the scope or te rms of a previously awarded public contract. White Dog Publ., Inc. v. Culpeper County Bd. of Supervisors, 272 Va. 377, 634 S.E.2d 334, 2006 Va. LEXIS 81 (2006). Closed meeting to discuss library closure improper.  Board of supervisors discussions in closed sessions violated the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, § 2.2-3700 et seq., as the information and discussion s concerning the economic viability of the library were too attenuated from litigation in which plaintiffs sought to be reinstated as library board members. Cole v. Smyth Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 298 Va. 625, 842 S.E.2d 389, 2020 Va. LEXIS 56 (2020). Subject matter of closed meeting not sufficiently identified.  Circuit court erred in holding that a board of supervisors did not violate the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, § 2.2-3700 et seq., when it passed motions to hold sessions closed to the public where although the motions properly identified the purpose of the closed sessions and subdivision A 7 of § 2.2-3711 as the applicable statutory exemption, the motions failed to include a subject matter for the clo sed sessions at all, and the mention of actual or probable litigation was too general to adequately identify the subject matter. Cole v. Smyth Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, 298 Va. 625, 842 S.E.2d 389, 2020 Va. LEXIS 56 (2020). Attorneys fees and costs.  As newspaper publishers substantially prevailed in their suit against a county board of supervisors for violating the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, § 2.2-3700 et seq., by holding a closed meeting, they were entitled to an award of attorneys fees and reasonable costs under subsection D of § 2.2-3713. The fact that the boards violation was not willful and knowing was not a special c ircumstance that would make such an award unjust. White Dog Publ., Inc. v.

Any person, including the attorney for the Commonwealth acting in his official or individual capacity, denied the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter may proceed to enforce such rights and privileges by filing a petition for mandamus or injunction, supp orted by an affidavit showing good cause. Such petition may be brought in the name of the person notwithstanding that a request for public records was made by the persons attorney in his representative capacity. Venue for the petition shall be addres sed as follows: 1. In a case involving a local public body, to the general district court or circuit court of the county or city from which the public body has been elected or appointed to serve and in which such rights and privileges were so denied; 2. In a case involving a regional public body, to the general district or circuit court of the county or city where the principal business office of such body is located; and 3. In a case involving a board, bureau, commission, authority, district, institution, or agency of the state government, including a public institution of higher education, or a standing or other committee of the General Assembly, to the general district court or the circuit court of the residence of the aggrieved party or of the City of Richmond. B. In any acti on brought before a general district court, a corporate petitioner may appear through its officer, director or managing agent without the assistance of counsel, notwithstanding any provision of law or Rule of Supreme Court of Virginia to the contrary. C. Notwithstan ding the provisions of § 8.01-644, the petition for mandamus or injunction shall be heard within seven days of the date when the same is made, provided the party against whom the petition is brought has received a copy of the petition at least three w orking days prior to filing. However, if the petition or the affidavit supporting the petition for mandamus or injunction alleges violations of the open meetings requirements of this chapter, the three-day notice to the party against whom the petition is brought shall not be required. The hearing on any petition made outside of the regular terms of the circuit court of a locality that is included in a judicial circuit with another locality or localities shall be given precedence on the docket of such co urt over all cases that are not otherwise given precedence by law. D. The petitio n shall allege with reasonable specificity the circumstances of the denial of the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter. A single instance of denial of the rights and privileges conferred by this chapter shall be sufficient to invoke the remedi es granted herein. If the court finds the denial to be in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the petitioner shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs, including costs and reasonable fees for expert witnesses, and attorney fees from the publ ic body if the petitioner substantially prevails on the merits of the case, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust. In making this determination, a court may consider, among other things, the reliance of a public body on an opinion of th e Attorney General or a decision of a court that substantially supports the public bodys position. E. In any acti on to enforce the provisions of this chapter, the public body shall bear the burden of proof to establish an exclusion by a preponderance of the evidence. No court shall be required to accord any weight to the determination of a public body as to whether an exclusion applies. Any failure by a public body to follow the procedures established by this chapter shall be presumed to be a violation of this chapter. F. Failure by any person to request and receive notice of the time and place of meetings as provided in § 2.2-3707 shall not preclude any person from enforcing his rights and privileges conferred by this chapter.

No. 6-1201 Petition for Writ of Mandamus against Officer of a Corporation, et seq.; No. 9-1302 Petition for Injunction or Mandamu s  Freedom of Information Acts, et seq. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. This section is unconstitutional as applied to State Corporation Commission.  Where petitioner invoked jurisdiction of circuit court, and filed petition for writ of mandamus against State Corporation Commission (SCC), trial court correctly ruled that this section was not constitutional as applied to the SCC because of jurisdictional limitations of Va. Const., Art. IX, § 4. Framers of Va. Const., Art. IX, § 4, intended that Supreme Court have exclusive jurisdiction over all challenges to all actions of the SCC, both judgmental and ministerial, and issuance of writ of mandamus directing SCC to reverse its action in refusing petitioners demand for access to official records was equivalent to entry of injunction restraining SCC in t he performance of its official duties. Atlas Underwriters, Ltd. v. SCC, 237 Va. 45, 375 S.E.2d 733, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1388, 1989 Va. LEXIS 3 (1989). Extraordinary relief not to be casually or perfunctorily ordered.  Under this section, a single violation is sufficient to permit the grant of relief based on the inference that future violations will occur, but such an extraordi nary and drastic remedy is not to be casually or perfunctorily ordered. Nageotte v. Board of Supvrs., 223 Va. 259, 288 S.E.2d 423, 1982 Va. LEXIS 198 (1982). The petition need not contain an allegation of irreparable injury. WTAR Radio-TV Corp. v. City Council, 216 Va. 892, 223 S.E.2d 895, 1976 Va. LEXIS 222 (1976). Petition suppo rted by affidavit showing good cause.  Circuit court erred in dismissing appellants petition to enforce the Virginia Freedom of Information Act because her petition satisfied the requirements of th is statute as it was supported by an affidavit showing good cause because the petition alleged that the Rappahannock County Board of Supervisors improperly discussed public business matters during five closed meetings, and that the Boards post-meetin g certifications to the contrary were false; those allegations were supported by appellants affidavit; and appellants sworn allegations were corroborated by a Board members acknowledgment, wherein the Board member admitted that the Board impr operly discussed public business matters during some or all of the closed meetings. Bragg v. Bd. of Supervisors, 295 Va. 416, 813 S.E.2d 331, 2018 Va. LEXIS 59 (2018). Injunctive relief discretionary and not granted unless violation willful, knowing, and substantial.  Although this section permits injunctive relief upon proof of a single violation of the act, based upon the inference that future violations will occur, such reli ef remains discretionary with the court and it will not be granted unless the court finds that the violation was willful, knowing, and substantial. Hale v. Washington County School Bd., 241 Va. 76, 400 S.E.2d 175, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1313, 1991 Va. LEXIS 9 (1 991). Inference insufficient to justify sanction.  A previous course of conduct might raise an inference that such conduct would be repeated but a mere inference did not support an apprehension with reasonable pro bability such as would have justified imposition of a judicial sanction against a legislative body. WTAR Radio-TV Corp. v. City Council, 216 Va. 892, 223 S.E.2d 895, 1976 Va. LEXIS 222 (1976). When injunctive relief, etc. , not justified.  The 1976 amendment to this section in effect permits a trial court to infer from a single violation that future violations will follow. However, where the court e xpresses the view that there will be no future violations, there is no justification for injunctive relief....</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-3714"><akn:num>§ 2.2-3714</akn:num><akn:heading>Violations and penalties</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Penalty not imposed when violation not knowingly or willfully made.  No civil penalty was imposed after it was determined that a chairman of a county board of supervisors violated the Virginia Freedom of Information Act by failing to adequately respond to a landowners request for public records because the chairmans failure to timely respond to the request was not knowing or willful; the chairmans assistant acted promptly upon being informed of the failure to make a ti mely response, attempted to get an extension, and acted responsibly to fulfill his obligations under the provisions of a district court order.

An in dividuals privacy is directly affected by the extensive collection, maintenance, use and dissemination of personal information; 2. The increasing use of computers and sophisticated information technology has greatly magnified the harm that can occur from these practices; 3. An individuals opportunities to secure employment, insurance, credit, and his right to due process, and other legal protections are endangered by the misuse of certain of these per sonal information systems; and 4. In order to preserve the rights guaranteed a citizen in a free society, legislation is necessary to establish procedures to govern information systems containing records on individuals . C. Recordkeepi ng agencies of the Commonwealth and political subdivisions shall adhere to the following principles of information practice to ensure safeguards for personal privacy: 1. There shall be no personal information system whose existence is secret. 2. Information shall not be collected unless the need for it has been clearly established in advance. 3. Information shall be appropriate and relevant to the purpose for which it has been collected. 4. Information shall not be obtained by fraudulent or unfair means. 5. Information shall not be used unless it is accurate and current. 6. There shall be a prescribed procedure for an individual to learn the purpose for which information has been recorded and particulars about its use and dissemination. 7. There shall be a clearly prescribed and uncomplicated procedure for an individual to correct, erase or amend inaccurate, obsolete or irrelevant information. 8. Any agency holding personal information shall assure its reliability and take precautions to prevent its misuse. 9. There shall be a clearly prescribed procedure to prevent personal information collected for one purpose from being used or disseminated for another purpose unless such use or dissemina tion is authorized or required by law. 10. The Commonwealth or any agency or political subdivision thereof shall not collect personal information except as explicitly or implicitly authorized by law.

CASE NOTES Automated lice nse plate recognition system lawful.  Police departments passive use of an Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system to capture license plates, photographs of the vehicles, and the date, t ime, and GPS location of the vehicles did not run afoul of the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act because the ALPR database itself did not contain the name, personal number, or other identifying particulars of an individual; there was no evidence the department was keeping any of information within the system. Neal v. Fairfax Cty. Police Dep't, 299 Va. 253, 849 S.E.2d 123, 2020 Va. LEXIS 121 (2020). Text of the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act (Data Act) covers a record-keeping process, and since the courts are dealing with records, to keep as intended by the Data Act is to preserve, maintain or to maintain a record; the ability to query data in a variety of databases does not offend the Data Act if none of that data is kept in the Automated License Plate Rec ognition system since having access to data is not the same as keeping it. Neal v. Fairfax Cty. Police Dep't, 299 Va. 253, 849 S.E.2d 123, 2020 Va. LEXIS 121 (2020). Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act does not apply to constitutional officers.  Court held that constitutional officer does not come within the definition of agency in § 2.2-3801 of the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act, §§ 2.2-3800 to 2.2-3809, therefore, the act did not apply to a city treasurer who allegedly gave a newspaper reporter information from a former city employees employment file. The case was decided before the 2003 amendment to § 2.2-3801 specifically included constitutional officers in the definition of agency. Carraway v. Hill, 265 Va. 20, 574 S.E.2d 274, 2003 Va.

The Supreme Court concluded that the police departments sweeping randomized surveillance and collec tion of personal information does not deal with investigations and intelligence gathering related to criminal activity and, therefore if the automated license plate readers database is determined to be an information system, it is not exempt from the ope ration of the Data Act.

CASE NOTES Public access to records.  Section 2.2-3704, restricting access to information under Virginias Freedom of Information Act to Virginia citizens did not abridge the ability of petitioner, an out-of-state searcher for his title company clients, to engage in a common calling in the sense the Privileges and Immunities Clause prohibited and a claim of constitutional violation by defendant state officials for denying the information sought fa iled; many records were available through other means, such as through discovery or subpoenas under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 4:1, 4:9, or the under the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act, subdivision A 3 of § 2.2-3806. McBurney v. Young , 569 U.S. 221, 133 S. Ct. 1709, 185 L. Ed. 2d 758, 2013 U.S. LEXIS 3317 (2013). Automated lice nse plate recognition system lawful.  Police departments passive use of an Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system to capture license plates, photographs of the vehicles, and the date, t ime, and GPS location of the vehicles did not run afoul of the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act because the ALPR database itself did not contain the name, personal number, or other identifying particulars of an individual; there was no evidence the department was keeping any of information within the system.

Former employee, who worked as a shipfitter, but who was unable to return to work after an accident because her permanent medical restrictions made her unable to perform the essential functions of her job and who did not show that the employer failed to make any reasonable accommodations, was unable to state a claim against her former employer under the Virginia Human Rights Act, § 2.2-3900 et seq., because th is law only applied where an independent violation of existing laws was found. Wells v. BAE Sys. Norfolk Ship Repair, 483 F. Supp. 2d 497, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26107 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 250 Fed. Appx. 552, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 24119 (4th Cir. 2007). Former § 2.1-725 D (now § 2.2-2639 D) prohibited a common-law cause of action base d upon the public policies reflected in the Virginia Human Rights Act. Doss v. Jamco, Inc., 254 Va. 362, 492 S.E.2d 441, 1997 Va. LEXIS 127 (1997). A common-law wrongful discharge claim cannot be based on the public polices of the Virginia Human Rights Act. Williamson v. Virginia First Sav. Bank, 26 F. Supp. 2d 798, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6709 (E.D. Va. 1998). The Virginia legislature, in enacting the 1995 amendments to former § 2.1-725 (see now § 2.2-2639), eliminated a common-law cause of action for wrongful ter mination based on any public policy which is reflected in the Virginia Human Rights Act, regardless of whether the policy is articulated elsewhere. Conner v. National Pest Control Ass'n, 257 Va. 286, 513 S.E.2d 398, 1999 Va. LEXIS 42 (1999). The Virginia Human Rights Act essentially makes any federal violation a violation of Virginia law as well. Grimes v. Canadian Am. Transp., C.A.T. (U.S.), Inc., 72 F. Supp. 2d 629, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12825 (W.D. Va. 1999). Employment-at-will doctrine.  Virginia strongly adheres to the employment-at-will doctrine, but there is a narrow exception to safeguard individuals, and that is if discharge violates public p olicy, which is the policy underlying existing laws designed to protect the property rights, personal-freedoms, health, safety, or welfare of the people in general. Lockhart v. Commonwealth Educ. Sys. Corp., 247 Va. 98, 439 S.E.2d 328, 10 Va. Law Rep. 7 51, 1994 Va. LEXIS 7 (1994)(superseded by statute). The Virginia Human Rights Act, as amended, no longer provides an exception to the at-will employment doctrine or the public policy basis for a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Oakley v. May Dep't Stores Co., 17 F. Supp. 2d 533, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15070 (E.D. Va. 1998). Statute did not create any statutory right or a corresponding public policy of the type that would support an exception to the employment-at-will doctrine and, th us, allow a common-law action for wrongful termination. Rowan v. Tractor Supply Co., 263 Va. 209, 559 S.E.2d 709, 2002 Va. LEXIS 38 (2002). Gender discrimination.  Plaintiffs factual allegations, if proven true, would support a reasonable inference by the fact finder that employer terminated her solely because of her sta tus as a woman who was also a working mother; this basis for termination would be a classic example of gender discrimination which is repugnant to Virginias strong public policy. Bailey v. Scott-Gallaher, Inc., 253 Va. 121, 480 S.E.2d 502, 1997 Va. LEXIS 20 (1997)(possible negative treatment). In the 1995 amendments to the Virginia Human Rights Act (VHRA), the Legislature eliminated the availability of common-law wrongful termination actions based on an y public policy that is contained in VHRA. Therefore, although Article I, § 11 expresses the Commonwealths policy against gender discrimination, any claim against an employer based on such discrimination must be brought under Title VII, the VHRA, or any other state statute that specifically provides for such a cause of action  but not as a common-law wrongful discharge claim. McCarthy v. Texas Instruments, Inc., 999 F. Supp. 823, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4723 (E.D. Va. 1998). Virginia law does not allow and, therefore, prohibits, discrimination on the basis of sex. Walker v. Electrolux Corp., 55 F. Supp. 2d 501, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9 490 (W.D. Va. 1999). Disability discrimination.  Because Virginias public policy against disability discrimination is manifested through the Virginians with Disabilities Act (VDA), and because the VDA contai ns an exclusivity provision, plaintiffs action for disability discrimination must be pursued under the VDA and not as a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Stafford v. Radford Community Hosp., 908 F. Supp. 1369, 1995 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 12050 (W.D. Va. 1995), dismissed, No. 94-1096-R, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 523 (W.D. Va. Jan. 16, 1996), aff'd, 120 F.3d 262, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 27389 (4th Cir. 1997). The policy against discrimination because of disability expressed in this act is also expressed in the Virginians with Disabilities Act (VWDA), § 51.5-1 et seq ., and the provisions of former § 2.1-725 (now § 2.2-2639) exclusively limiting causes of action to those afforded by other federal or state civil rights statutes or local ordinances bars any claim for wrongful termination in violation of the publi c policy embodied in both this act and the VWDA. Lamb v. Qualex, Inc., 28 F. Supp. 2d 374, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19719 (E.D. Va. 1998), aff'd, 33 Fed. Appx. 49, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 5982 (4th Cir. 2002). Failure to state a claim.  Employees claim for wrongful discharge in violation of the public policy expressed in § 18.2-465.1 was subject to dismissal because § 18.2-465.1 did not create any specific statutory right or set forth any specific public policy and the Virginia Supreme Court had not addressed whether § 18.2-465.1 provided a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Sewell v. Macado's, Inc., No. 7:04CV00268, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19950 (W.D. Va. Oct. 4, 2004). Employee failed to state a claim under the Virginia Human Rights Act, § 2.2-3900 et seq., because the Act limited private rights of action to employees seeking redress against employers of more than five but less than 15 employees, under § 2.2-2639, and her employer had more than 15 employees. Reiterman v. Costco Wholesale Mgmt. # 238, No. 5:05CV00012, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15219 (W.D. Va. July 28, 2005). Sixty-three-year-old former auxiliary deputy sheriff, did not state a viable age discrimination claim under the Virginia Human Rights Act, § 2.2-3900 et seq., because his claim against the sheriff, who attested to having hundreds of employees, did not fall under the special provisions of this section, and so it was disallowed. Blankenship v. City of Portsmouth, 372 F. Supp. 2d 496, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11124 (E.D. Va. 2005). Statute of limitations.  Counts were claims for wrongful discharge, not for breach of contract, personal injury, or violation of any federal statute. Thus, the statute of limitations exce ption for claims dependent upon federally created rights did not help plaintiffs in the instant case. Michael v. Sentara Health Sys., 939 F. Supp. 1220, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14876 (E.D. Va. 1996). Construction with other law.  Plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment under the Virginia Human Rights Act, subdivision B 2 of § 2.2-3900 was properly dismissed under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), because plaintiff was no...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-3901"><akn:num>§ 2.2-3901</akn:num><akn:heading>Definitions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Chapter 50. Religion includes any outward expression of religious faith, including adherence to re ligious dressing and grooming practices and the carrying or display of religious items or symbols.

Transp., C.A.T. (U.S.), Inc., 7 2 F. Supp. 2d 629, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12825 (W.D. Va. 1999) (decided under prior law). As the court determined that the association and the subsidiary were not employers under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), summary judgment against the Virginia Human Rights Act (VHRA) claim was appropriate to the extent that the former presidents VHRA claim rested on an alleged violation of the ADEA.

(i) An employer to discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment, (ii) an employment agency or a joint apprenticeship committee controlling an apprenticeship or other training program to discriminate against any individual, or (iii) a labor o rganization to discriminate against any member thereof or applicant for membership because such individual has opposed any practice made an unlawful discriminatory practice by this chapter or because such individual has made a charge, testified, assisted , or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this chapter. 8. An employer, labor organization, employment agency, or joint apprenticeship committee controlling an apprenticeship or other training program to print or publish, or cause to be printe d or published, any notice or advertisement relating to (i) employment by such an employer, (ii) membership in or any classification or referral for employment by such a labor organization, (iii) any classification or referral for employment by such an e mployment agency, or (iv) admission to, or employment in, any program established to provide apprenticeship or other training by such a joint apprenticeship committee that indicates any preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on ra ce, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, military status, disability, or national origin, except that such a notice or advertisement may indicate a preference , limitation, specification, or discrimination based on religion, sex, age, or national origin when religion, sex, age, or national origin is a bona fide occupational qualification for employment. C. Notwithstan ding any other provision of this chapter, it is not an unlawful discriminatory practice: 1. For ( i) an employer to hire and employ employees; (ii) an employment agency to classify, or refer for employment, any individual; (iii) a labor organization to classify its membership or to classify or refer for employment any individual; or (iv) an employer, labor organization, or joint apprenticeship committee to admit or employ any individual in any apprenticeship or other training program on the basis of such individuals religion, sex, or age in those certain instances where religion, sex, or age is a bona fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint apprenticeship committee; 2. For an elementary or secondary school or institution of higher education to hire and employ employees of a particular religion if such elementary or secondary school or institution of higher education is, in whole or in substantial part, owned, supported, controlled, or managed by a particular religion or by a particular religious corporation, association, or society or if the curriculum of such elementary or secondary school or insti tution of higher education is directed toward the propagation of a particular religion; 3. For an employer to apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system, or a syste m that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production, or to employees who work in different locations, provided that suc...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-3906"><akn:num>§ 2.2-3906</akn:num><akn:heading>Civil action by Attorney General</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Whenever th e Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights granted by this chapter, or that any person or group of persons has been d enied any of the rights granted by this chapter and such denial raises an issue of general public importance, the Attorney General may commence a civil action in the appropriate circuit court for appropriate relief. B. In such civ il action, the court may: 1. Award such preventive relief, including a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order against the person responsible for a violation of this chapter, as is necessary to assure the full enjoyment of the rights granted by this chapter. 2. Assess a civil penalty against the respondent (i) in an amount not exceeding $50,000 for a first violation and (ii) in an amount not exceeding $100,000 for any subsequent violation.

Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice may file a complaint in writing under oath or affirmation with the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Law (the Office). The Office itself or the Attorney General may in a like manne r file such a complaint. The complaint shall be in such detail as to substantially apprise any party properly concerned as to the time, place, and facts surrounding the alleged unlawful discrimination. B. Upon perfec tion of a complaint filed pursuant to subsection A, the Office shall timely serve a charge on the respondent and provide all parties with a notice informing the parties of the complainants rights, including the right to commence a civil action, and t he dates within which the complainant may exercise such rights. In the notice, the Office shall notify the complainant that the charge of unlawful discrimination will be dismissed with prejudice and with no right to further proceed if a written complaint is not timely filed with the appropriate general district or circuit court. C. The complai nant and respondent may agree to voluntarily submit the charge to mediation without waiving any rights that are otherwise available to either party pursuant to this chapter and without incurring any obligation to accept the result of the mediation proces s. Nothing occurring in mediation shall be disclosed by the Office or admissible in evidence in any subsequent proceeding unless the complainant and the respondent agree in writing that such disclosure be made. D. Once a char ge has been issued, the Office shall conduct an investigation sufficient to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe the alleged discrimination occurred. Such charge shall be the subject of a report made by the Office. The report shall be a confidential document subject to review by the Attorney General, authorized Office employees, and the parties. The review shall state whether there is reasonable cause to believe the alleged unlawful discrimination has been committed. E. If the repo rt on a charge of discrimination concludes that there is no reasonable cause to believe the alleged unlawful discrimination has been committed, the charge shall be dismissed and the complainant shall be given notice of his right to commence a civil actio n. F. If the repo rt on a charge of discrimination concludes that there is reasonable cause to believe the alleged unlawful discrimination has been committed, the complainant and respondent shall be notified of such determination and the Office shall immediately endeavor to eliminate any alleged unlawful discriminatory practice by informal methods such as conference, conciliation, and persuasion. When the Office determines that further endeavor to settle a complaint by conference, conciliation, and persuasion is unworkab le and should be bypassed, the Office shall issue a notice that the case has been closed and the complainant shall be given notice of his right to commence a civil action. G. At any time after a notice of charge of discrimination is issued, the Office or complainant may petition the appropriate court for temporary relief, pending final determination of the proceedings under this section, including an order or judgment restraining the re spondent from doing or causing any act that would render ineffectual an order that a court may enter with respect to the complainant. Whether it is brought by the Office or by the complainant, the petition shall contain a certification by the Office that the particular matter presents exceptional circumstances in which irreparable injury will result from unlawful discrimination in the absence of temporary relief. H. Upon receip t of a written request from the complainant, the Office shall promptly issue a notice of the right to file a civil action to the complainant after (i) 180 days have passed from the date the complaint was filed or (ii) the Office determines that it will b e unable to complete its investigation within 180 days from the date the complaint was filed. History History. 2020, c. 1140; 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 196. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2020, c. 1140, cl. 2 provides: That any regulations implementing the provisions of § 2.2-3907 of the Code of Virginia, as created by this act, shall, so far as practicable, conform to the practices and timelines of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with respect to analogous federal laws and regulations, for the purpose of maintaining a workshare agreement with that agency. The 2021 Sp. Sess. I amendments. The 2021 amendment by Sp. Sess. I, c. 196, effective July 1, 2021, substituted Office for Division throughout the section; and substituted Off ice of Civil Rights for Division of Human Rights in the first sentence of subsection A. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. Applicability.  Former employee, who worked as a shipfitter, but who was unable to return to work after an accident because her permanent medical restrictions made her unable to perform the essential functions of her job and who did not show that the employer failed to make any reasonable accommodations, was unable to state a claim against her former employer under the Virginia Human Rights Act, § 2.2-2639, because this law o nly applied where an independent violation of existing laws was found. Wells v. BAE Sys. Norfolk Ship Repair, 483 F. Supp. 2d 497, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26107 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 250 Fed. Appx. 552, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 24119 (4th Cir. 2007). Effect of 1995 amendment.  In the 1995 amendments to the Human Rights Act, the legislature eliminated the availability of common-law wrongful termination actions based on any public policy that is contained in this Act. McCarthy v. Texas Instruments, Inc., 999 F. Supp. 823, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4723 (E.D. Va. 1998). Common-law cause of action based on Human Rights Act policies.  Subsection D prohibits a common-law cause of action based upon the public policies reflected in the Virginia Human Rights Act. Doss v. Jamco, Inc., 254 Va. 362, 4 92 S.E.2d 441, 1997 Va. LEXIS 127 (1997). The Virginia Human Rights Act, as amended, no longer provides an exception to the at-will employment doctrine or the public policy basis for a cause of action for wrongful discharge. Oakley v. May Dep't Stores Co., 17 F. Supp. 2d 533, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15070 (E.D. Va. 1998). The Virginia legislature, in enacting the 1995 amendments to this section, eliminated a common-law cause of action for wrongful termination based on any public po licy which is reflected in the Virginia Human Rights Act, regardless of whether the policy is articulated elsewhere. Conner v. National Pest Control Ass'n, 257 Va. 286, 513 S.E.2d 398, 1999 Va. LEXIS 42 (1999). Subsection D does not prohibit a common law cause of action for wrongful termination based on public policies against fornication and lewd and lascivious behavior , because those policies are not reflected in the Virginia Human Rights Act. Mitchem v. Counts, 259 Va. 179, 523 S.E.2d 246, 2000 Va. LEXIS 25 (2000). Claim based on reduction in job responsibilities failed.  As the employment action alleged by the former president was not a discharge, but rather a reduction in job responsibilities, the presidents Virginia Human Ri ghts Act claim failed. Huizenga v. Am. Int'l Auto. Dealers Ass'n, No. 1:05cv264, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30972 (E.D. Va. Nov. 22, 2005). Number of employees.  Employee failed to state a claim under the Virginia Human Rights Act, § 2.2-3900 et seq., because the Act limited private rights of action to employees seeking redress against employers of more than five but less than 15 employees, under § 2.2-2639, and her employer had more than 15 employees. Reiterman v. Costco Wholesale Mgmt. # 238, No. 5:05CV00012, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15219 (W.D. Va. July 28, 2005). Former employees race discrimination claim against her former employer under the Virginia Human Rights Act failed because the employer had more than 15 employ ees. Smith v. Estes Express, No. 3:08cv574, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31543 (E.D. Va. Apr. 13, 2009), aff'd, 330 Fed. Appx. 52, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 16413 (4th Cir. 2009). Employer not covered.  Employer with more than 500 employees was not included within the coverage of the Virginia Human Rights Act, § 2.2-2639. Oglesby v. Ford Motor Co., No. 2:04cv7 68, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41472 (E.D. Va. Aug. 16, 2005). Former employee, who worked as a shipfitter, but who was unable to return to work after an accident because her permanent medical restrictions made her unable to perform the essential functions of her job and who did not show that the employer failed to make any reasonable accommodations, was unable to state a claim against her former employer under the Virginia Human Rights Act, subsection B of § 2.2-2639, be cause the employer had 15 or more employees. Wells v. BAE Sys. Norfolk Ship Repair, 483 F. Supp. 2d 497, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26107 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 250 Fed. Appx. 552, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 24119 (4th Cir. 2007). Amendments inapplicable to claim arising before effective date.  The 1995 amendments to the Virginia Human Rights Act place certain limits upon an employees right to recover punitive damages for wrongful termination of empl oyment but these provisions do not apply if the employee was terminated and the motion for judgment was filed before those amendments became effective. Smith v. Litten, 256 Va. 573, 507 S.E.2d 77, 1998 Va. LEXIS 145 (1998). Age discrimination claim disallowed.  Sixty three-year-old former auxiliary deputy sheriff, did not state a viable age discrimination claim under the Virginia Human Rights Act, because his claim again st the sheriff, who attested to having hundreds of employees, did not fall under the special provisions of this section, and so it was disallowed.

An aggrieve d person who has been provided a notice of his right to file a civil action pursuant to § 2.2-3907 may commence a timely civil action in an appropriate general district or circuit court having jurisdiction over the person who allegedly unlawfully disc riminated against such person in violation of this chapter. B. If the cour t or jury finds that unlawful discrimination has occurred, the court or jury may award to the plaintiff, as the prevailing party, compensatory and punitive damages and the court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs and may grant as relief any per manent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice, or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate. C. Upon timely application, the Attorney General may intervene in such civil action if the Attorney General certifies that the case is of general public importance. Upon intervention, the Attorney General may obtain such relief as would be available to a private party under subsection B.

As used in this section:Employer means any person, or agent of such person, employing five or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.Lactation means lactation as defined in § 2.2-3905.Reasonable accommodation includes mor e frequent or longer bathroom breaks, breaks to express breast milk, access to a private location other than a bathroom for the expression of breast milk, acquisition or modification of equipment or access to or modification of employee seating, a tempor ary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring, a modified work schedule, light duty assignments, and leave to recover from childbirth. Related medical conditions includes lactation. B. No employer shall: 1. Refus e to make reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of a person related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer. a. In determining whether an accommodation would constitute an undue hardship on the employer, the following shall be considered: (1) Hardship on the conduct of the employers business, considering the nature of the employers operation, including composition and structure of the employers workforce; (2) The size of the facility where employment occurs; and (3) The nature and cost of the accommodations needed. b. The fact that the employer provides or would be required to provide a similar accommodation to other classes of employees shall create a rebuttable presumption that the accommodat ion does not impose an undue hardship on the employer. 2. Take adverse action against an employee who requests or uses a reasonable accommodation pursuant to this section. As used in this subdivision, adverse action includes failure t o reinstate any such employee to her previous position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, seniority, and other benefits when her need for a reasonable accommodation ceases. 3. Deny employment or promotion opportunities to an otherwise qualified applicant or employee because such employer will be required to make reasonable accommodation to the known limitati ons of such applicant or employee related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. 4. Require an employee to take leave if another reasonable accommodation can be provided to the known limitations related to the pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions of su ch employee. C. Each employ er shall engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with an employee who has requested an accommodation pursuant to this section to determine if the requested accommodation is reasonable and, if such accommodation is determined not to be reasonab le, discuss alternative accommodations that may be provided. D. An employer shall post in a conspicuous location and include in any employee handbook information concerning an employees rights to reasonable accommodation for known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Such information shall also be directly provided to (i) new employees upon commencement of their employment and (ii) any employee within 10 days of such employees providing notice to the employer that she is pregnant. E. An employee or applicant who has been denied any of the rights afforded under subsection B may bring an action in a general district or circuit court having jurisdiction over the employer that allegedly denied such rights. Any such action shall be brought within tw o years from the date of the unlawful denial of rights, or, if the employee or applicant has filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Law or a local human rights or human relations agency or commission within two years of th e unlawful denial of rights, such action shall be brought within 90 days from the date that the Office or a local human rights or human relations agency or commission has rendered a final disposition on the complaint.If the court or jury finds that an un lawful denial of rights afforded under subsection B has occurred, the court or jury may award to the plaintiff, as the prevailing party, compensatory damages, back pay, and other equitable relief. The court may also award reasonable attorney fees and cos ts and may grant as relief any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order, including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice, or order such affirmative action as may be appropriate. F. The provisi ons of this section regarding the provision of reasonable accommodation for known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions shall not be construed to affect any other provision of law relating to discrimination on the b asis of sex or pregnancy.

Administrative Law, §§ 2, 9, 18, 20. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former corresponding provisions. Applicability.  Where an agencys basic law provides expressly for Virginia Administrative Process Act coverage of certain proceedings under specified conditions and makes no provision for judicial review of other proceedings, the unmentioned proceedings are subject to the Act unless otherwise expressly excluded. May Dep't Stores Co. v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 29 Va. App. 589, 513 S.E.2d 880, 1999 Va. App. LEXI S 236 (1999). Article 6 of this Act (former § 9-6.14:21, see now § 2.2-4030), providing for awards of attorney fees, does not apply to judicial review of determinations of claims for unemployment compensation. Shuler v. VEC, 14 Va. App. 1013, 420 S.E.2d 257, 9 Va. Law Rep. 115, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 213 (1992). Agency may be exempted from promulgation process under certain conditions.  The General Assembly clearly evinced its intent that regulations must be promulgated since it specifically provided that an agency may be exempted from the entire promulgation process under certain circumstances. Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, 6 Va. App. 231, 369 S.E.2d 1, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2665, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 46 (1988). Right to intervene.  In a case dealing with an application seeking permission to install a raw water intake on state-owned bottomlands, nothing in former Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2:15 [see now R. 3.14], the Virginia Administrative Process Act, or the enabling statutes for the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) gave the tribe the right to intervene; additionally, no settlement between the city and the VMRC could prejudice any rights t he tribe had under its treaty. Thus, the settlement between the city and the VMRC, consummated by the entry of a consent dismissal order, mooted the tribes appeal of the circuit courts decision to deny the tribes motion to intervene. Mattapon i Indian Tribe v. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n, 45 Va. App. 208, 609 S.E.2d 619, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 85 (2005). Standing.  Circuit court erred in dismissing property owners appeal of a decision of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VRMC) to approve a marinas permit appl ication because the owners qualified as a person aggrieved under subsection F of § 28.2-1205 and were entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act when the owners produced sufficient evidence to establish standing; the owners asserted facts sufficient to support their claim that their right to enjoy the recreational and aesthetic advantages of their waterfront property as riparian landowners was adversely impacted by VMRCs decision to gra nt the marinas permit, and because subdivision A 4 of § 28.2-1205 required VMRC to consider the effect of a proposed project on adjacent or nearby properties, the owners had a direct and substantial interest in the litigation simply by virtue of t he fact that VMRC was required to consider the projects effect on their property prior to granting the permit. Biddison v. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n, 54 Va. App. 521, 680 S.E.2d 343, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 352 (2009). Although the Virginia Administrative Process Act, § 2.2-4026, states that any person affected by and claiming unlawfulness has standing to appeal an agency dec ision, this phrase refers to challenges to the unlawfulness of agency regulations, but challenges to agency decisions require the petitioner to be aggrieved by and claiming unlawfulness; furthermore, § 2.2-4000 states that the Act supplements but does not supersede or repeal provisions of the basic law applicable to the agency, and accordingly, the provisions of subsection F of § 28.2-1205 control the requirements for filing an appeal from a decision by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Va . Marine Res. Comm'n v. Clark, 281 Va. 679, 709 S.E.2d 150, 2011 Va. LEXIS 83 (2011), overruled in part, Woolford v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 294 Va. 377, 806 S.E.2d 398, 2017 Va. LEXIS 168 (2017). Residents petition for appeal of a decision of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission approving a citys pipeline project was not insulated from consider ation of the motion to dismiss filed by the Commission and the city simply because it satisfied the four elements set out in Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2A:4(b), and the court of appeals erred in resolving the matter solely by reference to the Rule; subsection F of § 28.2-1205 provides that only a person aggrieved by a decision of the Commission is entitled to judicial review of that decision, and thus, compliance with Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2A:4 does not insulate a petition from a dispositive motion based on t he failure to include allegations to show that the petitioner had the requisite standing to pursue the appeal since the Rule cannot supersede or displace other statutes relevant to the appeal under the Virginia Administrative Process Act. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n v. Clark, 281 Va. 679, 709 S.E.2d 150, 2011 Va. LEXIS 83 (2011), overruled in part, Woolford v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 294 Va. 377, 806 S.E.2d 398, 2017 Va. LEXIS 168 (2017). The hearing determination chart is not a substantive rule of the Industrial (now Workers  Compensation) Commission subject to the Virginia Administrative Process Act or the Virginia Register Act. Bader v. Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 10 Va. App. 697, 396 S.E.2d 141, 7 Va. Law Rep. 204, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 152 (1990). Review of decisions concerning special education programs for handi capped children not subject to this chapter.  Special education programs for handicapped children are subject to the provisions of subsection D of § 22.1-214, which subsection allows the court to hear addi tional evidence and requires it to weigh the evidence and base its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, instead of simply finding substantial evidence in the record to support the hearing officers decision. Thus, the proper standard for the circuit court is to determine, based on a preponderance of the evidence, whether the substance of the proposed individualized educational program is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits. Beasley v. School Bd., 6 Va. App. 206, 367 S.E.2d 738, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2655, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (1988), rev'd, 238 Va. 44, 380 S.E.2d 884, 5 Va.

Administrative Law, §§ 1, 5, 9-11. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former corresponding provisions. Counties excluded from definition of agency.  Under the definition of agency, an administrative agency must be a unit of state government; counties are expressly excluded. County of Roanoke v. Friends hip Manor Apt. Village Corp., No. 0394-85 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 4, 1985). A local school board is not a board or unit of the state government, but rather is an en tity of a municipality or a county. As such, it is not an administrative agency as contemplated by the Administrative Process Act. Schwartz v. Highland County School Bd., 2 Va. App. 554, 346 S.E.2d 544, 3 Va. Law Rep. 105, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 305 (1986). The Virginia Historic Landmarks Board under former § 10-135 et seq. Was not an agency as defined by former § 9-6.2 because the General Assembly did not authorize the Board to make rules or to adjudicate contested cases in Louisa County. Virginia Historic Landmarks Comm'n v. Board of Supvrs., 217 Va. 468, 230 S.E.2d 449, 1976 Va. LEXIS 306 (1976) (decided under former § 9-6.2 and prior to enactment of former § 10-138.2). Where there is a specific provision for standing in the basic law, such provision is con trolling over the standardized court review in former § 9-6.14:16 (see now §§ 2.2-4025 B, 2.2-4026). Citizens for Clean Air v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Air Pollution Control Bd., 13 Va. App. 430, 412 S.E.2d 715, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1585, 1991 Va. A pp. LEXIS 320 (1991). Basic law to m ake regulations or decide cases.  Former § 9-6.14:16 (see now §§ 2.2-4025 B, 2.2-4026) does not supplement § 62.1-44.29 because the latter is not a basic law conferring authority o n agencies either to make regulations or decide cases. Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (1991). Former § 9-6.14:16 (see now §§ 2.2-4025 B, 2.2-4026) gives deference to provisions of the basic law, such as § 62.1-44.29, which make express provisio ns for standing. This construction is supported by the concluding sentence of former § 9-6.14:3 (see now § 2.2-4000 B). Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (1991). Reach of administrative, ministerial duties.  The granting and renewal of professional licenses are part of the administrative, ministerial duties of the real estate board. Such duties do not involve the quas i-judicial process of determining whether a person subject to regulation by the board is in violation of applicable statutes and regulations. Carpenter v. Virginia Real Estate Bd., 20 Va. App. 100, 455 S.E.2d 287, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 309 (1995). A de facto rule may be challenged by bringing a suit claiming the unlawfulness of a case decision, as defined by the Virginia Administrative Process Act. Virginia Bd. of Medicine v. Virginia Physical Therapy Ass'n, 13 Va. App. 458, 413 S.E.2d 59, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1602, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 324 (1991), aff'd, 245 Va. 125, 427 S.E.2d 183, 9 Va. Law Rep. 903, 1993 Va. LEXIS 28 (1993). Guidance documents.  Trial court did not err in upholding the use by the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) of a guidance document in evaluating the acceptable levels of metals that would potentially leach into groundwater, and in designating a farm as a sensitive environment. Given that determining safe levels of metals that may be leached into groundwater was plainly within the specialized knowledge of DEQ, the appellate cou rt could not say that its use of the guidance document, or the conclusions DEQ drew based upon such use, were arbitrary or capricious or an abuse of its delegated discretion. Hampton Rds. Sanitation Dist. v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 2017 Va. App. LEX IS 145 (Va. Ct. App. June 6, 2017). The Alcoholic Beverage Control Boards refusal to permit a licensees use of a 22-foot counter surfaced with five wood-inlaid backgammon boards for the service of alcoholic beverages constituted a case decision. Virginia ABC Comm'n v. York St. Inn, Inc., 220 Va. 310, 257 S.E.2d 851, 1979 Va. LEXIS 265 (1979). The resolution of the Virginia Historic Landmarks Board identifying the Green Springs Historic District cannot be construed as a rule of general application, and the proceedings conducted by the Board incident to the adoption of the resolution was not a contested case involving such rights, duties or privileges of a person t hat are required by law to be determined after a hearing. Virginia Historic Landmarks Comm'n v. Board of Supvrs., 217 Va. 468, 230 S.E.2d 449, 1976 Va. LEXIS 306 (1976) (decided under former § 9-6.2 and prior to enactment of former § 10-138.2).

Regulations that an agency finds are necessitated by an emergency situation may be adopted by an agency upon consultation with the Attorney General, which approval shall be granted only after the agency has submitted a request stating in writing the nature of the e mergency, and the necessity for such action shall be at the sole discretion of the Governor. B. Agencies ma y also adopt emergency regulations in situations in which Virginia statutory law or the appropriation act or federal law or federal regulation requires that a regulation be effective in 280 days or less from its enactment and the regulation is not exempt under the provisions of subdivision A 4 of § 2.2-4006.

Any such request must be submitted to the Governor at least 30 days prior to the scheduled expiration of the emergency regulation and shall include a description of the agencys efforts to adopt a replacement regulation together with the reasons that a replacement regulation cannot be adopted before the scheduled expiration of the emergency regulation. Upon approval of the Governor, provided such approval occurs prior to the sch eduled expiration of the emergency regulation, the duration of the emergency regulation shall be extended for a period of no more than six months. Such approval shall be in the sole discretion of the Governor and shall not be subject to judicial review.

Sup. Ct. R. 2A:2, and thus, the circuit court never gained appellate jurisdiction to consider the merits of any assignments of error with respect to the Board; the Board s publication of the final regulation in the August 18, 2008, issue of the Register of Regulations triggered the 30-day final adoption period as required by the Virginia Administrative Process Act, subsection D of § 2.2-4013, and on September 17, 2008, the regulation was adopted and became effective, but the citizens notice of appeal was not filed until October 30, 2008.

After publi cation of the Register pursuant to § 2.2-4031, the standing committee of each house of the General Assembly to which matters relating to the content of the regulation are most properly referable or the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules may meet and, during the promulgation or final adoption process, file with the Registrar and the promulgating agency an objection to a proposed or final adopted regulation. The Registrar shall publish any such objection received by him as soon as practicable in the Register. Within 21 days after the receipt by the promulgating agency of a legislative objection, that agency shall file a response with the Registrar, the objecting legislative committee or the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules, and the Gover nor. If a legislative objection is filed within the final adoption period, subdivision A 1 of § 2.2-4015 shall govern. B. In addition or as an alternative to the provisions of subsection A, the standing committee of both houses of the General Assembly to which matters relating to the content are most properly referable or the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules may suspend the ef fective date of any portion or all of a final regulation with the Governors concurrence. The Governor and (i) the applicable standing committee of each house or (ii) the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules may direct, through a statement signed by a majority of their respective members and by the Governor, that the effective date of a portion or all of the final regulation is suspended and shall not take effect until the end of the next regular legislative session. This statement shall be trans mitted to the promulgating agency and the Registrar within the 30-day final adoption period, or if a later effective date is specified by the agency the statement may be transmitted at any time prior to the specified later effective date, and shall be pu blished in the Register.If a bill is passed at the next regular legislative session to nullify a portion but not all of the regulation, then the promulgating agency (i) may promulgate the regulation under the provision of subdivision A 4 a of § 2.2-40 06, if it makes no changes to the regulation other than those required by statutory law or (ii) shall follow the provisions of §§ 2.2-4007.01 through 2.2-4007.06, if it wishes to also make discretionary changes to the regulation. If a bill to nulli fy all or a portion of the suspended regulation, or to modify the statutory authority for the regulation, is not passed at the next regular legislative session, then the suspended regulation shall become effective at the conclusion of the session, unless the suspended regulation is withdrawn by the agency. C. A regulatio n shall become effective as provided in § 2.2-4015. D. This sectio n shall not apply to the issuance by the State Air Pollution Control Board of variances to its regulations.

A regulatio n adopted in accordance with this chapter and the Virginia Register Act (§ 2.2-4100 et seq.) shall become effective at the conclusion of the thirty-day final adoption period provided for in subsection D of § 2.2-4013, or any other later date specif ied by the agency, unless: 1. A leg islative objection has been filed in accordance with § 2.2-4014, in which event the regulation, unless withdrawn by the agency, shall become effective on a date specified by the agency that shall be after the expiration of the applicable twenty-one-da y extension period provided in § 2.2-4014; 2. The Governor has exercised his authority in accordance with § 2.2-4013 to require the agency to provide for additional public comment, in which event the regulation, unless withdraw n by the agency, shall become effective on a date specified by the agency that shall be after the period for which the Governor has provided for additional public comment; 3. The Governor and (i) the appropriate standing committees of each house of the General Assembly or (ii) the Joint Commission on Administrative Rules have exercised their authority in ac cordance with subsection B of § 2.2-4014 to suspend the effective date of a regulation until the end of the next regular legislative session; or 4. The agency has suspended the regulatory process in accordance with § 2.2-4007.06, or for any reason it deems necessary or appropriate, in which event the regulation, unless withdraw n by the agency, shall become effective in accordance with subsection B. B. Whenever th e regulatory process has been suspended for any reason, any action by the agency that either amends the regulation or does not amend the regulation but specifies a new effective date shall be considered a readoption of the regulation for the purposes of appeal. If the regulation is suspended under § 2.2-4007.06, such readoption shall take place after the thirty-day public comment period required by that subsection. Suspension of the regulatory process by the agency may occur simultaneously with the f iling of final regulations as provided in subsection B of § 2.2-4013.When a regulation has been suspended, the agency must set the effective date no earlier than fifteen days from publication of the readoption action and any changes made to the regula tion. During that fifteen-day period, if the agency receives requests from at least twenty-five persons for the opportunity to comment on new substantial changes, it shall again suspend the regulation pursuant to § 2.2-4007.06. C. This sectio n shall not apply to the issuance by the State Air Pollution Control Board of variances to its regulations.

Former § 9-6.14:11 (see now this section and § 2.2-4021) and former § 9-6.14:12 (see now §§ 2.2-4020, 2.2-4021) are designed to bring cases to final decision at the agency level. State Bd. of Health v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 1 Va. App. 5, 332 S.E.2d 793, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1985). Construction with § 2.2-4020.  Subsection B of § 2.2-4020, dealing with formal hearings, contains explanatory requirement language apparently more expansive than that contained in clause (v) of subsection A of § 2.2-4019, dealing with informal hearings. Pursuant to the former, subsection E of § 2.2-4020 requires that a decision must briefly state the findings, conclusions, reasons or basis therefor upon the evidence presented and rele vant to the basic law under which the agency is operating. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Cirillo, 54 Va. App. 193, 676 S.E.2d 368, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 228 (2009). Board for Contractors did not err in finding that the contractor violated the administrative code by failing to obtain a building permit before beginning work and burying footings before they were inspected because the Boards basic laws provided the contractor an informal fact-finding conference under this statute, but did not expressly call for a formal hearing under § 2.2-4020. JES Constr., LLC v. Bd. fo r Contrs., Dep't of Prof'l &amp; Occupational Regulation, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 361 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 26, 2018).

App. LEXIS 421 (1999). Initial determination defined.  Date on which the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services held its first informal factfinding conference (IFFC) with a corporation that was allegedly o verpaid under the Medicaid program, governed the issue of whether the Department was barred by § 32.1-325.1:1 from recovering overpayments; the trial courts judgment finding that the Department could not recover payments made more than four years before it held its first IFFC was upheld, even though a cost analyst sent a Notice of Program Reimbursement to the corporation within four years after each overpayment was made. Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., 42 Va. App. 628, 593 S.E.2d 568, 2004 Va. A pp. LEXIS 100 (2004). No right to cros s-examination in informal hearings.  That a real estate appraiser was not able to cross examine witnesses at her license revocation hearing did not deprive her of due process. Section 2.2-4020, provi ding for cross-examination of witnesses, was inapplicable, because she had an informal hearing under § 2.2-4019, which did not entitle her to cross-examine witnesses or force them to testify under oath. Haley v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 441 ( Va. Ct. App. Oct. 3, 2006). Right to notice of contrary facts.  The requirement in clause (iii) of subsection A of § 2.2-4019 that an agency provide a party with notice of contrary facts was a right that only the party was allowed to assert. Furthermore, trial court properly held that a departments letter regarding the classification of business parks facility as a materials recovery facility was a case decision because the mailing of the letter to the business par k was sufficient service, and the author of the letter had authority to issue a case decision; finally, contrary to the departments claim, the informal meeting at issue had a presiding officer. Frederick County Bus. Park, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Q uality, 52 Va. App. 40, 660 S.E.2d 698, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 244 (2008), aff'd, 278 Va. 207, 677 S.E.2d 42, 2009 Va. LEXIS 64 (2009). Notice requirements.  Circuit court erred in suspending the revocation of a real estate agents license because the Real Estate Board of the Commonwealth of Virginia did not violate d the agents procedural due process rights when a reasonable reading of the initial notice clearly indicated that the agents prior criminal record would be before the Board and that it was actually required to consider it; the initial notice set forth the agents rights pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act, subsection A of § 2.2-4019, the grounds for disciplinary actions under 18 VAC 135-20-155, the actual language of § 54.1-204, and the fact that the Board was required t o consider the provisions of § 54.1-204 in making its determination. Commonwealth v. DeLapp, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 405 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 19, 2010). Standard of review.  Whether reviewing the Commissioners decision as if a formal proceeding had been conducted pursuant to former § 9-6.14:12 (see now §§ 2.2-4020, 2.2-40 21) or an informal proceeding conducted pursuant to this section, the circuit court was required to determine whether the Commissioner had complied with statutory or legal authority in reaching his decision. Roanoke Mem. Hosps. v. Kenley, 3 Va. App. 599, 352 S.E.2d 525, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1607, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 145 (1987). Retirement systems violation of clause (v) of subsection A of § 2.2-4019, by depriving the trial court of the rationale of the administrative decision, imp eded that court in the application of the substantive evidence rule in reviewing that decision. As a consequence, a benefits applicants right to an appropriate review by a circuit court was, likewise, compromised by the violation. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Ci rillo, 54 Va. App. 193, 676 S.E.2d 368, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 228 (2009). Burden of proof.  Virginia Real Estate Boards finding that a broker violated an administrative regulation by failing to obtain the written consent of a seller prior to advertis ing real estate properties for sale was appropriate because the Board did not improperly place the burden of proof on the broker at an agency hearing. There was no unfair burden shifting in the broker attempting to overcome a prima facie showing of lack of written consent to advertise by presenting evidence of consent that was accepted and considered. Finch v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 26, 2019). Authority to begin administr ative process.  Despite an assisted living facilitys lack of an application for a permit for a waterworks, the Virginia Department of Health was within its authority under Vi rginia Administrative Process Act to begin the administrative process and eventually issue a case decision determining that such a permit was necessary because the facility, as the owner of a waterworks, was not able to operate without a permit. North Vi ew Home for Adults, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Health, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 82 (Va. Ct. App. May 18, 2021). Error for failing to explain reason for denial of benefits was not harmless error.  Virginia Retirement System (VRS) committed a procedural error of law for failing to adequately comply with the explanatory requirements of clause (v) of subsectio n A of § 2.2-4019; that is, by failing to provide in writing the factual or procedural basis for an adverse decision. That failure required remand, pursuant to § 2.2-4027, because the error was not merely harmless error; the applicant could not hav e known which of three potential rationales for denial in subsection E of § 51.1-156 the VRS based its decision on when de...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-4020"><akn:num>§ 2.2-4020</akn:num><akn:heading>Formal hearings; litigated issues</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. The agency shall afford opportunity for the formal taking of evidence upon relevant fact issues in any case in which the basic laws provide expressly for decisions upon or after hearing and may do so in any case to the extent that informal procedures under § 2.2 -4019 have not been had or have failed to dispose of a case by consent. B. Parties to formal proceedings shall be given reasonable notice of the (i) time, place, and nature thereof; (ii) basic law under which the agency contemplates its possible exercise of authority; (iii) matters of fact and law asserted or questioned by the agency; and (iv) contact information consisting of the name, telephone number, and government email address of the person designated by the agency to respond to questions or otherwise assist a named party. Applicants for licenses, rights, benefits, or renewals ther eof have the burden of approaching the agency concerned without such prior notice but they shall be similarly informed thereafter in the further course of the proceedings whether pursuant to this section or to § 2.2-4019.

In all such formal proceedings the parties shall be entitled to be accompanied by and represented by counsel, to submit oral and documentary evidence and rebuttal proofs, to conduct such cross-examination as may elicit a full and fair disclosure of the facts, and t o have the proceedings completed and a decision made with dispatch. The burden of proof shall be upon the proponent or applicant. The presiding officers at the proceedings may (i) administer oaths and affirmations, (ii) receive probative evidence, exclud e irrelevant, immaterial, insubstantial, privileged, or repetitive proofs, rebuttal, or cross-examination, rule upon offers of proof, and oversee a verbatim recording of the evidence, (iii) hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of issues by consent, (iv) dispose of procedural requests, and (v) regulate and expedite the course of the hearing. Where a hearing officer presides, or where a subordinate designated for that purpose presides in hearings specified in subsection F of § 2.2-4024 , he shall recommend findings and a decision unless the agency shall by its procedural regulations provide for the making of findings and an initial decision by the presiding officers subject to review and reconsideration by the agency on appeal to it as of right or on its own motion. The agency shall give deference to findings by the presiding officer explicitly based on the demeanor of witnesses. D. Prior to th e recommendations or decisions of subordinates, the parties concerned shall be given opportunity, on request, to submit in writing for the record (i) proposed findings and conclusions and (ii) statements of reasons therefor. In all cases, on request, opp ortunity shall be afforded for oral argument (a) to hearing officers or subordinate presiding officers, as the case may be, in all cases in which they make such recommendations or decisions or (b) to the agency in cases in which it makes the original dec ision without such prior recommendation and otherwise as it may permit in its discretion or provide by general rule. Where hearing officers or subordinate presiding officers, as the case may be, make recommendations, the agency shall receive and act on e xceptions thereto. E. All decisio ns or recommended decisions shall be served upon the parties, become a part of the record, and briefly state or recommend the findings, conclusions, reasons, or basis therefor upon the evidence presented by the record and relevant to the basic law under which the agency is operating together with the appropriate order, license, grant of benefits, sanction, relief, or denial thereof.

Former §§ 9-6.14:11 and 9-6.14:12 (see now §§ 2.2-4019 to 2.2-4021) are designed to bring cases to final decision at the agency level. State Bd. of Health v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 1 Va. App. 5, 332 S.E.2d 793, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1985). Right to a formal hearing is governed by the Virginia Administrative Process Act and the basic law (§ 62.1-44.2 et seq.). Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (1991). Former § 9-6.14:12 (see now this section and § 2.2-4021) does not mandate formal hearing s where basic law does not.  Where basic law (§ 62.1-44.2 et seq.) does not expressly provide for issuance of Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) permits only upon or a fter formal hearings, formal hearings are not mandatory under former § 9-6.14:12 (see now this section and § 2.2-4021). Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. A pp. LEXIS 100 (1991). Construction with § 2.2-4019.  Subsection B of § 2.2-4020, dealing with formal hearings, contains explanatory requirement language apparently more expansive than that contained in clause (v) of subsection A of § 2.2-4019, dealing with informal hearings. Pursuant to the former, subsection E of § 2.2-4020 requires that a decision must briefly state the findings, conclusions, reasons or basis therefor upon the evidence presented and rele vant to the basic law under which the agency is operating. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Cirillo, 54 Va. App. 193, 676 S.E.2d 368, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 228 (2009). Despite the apparently less explanatory language requirement in § 2.2-4019, a trial courts opinions concerning § 2.2-4020 were persuasive because the un derlying statutory principle in both was the same: an administrative agency must offer a basis for its decision, understandable to a party and capable of proper review by a court. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Cirillo, 54 Va. App. 193, 676 S.E.2d 368, 2009 Va. App. L EXIS 228 (2009). Initial determination defined.  Date on which the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services held its first informal factfinding conference (IFFC) with a corporation that was allegedly o verpaid under the Medicaid program, governed the issue of whether the Department was barred by § 32.1-325.1:1 from recovering overpayments; the trial courts judgment finding that the Department could not recover payments made more than four years before it held its first IFFC was upheld, even though a cost analyst sent a Notice of Program Reimbursement to the corporation within four years after each overpayment was made. Finnerty v. Thornton Hall, Inc., 42 Va. App. 628, 593 S.E.2d 568, 2004 Va. A pp. LEXIS 100 (2004). Procedural due process.  Where the board: (1) afforded the doctor a formal hearing; (2) considered evidence from both the Attorney General and the doctor; (3) found that the doctors m isconduct led to the performance of unnecessary medical procedures, physical harm to patients, and death in one case; (4) and determined that the doctor violated several regulations, the board was authorized to conclude that the doctor posed a continuing threat to public health. The board had afforded the doctor the required procedural due process of notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the charges against the doctor. Vuyyuru v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2 008). Circuit court properly affirmed a decision by the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board suspending a licensees liquor license because the hearing officer did not exceed her administrative and statutory powers where her questions to a liquor board agent and to an underage buyer on behalf of the agent, if erroneous, were harmless and did not violate the licensees procedural due process rights inasmuch a s the questions did not demonstrate bias or partiality and the licensee conceded that the evidence was overwhelming. Mall Amusements, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Alcoholic Bev. Control, 66 Va. App. 605, 790 S.E.2d 245, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 237 (2016). The Virginia Board of Medicines denial of a doctors motion for a second continuance of an administrative hearing did not deprive the doctor of the doctor s due process right to counsel of the doctors choosing. The doctors right to counsel of the doctors choosing was not absolute, and the Board was entitled to exercise its discretion in weighing various other factors relevant to the decisio n, including the availability of substitute counsel, a quorum of the Board, and witnesses. Va. Bd. of Med. v. Hagmann, 67 Va. App. 488, 797 S.E.2d 422, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 80 (2017). Virginia Board of Medicine properly revoked a doctors license to practice medicine because the Board did not violate the due process rights of the doctor by d enying the doctors motion for a second...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-4021"><akn:num>§ 2.2-4021</akn:num><akn:heading>Timetable for decision; exemptions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

If the agency does not render a decision within 90 days, the named party to the case decision may provide written notice to the agency that a decision is due.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former corresponding provisions. Former §§ 9-6.14:11 and 9-6.14:12 (see now § 2.2-4020) are designed to bring cases to final decision at the agency level. State Bd. of Health v. Virginia Hosp. Ass'n, 1 Va. App. 5, 332 S.E.2d 793, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (1985). Nothing in the Virginia Administrative Process Act limits number of fact-finding conferences to one. Surprenant v. Board for Contractors, 30 Va. App. 165, 516 S.E.2d 220, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 421 (1999). Standard of review.  Whether reviewing the Commissioners decision as if a formal proceeding had been conducted pursuant to former § 9-6.14:12 (see now this section and § 2.2 -4020) or an informal proceeding conducted pursuant to this section, the circuit court was required to determine whether the Commissioner had complied with statutory or legal authority in reaching his decision. Roanoke Mem. Hosps. v. Kenley, 3 Va. App. 5 99, 352 S.E.2d 525, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1607, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 145 (1987). Ninety-day period commenced when fact-finding conference held by Virginia Retirement System.  Ninety-day period for review of disability retirement benefits commenced when Virginia Retirement System (VRS) representative held informal fact-finding conferenc e, not when VRS received medical board report on claimants condition; agencys failure to render decision meant that decision was deemed to be in claimants favor 30 days after agency received notice from claimant that a decision was due. Rizzo v. Virginia Retirement Sys., 255 Va. 375, 497 S.E.2d 852, 1998 Va. LEXIS 36 (1998). Written notice that decision due.  Circuit court properly affirmed an order by the Virginia Board of Medicine that removed a stay of suspension of a doctors medical license because the doctor c onceded that he withdrew from monitoring and was not in compliance with monitoring order, the doctor failed to appeal the original suspension of his license and the conditional reinstatement of his license, the doctors letter to the Department of Hea lth Professionals regarding his difficulties in complying with the Board-ordered monitoring did not constitute written notice that a decision was due, and the Board was not required to revisit the validity of the prior orders regarding the doctors fa ilure to comply with the monitoring. Clowdis v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 34 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 13, 2018). Triggering of statutory deadlines.  Informal fact-finding conference rendered a decision within the time frame specified in the statute because nothing in an e-mail message a physician sent suggeste d to the Board that a decision was due as required to trigger the deeming provision of subsection C; the failure of the only writing cited by the physician to provide notice precluded any possibility that he could have been entitled to relief under subse ction C. Merchia v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 334 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2018). Initial interviews by investigators are just that, interviews; they do not trigger the statutory deadlines of subsection C. Merchia v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2018 Va. A pp. LEXIS 334 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2018). Right to a formal hearing is governed by the Virginia Administrative Process Act and the basic law (§ 62.1-44.2 et seq.). Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (1991). Former § 9-6.14:12 (see now this section and § 2.2-4020) does not mandate formal hearing s where basic law does not.  Where basic law (§ 62.1-44.2 et seq.) does not expressly provide for issuance of Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) permits only upon or a fter formal hearings, formal hearings are not mandatory under former § 9-6.14:12 (see now this section and § 2.2-4020). Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. A pp. LEXIS 100 (1991). Procedural objection not waived.  The mere failure to mention issue during oral argument of the facts of the matter does not amount to a waiver of the procedural objection. This statute does not r equire the party who is the target of the proceeding to present oral argument before the board, or even to appear at the full board hearing. Virginia Bd. of Medicine v. Fetta, 244 Va. 276, 421 S.E.2d 410, 9 Va. Law Rep. 256, 1992 Va. LEXIS 91 (1992). Denial of application for a septic tank permit after formal hearing and informal rejecti on of post-hearing applications constituted agency case decision, but only the formal denial disposed of the litigated issue within the meaning of former § 9-6.14:12 (see now this section and § 2.2-4020).

CASE NOTES Right to subpoena.  Former § 9-6.14:13 (see now this section) creates a statutory right, under certain conditions, to a subpoena in an administrative proceeding for parties theret o. State Health Dep't Sewage Handling &amp; Disposal v. Britton, 15 Va. App. 68, 421 S.E.2d 37, 9 Va. Law Rep. 199, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 236 (1992) (decided under prior law). Standard for quashing subpoe na duces tecum.  While the State Health Department Sewage Handling and Disposal Appeal Review Board may quash a subpoena as illegally or improvidently granted, it may not do so merely because it deems as too burdensome the requirement that it identify and produce relevant evidence. State Health Dep't Sewage Handling &amp; Disposal v. Britton, 15 Va. App. 68, 421 S.E.2d 37, 9 Va. Law Rep. 199, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 236 (1992) (d ecided under prior law). Appeal review board erred in quashing appellees subpoena duces tecum although the bo ard argued that the other permits appellee sought to subpoena had been illegally issued in violation of the regulations, and therefore, the evidence would not establish a legal basis for his entitlement to a permit. The statute does not deny a party acce ss to relevant evidence when, in the boards judgment, the otherwise relevant evidence might not convince it to act. While the evidence ultimately may not be sufficient to prove appellees entitlement, he has the right of access to relevant evidenc e in the boards possession and control and has the right to have it considered.

CASE NOTES Section deals only with duties of agencies.  Former § 9-6.14:14 (see now this section) does not deal with appeals but only with the duties of the various agencies. Occoquan Land Dev. Corp. v. Cooper, 239 Va. 363, 389 S.E.2d 464, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1574, 1990 Va. LEXIS 56 (1990) (decided under corresponding former provisions). Case decision.  Trial court properly held that a departments letter regarding the classification of business parks facility as a materials recovery facility was a case de cision and the mailing of the letter to the business park was sufficient service. Frederick County Bus. Park, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 52 Va. App. 40, 660 S.E.2d 698, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 244 (2008), aff'd, 278 Va. 207, 677 S.E.2d 42, 2009 Va. LEXIS 64 (2009). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Additional time to file notice of appeal.  Neither a city, nor the city council were entitled to a mailed copy of the final decision of the Virginia Department of Environmental Qualitys to grant reques ted variances to Virginia solid waste management regulations, which would have given them three additional days during which to file a notice of appeal, because a final case decision was to be served upon the named parties by mail. City of Norfolk v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 99 Va. Cir. 465, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 140 (Norfolk Aug. 24, 2018). Service of final decision.  Circuit court denied a citys motion for reconsideration because it ultimately found persuasive the evidence presented by a lessor, a lessee, and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) that service of the final decision to grant certain variances by DEQ on the lessor was made via mail and email; the city failed to satisfy its burden of production to present countervailing evidence that proper s ervice on the lessor had not been made. City of Norfolk v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 99 Va. Cir. 465, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 348 (Norfolk Oct. 16, 2018). § 2.2-4023.1. Reconsideration. Text A. A party may file a petition for reconsideration of an agencys final decision made pursuant to § 2.2-4020. The petition shall be filed with the agency not later than 15 days after service of the final decision and shall state the specific grounds on which rel ief is requested. The petition shall contain a full and clear statement of the facts pertaining to the reasons for reconsideration, the grounds in support thereof, and a statement of the relief desired. A timely filed petition for reconsideration shall n ot suspend the execution of the agency decision nor toll the time for filing a notice of appeal under Rule 2A:2 of the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia, unless the agency provides for suspension of its decision when it grants a petition for reconsidera tion. The failure to file a petition for reconsideration shall not constitute a failure to exhaust all administrative remedies. B. The agency shall render a written decision on a partys timely petition for reconsideration within 30 days from receipt of the petition for reconsideration. Such decision shall (i) deny the petition, (ii) modify the case decision, or (iii) vacate the case decisi on and set a new hearing for further proceedings. The agency shall state the reasons for its action. C. If reconsid eration is sought for the decision of a policy-making board of an agency, such board may (i) consider the petition for reconsideration at its next regularly scheduled meeting; (ii) schedule a special meeting to consider and decide upon the petition withi n 30 days of receipt; or (iii) notwithstanding any other provision of law, delegate authority to consider the petition to either the board chairman, a subcommittee of the board, or the director of the agency that provides administrative support to the bo ard, in which case a decision on the reconsideration shall be rendered within 30 days of receipt of the petition by the board. D. Denial of a petition for reconsideration shall not constitute a separate case decision and shall not on its own merits be subject to judicial review. It may, however, be considered by a reviewing court as part of any judicial review of the case decision itself. E. The agency may reconsider its final decision on its own initiative for good cause within 30 days of the date of the final decision. An agency may develop procedures for reconsideration of its final decisions on its own initiative. F.

An individu al who has served as investigator, prosecutor, or advocate at any stage in a contested case or who is subject to the authority, direction, or discretion of an individual who has served as investigator, prosecutor, or advocate at any stage in a contested case may not serve as the presiding officer or hearing officer in the same case. An agency head who has participated in a determination of probable cause or other preliminary determination in an adjudication may serve as the presiding officer in the adju dication unless a party demonstrates grounds for disqualification under subsection B. B. A presiding officer or hearing officer is subject to disqualification for any factor that would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality of the presiding officer or hearing officer, which may include bias, prejudice, financial interest, or ex parte co mmunications; however, the fact that a hearing officer is employed by an agency as a hearing officer, without more, is not grounds for disqualification. The presiding officer or hearing officer, after making a reasonable inquiry, shall disclose to the pa rties all known facts related to grounds for disqualification that are material to the impartiality of the presiding officer or hearing officer in the proceeding.

However, no appeal may be broug ht regarding the adequacy of standards of need and payment levels for public assistance and social services programs. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 2.2-4027, the review shall be based solely upon the agency record, and the court shall be limited to ascertaining whether there was evidence in the agency record to support the case decision of the agency acting as the trier of fact. If the court finds in favor of the party complaining of agency action, the court shall remand the case to the agency for further proceedings. The validity of any statute, regulation, standard or policy, federal or state, upon which the action of the agency was based shall not be subject to review by the court.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. Review only at insiste nce of owner aggrieved.  Former § 9-6.14:15 (see now this section) prohibits judicial review of a boards decision at the insistence of any one other than an owner aggrieved.  Town of Fries v. State Water Control Bd., 13 Va. App. 213, 409 S.E.2d 634, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1093, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 268 (1991). Legislative intent.  When the legislature created the trial de novo exclusion under former § 9-6.14:15 (see now this section), it contemplated agency actions whose subject matters were not subject to the standard of review set forth in former § 9-6.14:17 (see now § 2.2-4027). School Bd. v. Nicely, 12 Va. App. 1051, 408 S.E.2d 545, 8 Va. Law Rep. 367, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (1991). Failure to name proper party on appeal to circuit court.  Both former § 9-6.14:16 (see now this section and § 2.2-4026) and Supreme Court Rule 2A:1(b) require that the agency rendering a case decision be made a par ty to the judicial review proceeding; where such agency is not named, the appellants petition may be dismissed. Somers v. Accomack County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 291 (Va. Ct. App. May 29, 2001). An action brought pursuant to subsection D of § 22.1-214 (pertaining to provision of special education programs for handicapped children) amounts to a trial de novo for the purposes of clause (v) of former § 9-6.14:15 (see now this section), which excludes matters subject to trial de novo from the Virginia Administrative Process Act s provisions governing court review of agency decisions. School Bd. v. Nicely, 12 Va. App. 1051, 408 S.E.2d 545, 8 Va. Law Rep. 367, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (1991). Agencys action arbitrary a nd capricious.  Excavation company was entitled to recover reasonable costs and fees under this section where all issues in dispute were decided in its favor, the Department of M ines, Minerals &amp; Energys actions were arbitrary and capricious (Department sought determination that removal of dirt was mining within meaning of § 45.1-180), and there were no special circumstances to render the award unjust. Commonwealth Dep't of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy v. May Bros., 11 Va. App. 115, 396 S.E.2d 695, 7 Va. Law Rep. 499, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 170 (1990). Failure to comply with Virginia Supreme Court Rule 2A:4.  In a case in which a Medicaid claimant appealed a trial courts dismissal of his petition seeking review of a decision by the Virginia Department of Medical As sistance Services, the claimants indefinite allegations against the Alexandria Department of Human Services did not satisfy Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2A:4(b)s requirements that the petition for appeal specify the errors alleged and state the reasons why th e agencys case decision violated the law. Sudduth v. City of Alexandria Dep't of Human Servs., 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 466 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 20, 2009). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No appeal intervention.  Neighbor of landowner who appealed administrative decision concerning landowners land could not intervene in the appeal because she did not challenge the unla wfulness of the agency decision, but rather sought to preserve her interests, which had been obtained in the administrative procedure, and she was not an aggrieved person nor a necessary party. City of Norfolk Wetlands Bd. v. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n, 54 V a. Cir. 294, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 599 (Norfolk Dec. 21, 2000) (decided under prior law). Reviewability of claim.  Spouses claim that a Medicaid eligibility worker failed to advise her that she should set funds aside for burial was not reviewed, as it was not submitted to the agency for consideration. Sherline v. Finnerty, 65 Va. Cir. 154, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 143 (Fairfax County June 21, 2004). Failure to exhaust adminis trative remedies.  Owners suit seeking to enjoin a city from demolishing improvements on the owners property was barred because the owners failure to seek review provide d for by § 36-105 was a failure to exhaust administrative remedies; § 2.2-4025 et seq. provided for review by the circuit courts, which was due process of law. Family Home Servs., Inc. v. City of Norfolk, 72 Va. Cir. 320, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 311 (N orfolk Dec. 5, 2006). Standards of review.  As petitioner did not identify any statute that allowed a party to appeal a decision of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles regarding the issuance and revoc ation of vanity license plates by bringing an action outside of the Virginia Administrative Procedure Act, § 2.2-4025 did not apply and the standards of review of § 2.2-4027 governed his appeal, notwithstanding the fact that he raised a constitutio nal claim. Bujno v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. Cir. 32, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 143 (Chesapeake Nov. 2, 2012). Medicaid benefits denial affirmed.  Substantial evidence supported a hearing officers conclusion that there was no real agreement to transfer property in exchange for care as alleged by Medicaid applicants, and a decision denying Medicaid benefits to the applicants based on the transfer of their home to their daughter was affirmed.

Actions may be instituted in any court of competent jurisdic tion as provided in § 2.2-4003, and the judgments of the courts of original jurisdiction shall be subject to appeal to or review by higher courts as in other cases unless otherwise provided by law. In addition, when any regulation or case decision is the subject of an enforcement action in court, it shall also be reviewable by the court as a defense to the action, and the judgment or decree therein shall be appealable as in other cases. B. In any cour t action under this section by a person affected by and claiming the unlawfulness of any regulation on the basis that an agency failed to follow any procedure for the promulgation or adoption of a regulation specified in this chapter or in such agency s basic law, the burden shall be upon the party complaining of the agency action to designate and demonstrate the unlawfulness of the regulation by a preponderance of the evidence. If the court finds in favor of the party complaining of the agency ac tion, the court shall declare the regulation null and void and remand the case to the agency for further proceedings. C.

Some of the cases below were decided under former corresponding provisions. Purpose of section.  Section 62.1-44.29 is a statute providing for judicial review. The purpose of this section is to standardize court review . . . save as laws hereafter enact ed may otherwise expressly provide. Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (1991). This section does not supplement § 62.1-44.29 because the latter is not a basic law conferring authority on agencies either to make regulations or decide c ases. Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (1991). Applicability.  Where an agencys basic law provides expressly for Virginia Administrative Process Act coverage of certain proceedings under specified conditions and makes no provision for judicial review of other proceedings, the unmentioned proceedings are subject to the Act unless otherwise expressly excluded. May Dep't Stores Co. v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 29 Va. App. 589, 513 S.E.2d 880, 1999 Va. App. LEXI S 236 (1999). Virginia Administrative Process Act did not apply to suit challenging executive orders and emergency temporary standards taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemi c, because the orders were issued pursuant Virginia Emergency Law, which expressly authorized the Governor to declare a state of emergency and conferred upon the Governor the broad authority to issue orders necessary to protect public health and safety i n an emergency. Va. Mfrs. Ass'n v. Northam, 74 Va. App. 1, 866 S.E.2d 27, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 230 (2021). Prerequisites to judicial review.  A party must pursue administrative avenues that result in agency regulations and final case decisions before seeking judicial review. Fauquier County Dep't of Soc ial Servs. v. Robinson, 20 Va. App. 142, 455 S.E.2d 734, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 332 (1995). Section 32.1-164.1 provides special statutory form for review.  The procedure provided in § 32.1-164.1 is adequate to avoid the preclusive provisions of clause (ii) of the first sentence of former § 9-6.14:16 (see now th is section). Forbes v. Kenley, 227 Va. 55, 314 S.E.2d 49, 1984 Va. LEXIS 267 (1984). This section does not create an additional basis for jurisdiction, but instead gives deference to provisions of the basic law, such as § 62.1-44.29, which makes express provisions for standing. Town of Fries v. State Water Control Bd., 13 Va. App. 213, 409 S.E.2d 634, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1093, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 268 (1991). Jurisdiction of circuit court.  The Administrative Process Act confers upon the circuit court the power to review agency case decisions. Avery v. Virginia Retirement Sys., 33 Va. App. 210, 532 S .E.2d 348, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 589 (2000), aff'd, 262 Va. 538, 551 S.E.2d 612, 2001 Va. LEXIS 93 (2001). A determination addressing only an agencys legal duties does not qualify for review under the Virginia Administrative Process Act. Giannoukos v. Va. Bd. of Me d. &amp; Dep't of Health Professions, 44 Va. App. 694, 607 S.E.2d 136, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (2005). Circuit court did not err in granting the motion filed by the Virginia Board of Agriculture and Consumer Services to dismiss a citizens petition for appeal be cause the citizen failed to file notice within the 30-day period as required by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2A:2, and thus, the circuit court never gained appellate jurisdiction to consider the merits of any assignments of error with respect to the Board; the Board s publication of the final regulation in the August 18, 2008, issue of the Register of Regulations triggered the 30-day final adoption period as required by the Virginia Administrative Process Act, subsection D of § 2.2-4013, and on September 17, 2008, the regulation was adopted and became effective, but the citizens notice of appeal was not filed until October 30, 2008. Russell v. Va. Bd. of Agric. &amp; Consumer Servs., 59 Va. App. 86, 717 S.E.2d 413, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 364 (2011). Because a county department of social services was a unit of county government and exempt from the Virginia Administrative Process Act, the circuit court was with out jurisdiction to hear a daughters appeal of its decision; at no time did a state agency make a finding against the daughter, and consequently, the statutory right to judicial review of the case decision of an administrative agency under the Act di d not apply. Pittsylvania Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Gosney, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (Va. Ct. App. May 2, 2017). Ba sic law standing requirement controls over this section.  Where the basic law contains a specific standing requirement, such as that contained in § 62.1-44.29, this requirement is controlling over the standardized cou rt review in this section. Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (1991). This section gives deference to provisions of the basic law, such as § 62.1-44.29, which make express provisions for standing. This construction is supported by the concluding sentence of former § 9-6.14:3 (see now § 2.2-4000 B). Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 12 Va. App. 456, 404 S.E.2d 728, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2575, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (1991). Where there is a specific provision for standing in the basic law, such provision is controlling over the standardized court review in this section. Citizens for Clean Air v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Air Pollution Control Bd., 13 Va. App. 430, 412 S.E.2d 715, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1585, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 320 (1991). The State Air Pollution Control Law, §§ 10.1-1300 et seq., contains a specific provision with respect to standing to appeal and, thus, precludes recourse th rough the Administrative Process Act, unless the party seeking review is an owner aggrieved by a final decision of the board. Citizens for Clean Air v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Air Pollution Control Bd., 13 Va. App. 430, 412 S.E.2d 715, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1585, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 320 (1991). Property owners had standing.  Property owners petition for appeal complied with Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2A:4(b) and contained all of the elements required by the rule. The circuit court improperly expanded the requirements of the rule when it found the owners petition for appeal insufficient to establish standing and the owners were entitled to an evidentiary hearing in circuit court on the issue of standing. Clark v. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n, 55 Va. App. 328, 685 S.E.2d 863, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 537 (2009). Property owner lacked standing.  Circuit court properly dismissed an owners appeal of the Board for Contractors decision denying him standing as a party in a disciplinary proceeding again st a contractor because he did not establish that he was aggrieved, the Board lacked authority to determine who was responsible for correcting the violations in the owners residence, the owners right to pursue direct relief with the City Code Adm inistration was not affected, and, while he had an imme...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_2.2-4027"><akn:num>§ 2.2-4027</akn:num><akn:heading>Issues on review</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The burden shall be upon the party complaining of agency action to designate and demonstrate an error of law subject to review by the court. Such issues of law include: (i) accordance with constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity, (ii) compliance with statutory authority, jurisdiction limitations, or right as provided in the basic laws as to subject matter, the stated objectives for which regulations may be made, and the factual showing respecting violations or entitlement in connection with case decisions, (iii) observance of required procedure where any failure therein is not mere harmless error, and (iv) the substantiality of the evidentiary support for findings of fact. The determination of such fact issue shall be made upon the whole evidentiary record provided by the agency if its proceeding was required to be conducted as provided in § 2.2-4009 or 2.2-4020 or, as to subjects exempted from those s ections, pursuant to constitutional requirement or statutory provisions for opportunity for an agency record of and decision upon the evidence therein. In addition to any other judicial review provided by law, a small business, as defined in subsection A of § 2.2-4007.1, that is adversely affected or aggrieved by fi nal agency action shall be entitled to judicial review of compliance with the requirements of subdivision A 2 of § 2.2-4007.04 and § 2.2-4007.1 within one year following the date of final agency action. When the decision on review is to be made on the agency record, the duty of the court with respect to issues of fact shall be to determine whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record to support the agency decision. The duty of the court with respect to the issues of law shall be to review the agency decision de novo. The court shall enter judgment in accordance with § 2.2-4029. Where there is no agency record so required and made, any necessary facts in controversy shall be determined by the court upon the basis of the agency file, minutes, an d records of its proceedings under § 2.2-4007.01 or 2.2-4019 as augmented, if need be, by the agency pursuant to order of the court or supplemented by any allowable and necessary proofs adduced in court except that the function of the court shall be t o determine only whether the result reached by the agency could reasonably be said, on all such proofs, to be within the scope of the legal authority of the agency. Whether the fact issues are reviewed on the agency record or one made in the review action, the court shall take due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.

I.In General. Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former corresponding provisions. Cases subject to the standard of review outlined in this section cannot be considered a trial de novo since the factual issues on appeal are controlled solely by the agency record. The reviewing court is not free to take additional evidence, even at the request of one of the parties. School Bd. v. Nicely, 12 Va. App. 1051, 408 S.E.2d 545, 8 Va. Law Rep. 367, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (1991). When the legislature created the trial de novo exclusion under former § 9-6.14:15 (see now § 2.2-4025), it contemplated agency actions whose subject matters were not subject to the standard of review set forth in this section. School Bd. v. Nicely, 12 Va. App. 1051, 408 S.E.2d 545, 8 Va. Law Rep. 367, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (1991). The scope of court review of a litigated issue under this chapter is limited to a determ ination of whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record to support the decision. State Bd. of Health v. Godfrey, 223 Va. 423, 290 S.E.2d 875, 1982 Va. LEXIS 221 (1982). Proper judicial review of boards action must not be restricted to legal issues, but must encompass all . . . proofs found within the entire record. In terrelated factual and legal issues must be considered together in the context of the entire record, with each examined under the appropriate standard of review. Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 15 Va. App. 271, 422 S .E.2d 608, 9 Va. Law Rep. 438, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 268 (1992). Amendments did not alter standard of review.  Standard of review was not altered by the 2013 amendments; the General Assembly left intact the language that requires courts to take due account of the presumpti on of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted. Women's Healthcare Assocs. v. Mucci, 64 Va. App. 420, 768 S.E.2d 720, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2015). Plain reading of the statute, with due consideration to the words used and their context in the overall statutory scheme, and the applicable canons of statutory c onstruction, assures that the legislature effected no change to the substantial evidence standard in place prior to the 2013 amendments; the 2013 amendments to the statute did not alter the established standard for a circuit court reviewing an agency s factual determinations. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Blair, 64 Va. App. 756, 772 S.E.2d 26, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 177 (2015). Due process rights not violate d.  Virginia Board of Medicine did not fail to afford a physician due process protections because he received notice of the allegations against him, was given the opp ortunity to cross-examine all of the witnesses against him, and was represented by counsel; the physician did not demonstrate any bias on the part of the chairman of the Board because although the Board found against him regarding record keeping issues, it did not make an adverse finding against him regarding the fraud charges. Merchia v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 334 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2018). Notice requirements.  Virginia Board of Medicine did not fail to afford a physician due process protections because he received notice of the allegations against him, was given the opp ortunity to cross-examine all of the witnesses against him, and was represented by counsel; the physician did not demonstrate any bias on the part of the chairman of the Board because although the Board found against him regarding record keeping issues, it did not make an adverse finding against him regarding the fraud charges. Merchia v. Va. Bd. of Med., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 334 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2018). Limitation on evidence.  In an agency appeal, the circuit court is not free to take additional evidence at the request of one of the parties, but is obliged to defer to the trier of fact. J.P. v. Carter, 24 Va. App. 707, 485 S.E.2d 162, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 310 (1997). Trial court wrongly considered evidence not presented to the State Health Commissioner regarding an application for a certificate of public need because there was no showing of bias of the State Health Department, so there was no legal basis for receiving new evidence. Levine v. Arlington Med. Imaging, LLC, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 23, 2018). Burd en to establish insufficiency of evidence.  The burden of proof rests upon the party challenging the agency determination to show that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support it. Baumann v. Virginia Retirement Sys., 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 632 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 29, 2000). Virginia Administrative Process Act governs dental disciplinary hearings before the Virginia Board of Dentistry. A dentist, as the complaining party, bears the bu rden of proving the Board committed an error of law under § 2.2-4027. Doe v. Va. Bd. of Dentistry, 52 Va. App. 166, 662 S.E.2d 99, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 411 (2008). The circuit courts role.  Under the Virginia Administrative Process Act, the circuit courts role in an appeal from an agency decision is equivalent to an appellate courts role in a n appeal from a trial court. School Bd. v. Nicely, 12 Va. App. 1051, 408 S.E.2d 545, 8 Va. Law Rep. 367, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (1991). Reversal of an administrative decision and an award of benefits constituted error under § 2.2-4029, which precluded a court from supplying agency action that w as committed by the basic law to the agency.

Otherwise the court may, on proper application and with or without bond, deposits in court, or other safeguards or assurances as may be suitable, issue all necessary and appropriate process t o postpone the effective dates or preserve existing status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings if the court finds the same to be required to prevent immediate, unavoidable, and irreparable injury and that the issues of law or fact pres ented are not only substantial but that there is probable cause for it to anticipate a likelihood of reversible error in accordance with § 2.2-4027. Actions by the court may include (i) the stay of operation of agency decisions of an injunctive nature or those requiring the payment of money or suspending or revoking a license or other benefit and (ii) continuation of previous licenses in effect until timely applications for renewal are duly determined by the agency. History History. 1975, c. 503, § 9-6.14:18; 2001, c. 844. Annotations CASE NOTES Applicability.  Assuming without deciding that the statute permitted the issuance of an interlocutory injunction, petitioners were not entitled to such extraordinary relief becau se they did not show that the usual relief under the statute, a stay of the permit, would be inadequate. NAACP (Hanover Cnty. Chapter) v. Commonwealth ex rel. Va. State Water Control Bd., 74 Va. App. 702, 871 S.E.2d 662, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 116 (2022). Motion to remand.  Circuit court did not err by denying appellants motions to remand because the relief that appellant requested was not to postpone an effective date or preserv e the existing status or rights pending the courts review, but to reopen the administrative proceedings to present what appellant contended was new evidence. However, the court was limited to reviewing the agency record to determine whether substanti al evidence supported the administrative hearing officers finding. Moon v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2019). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Illustrative cases.  Automobile dealer who sought judicial review of a decision by the Virginia Motor Vehicle Dealer Board, revoking his licenses and imposing a $1,500 fine, did not s how he was likely to prevail in the courts, and the circuit court denied the dealers motion for intermediate relief. Bryden v. Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd., 60 Va. Cir. 279, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 393 (Arlington County Oct. 28, 2002). Although the trial court had the authority to act if it found that doing so was required to prevent immediate, unavoidable, and irreparable injury, such was not n ecessary in the instant case involving a dispute over whether the resident was entitled to a permit to fix a damaged bulkhead that was causing erosion to his waterfront property, as the resident had already been issued the permit and had completed the ne w bulkhead; accordingly, there was no basis that would permit the trial court to stay the action. Stearns v. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n, 60 Va. Cir. 296, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 395 (Norfolk Oct. 29, 2002). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Pollution abatement permits.  A pollution abatement permit is a final decision of the Board, and if no timely appeal is taken, the permit is valid and enforceable by its terms and not subject to appeal. On the other hand, unless the court should stay, suspend, or set aside one or both of the pollution abatement permits that were appealed, each remains valid and enforceable.

CASE NOTES Court may not undertake agency action.  Where a circuit court has made a determination of invalidity, the court shall suspend or set the decision aside and remand the matter to the agency. The court its elf may not undertake the agency action directly. Virginia Bd. of Medicine v. Fetta, 244 Va. 276, 421 S.E.2d 410, 9 Va. Law Rep. 256, 1992 Va. LEXIS 91 (1992) (decided under former corresponding provisions). Reversal of an administrative decision and an award of benefits constituted error under § 2.2-4029, which precluded a court from supplying agency action that w as exclusively committed by the basic law to the agency itself. Failure of a decision to comply with § 2.2-4027 required a remand to the agency for further proceedings. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Cirillo, 54 Va. App. 193, 676 S.E.2d 368, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 228 (2009). Action by the court.  The clear statutory language contemplates that the circuit court may order a new hearing upon remand or may order dismissal of the charges, resulting in no furthe r hearing at all. Virginia Bd. of Medicine v. Fetta, 244 Va. 276, 421 S.E.2d 410, 9 Va. Law Rep. 256, 1992 Va. LEXIS 91 (1992) (decided under former corresponding provisions). Trial court erred in upholding the state environmental quality departments decision that found the corporation was entitled to reimbursement from the Petroleu m Storage Tank Fund limited to the reduction in market value of the property that the corporations spill damaged, and, thus, that it need not consider the amount of the settlement the corporation paid to the other company for the damage to its proper ty. The settlement amount was a relevant indicator of the reasonable and necessary cost the corporation incurred in cleaning up the spill, and, thus, the record demonstrated that an error of law had occurred in calculating the proper amount of reimbursem ent; as a result, the trial courts affirmance of the state environmental quality departments decision had to be reversed and the case had to be remanded for further proceedings. 7-Eleven, Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 42 Va. App. 65, 590 S.E. 2d 84, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 703 (2003) (reversing 7-Eleven, Inc. v. Va. Dept. of Envtl. Quality, 56 Va. Cir. 276, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 458 (Richmond 2001)). Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) added a special requirement to a permittees Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System discharge perm it obliging it to allow photography by VDEQ inspectors. Pursuant to § 2.2-4029, the trial court properly directed VDEQ to amend the special requirement to state that the permittee could not prevent photography reasonably related to the purpose of the site visit and the particular inspection being carried out under the permit. Bowman Apple Prods. Co. v. State Water Control Bd., 50 Va. App. 383, 650 S.E.2d 548, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 345 (2007). Circuit court did not err by denying appellants motions to remand because the relief that appellant requested was not to postpone an effective date or preserv e the existing status or rights pending the courts review, but to reopen the administrative proceedings to present what appellant contended was new evidence. However, the court was limited to reviewing the agency record to determine whether substanti al evidence supported the administrative hearing officers finding. Moon v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2019). Failure to make findings require d remand.  Because the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board granted an applicant licenses allowing liquor sales only until 12:00 a.m., without making findings of fact o r conclusions of law to support these time restrictions, as required by § 2.2-4020, the case was remanded to Board pursuant to § 2.2-4029 so it could make such findings. Harrison v. Ocean View Fishing Pier, LLC, 50 Va. App. 556, 651 S.E.2d 421, 200 7 Va. App. LEXIS 397 (2007). Agency final decision not found.  Because a trial courts order did not address the merits of a sanction imposed on real estate agents by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupationa l Regulation, Real Estate Board, but remanded the matter for or further consideration, its order was not a final decision within the meaning of § 17.1-405, and the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to consider the Boards appeal. Commonw ealth v. Lancaster, 45 Va. App. 723, 613 S.E.2d 828, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (2005). Final judgment appropriate.  Because the court of appeals reinstated the agencys action, final judgment was appropriate. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Blair, 64 Va. App. 756, 772 S.E.2d 26, 2015 Va.

Applicability.  Upon the trial courts dismissal of a protective order when it found that the Department of Family Services had failed to establish that the fathers child was abused and/or neglected, the father was not entitled to an award of attorneys fees; the department was not an agency as defined under former § 9-6.14:4 (see now § 2.2-4501) and former § 9-6.14:15 et seq. (see now § 2.2-4025 et seq.) did n ot apply to matters subject by law to a trial de novo in any court. Simonds v. Fairfax County Dep't of Family Servs., 36 Va. App. 243, 549 S.E.2d 607, 2001 Va.

Statutory limit applies to eac h defendant.  When eight nursing facilities were entitled to recover their attorneys fees and costs under subsection A of § 2.2-4030, the statutory limit of $25,000 appl ied to each facility, rather than to all of the facilities as a group, because, in permitting any person in any civil case to recover fees up to the stated limit, the legislature intended, where each facility independently filed its own n otice of appeal, which was then consolidated with the other facilities appeals into a single proceeding, in accordance with Va.

Where several providers appeals of the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services denial of their claims for increased Medicaid reimbursement were consolidated into one case under Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 2A:3, and they substantially prevailed, the $25,000 cap on attorneys fees awards had to be applied on a per party basis, rather than a per case basis. Dep't of Med. Assistance Servs. v. Beverly Heal thcare, 268 Va. 278, 601 S.E.2d 604, 2004 Va. LEXIS 136 (2004). Award upheld.  Trial courts award of attorney fees to corporation was proper pursuant to former § 9-6.14:21 (see now this section), as corporation substantially prevailed on the merits of its case that it had not received Medicaid payments in excess of what it was entitled to for two different years, state government agency was found to have acted unreasonably in trying to recover the alleged overpayments, and no special circumstances made the attorney fee award to the corporation unjust. Smith v. Liberty Nursing Home, Inc., 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 543 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2001). Circuit court properly denied a service provider for the Medicaid program attorneys fees and costs because the position of the Department of Medical Assistanc e Services was substantially justified and prevailed on appeal. Morrison Comprehensive Learning Ctr., LLC v. Va. Dep't of Med. Assistance Servs., 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 122 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 12, 2016). Denial upheld.  Denial of an accuseds request for attorneys fees and costs with regard to a circuit court reversing a founded disposition of sexual abuse against the accu sed was upheld on appeal as substantially justified since the Department of Social Services (DSSs) disposition was justified and it was reversed due to procedural violations, not substantive, in that the DSSs failure to record the victims interview caused the reversal of the disposition. Jones v. West, 46 Va. App. 309, 616 S.E.2d 790, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (2005). Two landfill operators did not substantially prevail on the merits of their appeals of the decisions of the Director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Q uality denying their requests for variances from ground water monitoring requirements and requiring ground water monitoring at a closed portion of a landfill, and the Directors decisions were substantially justified; the trial court did not err by re fusing to award the operators attorneys fees and costs. Elbow Farm, Inc. v. Paylor, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 13, 2007). As a property owners claim on appeal that a decision of the trial court, upholding the State Building code Technical Review Boards determination that the absence of firestops in the residents condominium building did not violate the Virginia Maintenance Code, 13 VAC § 5-63-450(A), lacked merit, he was not entitled to an award of attorneys fees pursuant to subsection A of § 2.2-4030. Clayton v. State Bldg. Code Tech. Review Bd., 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 36 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 8, 2011). Circuit court properly denied attorneys fees to a Medicaid provider because the provider did not substantially prevail and the agencys decision was substa ntially justified. Dep't of Med. Assistance Services v. Ablix Corp., 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 82 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 17, 2015). Because citizens did not prevail in the circuit court or in the court of appeals, they were not entitled to attorneys fees as they did not substantially preva il on the merits of the case, and the position of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality was substantially justified. Karr v. Va. Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 66 Va. App. 507, 789 S.E.2d 121, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 221 (2016). Denial erroneous.  Trial court erred in denying an award of attorneys fees under § 2.2-4030 to a commercial waterman where the waterman substantially prevailed in a challenge to the lawfulness of 4 VAC § 20-1140-20, a crab dredging regulation, and where the Virginia Marine Resources Commission was unreasonable, and thus not substantially justified in promulgating the regulation, as a matter of law. Hollowell v. Va. Marine Res. Comm'n, 56 Va. App. 70, 691 S.E.2d 500, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 150 (2010).

This chapte r may be cited as the Virginia Public Procurement Act. B. The purpose of this chapter is to enunciate the public policies pertaining to governmental procurement from nongovernmental sources, to include governmental procurement that may or may not result in monetary consideration for either party. This chapter shall apply whether the consideration is monetary or nonmonetary and regardless of whether the public body, the contractor, or some third party is providing the consideration. C. To the end that public bodies in the Commonwealth obtain high quality goods and services at reasonable cost, that all procurement procedures be conducted in a fair and impartial manner with avoidance of any impropriety or appearance of impropriety, that all qualifi ed vendors have access to public business and that no offeror be arbitrarily or capriciously excluded, it is the intent of the General Assembly that competition be sought to the maximum feasible degree, that procurement procedures involve openness and ad ministrative efficiency, that individual public bodies enjoy broad flexibility in fashioning details of such competition, that the rules governing contract awards be made clear in advance of the competition, that specifications reflect the procurement ne eds of the purchasing body rather than being drawn to favor a particular vendor, and that the purchaser and vendor freely exchange information concerning what is sought to be procured and what is offered. Public bodies may consider best value concepts wh en procuring goods and nonprofessional services, but not construction or professional services. The criteria, factors, and basis for consideration of best value and the process for the consideration of best value shall be as stated in the procurement sol icitation.

Prospective contractors may be prequalified for particular types of supplies, services, insurance or construction, and consideration of bids or proposals limited to prequalified contractors. Any prequalification procedure shall be established in writing and suffici ently in advance of its implementation to allow potential contractors a fair opportunity to complete the process. B. Any prequal ification of prospective contractors for construction by a public body shall be pursuant to a prequalification process for construction projects adopted by the public body. The process shall be consistent with the provisions of this section.The applicati on form used in such process shall set forth the criteria upon which the qualifications of prospective contractors will be evaluated. The application form shall request of prospective contractors only such information as is appropriate for an objective e valuation of all prospective contractors pursuant to such criteria. The form shall allow the prospective contractor seeking prequalification to request, by checking the appropriate box, that all information voluntarily submitted by the contractor pursuan t to this subsection shall be considered a trade secret or proprietary information subject to the provisions of subsection D of § 2.2-4342.In all instances in which the public body requires prequalification of potential contractors for construction pr ojects, advance notice shall be given of the deadline for the submission of prequalification applications. The deadline for submission shall be sufficiently in advance of the date set for the submission of bids for such construction so as to allow the pr ocedures set forth in this subsection to be accomplished.At least 30 days prior to the date established for submission of bids or proposals under the procurement of the contract for which the prequalification applies, the public body shall advise in writ ing each contractor who submitted an application whether that contractor has been prequalified.

C. A public bo dy may deny prequalification to any contractor only if the public body finds one of the following: 1. The c ontractor does not have sufficient financial ability to perform the contract that would result from such procurement. If a bond is required to ensure performance of a contract, evidence that the contractor can acquire a surety bond from a corporation inc luded on the United States Treasury list of acceptable surety corporations in the amount and type required by the public body shall be sufficient to establish the financial ability of the contractor to perform the contract resulting from such procurement ; 2. The contractor does not have appropriate experience to perform the construction project in question; 3. The contractor or any officer, director or owner thereof has had judgments entered against him within the past ten years for the breach of contracts for governmental or nongovernmental construction, including, but not limited to, design-build or construction management; 4. The contractor has been in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of prior construction contracts with a public body without good cause. If the public body has not con tracted with a contractor in any prior construction contracts, the public body may deny prequalification if the contractor has been in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of comparable construction contracts with another public body w ithout good cause. A public body may not utilize this provision to deny prequalification unless the facts underlying such substantial noncompliance were documented in writing in the prior construction project file and such information relating thereto gi ven to the contractor at that time, with the opportunity to respond; 5. The contractor or any officer, director, owner, project manager, procurement manager or chief financial official thereof has been convicted within the past ten years of a crime related to governmental or nongovernmental construction or contracting, including, but not limited to, a violation of (i) Article 6 (§ 2.2-4367 et seq.) of this chapter, (ii) the Virginia Governmental Frauds Act (§ 18.2-498.1 et seq.), (iii) Chapter 4.2 ( § 59.1-68.6 et seq.) of Title 59.1, or (iv) any substantially similar law of the United States or another state; 6.

CASE NOTES Unreasonable delay damages waiver void.  Provisions in a joint ventures contract with a waste water treatment facility, whereby the joint venture was to construct the facility, were held to be void a s violative of subsection A of § 2.2-4335, as the contract provided that the joint venture waived, released, and extinguished all unreasonable delay damages unless the unreasonable delay was coupled with the facilitys bad faith, malice, gross negl igence, or abandonment of the contract; the contract provisions directly contradicted the specific statutory prohibition of subsection A of § 2.2-4335 and accordingly, the appellate court found that the trial courts judgment sustaining the validit y of the contract provisions was erroneous under § 8.01-680.

No basis for cost application.  Trial courts denial of a waste water treatment facilitys motion for costs, pursuant to subsection C of § 2.2-4335, was properly denied where the prior law of the case indicated that material breach damages were still in the consolidated cases between the parties, arising from contract disputes on a public project that were appealed to the circuit court pursuant to the Virginia Public Procurement Act, § 2.2-4300 et seq.; accordingly, there was no evidence of a false or statutorily baseless delay damages claim upon which the facility could anchor its application for statutory costs.

CASE NOTES Relationship with § 8.01-246.  In a case in which the underlying contracts for which the payment bonds were issued fell under the Virginia Public Procurement Act (VPPA), a paving companys c ontention that the five-year limitations period under subdivision 2 of § 8.01-246, which was applicable to written agreements, would apply rather than subsection C of § 2.2-4341, failed since under the VPPA, subsection C of this section was specifi cally applicable to VPPA-derived actions. APAC-Atlantic, Inc. v. General Ins. Co., 273 Va. 682, 643 S.E.2d 483, 2007 Va. LEXIS 49 (2007). Contractual reduction of notice period held invalid.  A subcontractor on a public construction project, who was not a party to payment bonds, could not be bound by a provision in the bonds which required written noti ce of a claim within a 90-day period, as the parties to the bond could not reduce the 180-day notice period prescribed by this section without subcontractors consent.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Subcontractor for subcontractor could recover on general contractors payment bond.  Sheet metal company, hired by a subcontractor, fell within the criteria for a claimant, and thus, the sheet metal company could recover against the general contra ctors payment bond. Even if the surety was correct that the language of payment bond was more general than Virginia law required, there was no conflict with Virginia Public Procurement Act, § 2.2-4300 et seq., and the broader provisions of the bon d took precedence. Stromberg Sheet Metal Works, Inc. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 71 Va. Cir. 122, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 102 (Fairfax County June 13, 2006). Subcontractor had a cause of action under this section to recover against the bond required by subsection A of § 2.2-4337 because the provision of a site to du mp land-clearing debris from the project was as much a material provision for the project as if it had supplied newly manufactured products for incorporation in the project. Yard Works, L.L.C. v. GroundDown Constructors, L.L.C., 85 Va. Cir. 273, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Hanover County Aug. 28, 2012). Notice.  Only evidence offered to establish the date of delivery of notice was an exhibit attached to defendants motion for summary judgment that purported to be the c ertified mail receipt/return and the tracking history, and although the exhibit was a pleading, while properly authenticated documents are presumably admissible at trial, the court cannot find authority for granting summary judgment based on unauthentica ted documents attached to the motion; the facts referenced in the exhibit were contested, and as a material fact issue remained, the motion was denied.

Such notice shall state the basis for the determination, which shall be final unless the bidder appeals the decision within 10 days after receipt of the notice by invoking administrati ve procedures meeting the standards of § 2.2-4365, if available, or in the alternative by instituting legal action as provided in § 2.2-4364.The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to procurements involving the prequalification of bidders and the rights of any potential bidders under such prequalification to appeal a decision that such bidders are not responsible. B. If, upon ap peal pursuant to § 2.2-4364 or 2.2-4365, it is determined that the decision of the public body was not (i) an honest exercise of discretion, but rather was arbitrary or capricious or (ii) in accordance with the Constitution of Virginia, applicable sta te law or regulation, or the terms or conditions of the Invitation to Bid, and the award of the contract in question has not been made, the sole relief shall be a finding that the bidder is a responsible bidder for the contract in question or directed aw ard as provided in subsection A of § 2.2-4364 or both.If it is determined that the decision of the public body was not an honest exercise of discretion, but rather was arbitrary or capricious or not in accordance with the Constitution of Virginia, app licable state law or regulation, or the terms or conditions of the Invitation to Bid, and an award of the contract has been made, the relief shall be as set forth in subsection B of § 2.2-4360. C. A bidder co ntesting a determination that he is not a responsible bidder for a particular contract shall proceed under this section, and may not protest the award or proposed award under the provisions of § 2.2-4360. D. Nothing con tained in this section shall be construed to require a public body, when procuring by competitive negotiation, to furnish a statement of the reasons why a particular proposal was not deemed to be the most advantageous. E. Any determi nation that a low bidder is not responsible that uses such factors listed in the Invitation to Bid as a basis for its decision shall be presumptively considered an honest exercise of discretion.

CASE NOTES Bidder sufficiently pleade d cause of action.  Circuit court erred in sustaining a county school boards demurrer to a corporations complaint alleging that the school board violated the Virginia Public Procurement Act, § 2.2-4300 et seq., because the corporation adequately alleged that the school board failed to properly follow the requirements of the Act; the school board did not notify the corporation that it was determined to be not responsible p ursuant to the provisions set forth in the Act, subsection A of § 2.2-4359. Prof'l Bldg. Maint. Corp. v. Sch. Bd., 283 Va. 747, 725 S.E.2d 543, 2012 Va. LEXIS 83 (2012). Circuit court erred in sustaining a county school boards demurrer to a corporations complaint alleging that the school board violated the Virginia Public Procurement Act, § 2.2-4300 et seq., because the corporations allegations were not merely conclusory, and they sufficiently stated a cause of action under the Act; the corporation alleged the school board willfully disregarded the fact that the co rporation submitted the lowest bid and failed to either award the contract to it or determine that it was not responsible as required by the Act, and the corporation alleged that certain scores it was given had no basis in fact and did not bear a rationa l relationship with the information provided in its bid.

Any bidder or offeror, who desires to protest the award or decision to award a contract shall submit the protest in writing to the public body, or an official designated by the public body, no later than ten days after the award or the announcement of the decision to award, whichever occurs first. Public notice of the award or the announcement of the decision to award shall be given by the public body in the manner prescribed in the terms or conditions of the Invitation to Bid or Request for Proposal. Any potentia l bidder or offeror on a contract negotiated on a sole source or emergency basis who desires to protest the award or decision to award such contract shall submit the protest in the same manner no later than ten days after posting or publication of the no tice of such contract as provided in § 2.2-4303. However, if the protest of any actual or potential bidder or offeror depends in whole or in part upon information contained in public records pertaining to the procurement transaction that are subject t o inspection under § 2.2-4342, then the time within which the protest shall be submitted shall expire ten days after those records are available for inspection by such bidder or offeror under § 2.2-4342, or at such later time as provided in this se ction. No protest shall lie for a claim that the selected bidder or offeror is not a responsible bidder or offeror. The written protest shall include the basis for the protest and the relief sought. The public body or designated official shall issue a de cision in writing within ten days stating the reasons for the action taken. This decision shall be final unless the bidder or offeror appeals within ten days of receipt of the written decision by invoking administrative procedures meeting the standards o f § 2.2-4365, if available, or in the alternative by instituting legal action as provided in § 2.2-4364. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit a bidder to challenge the validity of the terms or conditions of the Invitation to Bid or Request for Proposal. B. If prior to an award it is determined that the decision to award is arbitrary or capricious, then the sole relief shall be a finding to that effect. The public body shall cancel the proposed award or revise it to comply with the law. If, after an award, it is deter mined that an award of a contract was arbitrary or capricious, then the sole relief shall be as hereinafter provided.Where the award has been made but performance has not begun, the performance of the contract may be enjoined. Where the award has been ma de and performance has begun, the public body may declare the contract void upon a finding that this action is in the best interest of the public. Where a contract is declared void, the performing contractor shall be compensated for the cost of performan ce up to the time of such declaration. In no event shall the performing contractor be entitled to lost profits. C. Where a pub lic body, an official designated by that public body, or an appeals board determines, after a hearing held following reasonable notice to all bidders, that there is probable cause to believe that a decision to award was based on fraud or corruption or on an act in violation of Article 6 (§ 2.2-4367 et seq.) of this chapter, the public body, designated official or appeals board may enjoin the award of the contract to a particular bidder.

LEXIS 82 (1998) (decided under former corresponding provisions). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Appeal before announ cement of award not allowed.  Virginia Public Procurement Act, § 2.2-4300 et seq., did not permit an appeal before the public bodys announcement of its decision; a contractors prote st, submitted in response to information that it would not be awarded a contract, was not capable of being appealed as it was filed before announcement of the award. John T. Moore &amp; Assocs., P.C. v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 69 Va. Cir. 200, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 356 (Richmond Oct. 24, 2005). Amount of damages.  When a state university official wrote in an e-mail to a marketing expert that a contract submitted to the expert was void because it was initiated by an individu al at the university without authority to do so, the expert, as of that date, had submitted three invoices and done a good deal of work on the contract. Therefore, the expert was entitled to be compensated for the cost of performance up to the time of th e officials declaration that the contract was void. Landfall Consulting, LLC v. Va. State Univ., 90 Va. Cir. 38, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 21 (Richmond Feb. 10, 2015). Demurrer granted.  In a case in which the county published a request for proposals for healthcare services for the inmates of the jail pursuant to the Virginia Public Procurement Ac t (VPPA), the court granted the countys and the jail authoritys second demurrer because, in response to plaintiffs concerns about the procurement process, defendants, in keeping with the VPPA, provided a full remedy under this statute, result ing in the cancellation of the request for proposals and the opening of a new request for proposals upon conclusion of the litigation; thus, to the extent plaintiff was entitled to relief, it had already received that relief under the VPPA  cancellat ion of the old request for proposals and the opening of a new request for proposals  and the matter was moot.

Contractual claims, whether for money or other relief, shall be submitted in writing no later than 60 days after final payment. However, written notice of the contractors intention to file a claim shall be given at the time of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim is based. Nothing herein shall preclude a contract from requiring submission of an invoice for final payment within a certain time after completion and acceptance of the work or acceptance of the goods. Pendency of claims shall not delay payment of amounts agreed due in the final payment. B. Each public body shall include in its contracts a procedure for consideration of contractual claims. Such procedure, which may be contained in the contract or may be specifically incorporated into the contract by reference and made available to the contractor, shal l establish a time limit for a final decision in writing by the public body. If the public body has established administrative procedures meeting the standards of § 2.2-4365, such procedures shall be contained in the contract or specifically incorpora ted in the contract by reference and made available to the contractor. C. If, however , the public body fails to include in its contracts a procedure for consideration of contractual claims, the following procedure shall apply: 1. Contr actual claims, whether for money or other relief, shall be submitted in writing no later than 60 days after receipt of final payment; however, written notice of the contractors intention to file a claim shall be given at the time of the occurrence or at the beginning of the work upon which the claim is based. 2. No written decision denying a claim or addressing issues related to the claim shall be considered a denial of the claim unless the written decision is signed by the public bodys ch ief administrative officer or his designee. The contractor may not institute legal action prior to receipt of the final written decision on the claim unless the public body fails to render a decision within 90 days of submission of the claim. Failure of the public body to render a decision within 90 days shall not result in the contractor being awarded the relief claimed or in any other relief or penalty. The sole remedy for the public bodys failure to render a decision within 90 days shall be the c ontractors right to institute immediate legal action. D. A contracto r may not invoke administrative procedures meeting the standards of § 2.2-4365, if available, or institute legal action as provided in § 2.2-4364, prior to receipt of the public bodys decision on the claim, unless the public body fails to rende r such decision within the time specified in the contract or, if no time is specified, then within the time provided by subsection C. A failure of the public body to render a final decision within the time provided in subsection C shall be deemed a final decision denying the claim by the public body. E. The decisio n of the public body shall be final and conclusive unless the contractor appeals within six months of the date of the final decision on the claim by the public body by invoking administrative procedures meeting the standards of § 2.2-4365, if availabl e, or in the alternative by instituting legal action as provided in § 2.2-4364.

For annual survey of Virginia law article, Local Government Law, see 47 U. Rich. L. Rev. 257 (2012). CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former § 11-35 et seq. Time and form of notice dependent on circumstances.  This section does not specifically require that the notice of intent be separate and distinct from the claim itself in time or in form. The statute acknowledges t hat not all claims will arise under the same circumstances and, thus, the timing and form of an alleged notice of intent pursuant to this section requires an examination of the circumstances of each case. Dr. William E.S. Flory Small Bus. Dev. Ctr., Inc. v. Commonwealth, 261 Va. 230, 541 S.E.2d 915, 2001 Va. LEXIS 39 (2001). Failure to provide notice.  Because the Virginia Public Procurement Act applied, the contractor was required to comply with its procedures for filing a contractual claim and its failure to d o so limited its recovery under § 2.24309. Carnell Constr. Corp. v. Danville Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., No. 4:10CV00007, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8259 (W.D. Va. Jan. 27, 2011). Extension of time to sue under tolling statute.  There is no conflict between this section and subdivision E 1 of § 8.01-229, because this section does not address the tolling of actions, which is the subject of subdivision E 1 of § 8.01-229. The time limit for filing suit established by this section thus does not preclude the extension of such limit due to application of the statutory tolling provision. Welding, Inc. v. Bland County Serv. Auth., 261 Va. 218, 541 S.E.2d 909, 2001 Va. LEXIS 36 (2001). Provisions of § 15.2-1246 and the Procurement Act, subsection E of §§ 2.2-4363 and 2.2-4364, do not conflict.  Circuit court did not err in dismissing a contractors complaint, which challenged a countys disallowance of a monetary claim, for failure to fulfill the r equirements of § 15.2-1246 because when the countys board of supervisors denied the contractors claim and the clerk of the governing body served the contractor with a written notice of the disallowance, the contractor had 30 days to comply wit h the requirements of § 15.2-1246 by serving written notice of its appeal on the clerk and executing a bond to the county with sufficient surety; because the contractors claim arose out of a construction contract subject to the Procurement Act, it then had to file its complaint in the circuit court within six months of the date of the final decision of the public body in accordance with the Act, subsection E of §§ 2.2-4363 and 2.2-4364. Viking Enter. v. County of Chesterfield, 277 Va. 104, 670 S.E.2d 741, 2009 Va. LEXIS 4 (2009). Because the procedural requirements set forth in the Public Procurement Act, subsection E of §§ 2.2-4363 and 2.2-4364 do not conflict with the notice and bo nd requirements of § 15.2-1246, when appealing from a countys disallowance of a claim arising out of a contract covered by the Procurement Act, the claimant must serve written notice of its appeal on the clerk of the countys governing body and execute a bond to the county, both within 30 days from the date of either the decision or service of written notice of the denial, in accordance with § 15.2-1246; the claimant must then institute legal action in the appropriate circuit court within s ix months of the date of the decision denying the claim, in accordance with the Procurement Act, subsection E of §§ 2.2-4363 and 2.2-4364. Viking Enter. v. County of Chesterfield, 277 Va. 104, 670 S.E.2d 741, 2009 Va. LEXIS 4 (2009). Procedural compliance required.  In a case arising from plaintiffs cost over-runs on a contract for a public housing project, because the Virginia Public Procurement Act did apply, plaintiff was required to comply with its procedures for filing a contractual claim. Carnell Constr. Corp. v. Danville Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., No. 4:10CV00007, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6890 (W.D. Va. Jan. 25, 2011), amended, No. 4:10CV00007, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 8259 (W.D. Va. Jan. 27, 2011). Contractor was not entitled to recover fees from a county health center commission for developing an independent living facility because it failed to file a claim to the commission within 60 days after final payment as required by subdivision C 1 of § 2.2-4363. A letter to the commission satisfied the requirement of giving notice of intent to file a claim, but it was not itself a claim; a later letter offering to mediate the dispute was not a claim, but an offer to settle. Jean Moreau &amp; Assocs. v. Health Ctr. Comm'n, 283 Va. 128, 720 S.E.2d 105, 2012 Va. LEXIS 5 (2012). The submission of invoices did not qualify as compliance with the requirement in subsect ion A that a notice of intention to file a claim be filed with the commonwealth within a specified time. Dr. William E.S. Flory Small Bus. Dev. Ctr., Inc. v. Commonwealth, 261 Va. 230, 541 S.E.2d 915, 2001 Va. LEXIS 39 (2001). Trial court review of publ ic agency decision.  Appellate court upheld trial courts determination on issues of whether a joint venturer, which had contracted with a waste water treatment facility owner to c onstruct such a facility, had filed its claims in a timely manner, whether it had waived certain claims, submitted time impact analyses for certain claims, and timely submitted a notice of claim for other claims pursuant to the venturers appeal under § 2.2-4363; pursuant to the applicable review standard under § 8.01-680, the trial courts determinations were not plainly wrong in all but one instance, as there was evidentiary support in the record. Upper Occoquan Sewage Auth. v. Blake Const r. Co., 266 Va. 582, 587 S.E.2d 721, 2003 Va. LEXIS 110 (2003).

A bidder or offeror, actual or prospective, who is refused permission or disqualified from participation in bidding or competitive negotiation, or who is determined not to be a responsible bidder or offeror for a particular contract, may bring an action in the appr opriate circuit court challenging that decision, which shall be reversed only if the petitioner establishes that the decision was not (i) an honest exercise of discretion, but rather was arbitrary or capricious; (ii) in accordance with the Constitution o f Virginia, applicable state law or regulation, or the terms or conditions of the Invitation to Bid; or (iii) in the case of denial of prequalification, based upon the criteria for denial of prequalification set forth in subsection B of § 2.2-4317. In the event the apparent low bidder, having been previously determined by the public body to be not responsible in accordance with § 2.2-4301, is found by the court to be a responsible bidder, the court may direct the public body to award the contract to such bidder in accordance with the requirements of this section and the Invitation to Bid. B. A bidder de nied withdrawal of a bid under § 2.2-4358 may bring an action in the appropriate circuit court challenging that decision, which shall be reversed only if the bidder establishes that the decision of the public body was not (i) an honest exercise of dis cretion, but rather was arbitrary or capricious or (ii) in accordance with the Constitution of Virginia, applicable state law or regulation, or the terms or conditions of the Invitation to Bid. C. A bidder, o fferor or contractor, or a potential bidder or offeror on a contract negotiated on a sole source or emergency basis in the manner provided in § 2.2-4303, whose protest of an award or decision to award under § 2.2-4360 is denied, may bring an action in the appropriate circuit court challenging a proposed award or the award of a contract, which shall be reversed only if the petitioner establishes that the proposed award or the award is not (i) an honest exercise of discretion, but rather is arbitrar y or capricious or (ii) in accordance with the Constitution of Virginia, applicable state law or regulation, or the terms and conditions of the Invitation to Bid or Request for Proposal. D. If injuncti ve relief is granted, the court, upon request of the public body, shall require the posting of reasonable security to protect the public body. E. A contracto r may bring an action involving a contract dispute with a public body in the appropriate circuit court. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Comptroller shall not be named as a defendant in any action brought pursuant to this chapter or § 3 3.2-1103, except for disputes involving contracts of the Office of the Comptroller or the Department of Accounts. F. A bidder, o fferor or contractor need not utilize administrative procedures meeting the standards of § 2.2-4365, if available, but if those procedures are invoked by the bidder, offeror or contractor, the procedures shall be exhausted prior to instituting legal a ction concerning the same procurement transaction unless the public body agrees otherwise. G. Nothing her ein shall be construed to prevent a public body from instituting legal action against a contractor.

Some of the cases below were decided under former § 11-35 et seq. Appellate jurisdiction for action protesting decision to award contract.  For an action protesting the decision to award a contract brought under this section and not under the administrative appeals procedure authorized by § 11-71 ( now § 2.2-4365), appellate jurisdiction lies with the Supreme Court and not the Court of Appeals. Allstar Towing, Inc. v. City of Alexandria, 231 Va. 421, 344 S.E.2d 903, 1986 Va. LEXIS 208 (1986). Statute overrides contract language.  This section overrides language in a contract in which a contractor agrees to submit to the administrative review procedures created by a public entity; the statu tory language is controlling and the contractor can choose to proceed directly in court without utilizing the public bodys administrative review procedures. W.M. Schlosser Co. v. Fairfax County Redevelopment &amp; Housing Auth., 975 F.2d 1075, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 22401 (4th Cir. 1992). When special limitation is part of statute creating substantive right as it is in this s ection, namely appealing the written decision of the public body within ten days, the limitation is not merely a procedural requirement, but a part of the newly created substantive cause of action. Special limitation is a condition precedent to maintaini ng the claim, and failure to comply with it bars the claim. Sabre Constr. Corp. v. County of Fairfax, 256 Va. 68, 501 S.E.2d 144, 1998 Va. LEXIS 82 (1998). Subsection A is limited to challenges of public body decisions which disqualified  a bidder or offeror from participating in the process in any manner. It applies to decisions which exclude the bidder from the process, not to decisions which exclude a particular bid. Sabre Constr. Corp. v. County of Fairfax, 256 Va. 68, 501 S.E.2d 144, 1998 Va. LEXIS 82 (1998). Subsection A does not provide bidder with remedy independent of the one created by subse ction C and § 11-66 (now § 2.2-4360) to challenge a public bodys finding that a bid was nonresponsive. Sabre Constr. Corp. v. County of Fairfax, 256 Va. 68, 501 S.E.2d 144, 1998 Va. LEXIS 82 (1998). Action by contractors.  While contract suits against the Commonwealth were permitted to a limited extent, a direct contractual relationship was contemplated; thus, the trial court did no t err in denying the suretys motions for judgment against the state transportation department, which the surety filed in an attempt to collect on work it performed after it took over work for the original contracting party after that party defaulted on the underlying construction projects, as the surety did not have a direct contractual relationship with the state transportation department and the surety could not show any Virginia law which waived the Commonwealths sovereign immunity regarding the suretys equitable subrogation claim.

Provisions of § 15.2-1246 and the Procurement Act, subsection E of §§ 2.2-4363 and 2.2-4364, do not conflict.  Circuit court did not err in dismissing a contractors complaint, which challenged a countys disallowance of a monetary claim, for failure to fulfill the r equirements of § 15.2-1246 because when the countys board of supervisors denied the contractors claim and the clerk of the governing body served the contractor with a written notice of the disallowance, the contractor had 30 days to comply wit h the requirements of § 15.2-1246 by serving written notice of its appeal on the clerk and executing a bond to the county with sufficient surety; because the contractors claim arose out of a construction contract subject to the Procurement Act, it then had to file its complaint in the circuit court within six months of the date of the final decision of the public body in accordance with the Act, subsection E of §§ 2.2-4363 and 2.2-4364. Viking Enter. v. County of Chesterfield, 277 Va. 104, 670 S.E.2d 741, 2009 Va. LEXIS 4 (2009). Because the procedural requirements set forth in the Public Procurement Act, subsection E of §§ 2.2-4363 and 2.2-4364 do not conflict with the notice and bo nd requirements of § 15.2-1246, when appealing from a countys disallowance of a claim arising out of a contract covered by the Procurement Act, the claimant must serve written notice of its appeal on the clerk of the countys governing body and execute a bond to the county, both within 30 days from the date of either the decision or service of written notice of the denial, in accordance with § 15.2-1246; the claimant must then institute legal action in the appropriate circuit court within s ix months of the date of the decision denying the claim, in accordance with the Procurement Act, subsection E of §§ 2.2-4363 and 2.2-4364.

The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. This section furnishes immunity to the Virginia fiduciary who invests according to the p rovisions of the statute, and the reason for departing therefrom should be very urgent, although the statute is purely permissive. Powers v. Powers, 174 Va. 164, 3 S.E.2d 162, 1939 Va. LEXIS 150 (1939); Buckle v. Marshall, 176 Va. 139, 10 S.E.2d 506, 194 0 Va. LEXIS 240 (1940). Under this section, trustees may invest in first lien mortgages not to exceed eighty percent of the fair market value of real estate securing them. But this is no t mandatory. All that the statute means to say is that the trustee shall be relieved from liability if he does make such an investment. Koteen v. Bickers, 163 Va. 676, 177 S.E. 904, 1934 Va. LEXIS 208 (1934). May in vest in investments not enumerated in this section.  When a fiduciary invests in the statutory subjects specified in this section, he is relieved from liability, but it is not imperative that he select one of the in vestments there designated. He may make some other investment and if he exercises the proper care and caution and a loss occurs he is not liable. Powers v. Powers, 174 Va. 164, 3 S.E.2d 162, 1939 Va. LEXIS 150 (1939). Where a trustee makes loans or takes security not within the class of securities described in this section, the personal liability must be determined from pertine nt general principles and not from the statutory rule which if complied with, furnishes immunity to fiduciaries who invest according to its provisions. Parsons v. Wysor, 180 Va. 84, 21 S.E.2d 753, 1942 Va. LEXIS 148 (1942). Waiver of prudent man rule.  Where a will, which created a testamentary marital trust, provided that the trustee was to have full discretionary powers of management without being restricted t o those investments authorized by this section and § 26-40.1 for the investment of trust funds, and provided that investment was authorized with respect to any type of real or personal property, regardless of diversification or state laws, and with re spect to common stocks, unimproved real estate, nonproductive items, common trust funds and investment company shares, the testator had waived the prudent man rule otherwise applicable in the investment of trust assets.

The case below was decided under former Title 2.1 or prior provisions. The effect of this section prior to the 1972 amendment was to remove the six percent int erest ceiling on bonds issued by governmental entities until 1972. Miller v. Ayres, 211 Va. 69, 175 S.E.2d 253, 1970 Va. LEXIS 213 (1970). Issuance of bonds pursuant to election must be in conformity with term s and conditions of submission to voters.  Bonds approved by the voters of Prince William County and bonds approved by the voters of the city of Virginia Beach at a time when the Public Finance Act (see no w § 15.2-2600 et seq.) provided a maximum interest rate of six percent cannot subsequently be issued at an interest rate of seven percent, although the General Assembly determined that a fiscal emergency existed and enacted a law authorizing counties and cities to issue bonds at higher interest rates. The rate of interest to be paid on the bonds was part of the submission to the voters and the issuance of bonds pursuant to an election must be in conformity with the terms and conditions of the submission. The terms of a bond cannot be changed so as to materially increase the burden on the voter after a vote that is constitutionally required. It was beyond the power of the General Assembly to authorize a higher interest rate on the bonds. Mill er v. Ayres, 211 Va. 69, 175 S.E.2d 253, 1970 Va. LEXIS 213 (1970). After the approval by the voters of a bond issue in a constitutionally required election, the law which limited the interest to be paid on the bonds cannot be abr ogated to remove such limit and thus increase the burden on the taxpayer beyond the maximum he approved.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Mandated mental health s ervices for children.  Section 63.2-905 does not mandate that mental health services be provided; it merely defines the term foster care services. The Comprehensive Services Act (CSA) m andates the provision of such foster care services by the state and locality to prevent foster care placements when the child receiving the services is abused and neglected as defined in § 63.2-100, or is in need of services as defined in § 16.1-22 8. Statutory and constitutional provisions require mandated services pursuant to CSA to be provided to eligible children without their parents having to relinquish custody to local service agencies. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Willia m H. Fralin, Jr., Member, House of Delegates, 05-095 (12/6/06). Purchase of personal services.  Purchase of personal services under the Childrens Services Act may be exempt from certain competitive process requirements under the Virginia Public Procureme nt Act when personal services are purchased for individual recipients.

There is es tablished a state pool of funds to be allocated to community policy and management teams in accordance with the appropriation act and appropriate state regulations. These funds, as made available by the General Assembly, shall be expended for public or p rivate nonresidential or residential services for troubled youths and families. However, funds for private special education services shall only be expended on private educational programs that are licensed by the Board of Education or an equivalent out- of-state licensing agency. Effective July 1, 2022, funds for private special education services shall only be expended on private educational programs that the Office of Childrens Services certifies as having reported their tuition rates on a standar d reporting template developed by the Office. The Office of Childrens Services shall consult with private special education services providers in developing the standard reporting template for tuition rates.The purposes of this system of funding are to: 1. Place authority for making program and funding decisions at the community level; 2. Consolidate categorical agency funding and institute community responsibility for the provision of services; 3. Provide greater flexibility in the use of funds to purchase services based on the strengths and needs of children, youths, and families; and 4. Reduce disparity in accessing services and to reduce inadvertent fiscal incentives for serving children and youth according to differing required local match rates for funding streams. B. The state p ool shall consist of funds that serve the target populations identified in subdivisions 1 through 6 in the purchase of residential and nonresidential services for children and youth. References to funding sources and current placement authority for the t argeted populations of children and youth are for the purpose of accounting for the funds in the pool. It is not intended that children and youth be categorized by individual funding streams in order to access services. The target population shall be the following: 1. Child ren and youth placed for purposes of special education in approved private school educational programs, previously funded by the Department of Education through private tuition assistance; 2. Children and youth with disabilities placed by local social services agencies or the Department of Juvenile Justice in private residential facilities or across jurisdictional lines in private, special education day schools, if the individualized education program indicates such school is the appropriate placement while living in foster homes or child-caring facilities, previously funded by the Department of Education through the Inter agency Assistance Fund for Noneducational Placements of Handicapped Children; 3. Children and youth for whom foster care services, as defined by § 63.2-905, are being provided; 4. Children and youth placed by a juvenile and domestic relations district court, in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-286, in a private or locally operated public facility or n onresidential program, or in a community or facility-based treatment program in accordance with the provisions of subsections B or C of § 16.1-284.1; 5. Children and youth committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice and placed by it in a private home or in a public or private facility in accordance with § 66-14; and 6. Children and youth previously placed pursuant to subdivision 1 in approved private school educational programs for at least six months who will receive transitional services in a publi c school setting. State pool funds shall be allocated for no longer than 12 months for transitional services. Local agencies may contract with a private school education program provider to provide transition services in the public school. C. The General Assembly and the governing body of each county and city shall annually appropriate such sums of money as shall be sufficient to (i) provide special education services and foster care services for children and youth identified in subdivisions B 1, 2, 3, and 6 and (ii) meet relevant federal mandates for the provision of these services. The community policy and management team shall anticipate to the best of its ability the number of children and youth for whom such services will be required and reserve f unds from its state pool allocation to meet these needs. Nothing in this section prohibits local governments from requiring parental or legal financial contributions, where not specifically prohibited by federal or state law or regulation, utilizing a st andard sliding fee scale based upon ability to pay, as provided in the appropriation act. D. When a comm unity services board established pursuant to § 37.2-501, local school division, local social service agency, court service unit, or the Department of Juvenile Justice has referred a child and family to a family assessment and planning team and that te am has recommended the proper level of treatment and services needed by that child and family and has determined the childs eligibility for funding for services through the state pool of funds, then the community services board, the local school divi sion, local social services agency, court service unit, or Department of Juvenile Justice has met its fiscal responsibility for that child for the services funded through the pool. However, the community services board, the local school division, local s ocial services agency, court service unit, or Department of Juvenile Justice shall continue to be responsible for providing services identified in individual family service plans that are within the agencys scope of responsibility and that are funded separately from the state pool.Further, in any instance that an individual 18 through 21 years of age, inclusive, who is eligible for funding from the state pool and is properly defined as a school-aged child with disabilities pursuant to § 22.1-213 is placed by a local social services agency that has custody across jurisdictional lines in a group home in the Commonwealth and the individuals individualized education program (IEP), as prepared by the placing jurisdiction, indicates that a private day school placement is the appropriate educational program for such individual, the financial and legal responsibility for the individuals special education services and IEP shall remain, in compliance with the provisions of federal law, Article 2 (§ 22.1-213) of Chapter 13 of Title 22.1, and Board of Education regulations, the responsibility of the placing jurisdiction until the individual reaches the age of 21, inclusive, or is no longer eligible for special education services. The financial and legal responsibility for such special education services shall remain with the placing jurisdiction, unless the placing jurisdiction has transitioned all appropriate services with the individual. E. In any matt er properly before a court for which state pool funds are to be accessed, the court shall, prior to final disposition, and pursuant to §§ 2.2-5209 and 2.2-5212, refer the matter to the community policy and management team for assessment by a local family assessment and planning team authorized by policies of the community policy and management team for assessment to determine the recommended level of treatment and services needed by the child and family. The family assessment and planning team mak ing the assessment shall make a report of the case or forward a copy of the individual family services plan to the court within 30 days of the courts written referral to the community policy and management team. The court shall consider the recommend ations of the family assessment and planning team and the community policy and management team. If, prior to a final disposition by the court, the court is requested to consider a level of service not identified or recommended in the report submitted by the family assessment and planning team, the court shall request the community policy and management team to submit a second report characterizing comparable levels of service to the requested level of service. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subs ection, the court may make any disposition as is authorized or required by law. Services ordered pursuant to a disposition rendered by the court pursuant to this section shall qualify for funding as appropriated under this section. F. As used in this section, transitional services includes services delivered in a public school setting directly to students with significant disabilities or intensive support needs to facilitate their transition back to public school after having been served in a private special education day school or residential facility for at least six months. Transitional services includes one-on-one aides, speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral health services, counseling, applied behavior analysis, specially designed instruction delivered directly to the student, or other services needed to facilitate such transition that are delivered directly to the student in their public school over the 12-month period as identified in the childs individual ized education program.

Article I. Purpose and Findings. A. The p urpose of this compact shall be to create a regional authority to oversee the conduct of the 2012 Olympic Games, coordinated and managed by the local Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG), and to assure that the regions guarantees and com mitments accepted in conjunction with hosting the Olympic Games are fulfilled. B. The General Assembly finds that: 1. For some time, the State of Maryland (including the City of Baltimore), the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Virginia, through the nonprofit organization known as the Washington/Baltimore Regional 2012 Coalition (WBRC 2012), have been active ly engaged in national competition to win the U.S. Candidate City designation and, subsequently, the Host City designation and the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games. 2. Hosting the Olympic Games will provide several major, lasting, and unique benefits for all of the citizens of the Chesapeake region, including: a. Direct, positive economic impact on our regional economy; b. An opportunity to showcase our region to the world; c. A catalyst for regional action; and d. A renewed sense of pride along with a tangible legacy (e.g. new and improved venues and enhanced transportation infrastructure). 3. Independent economic studies show that preparing for and hosting the Olympic Games will have a positive economic impact on the region, including: a. Direct and indirect spending in excess of $5,000,000,000; b. The creation of approximately 70,000 jobs; c. Increased tax revenues resulting from Olympic-related economic activity in excess of $130,000,000, without raising or creating any new taxes; and d. A lasting improvement in the regions competitive position within the travel/tourism industry, as well as the regions ability to attract new businesses. 4. The citizens of the region have responded positively to WBRC 2012s efforts and solidly embraced the cause to host the Olympic Games, expressed in part by the endorsement of sc ores of local business, civic, governmental, academic, and amateur sports organizations, and by survey results that show (i) eighty-two percent of the regions residents support the effort to bring the 2012 Olympic Games to this area and (ii) eighty-s ix percent of area residents believe that the Olympic Games will bring substantial economic benefits to our region. 5. Through the submission of the regions official bid proposal to the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) on December 15, 2000, WBRC 2012 reached a milestone in the process of capturing the Olympic Games by providing a 631-page logistical, operational, and financial blueprint for hosting the 2012 Games. 6. The bid proposal highlights the great venues and vistas found in our region and is developed around key principles, including (i) building less, not more and (ii) utilizing mass t ransit, and (iii) protecting the environment. 7. In addition to the regions bid proposal, the USOC and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) require certain government guarantees and commitments in conjunction with hosti ng the 2012 Olympic Games, should our region win the U.S. Candidate City designation. 8. Our unique regional approach to winning the right to host the Olympic Games creates the added complication of determining which entities will provide the necessary guarantees. 9. It is incumbent upon WBRC 2012 and government leaders to move forward together now to craft the solution that best lives regionalism and maximizes the regions chances of winning the 2012 Olympic Games, and reaping the many benefits that come with this honor. 10. Given that all four jurisdictions, Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Baltimore, will host a significant number of events and reap substantial benefits, the most e ffective solution for all four jurisdictions is to enter into a single agreement that gives the USOC (and subsequently the IOC) a single focal point and a united front that reflects the regional nature of our bid. Article II. Definitions.
