CASE NOTES Section is mandatory.  The enactment of this statute wholly abrogated the common law in force in this State on the subject of marriages; and no marriage or attempted marriage, if it too k place in this State, can be held valid here unless shown to have been under a license, and solemnized according to the statutes. The language of this statute is mandatory, and not simply directory. Offield v. Davis, 100 Va. 250, 40 S.E. 910, 1902 Va. L EXIS 23 (1902) (see also Colston v. Quander, 1 Va. Dec. 283 (1877); Eldred v. Eldred, 97 Va. 606, 34 S.E. 477 (1899)). Definition of solemnization.  Term solemnization does not appear in subsection C of § 32.1-267, and the term ceremony does not appear in § 20-13; the dissimilar use of th ese terms implies that the General Assembly has declined to adopt a specific definition for solemnization, leaving the details to the discretion of the officiant and the celebrants. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2 017). Void marriage not revived by corrective measures.  Denial of a wifes petition to annul a bigamous marriage was error because, contrary to the trial courts finding, a void bigamous marriage could not have b een revived by corrective measures, and the wifes action in obtaining a falsified marriage certificate was not an option because, under § 20-13, marriages in Virginia had to be solemnized; a marriage license presupposed a marriage ceremony solemnizing the union, and whatever formalities the ceremony required, at the very least it required the attendance of both the bride and groom. Section 20-31 had no application in cases where the putative marriage was void ab initio. Davidson v. Davids on, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. July 14, 2009). Marriage ceremony before license.  Trial court properly ruled that a husband and wife never married because their marriage ceremony was not under a license since the husband and wife did not have a license when they held their marriage ceremony, and when they did obtain a license they did not perform any kind of solemnization; mailing a license via express mail for a signature when the parties were not even present did not constitute solemniza tion. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Statute does not expressly state that the license must precede solemnization, but that is its most reasonable reading; statute indicates that, to contract a lawfu l marriage in Virginia, the parties must obtain a license and, afterward, solemnize their union under that license. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. A pp. LEXIS 90 (2016). Performance of ceremony without license.  By attaching a criminal penalty to the performance of a ceremony of marriage without a license, the General Assembly clarified its intention that a lawful marriag e be contracted by solemnization after a license has been obtained; the statutes make plain the General Assemblys intent that a license must precede the solemnization ceremony. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXI S 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Marriage valid.  Although the court of appeals correctly reversed the ruling that the parties marriage was void ab initio, it incorrectly concluded the marriage was voidable u pon the challenge of either party because the husband failed to rebut the strong presumption favoring the validity of the marriage; the solemnization agreement did not violate any existing Virginia statute or case law and satisfied the objects of the sta tute to insure publicity and preserve evidence of marriage. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). Rabbis alleged violation of § 20-28 did not invalidate a marriage because even if the rabbi violated § 20-28, his violation of § 20-28 did not affect the only two requirements to create a valid marriage under § 20-13, a license and solemnization. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). Marriage was not voidable or void ab initio because the solemnization agreement, a ceremony followed by the issuance of a marriage license, the joint presentation of the marriage register to a rabbi, and the rabbis execution of the marriage certificate, did not violate any Virginia statute or case law; therefore, the circuit court had authority to distribute marital assets consistent with the marital agreemen t and to continue its adjudication of the divorce proceeding. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). Solemnization.  For the purposes of solemnization, a ceremony merely serves to authenticate the parties intent to marry. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 20 17 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). Nothing in the governing statutes or case law renders a marriage void ab initio or voidable merely because the officiant and celebrants agree in advance to solemn ize the marriage. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). Solemnization occurred because a husband and a wife obtained the marriage register and forwarded it to the rabbi pursuant to their agreement, which they made with the rabbi in person at the earlier ceremony, and the rabbi thereafter executed the marriage certificate in accordance with their agreement; by doing so, the husband and the wife repeated and reaffirmed to the rabbi their joint, unqualified intent to mar ry, and nothing in any statute or case law forbade them from verifying their intent. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). As long as consent to be married is presently expressed to and, at the same time, received by the officiant when the celebrants possess a marriage license, a vali d marriage is created. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Section is mandatory.  In a case in which a husband and wife were married in a religious ceremony and sought to have their marriage confirmed by a court pursuant to §§ 20-31 and 2 0-90, they had not obtained a marriage license, as required by § 20-13. While the parties might remain married according to their religion, their marriage ceremony conferred no legal rights between them under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the court could not issue a marriage license retroactive to the date of the religious ceremony. In re Ejigu, 79 Va. Cir. 349, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 127 (Fairfax County Sept. 30, 2009). Consideration of forei gn common-law marriages.  A husbands motion to dismiss a wifes divorce action was denied because the Texas statute of limitations for an action to prove a common-law marriage that was in effect at the time the parties allegedly entered into a common law marriage was not applicable pursuant to Virginias choice of law rules, and Virginia did not have a statute of limitations for such an action, as Virginia required that marriage s had to be solemnized by a license in order to be valid. Reynolds v. Reynolds, 60 Va. Cir. 414, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 412 (Rockingham County Dec. 13, 2002), dismissed, 62 Va. Cir. 114, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 315 (Rockingham County June 4, 2003). Ceremony must take place within Commonwealth.  Ceremony contemplated by Virginias statutes must take place within the Commonwealth, and a ceremony that takes place outside the Commonwealth even if performe d by a Virginia-licensed celebrant has no legal effect in terms of creating a valid Virginia marriage; the phrase in this Commonwealth in the statute supports the conclusion that the solemnization requirement must occur within the geographic conf ines of the Commonwealth. Porter v. Porter, 97 Va. Cir. 81, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 304 (Fairfax County Oct. 11, 2017). Marriage null and void ab initio.  Parties marriage was null and void ab initio because it did not meet the statutory requirements of licensure followed by solemnization, as the marriage licens e was obtained after the marriage ceremony and was subsequently signed by the officiant without either party being present. Moreover, the curative statute, § 20-31, and estoppel, as well as other equitable remedies, were not applicable because the all eged marriage was void ab initio. MacDougall v. Levick, 87 Va. Cir. 160, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 87 (Fairfax County Oct. 10, 2013), aff'd, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), aff'd, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. L EXIS 90 (2016). Marriage of a husband and wife was void ab initio because Virginia case law and statutes clearly dictated that in order to form a valid marriage in Virginia, the parties had to have a Virginia license and a Virginia ceremony, but the husband and wife had the license and lacked the ceremony...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_20-14"><akn:num>§ 20-14</akn:num><akn:heading>By whom license to be issued</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Every license for a marriage shall be issued by the clerk or deputy clerk of a circuit court of any county or city.

License and solemnization.  Statute was not violated because the marriage license was obtained 15 days prior to the culmination of the solemnization agreement, the day on which a rabbi recei ved the marriage register and executed the marriage certificate as promised. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL License mandatory.  A court does not have the statutory or equitable authority to affirm marriages that were not performed under a license of marriage. See opinion of Attorney Genera l to The Honorable John T. Frey, Fairfax Circuit Court Clerk, 09-072, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 50 (12/10/09). A court may not direct a circuit court clerk to issue marriage licenses retrospectively when marriages were not performed under a license of marriage. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable John T. Frey, Fairfax Circuit Court Clerk, 09-072, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 50 (12/10/09). § 20-14.1. Duration of license; issuance of additional licenses. Text Every marriage license issued under § 20-14 shall constitute authority for a period of only sixty days from the date of issuance for the solemnization of a marriage of the licensees. Whenever such sixty-day period shall have elapsed without the solemnization of a marriage of the licensees, the license shall expire. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent licensees from applying for or receiving an additional license, either before or after expiration of an y license, but no new license shall be issued except in compliance with all provisions of law applicable to the issuance of a license in the first instance. History History. 1958, c. 8; 1968, c. 318. Annotations CASE NOTES License and solemnization.  Statute plainly contemplates a specific order: the parties must obtain a license and, within the sixty days following, solemnize their union; if a ceremony does n ot occur within that time, the license expires, and at that point, if the parties still wish to be married, they must apply for a new license. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Statute was not violated because the marriage license issued to a husband and a wife was obtained 15 days prior to the culmination of their solemnization agreemen t, the day on which the rabbi received the marriage register and executed the marriage certificate as promised; the statute did not address, much less prohibit, the unique sequence agreed to by the husband, the wife, and the rabbi. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017).

CASE NOTES The interest of the Commonwealth is not only in marriage as an institution, but in the c ontract between the parties who marry, and in the proper memorializing of the entry into, and execution of, such a contract.

The State has no official interest in the place where a marriage occurs, or in the ceremony or ritual which surrounds the act. Cramer v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 561 , 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va. LEXIS 178, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 875, 95 S. Ct. 137, 42 L. Ed. 2d 114, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2818 (1974).

Neither the word ordination nor communion is used in this section in an ecclesiastical sense, for the legislature was not concerned with the religious aspect of the marriage ceremony. Cramer v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va. LEXIS 178, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 875, 95 S. Ct. 137, 42 L. Ed. 2d 114, 1974 U. S. LEXIS 2818 (1974). This section amounts to a blanket qualification of all ministers selected or elected by religious organizations and societies. Cramer v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va. LEXIS 178, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 875, 95 S. Ct. 137, 42 L. Ed. 2d 114, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2818 (1974). Who is minister referred to in section .  The minister referred to in this section is the head of a religious congregation, society or order. He is set apart as the leader. He is the person elected or sel ected in accordance with the ritual, bylaws or discipline of the order. Cramer v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va.

In treating ministers as a class, the General Assembly obviously meant to qualify those individuals who, in accordance with the rules, regulations and discipline of their church, religious sect or organization, had been selected or elected as ministers. Cramer v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va. LEXIS 178, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 875, 95 S. Ct. 137, 42 L. Ed. 2d 114, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2818 (1974). The General Assembly never intended to qualify, for licensing to marry, a minister whose title and status could be casually and cavalierly acquired. Cramer v. Com monwealth, 214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va. LEXIS 178, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 875, 95 S. Ct. 137, 42 L. Ed. 2d 114, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2818 (1974). Ministers qualifying for appointment are members of narrow class.  Ministers qualifying for appointment under this section, like the ministers exempt under the Selective Service Act, are members of a narrow class intended for the leaders of the various religious faiths and not for the members generally. Cramer v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va. LEXIS 178, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 875, 95 S. Ct. 137, 42 L. Ed. 2d 114, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2818 (1974). Clerk of Quaker meeting within definition of minister.  The clerk of a Quaker meeting is its designated administrative official, meets with the members of the meeting for weekly worship, and performs such ministerial d uties in meeting for worship and meeting for business as are consistent with Quaker discipline, and he, therefore, meets the definition of a minister who has furnished proof of his ordination and of his being in regular communion with the rel igious society of which he is a reputed member within the meaning of this section. In re Ginsburg, 236 Va. 165, 372 S.E.2d 387, 5 Va. Law Rep. 598, 1988 Va. LEXIS 104 (1988). A church which consists of all ministers, and in which all new converts can become insta nt ministers, in fact has no minister within the contemplation of this section. Cramer v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va. LEXIS 178, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 875, 95 S. Ct. 137, 42 L. Ed. 2d 114, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2818 (1974). Selection or election of ministers must be a considered, deliberate and responsible act. It must be an authoritative act. Cramer v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 561, 202 S.E.2d 911, 1974 Va.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Authorization to perform marriages.  Members could not have been approved to perform marriages under § 20-23 because they were of the Sikh faith, there were no ministers or leaders in Sikhism, and this type of religious structure could not have had individuals approved under § 20-23; however, § 20-26 applied. In re Dhanoa, 86 Va. Cir. 373, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Fairfax County Mar. 29, 2013). Marriage void ab initio.  Marriage of a husband and wife was void ab initio because Virginia case law and statutes clearly dictated that in order to form a valid marriage in Virginia, the parties had to have a Virginia license and a Virginia ceremony, but the husband and wife had the license and lacked the ceremony; given that both a license and a solemnization were required, and the solemnization had to taken place in the Commonwealth, i t was not a marriage that in all other respects was lawful. Porter v. Porter, 97 Va. Cir. 81, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 304 (Fairfax County Oct. 11, 2017). Ceremony must take place within Commonwealth.  Ceremony contemplated by Virginias statutes must take place within the Commonwealth, and a ceremony that takes place outside the Commonwealth even if performe d by a Virginia-licensed celebrant has no legal effect in terms of creating a valid Virginia marriage; phrase in the Commonwealth is not surplusage but emphasizes the geographical limitations of the statute, and in other words, a Virginia Circuit Court may only authorize a minister to celebrate the rites of matrimony in the Commonwealth. Porter v. Porter, 97 Va. Cir. 81, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 304 (Fairfax County Oct. 11, 2017). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL No investigation required of facially valid ordinatio n or certificate to determine authenticity of religious society or denomination.  A clerk of the circuit court is not required to investigate proof of a facially valid ordination or certificate to determine the authenticity of a given religious society or denomination for the purposes of authorization pursuant to the statute; further, the clerk has discretion to allow individuals issued Credentials of Ministry by a Universal Life Church in California to qualify as ministers. Se e opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas M. Moncure Jr., Clerk, Circuit Court of Stafford County, 01-057 (11/29/01). Authorization to perform marriages.  A minister may be authorized to perform marriages pursuant to this section, upon production of proof before the circuit court of his ordination or licensure, with out personally appearing before the circuit court clerk. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Edward Semonian, Clerk, Circuit Court of the City of Alexandria, 02-066 (9/10/02). Authority to perform the rit es of matrimony.  The authority vested in a minister or other person authorized to perform the rites of matrimony in Virginia does not extend to a celebration of marriage under a V irginia marriage license when the ceremony is conducted outside the territorial boundaries of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Lack of consent of parent does not invalidate marriage of infant.  Although common-law marriages are void in Virginia, under the provision of this section the validity of a marriage is not affected by the want of authority of the person issuing the marriage license, or any defect, omission or imperfection in such license. Accordingly, the marriage of an infant is valid, although the license was issued by the clerk without the authority of the parent or guardian of the infant in writing, as required by § 20-49. Stanley v. Rasnick, 137 Va. 415, 119 S.E. 76 (1923). But see § 20-45.1. Statute in applicable where marriage is void ab initio.  Denial of a wifes petition to annul a bigamous marriage was error because, contrary to the trial courts finding, a void bigamous marriage could not have b een revived by corrective measures, and the wifes action in obtaining a falsified marriage certificate was not an option because, under § 20-13, marriages in Virginia had to be solemnized; a marriage license presupposed a marriage ceremony solemnizing the union, and whatever formalities the ceremony required, at the very least it required the attendance of both the bride and groom. This section had no application in cases where the putative marriage was void ab initio. Davidson v. Davidso n, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. July 14, 2009). Solemnization.  Nothing in the governing statutes or case law renders a marriage void ab initio or voidable merely because the officiant and celebrants agree in advance to solemn ize the marriage. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). Presumption of validity.  Marriage was not voidable or void ab initio because the husband failed to rebut the strong presumption favoring the validity of his marriage; the solemnization ag reement, a ceremony followed by the issuance of a marriage license, the joint presentation of the marriage register to a rabbi, and the rabbis execution of the marriage certificate, did not violate any Virginia statute or case law. Levick v. MacDouga ll, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statute in applicable where marriage is void ab initio.  In a case in which a husband and wife were married in a religious ceremony and sought to have their marriage confirmed by a court pursuant to §§ 20-31 and 2 0-90, they had not obtained a marriage license, as required by § 20-13. While the parties might remain married according to their religion, their marriage ceremony conferred no legal rights between them under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the court could not issue a marriage license retroactive to the date of the religious ceremony. In re Ejigu, 79 Va. Cir. 349, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 127 (Fairfax County Sept. 30, 2009). Parties marriage was null and void ab initio because it did not meet the statutory requirements, under § 20-13, of licensure followed by solemnization, as the marriage license was obtained after the marriage ceremony and was subsequently signed by the officiant without either party being present. Moreover, the curative statute, § 20-31, and estoppel, as well as other equitable remedies, were not applica ble because the alleged marriage was void ab initio. MacDougall v. Levick, 87 Va. Cir. 160, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 87 (Fairfax County Oct. 10, 2013), aff'd, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), aff'd, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 1 82, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Marriage void ab initio.  Marriage of a husband and wife was void ab initio because Virginia case law and statutes clearly dictated that in order to form a valid marriage in Virginia, the parties had to have a Virginia license and a Virginia ceremony, but the husband and wife had the license and lacked the ceremony;. Porter v. Porter, 97 Va. Cir. 81, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 304 (Fairfax County Oct. 11, 2017). Ceremony must take place within Commonwealth.  Ceremony contemplated by Virginias statutes must take place within the Commonwealth, and a ceremony that takes place outside the Commonwealth even if performe d by a Virginia-licensed celebrant has no legal effect in terms of creating a valid Virginia marriage. Porter v. Porter, 97 Va. Cir. 81, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 304 (Fairfax County Oct. 11, 2017). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL License mandatory.  A court may not direct a circuit court clerk to issue marriage licenses retrospectively when marriages were not performed under a license of marriage. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable John T. Frey, Fairfax Circuit Court Clerk, 09-072, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 50 (12/10/09). § 20-31.1. When marriage legitimates children; issue of marriages prohibited by law, etc., legitimate. Text If a person, having had a child, shall afterwards intermarry with the mother or father, such child if recognized by both of them, as their own child, jointly or separat ely, before or after marriage, shall be deemed legitimate. The issue of marriages prohibited by law, deemed null or void or dissolved by a court shall nevertheless be legitimate. History History. 1978, c. 647. Annotations Law Review.

Legitimation by Marriage. III. Legitimacy Though Marriage Null. I.General Consideration. Editors note. The cases cited in the notes below were decided under former §§ 64.1-6 and 64.1-7. For history of legitimation provisions, see Hoover v. Hoover, 131 Va. 522, 105 S.E. 91, 1920 Va. LEXIS 25 (1920), different results reached on reh'g, 131 Va. 522, 109 S.E. 424, 1921 Va. LEXIS 43 (1921). Purpose and constr uction.  Former § 64.1-6 (similar to the first paragraph), former § 64.1-7 (similar to the second paragraph) and § 20-43 are remedial in their nature and should b e liberally construed. When so construed it is apparent that the object and purpose of their enactment was to remove the stain and disabilities of bastardy from all innocent and unoffending children who, for any cause, might be classed as illegit imate. Goodman v. Goodman, 150 Va. 42, 142 S.E. 412, 1928 Va. LEXIS 292 (1928); McClaugherty v. McClaugherty, 180 Va. 51, 21 S.E.2d 761, 1942 Va. LEXIS 145 (1942). Legitimation may be defined to be the investment of an illegitimate child with the right s of one born in wedlock and is but a legal equalization of certain children illegitimately begotten with legitimate children. Bond v. Bond, 16 Va. L. Reg. 411 (1910). II.Legitimation by Marriage. In order for child to be legitimate under former § 64.1-6 (similar to the first parag raph) it was necessary: (1) that the man should have had a child by the woman; (2) that the man and woman should have intermarried after the birth of the child; and (3) that the child should have been recognized by the man before or after the marriage. T hese were facts to be proved as in any other case, and the burden was on the child to prove them. Bennett v. Toler, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 588, 1860 Va. LEXIS 21 (1860); Hoover v. Hoover, 131 Va. 522, 105 S.E. 91, 1920 Va. LEXIS 25 (1920), different results reached on reh'g, 131 Va. 522, 109 S.E. 424, 1921 Va. LEXIS 43 (1921); Harper v. Harper, 159 Va. 210, 165 S.E. 490, 1932 Va. LEXIS 183 (1932). If the marriage of the parents was entered into in accordance with the forms and ceremonies of the law, and the child was recognized by his father, either before or after the marriage, the conditions of former § 64.1-6 were complied with and the child would be deemed legitimate.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS St atute only applies to marriages entered prior to passage.  Statute only applies to marriages entered into prior to the passage of the statute in 1952; the 1952 statute constitutes a legislative recognition that legislatio n was required to validate pre-1952 marriages performed outside the Commonwealth, and no similar legislation addresses post-1952 marriages.

Rev. 663 (1976). CASE NOTES This section is broader in scope than its felony counterpart.  While the felony described in § 18.2-362 applies only to a person who, while already married, marries again, the misdemeanor described in this section is broad er in scope and applies to any person, whether married or not, who enters into a marriage before the dissolution of an earlier marriage of one of the parties. Stuart v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 216, 397 S.E.2d 533, 7 Va. Law Rep. 599, 1990 Va. App. LEXI S 182 (1990). Commonwealth could choose to charge defendant with felony rather than misdemeanor.  Attorney for the Commonwealth could choose to charge the defendant with a felony under § 18.2-362, instead of a misdemeanor under this section; the mere fact t hat the defendant may also have committed a lesser offense does not preclude the Commonwealth from charging a greater offense arising out of the same act or transaction.

Second marriage following voidable but not voided marriage as bigamous and void.  Wifes earlier green card marriage in New Jersey was voidable but had never been voided by a court and, therefore, her subsequent marriage in New York was bigamous and void and she could not maintain an action of spousal support or equitable distribution. Kleinfield v. Veruki, 7 Va. App. 183, 372 S.E.2d 407, 5 Va. Law Rep. 415, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 103 (1988). Bigamous marriage absolutely void.  Denial of a wifes petition to annul a bigamous marriage was error because a bigamous marriage was absolutely void and, contrary to the trial courts findin g, a void bigamous marriage could not have been revived by corrective measures; the wifes action in obtaining a falsified marriage certificate was not an option because, under § 20-13, marriages in Virginia had to be solemnized. A marriage license presupposed a marriage ceremony solemnizing the union, and whatever formalities the ceremony required, at the very least it required the attendance of both the bride and groom. Davidson v. Davidson, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. July 14, 2009). No jurisdiction over appeal from dismissal of cross-bill for annulment.  In a divorce case, an interlocutory decree dismissing appellants cross-bill for annulment was not appealable under § 17.1-405, as the decree did not determ ine the status or validity of the parties marriage, award spousal support, or make an equitable distribution of marital assets, it did not respond to the chief object of the domestic relations dispute and did not determine the principles that were necessary to adjudicate the cause. Lewis v. Lewis, 271 Va. 520, 628 S.E.2d 314, 2006 Va. LEXIS 44 (2006). Sufficient evidence.  Sufficient evidence supported annulment of marriage based on bigamy where the former husband testified that he went to Pakistan and investigated the former wife s marriage, where he learned that she never divorced her prior husband; the former husband also submitted documentation from Pakistan to prove that the former wife was being charged with bigamy and a warrant for her arrest was outstanding, and an exp ert explained Pakistani law and how one obtains a religious and legal divorce in Pakistan; once the former wife learned about the legal process, she filed the necessary paperwork, but did so after she married the former husband. The former husbands e xpert testified that Pakistani divorces were not retroactive, and the trial court found that the testimony of the former husband and his witnesses was more credible than the testimony of the former wife and her witnesses. Naseer v. Moghal, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 14, 2012). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Void marriages.  Virginias laws voiding bigamous marriages and criminalizing bigamy are constitutional; the Fourth Circuits decision in Bostic v. Schaefer does not invalidate §§ 18.2-362, 18.2-363, 20-38.1, 20-40, and 20-45.1, which prohibit bigamy by all persons , regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

CASE NOTES Rule that marriages valid where celebrated are valid everywhere not applicable.  The rule which requires that a marriage valid where celebrated is valid everywhere else has no application to a marriage entered into in another state in contravention of the public policy and statutes of Virginia. Greenhow v. James, 80 Va. 636, 1885 Va. LEXIS 104 (1885). As the law of the domicile controls such marriages.  The law of the domicile will govern in a case where the parties go into another state and get married in order to evade such law, and when they return they will b e subject to all its penalties, as if such marriage had been celebrated within the state whose public law they have set at defiance. Kinney v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 858, 1878 Va. LEXIS 102 (1878). While the forms and ceremonies of marriage are governed by the laws of the place where the marriage is celebrated, the essentials of the contract depend upon and are governed by the laws of the country where the parties are domiciled at the time of the marriage, and in which the matrimonial residence is contemplated. Kinney v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 858, 1878 Va. LEXIS 102 (1878). Indictment.  An indictment under the act against incestuous marriages, which charges that W.T. (the man) did unlawfully, willingly, and incestuously intermarry with N.H. (the woman), is sufficiently certain to charge her, as well as him, without requiring the converse to be charged; for he could not intermarry with her, without her intermarrying with him also.

Bigamous marriage absolutely void.  Denial of a wifes petition to annul a bigamous marriage was error because, in Virginia, a marriage entered into prior to the dissolution of an earlier marriag e of one of the parties was bigamous and was absolutely void; contrary to the trial courts finding, a void bigamous marriage could not have been revived by corrective measures, and the wifes action in obtaining a falsified marriage certificate wa s not an option because, under § 20-13, marriages in Virginia had to be solemnized. A marriage license presupposed a marriage ceremony solemnizing the union, and whatever formalities the ceremony required, at the very least it required the att endance of both the bride and groom. Davidson v. Davidson, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. July 14, 2009). Court cannot decree as to alimony (now support and maintenance) in declaring bigamous marriage void.  In a suit to annul a second marriage, because either consort had a wife or husband then living, it was held that in granting a decree of the nullity of such a mar riage alimony (now support and maintenance) could not be decreed, because the statute declares such a marriage to be absolutely void, and alimony cannot be decreed if there never was a marriage. Brown v. Brown, 24 S.E. 238 (Va. Ct. App. 1896). Plaintiff obtained a decree of a void marriage based on the knowledge that defendant was already married, so the trial court did not err in denying plaintiff an a ward of spousal support where plaintiff had no legal right to support. Shoustari v. Zamani, 39 Va. App. 517, 574 S.E.2d 314, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 769 (2002). But has jurisdiction to enter further decree concerning children.  In declaring a marriage invalid because one party had a spouse then living, the court has jurisdiction to enter a further decree as to the care and custody of the children of the marriage, for such children are legitimated for all purposes by former § 64-7 (now § 20-31.1). Henderson v. Henderson, 187 Va. 121, 46 S.E.2d 10, 1948 Va. LEXIS 205 (1948). Illustrative case of void marriage.  On an appeal from the dismissal of appellants claim for compensation for the death of her alleged husband, the evidence showed that claimant, under the errone ous impression that a former husband was dead, married in West Virginia. Under this section the second marriage was absolutely void, while under the former West Virginia Code, § 4701, such marriage was void only from the time it was so decreed. The fa ct that claimants second marriage was made in good faith, under a reasonable belief that her former consort was dead, might relieve her from a successful prosecution for bigamy, but would not render the void marriage valid. Hence, her claim was prope rly dismissed. Toler v. Oskwood Smokeless Coal Corp., 173 Va. 425, 4 S.E.2d 364, 1939 Va. LEXIS 210 (1939). Wife was afforded due process.  An order declaring her marriage void ab initio was upheld, as: (1) she received both a notice and an opportunity to be heard for the judgment hearing; (2) despite her absence and choice not to attend said hearing, her counsel was present; and (3) said counsel failed to object or rebut the husbands evidence of the wifes prior and still existing marriage to another man. Hence, the wifes attempt to rebut said evidence in her motion for reconsideration was properly rejected. Lwasa v. Lwasa, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 450 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 8, 2005). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Court cannot decree as to support and maintenance in declaring bigamous marriage void.  Since parties alleged marriage was void ab initio as husband was already married, the court did not have the authority to enforce its spousal support order to the alleged wife that it entered before it declared the alleged marriage void ab initio, and by equitable estoppel principles or otherwise, the parties spousal support agreement. Wallace v. Kilgore, 68 Va. Cir. 40, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 54 (Spotsylvan ia County Feb. 24, 2005). Circuit court has no authority to compel payment of spousal support where the parties were never married, even when the support order was entered before the circu it court declared the marriage to be void ab initio.

CASE NOTES A void marriage, unlike a voidable marriage, does not require an action of annulment to render it void. Without obtaining an annulment, a party to a void marriage is free to marry again. Conversely, a party to a voidable marriage must obtain an annulment, or any subsequent marriage is bigamous. Kleinfield v. Veruki, 7 Va. App. 183, 372 S. E.2d 407, 5 Va. Law Rep. 415, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 103 (1988). But second marriage following voidable but not voided marriage is void.  Wifes earlier green card marriage in New Jersey was voidable but had never been voided by a court and, therefore, her subsequent marriage in New York was bigamous and void and she could not maintain an action of spousal support or equitable distribution. Kleinfield v. Veruki, 7 Va. App. 183, 372 S.E.2d 407, 5 Va. Law Rep. 415, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 103 (1988). Marriage of person insane at time of marriage as voidable and not void.  If decedent was insane when his marriage was contracted, the marriage would be voidable and not void. And where no decree declaring the marriage void had been ent ered, it remained valid. Cornwall v. Cornwall, 160 Va. 183, 168 S.E. 439, 1933 Va. LEXIS 197 (1933). Marriage under minimum legal age for marriage would have been void.  There was sufficient evidence that defendant was not the spouse of the victims for purposes of § 18.2-67.2 as: (1) the minimum legal age for marriage, even wit h parental consent, was 16 under § 20-48; (2) at the time of the offenses, the younger victim was between four and eight; the elder was between 11 and 12; and (3) any marriage between defendant and either victim would have been void pursuant to § 2 0-45.1.Haley v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 402 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2007). Sham green card marriage.  Sham green card marriage was voidable as it was not included in a list of void marriages under §§ 20-45.1 and 20-45.2; if the Virginia legislature had desir ed to deny workers compensation dependent benefits under § 65.2-101 to the purported spouse in sham green card marriages, they could have done so. Marblex Design Int'l, Inc. v. Stevens, 54 Va. App. 299, 678 S.E.2d 276, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 292 (200 9). Marriage voidable.  Parties purported marriage was voidable, not void, because the statute specifies what marriages were void, and the factual situation presented was not among t hem. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Petition b y emancipated minors for protective orders.  Emancipated minor may file petitions for protective orders under applicable statutes, but emancipation requires a valid marriage. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Charniele L. Herring, Member, House of Delegates, 10-116, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 2 (01/21/11). Void marriages.  Virginias laws voiding bigamous marriages and criminalizing bigamy are constitutional; the Fourth Circuits decision in Bostic v. Schaefer does not invalidate §§ 18.2-362, 18.2-363, 20-38.1, 20-40, and 20-45.1, which prohibit bigamy by all persons , regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Also, bisexual and transgender Virginians, like all Virginians, have the right to marry the person they choose, so long as the marriage is otherwise lawful.

CASE NOTES Marriage of minors a permissible s tatus.  Minors over the age of consent for marriage have the capacity to enter into the marriage relation and their marriage is a permissible status and not merely a cont ract between infants. Needam v. Needam, 183 Va. 681, 33 S.E.2d 288, 1945 Va. LEXIS 214 (1945). Marriage of persons below age of consent not absolutely void.  Neither in this section nor in any other is there any provision declaring that marriages of persons under the age of consent are absolutely void. Kirby v. Gilliam , 182 Va. 111, 28 S.E.2d 40 (1943); Needam v. Needam, 183 Va. 681, 33 S.E.2d 288 (1945). But see § 20-45.1. In view of the fact that the statute does not declare a marriage void which has been contracted under a license issued to persons under 21 (now 18) years of age w ithout the consent of parents or guardians, it is apparent that a marriage between parties who were 17 and 16, respectively, was not a nullity.

The parent and child relationship between a child and a woman may be established prima facie by proof of her having given birth to the child, or as otherwise provided in this chapter. B. The parent and child relationship between a child and a man may be established by: 1. Scien tifically reliable genetic tests, including blood tests, which affirm at least a ninety-eight percent probability of paternity. Such genetic test results shall have the same legal effect as a judgment entered pursuant to § 20-49.8. 2. A voluntary written statement of the father and mother made under oath acknowledging paternity and confirming that prior to signing the acknowledgment, the parties were provided with a written and oral description of the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging paternity and the consequences arising from a signed acknowledgment, including the right to rescind. The acknowledgement may be rescinded by either party within sixty days from the date on which it was signed unless an administrative or judicial order relating to the child in an action to which the party seeking rescission was a party is entered prior to the rescission. A written statement shall have the same legal effect as a judgment entered pursuant to § 20-49.8 and shall be binding and conclusive unless, in a subsequent judicial proceeding, the person challenging the statement establishes that the statement resulted from fraud, duress or a material mistake of fact. In any subsequent proceeding in which a statement acknowledging paternity is subject to challenge, the legal responsibilities of any person signing it shall not be suspended during the pendency of the proceeding, except for good cause shown. Written ack nowledgments of paternity made under oath by the father and mother prior to July 1, 1990, shall have the same legal effect as a judgment entered pursuant to § 20-49.8. 3. In the absence of such acknowledgment or if the probability of paternity is less than ninety-eight percent, such relationship may be established as otherwise provided in this chapter. C. The parent and child relationship between a child and an adoptive parent may be established by proof of lawful adoption.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under former § 20-61.1. Constitutionality.  The fathers failure to avail himself of the opportunity to cross-examine the expert or to provide his own expert to refute the findings did not render former §§ 20-61.1 and 20-61.2 unconstitutionally vague. Reynolds v. Stapleton, No. 1210-86-3 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 30, 1987). Former §§ 20-61.1 and 20-61.2 are not unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. Lawrence v. Bluford Brown, 1 Va. App. 202, 336 S.E.2d 899, 1985 Va. App. LEXI S 85 (1985). Statutes constitut e no impediment to due process.  The statutes governing this case provide for notice, the right to be heard and to present evidence, and a fair and impartial decision; they constitute no impedime nt to due process. Watkins v. Commonwealth, No. 0220-89-3 (Ct. of Appeals May 15, 1990). Construction.  There is no requirement that a party have no knowledge that a fact might be untrue to create a mistake of fact; rather, the party must act in part upon an error, misconception, or misunderstanding. Matzuk v. Price, 70 Va. App. 474, 828 S.E.2d 252, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 136 (2019). Legislature intended that this section control the determination of paternity in all cases concerning a child of unwed parents. Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Prior to enactment of this section, there was no recognized duty on the part of the fath er to support his illegitimate child. Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Former § 20-61.1 applied to both civil and criminal proceedings. It controlled the ad judication of paternity issues in all criminal or civil cases involving a child of unwed parents. Florence v. Roberts, 233 Va. 297, 355 S.E.2d 316, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2397, 1987 Va. LEXIS 197 (1987). Former § 20-61.1 applied to both civil and criminal proceedings. Used in conjunction with § 20-61, it is criminal in nature. Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Former § 20-61.1, which allows a court to enforce a judgment for the support of an illegitimate child, applies to both civil and criminal proceedings. Lawrence v. Bluford Brown, 1 Va. App. 202, 336 S.E.2d 899, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 85 (1985). Former § 20-61.1 was limited to the support of a child whose parents are not married. Brown v. Commonwealth ex rel. Custis, 218 Va. 40, 235 S.E.2d 325, 1977 Va. LEXIS 169 (1977), overruled in part, Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Former § 20-61.1 expressly applied to proceedings instituted under Chapter 5 (§ 20-61 et seq.) of Title 20 dealing with desertion and nonsupport and is desi gned to require support of children of unwed parents by the father. Brown v. Commonwealth ex rel. Custis, 218 Va. 40, 235 S.E.2d 325, 1977 Va. LEXIS 169 (1977), overruled in part, Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). In former § 20-61.1 the legislature was referring to and providing for the support of the offspring of a meretricious union between a man and a woman. Brown v. Commonwealth ex rel. Custis, 218 Va. 40, 235 S.E.2d 325, 1977 Va. LEXIS 169 (1977), overruled in part, Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Former § 20-61.1 was not applicable to the support of children of a marriage which, t hough solemnized, is void and thus does not provided the only means by which paternity may be established in such a case. Brown v. Commonwealth ex rel. Custis, 218 Va. 40, 235 S.E.2d 325, 1977 Va. LEXIS 169 (1977), overruled in part, Jones v. Robinson, 2 29 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). The legislature did not intend by its enactment of former § 20-61.1 and related sections to impair the jurisdiction of a court of equity to determine in a prop er proceeding for the support of an infant, whether such child is the issue of a null marriage entitled to the benefits of former § 64.1-7 [now second paragraph of § 20-31.1]. Brown v. Commonwealth ex rel. Custis, 218 Va. 40, 235 S. E.2d 325, 1977 Va. LEXIS 169 (1977), overruled in part, Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Former § 20-61.1 required strict and limited proof of paternity to protect a man from a specious claim of fatherhood made by a woman who has not entered into a marriage relationship with the man. Brown v. Commonwealth ex rel. Custis, 218 Va. 40, 235 S.E.2d 325, 1977 Va. LEXIS 169 (1977), overruled in part, Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985).

In addition, an amount shall be assessed for any full and partial months between the effective date of the order and the date that the first monthly payment is due.

CASE NOTES Co mmon-law doctrine of necessaries held unconstitutional.  The common-law necessaries doctrine, which makes a husband responsible for necessities provided to his spouse but does not impose a similar obligation on the wife , contains a gender-based classification which is violative of Va. Const., Art. I, § 11, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, as it is not substantially related to the achievement of an important gov ernmental objective. Schilling v. Bedford County Mem. Hosp., 225 Va. 539, 303 S.E.2d 905, 1983 Va. LEXIS 253 (1983). This chapter embraces criminal nonsupport actions. Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S. E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Section affords no basis for civ il relief.  This section, imposing criminal sanctions, affords no basis for civil relief. Commonwealth v. Shepard, 212 Va. 843, 188 S.E.2d 99, 1972 Va. LEXIS 280 (1972). This section is a criminal statute which provides no civil relief. Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Actions under this section are criminal in nature.  Any action brought pursuant to this section is criminal in nature, regardless of the person instituting the petition, whether it is the state or some other named party in the statute. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1806, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (1987). Former § 20-61.1 became criminal in nature when employed in conjunction with a proceeding under this section. Section 20-61.1 in itself, however, was not criminal in that it provided no penalty or punishment. Florence v. Roberts, 233 Va. 297, 355 S.E.2d 316, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2397, 1987 Va. LEXIS 197 (1987). Former § 20-61.1 applied to both civil and criminal proceedings. Used in conjunction with this section, it was criminal in nature. Jones v. Robinson, 229 Va. 276, 329 S.E.2d 794, 1985 Va. LEXIS 204 (1985). Object of statutes.  A father has the right at common law to maintain his children in his own home, and he cannot be compelled against his will to do so elsewhere, unless he has refus ed or failed to provide for them where he lives, and the statutes providing for the punishment of a father (now spouse) for the failure to support his children, were not intended to change the common law, with respect to the duty of a father to maintain and support his infant children, but merely to more effectually enforce the legal duty. Butler v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 609, 110 S.E. 868, 1922 Va. LEXIS 58 (1922). Both parents owe a duty of support to their minor children. Bennett v. Commonwealth, Va. Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Bennett, 22 Va. App. 684, 472 S.E.2d 668, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 513 (1996). Duty not escaped by misconduct.  A husband and father is bound to support his wife and children, and if, by his misconduct, he renders it impossible for them to remain under his roof, he cannot, by his misconduct, escape the performance of the duty which the law imposes upon him. Owens v. Owens, 96 Va. 191, 31 S.E. 72, 1898 Va. LEXIS 78 (1898). It is a fathers (now spouses) legal and moral duty to support his dependent infant children. Bruce v. Dean, 149 Va. 39, 140 S.E. 277, 1927 Va. LEXIS 173 (1927); Boaze v. Commonwealth, 165 Va. 786, 183 S.E. 263, 1936 Va. LEXIS 252 (1936). The duty of a father (now spouse) to support his children is based largely upon his right to their custody and control. Butler v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 609, 110 S .E. 868, 1922 Va. LEXIS 58 (1922). The duty of a parent to support minor children is a continuing obligation subject to rev iew at any time as changing circumstances may dictate. D'Auria v. D'Auria, 1 Va. App. 455, 340 S.E.2d 164, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 223 (1986). Legal obligation only during minority of children.  A parent has the legal obligation to support his children only during their minority. Cutshaw v. Cutshaw, 220 Va. 638, 261 S.E.2d 52, 1979 Va. LEXIS 306 (1979). But pa rent may contract to support child beyond minority.  The legal obligation of a parent to support his children only during their minority does not preclude the parent from contracting to support the children after th eir minority. Cutshaw v. Cutshaw, 220 Va. 638, 261 S.E.2d 52, 1979 Va. LEXIS 306 (1979). When support of child beyond minority required.  Even though the oldest child is 18 years old, the husband may be liable for support. A father may be obliged by contract to support a child who has reached majori ty. He may also be required to support an adult child who is mentally or physically incapacitated from earning a living. Whether he is liable for her support is an appropriate inquiry for a timely appeal of the divorce decree, but not for a collateral at tack in an action to recover delinquent support payments. Johnson v. Johnson, 1 Va. App. 330, 338 S.E.2d 353, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 203 (1986). Agreement on support.  Both parents owed a duty of support to their minor children; even though the parties stated in their property settlement agreement that there was no child support obligation, the trial court was not prohibited from subsequently reviewing child support and ordering father to pay it. Huy K. Le v. Mai T. Ngo, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 73 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 15, 2016). Mother accountable for support of child.  This section indicates a legislative intent that the mother, as well as the father, of a child under 18 years of age or of an incapacitated child of any age, shal l be accountable for the support of such child. Commonwealth v. Shepard, 212 Va. 843, 188 S.E.2d 99, 1972 Va. LEXIS 280 (1972). Null and void settlement provisions.  Where parties contracted away the husbands legal duty to support his children and, in effect, placed upon the wife the sole duty of support, and additionally, the wifes ability to contribute to the support of the children was adversely affected, the childrens right to receive support from both parents was substantiall...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_20-62"><akn:num>§ 20-62</akn:num><akn:heading>Commitment to workhouse, city farm or work squad for such desertion</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In the event that the cities or counties of this Commonwealth or any of them establish workhouses, city farms or work squads on which prisoners are put to work, persons convicted of nonsupport under the provisions of this chapter may be committed to the farms, workhouses or work squads instead of to jail.

The section is limited to the person accused, a criminal defendant. The appeal authorized by this section is from a judgment of conviction, a criminal judgment.

CASE NOTES Effect of specific provision in divorce decree for allowance or denial of alimony.  It is clear from §§ 20-79 and 20-121 that a support order of a juvenile and domestic relations court continues in full force and effect notwithstanding the entry by a court of record of a divorce decree that is silent as to support, but if a specific provision for allowance or denial of alimony is included in the final divorce decree, the jurisdiction of the juvenile and domestic relations court would cease under subsection (a) of § 20-79.

CASE NOTES Judgment for contractual arrearages not support order.  Where ex-wife brought garnishment proceeding against her ex-husband and the United States to enforce a judgment against her husband for arrearages under a propert y settlement agreement and to attach the husbands Marine Corps retirement pay, the ex-wifes prior judgment for arrearages was not based upon any arrearages in court-ordered support payments, but upon violations of a contractual obligation; thus t he trial courts ruling that the ex-wifes judgment for contractual arrearages was not a court order for her support within the meaning of this section was correct, and it followed that a limitation of 25 percent applied in determining the amount o f the ex-husbands federal income that was subject to garnishment for enforcement of the judgment. Butler v. Butler, 221 Va. 1035, 277 S.E.2d 180, 1981 Va. LEXIS 246 (1981). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Effect of a judgment creditors dea th.  Where a judgment creditor obtained a judgment against a judgment debtor for an arrearage in spousal support payments, the judgment debtors motion to quash a c ontinuing garnishment order based on the judgment creditors death was denied because the arrearages were recoverable by the executrix of the judgment creditors estate.

Text The entry of an order or decree of support for a spouse or for support and maintenance of a child under the provisions of this chapter or §§ 20-107.1 through 20-1 09 shall constitute a final judgment for any sum or sums in arrears. This order shall also include an amount for interest on the arrearage including from the date support is established or retroactively modified at the judgment interest rate as establish ed by § 6.2-302 unless the obligee, in a writing submitted to the court, waives the collection of interest; and may include reasonable attorney fees if the total arrearage for support and maintenance, excluding interest, is equal to or greater than th ree months of support and maintenance. History History. 1983, c. 488; 1987, c. 190; 1995, c. 483; 2005, c. 880; 2022, c. 527. Annotations Editors note. Effective October 1, 2010, § 6.2-302 was substituted for § 6.1-330.54 to conform to the recodification of Title 6.1 by Acts 2010, c. 794. The 2005 amendments. The 2005 amendment by c. 880 added and may include reasonable attorneys fees if the total arrearage for support and maintenance, excluding interest, is eq ual to or greater than three months of support and maintenance at the end of the last sentence. The 2022 amendments. The 2022 amendment by c. 527, in the second sentence, inserted including from the date support is established or retroactively modified following arre arage and substituted attorney fees for attorneys fees. CASE NOTES Interest mandatory.  Trial court properly ordered a husband to pay interest on a spousal support arrearage. Interest is mandatory under § 20-78.2.Taylor v. Taylor, 2006 Va. App. LE XIS 265 (Va. Ct. App. June 13, 2006). Judgment rate of interest.  Because the amount of interest owed by a husband was dependent on the ultimate determination of the husbands child support arrearage, if any, and because the matter was remanded to the trial court for the recalculation of his child support arrearage, the courts interest award had to be reversed and remanded for reconsideration. Insofar as the husbands underlying argument as to the amount of child supp ort owed remained pertinent on remand, the trial court did not err in applying the judgment rate of interest from the date each payment of support was due until paid in full or in determining the applicable judgment rate was 9 percent through a certain d ate and 6 percent thereafter. Wolfe v. Arthur, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 135 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2008). Nothing in the code section required a final order to award interest on arrearages. Thus, the code section provides a mechanism for treating an order that sets ar rearages as a final judgment for interest purposes. Deluca v. Deluca, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 122 (Va. Ct. App. May 21, 2019). Wife not barred from collecting interest.  Wife was not barred from collecting interest that was due from arrearage in support payments although she did not provide the trial court with a computation of in terest due; this section places that burden on the moving party upon instruction of the court, and record did not show that the trial court requested the wife to make such a computation. Chattin v. Chattin, 245 Va. 302, 427 S.E.2d 347, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1000, 1993 Va. LEXIS 25 (1993). While a mother was not entitled to prejudgment interest on an established child support arrearage owed by the father because she failed to request the same as req uired by § 20-78.2, that failure did not extend to postjudgment interest on the arrearage. Scagnelli v. Hart, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 172 (Va. Ct. App. May 9, 2006). Trial court did not err in awarding interest on a child support arrearage, although neither appellee mother nor the Division of Child Support Enforcement requeste d interest, because the statutory interest provision, § 20-78.2, mandated an award of interest unless the mother waived it. Barrett v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 246 (Va. Ct. App. July 26, 2011). Not applicable where property settlement agreement was controlling.  Because the parties property settlement agreement was the controlling document in their litigation, the former wifes reliance on various statutory provisi ons governing an award of attorneys fees was misplaced. Shea v. Spinicci, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 356 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 3, 2013). Child support award not an arrearage.  Trial court erred by awarding prejudgment interest on the retroactive child support award because award was not an arrearage because it was not unpaid or overdue when the trial court ordered the husband to pay it. It was not until the pendente lite hearing on November 27, 2017, that the husband was actually ordered to pay any amount of child support, making it impossible for him to be in arrears for an amount not determined or ordered.

CASE NOTES The intent was clearly that only Virginia divorce decrees nullified Virginia support orders. Jones v. Richardson, 320 F. Supp. 929, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9863 (W.D. Va. 1970). Construction with other statutes.  Although § 16.1-278.19 only applies to proceedings in juvenile and domestic relations district courts, the statute creates a discretionary attorney fees regim e, authorizing awards as the court deems appropriate; despite differences in the precise statutory language used, the basis for an award under § 16.1-278.19 is indistinguishable from the basis for an award under §§ 20-79(b) and 20-99(6) as the court has interpreted those statutes, and thus trial courts erroneous citation was harmless. Sobol v. Sobol, 74 Va. App. 252, 867 S.E.2d 774, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 18 (2022). Support order continues in effect where divorce decree silent as to support.  It is clear from this section and § 20-121 that a support order of a juvenile and domestic relations court continues in full force and effect notwithstanding t he entry by a court of record of a divorce decree that is silent as to support, but if a specific provision for allowance or denial of alimony is included in the final divorce decree, the jurisdiction of the juvenile and domestic relations court would ce ase under subsection (a) of this section. Werner v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 623, 186 S.E.2d 76, 1972 Va. LEXIS 219 (1972). Confirm not syno nymous with incorporate.  An order which ratified, affirmed and approved a Juvenile Court Custody Order did not constitute an adjudication of child custody or support issues, becau se the language approved, ratified and confirmed was not synonymous with affirm, ratify and incorporate. The former merely approved the order while the latter makes it a part of the divorce decree and enforceable as such. Thus, while the trial court took cognizance of the existing order of the juvenile and domestic court addressing custody and support, the court did not exercise jurisdiction over such issues, and the resulting silence continued the preexisting order of the juvenile and d omestic court in full force and effect without implicating subsection (a) of this section. Rose v. Bartlett, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 438 (Va. Ct. App. June 13, 2000). Transfer not divestment of continuing jurisdiction.  A transfer of any other matters pertaining to support and maintenance . . . and custody to the juvenile and domestic relations district court purs uant to subsection (c) conveys concurrent jurisdiction on the juvenile and domestic relations district court to hear those matters, but the transfer does not divest the circuit court of its continuing jurisdiction to consider those issues, should it exer cise its discretion to do so. Accordingly, the circuit court had the authority to reinstate the case on its docket and to consider the motions to modify child support and visitation. Crabtree v. Crabtree, 17 Va. App. 81, 435 S.E.2d 883, 10 Va. Law Rep. 3 31, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 449 (1993). This section grants authority to a circuit court to transfer to a juvenile and domestic relations court matters pertaining to support and maintenance for the spou se after the entry of a divorce decree; a circuit courts transfer of such matters creates concurrent jurisdiction in each court. Romine v. Romine, 22 Va. App. 760, 473 S.E.2d 99, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 531 (1996). Circuit court erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the rules to show cause by transferring enforcement of support to the juvenile and domestic relati ons district court, which establishes concurrent jurisdiction in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, however, the concurrent jurisdiction afforded it discretion to leave the matter to the juvenile and domestic relations district court. Do rer v. Siddiqui, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 165 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 19, 2002). Transfers from one circuit c ourt to another.  As subsection (c) of § 20-79 states that a circuit court may transfer the enforcement of its child support orders to a juvenile and domestic relations district court, but is silent regarding transfers to another circuit court, it necessarily excludes transfers to such courts.

LEXIS 273 (1948). Parent must be in necessit ous circumstances.  A condition of this section making a child liable for the support of its parent, is that the parent must be in necessitous circumstances according to his or her s tandard of living.

As used in this section, uncompensated value means the aggregate amount by which the fair market value of al l property or resources, including fractional interests, transferred by any transferor after the effective date of and subject to this section, exceeds the aggregate consideration received for such property or resources. B. Within thir ty months prior to the date on which any person receives benefits from any program of public assistance or social services as defined in § 63.2-100, if such person has transferred any property or resources resulting in uncompensated value, the transfe ree of such property or resources shall be liable to repay the Commonwealth for benefits paid on behalf of the transferor up to the amount of that uncompensated value less $25,000. C. In their di scretion, the heads of the agencies which administer the appropriate program or programs of public assistance may petition the circuit court having jurisdiction over the property or over the transferee for an order requiring repayment. That order shall c ontinue in effect, as the court may determine, for so long as the transferor receives public assistance or until the uncompensated value is completely repaid. With respect to all transfers subject to this section, a rebuttable presumption is created that the transferee acted with the intent and for the purpose of assisting the transferor to qualify for public assistance. If the presumption is rebutted, this section shall not apply and the petition shall be dismissed. D. After reaso nable investigation, the agency or agencies administering the program of public assistance shall not file any petition, and no court shall order payments under subsection B of this section if it is determined that: (i) the uncompensated value of the prop erty transferred is $25,000 or less, (ii) that the property transferred was the home of the transferor at the time of the transfer and the transferor or any of the following individuals reside in the home: the transferors spouse, any natural or adopt ed child of the transferor under the age of ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_20-89"><akn:num>§ 20-89</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1975, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>644. § 20-89.1. Suit to annul marriage. Text A. When a marr iage is alleged to be void or voidable for any of the causes mentioned in § 20-13, 20-38.1, or 20-45.1 or by virtue of fraud or duress, either party may institute a suit for annulling the same; and upon proof of the nullity of the marriage, it shall b e decreed void by a decree of annulment. B. In the case of natural or incurable impotency of body existing at the time of entering into the marriage contract, or when, prior to the marriage, either party, without the knowledge of the other, had been convicted of a felony, or when, at the time of the marriage , either spouse, without the knowledge of the other spouse, was with child by a person other than the other spouse or had conceived a child born to a person other than the other spouse within 10 months after the date of the solemnization of the marriage, or where, prior to the marriage, either party had been, without the knowledge of the other, a prostitute, a decree of annulment may be entered upon proof, on complaint of the party aggrieved. C. No annulmen t for a marriage alleged to be void or voidable under subsection B of § 20-45.1 or subsection B of this section or by virtue of fraud or duress shall be decreed if it appears that the party applying for such annulment has cohabited with the other afte r knowledge of the facts giving rise to what otherwise would have been grounds for annulment, and in no event shall any such decree be entered if the parties had been married for a period of two years prior to the institution of such suit for annulment. D. A party who , at the time of such marriage as is mentioned in § 20-48, was capable of consenting with a party not so capable shall not be permitted to institute a suit for the purpose of annulling such marriage.

CASE NOTES Voidable marriage is usually treated as a valid marriage until it is decreed void. McConk ey v. McConkey, 216 Va. 106, 215 S.E.2d 640, 1975 Va. LEXIS 255 (1975). Parties to a voidable marriage are husband and wife unless and until the marriage is ann ulled. McConkey v. McConkey, 216 Va. 106, 215 S.E.2d 640, 1975 Va. LEXIS 255 (1975). A judicial decision is important in reference to a void marriage.  Although there may be no doubt in the minds of the parties, it is often desirable, and sometimes of highest importance, both to individuals and to the community t hat there should be a judicial decision in reference to a void marriage, for then the status of the parties and their children is set at rest, and the parties are justified in the eyes of the public in entering into a second marriage. Former § 20-89 a nd §§ 20-96 through 20-97 made provisions for this situation. The fact that a marriage is void under § 20-43 and former § 20-57 without any legal process does not take away the power of the courts to declare it invalid. Henderson v. Henderson , 187 Va. 121, 46 S.E.2d 10, 1948 Va. LEXIS 205 (1948). Though a marriage between persons, one of whom had a former wife or husband then living, is absolutely void without any decree of divorce or other legal process, for obvious reasons such judicial sentence is prudent and advisable, and the statute gives either party the right to obtain such a decree. Brown v. Brown, 24 S.E. 238 (Va. Ct. App. 1896). The causes for annulment mentioned are not exclusive. Pretlow v. Pretlow, 177 Va. 524, 14 S.E.2d 381, 1941 Va. LEXIS 239 (1941). Where a divorced wife enters into a subsequent, voidable marriage, she thereby forfeits her right to alimony from her former husband. McConkey v. McConkey, 216 Va. 106, 215 S.E.2d 640, 1975 Va. LEXIS 255 (1975). Annulment of voidable second marriage does not entitle wife to reinstatement of alimony payments from first husband, where there is a statute providing that alimony shall terminate upon the recipients remarriage. McConkey v. McConkey, 216 Va. 106, 215 S.E.2d 640, 1975 Va. LEXIS 255 (1975). Misrepresentation as to prior marital status is not ground for annulment. Sanderson v. Sa nderson, 212 Va. 537, 186 S.E.2d 84, 1972 Va. LEXIS 198 (1972). Insane person cannot institute suit himself under this section.  Under this section a person who has been adjudged insane and is still non compos mentis cannot himself institute a suit. He cannot sue except by and through his l egally constituted representative. Counts v. Counts, 161 Va. 768, 172 S.E. 248, 1934 Va. LEXIS 299 (1934). The right to bring a suit for annulment of marriage is expressly given by this section, but this is probably merely declaratory of a preexisting ground of equitable jurisdiction. Heflinger v. Heflinger, 136 Va. 289, 118 S.E. 316, 1923 Va. LEXIS 87 (1923) (see Pretlow v. Pretlow, 177 Va. 524, 14 S.E.2d 381 (1941)). Section not applicable to marriage of minor over age of consent.  Marriages of minors over the age of consent for marriage are not supposed to be void merely because of the lack of parental consent, so as to make applica ble this section authorizing a suit for annulment of a marriage when the marriage is supposed to be void. Needam v. Needam, 183 Va. 681, 33 S.E.2d 288, 1945 Va. LEXIS 214 (1945). Cohabi tation after knowledge of fraud barred annulment.  Even if the evidence had established that a wife was induced to marry her husband by fraud, the evidence proved the wife chose to remain with the husband for almo st five months after husband disclosed his improper purpose and, by remaining with the husband after learning of his improper purpose, the wife was barred from relying on fraud to annul the marriage. Simindokht Jouybari Okhravi v. Masoud Ganji, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 233 (Va. Ct. App. May 1, 2001). Annulment based on fraud upheld.  Trial court did not err in granting a husband an annulment on fraud grounds, although the parties testimony was in conflict about whether they had consummated their marriage, because the trial court found the husband and his corroborating witnesses credible where there was no evidence of any physical affection between the parties. Mustafa v. Mustafa, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 139 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 13, 2010). No jurisdiction over appeal from dismissal of cross-bill for annulment.  In a divorce case, an interlocutory decree dismissing appellants cross-bill for annulment was not appealable under subdivision 4(ii) of § 17.1-405. As the decree did not determine the status or validity of the parties marriage, award spousal support, or make an equitable distribution of marital assets, it did not respond to the chief object of the domestic relations dispute and did not determin e the principles that were necessary to adjudicate the cause. Lewis v. Lewis, 271 Va. 520, 628 S.E.2d 314, 2006 Va. LEXIS 44 (2006). Denial of annulment petition error.  Denial of a wifes petition to annul a bigamous marriage was error because, contrary to the trial courts finding, a void bigamous marriage could not have b een revived by corrective measures, and the wifes action in obtaining a falsified marriage certificate was not an option because, under § 20-13, marriages in Virginia had to be solemnized; a marriage license presupposed a marriage ceremony solemnizing the union, and whatever formalities the ceremony required, at the very least it required the attendance of both the bride and groom. Section 20-31 had no application in cases where the putative marriage was void ab initio. Davidson v. Davids on, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. July 14, 2009). Sufficient evidence of bigamy.  Sufficient evidence supported annulment of marriage based on bigamy where the former husband testified that he went to Pakistan and investigated the former wife s marriage, where he learned that she never divorced her prior husband; the former husband also submitted documentation from Pakistan to prove that the former wife was being charged with bigamy and a warrant for her arrest was outstanding, and an exp ert explained Pakistani law and how one obtains a religious and legal divorce in Pakistan; once the former wife learned about the legal process, she filed the necessary paperwork, but did so after she married the former husband. The former husbands e xpert testified that Pakistani divorces were not retroactive, and the trial court found that the testimony of the former husband and his witnesses was more credible than the testimony of the form...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_20-90"><akn:num>§ 20-90</akn:num><akn:heading>Suit to affirm marriage</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. When the va lidity of any marriage shall be denied or doubted by either of the parties, the other party may institute a suit for affirmance of the marriage, and upon due proof of the validity thereof, it shall be decreed to be valid, and such decree shall be conclus ive upon all persons concerned. B. Notwithstan ding § 20-13, a marriage of a couple where one of the parties was under the age of 18 at the time of solemnization may be decreed valid upon petition by the party who was under the age of 18 at the time of the solemnization that would otherwise be dee med voidable under subsection C of § 20-45.1 solely because of age, once such party has attained the age of 18. If both parties were under the age of 18 at the time of solemnization, such petition shall not be granted unless both parties have reached the age of 18 and join in the petition together.

CASE NOTES Scope of section.  This section and §§ 20-96 through 20-98 (now repealed) include suits to determine questions of doubt or denial affecting the matrimonial status as well as q uestions relating to the contracting rights of the parties, the form, or the solemnity of their contracts. McFarland v. McFarland, 179 Va. 418, 19 S.E.2d 77, 1942 Va. LEXIS 235 (1942). Validity of ma rriage determined under Virginia law.  The law of Virginia must be applied to determine the question of validity of the marriage within this state. No state is bound by comity to give effect in its cou rts to the marriage laws of another state, repugnant to its own laws and policy. Hager v. Hager, 3 Va. App. 415, 349 S.E.2d 908, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1151, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 376 (1986). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Validity of ma rriage determined under Virginia law.  In a case in which a husband and wife were married in a religious ceremony and sought to have their marriage confirmed by a court pursuant to §§ 20-31 and 2 0-90, they had not obtained a marriage license, as required by § 20-13. While the parties might remain married according to their religion, their marriage ceremony conferred no legal rights between them under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the court could not issue a marriage license retroactive to the date of the religious ceremony. In re Ejigu, 79 Va. Cir. 349, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 127 (Fairfax County Sept. 30, 2009). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL License mandatory.  A court does not have the statutory or equitable authority to affirm marriages that were not performed under a license of marriage.

A divorce f rom the bond of matrimony may be decreed: (1) For adultery; or for sodomy or buggery committed outside the marriage; (2) [Repealed.] (3) Where either of the parties subsequent to the marriage has been convicted of a felony, sentenced to confinement for more than one year and confined for such felony subsequent to suc h conviction, and cohabitation has not been resumed after knowledge of such confinement (in which case no pardon granted to the party so sentenced shall restore such party to his conjugal rights); (4), (5) [Repealed.] (6) Where either party has been guilty of cruelty, caused reasonable apprehension of bodily hurt, or willfully deserted or abandoned the other, such divorce may be decreed to the innoce nt party after a period of one year from the date of such act; or (7), (8) [Repealed.] (9) (a) O n the application of either party if and when they have lived separate and apart without any cohabitation and without interruption for one year. In any case where the parties have entered into a separation agreement and there are no minor children either born of the parties, born of either party and adopted by the other or adopted by both parties, a divorce may be decreed on application if and when they have lived separately and apart without cohabitation and without interruption for six months. A plea of res adjudicata or of recrimination with respect to any other provision of this section shall not be a bar to either party obtaining a divorce on this ground; nor shall it be a bar that either party has been adjudged insane, either before or after such separation has commenced, but at the expiration of one year or six months, whichever is applicable, from the commencement of such separation, the grounds for divorce shall be deemed to be complete, and the committee of the insane defendant, if there be one, shall be made a party to the cause, or if there be no committee, then the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the insane defendant.

Boyd v. Boyd, 2 Va. App. 16, 340 S.E.2d 578, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 236 (1986). No legislative preference between grounds.  There is nothing in any portion of the divorce law which suggests a legislative intent to give precedence to one proven ground of divorce over another. Robertson v. Robertson, 215 Va. 425, 211 S.E.2d 41, 1975 Va. LEXIS 169 (1975). Trial court can choose between grounds alleged.  Trial court did not err in granting the wife a divorce on the ground of living separate and apart for more than one year and refusing to grant the husband a divor ce on the grounds of cruelty and desertion, because trial court was free to choose between the two grounds in granting the divorce and thus, did not abuse its discretion. Fadness v. Fadness, 52 Va. App. 833, 667 S.E.2d 857, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 496 (2008) . Trial court did not err in refusing to award a husband a divorce on the ground of desertion, because even if grounds existed for the trial court to award the husb and a divorce on desertion, the trial court was free to select any sufficient ground in awarding the divorce and it had found that the husband had committed adultery. Davis v. Davis, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 26 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 26, 2010). Circuit court properly entered a final decree of divorce based on a one-year separation because, even if the record supported the husbands argument regarding the fault grounds for divorce, the circuit court was free to choose between the grounds presented by the parties, the ground the court used was supported by the evidence, the husband failed to preserved his arguments regarding the distribution of the wif es retirement account and the former marital residence, and the circuit court considered all of the circumstances in declining to award attorneys fees to either party.

CASE NOTES Section changes prior rule.  Prior to the enactment of this section in 1926, it was the law in this State that when a defendant in a divorce case became and was adjudged insane between the da te of desertion and the running of the statutory period prescribed to make the ground for divorce complete, such insanity was a bar to the granting of a divorce. The legislature, in sound consideration of public policy, saw fit to change the rule. Pollar d v. Pollard, 204 Va. 316, 130 S.E.2d 425, 1963 Va. LEXIS 150 (1963). Now insanity after start of desertion does not bar divorce therefor.  In clear and unambiguous language this section provides that insanity occurring between the commencement of desertion and the running of the statutory period is n ot a bar to divorce for willful desertion or abandonment.

Condonation is conditional forgiveness. Knowledge is necessary. One cannot condone what one does not know. Moreover, it is essential that there be no repetition of the offense. Repetition revives the right to complain of an injury forgiven. Elder v. Elder, 139 Va. 19, 123 S.E. 369, 1924 Va. LEXIS 81 (1924); Martin v. Martin, 166 Va. 109, 18 4 S.E. 220, 1936 Va. LEXIS 170 (1936); McKee v. McKee, 206 Va. 527, 145 S.E.2d 163, 1965 Va. LEXIS 229 (1965). And operates as to known offense only.  Where a defendant is guilty of several matrimonial offenses, and the plaintiff, when he forgives the defendant, knows of one of them but not of the others, the co ndonation operates as to the known offense; but because of the lack of knowledge the forgiveness does not bar an action based on the others. McKee v. McKee, 206 Va. 527, 145 S.E.2d 163, 1965 Va. LEXIS 229 (1965). Voluntary cohabitation after knowledge of the spouses misconduct amounts to condonation. McKee v. McKee, 206 Va. 527, 145 S.E.2d 163, 1965 Va. LEXIS 229 (1965). And it bars a divorce to the condoning party. McKee v. McKee, 206 Va. 527, 145 S.E.2d 163 , 1965 Va. LEXIS 229 (1965). On its own motion, the court may and should deny a divorce where it appears from the record that the injured party has condoned the acts complained of. McKee v. M cKee, 206 Va. 527, 145 S.E.2d 163, 1965 Va. LEXIS 229 (1965). A single voluntary act of sexual intercourse by the innocent spouse after knowledge of t he offense is sufficient to constitute condonation. Tarr v. Tarr, 184 Va. 443, 35 S.E.2d 401, 1945 Va. LEXIS 163 (1945), limited, Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 296, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). Ordinarily condonation is a matter of affirmative defense which must be specially pleaded and proven, but where a fraud has been perpetrated on the court in obtaining a divorce decree, a subsequent suit attacking the decree is not barred. Tarr v. Tarr, 184 Va. 443, 35 S.E.2d 401, 1945 Va. LEXIS 163 (1945), limited, Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 296, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). Condonation should be pleaded as an affirmative defense in the wifes answer. McKee v. McKee, 206 Va. 527, 145 S.E.2d 163, 1965 Va. LEXIS 229 (1965). Revival of condoned adultery.  Condoned adultery is revived where the guilty party has resumed his association with his former paramour, even without strict proof of an actual repetition of the offense. McKee v. McKee, 206 Va. 527, 145 S.E.2d 163, 1965 Va. LEXIS 229 (1965). Husband held to have con doned wifes adultery.  See Huddle v. Huddle, 206 Va. 535, 145 S.E.2d 167, 1965 Va. LEXIS 230 (1965). Adultery within the five years not shown.  Adultery by wife within five-year actionable time frame was not shown where her and her adulterous partners admissions were of adultery before the time frame, she denied subsequent adultery, the partner took the Fifth Amendment when asked about subsequent adultery, and his initial denial of any adultery  which was a prior inconsistent statement  went only to his credibility and not proof on the issue. Fickett v. Fickett, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 120 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 26, 2002). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Adultery within five years.  Because the evidence established that the wife had intercourse with two other men while married to the husband within five years of the institution of the divorce action, the husband was granted a divorce on the ground of adultery.

Cruelty and Reasonable Apprehension of Bodily Hurt. III. Pleading and Proof. I.Abandonment and Desertion. What constitutes abandonment and desertion.  Abandonment and desertion which entitles a husband or wife to a divorce a mensa et thoro is composed: first, of the actual breaking off of the matrimonial cohabit ation, and second, of an intent to desert in the mind of the offender. Both must combine to make the desertion complete. The intent to desert is usually the principal thing to be considered. Bailey v. Bailey, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 43, 1871 Va. LEXIS 81 (187 1) (see Carr v. Carr, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 168 (1872); Latham v. Latham, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 307 (1878); Smith v. Smith, 202 Va. 104, 116 S.E.2d 110 (1960)). In the absence of justification, proof of an actual breaking off of matrimonial cohabitation, combined with the intent to desert in the mind of the offender, enti tles the party deserted to a divorce. Graham v. Graham, 210 Va. 608, 172 S.E.2d 724, 1970 Va. LEXIS 170 (1970). In the context of both § 20-91 A (6) and this section desertion is a breach of matrimonial duty  an actual breaking off of the matrimonial cohabitation cou pled with an intent to desert in the mind of the deserting party. Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 296, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). Conduct justifying desertion must be sufficient to establish grounds f or divorce.  One spouse is not justified in leaving the other unless the conduct of the other is sufficient to establish the foundation of a judicial proceeding for divorce. S tolfi v. Stolfi, 203 Va. 696, 126 S.E.2d 923, 1962 Va. LEXIS 208 (1962). The desertion must be alleged and proved to have occurred prior to the bringing of the suit, and cannot be based upon some act or conduct alleged to have taken place during its pendency. Smith v. Smith, 202 Va. 104, 116 S.E.2d 110, 1960 Va. LEXIS 196 (1960); Beckner v. Beckner, 204 Va. 580, 132 S.E.2d 715, 1963 Va. LEXIS 188 (1963) . Cruelty tantamount to desertion.  Cruelty on the part of the husband which results in the wifes enforced separation from his bed and board is tantamount to desertion on his part. Ringgold v. R inggold, 128 Va. 485, 104 S.E. 836, 1920 Va. LEXIS 118 (1920). No definite period of desertion is required by this section to sustain a suit for divorc e a mensa et thoro. Any desertion which fulfills the requirements of the definition given above is sufficient to sustain the suit, no matter if the parties have cohabited as man and wife for a short period since the first desertion by the defendant. Bail ey v. Bailey, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 43, 1871 Va. LEXIS 81 (1871); Carr v. Carr, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 168, 1872 Va. LEXIS 10 (1872); Throckmorton v. Throckmorton, 86 Va. 768, 11 S.E. 289, 1890 Va. LEXIS 43 (1890). Since the statute fixes no period for which the desertion must have continued to entitle a party to a divorce a mensa et thoro, the question is to be determined b y the court according to the facts and circumstances of each case. Bailey v. Bailey, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 43, 1871 Va. LEXIS 81 (1871); Carr v. Carr, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 168, 1872 Va. LEXIS 10 (1872). Under this section, unlike subdivision A (6) of § 20-91, no specific period is prescribed during which the desertion must continue to entitle a party to a divo rce from bed and board. Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 296, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). De sertion presumed to continue.  Once separation and intent to desert have been established, the desertion is presumed to continue until the contrary is shown. Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 2 96, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). Husband moving to the familys second home and having sporadic communication and sexual intercourse with the wife did not constitute cohabitation because there was no accompanying resumption of marital duties or cohabitation on a continuous basis, and intent to desert was found from husbands withdrawal of $100,000 from couples joint bank account a few days before telling his wife he was moving out. Thu s, the wife was properly awarded a divorce on the ground of desertion. Gruettner v. Gruettner, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 556 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2004). A separation by mutual consent will be presumed to continue by mutual consent until one of the parties withdraws consent and offers to resume cohabitation, in which case the burden is on the offering party to prove that the offer was made in good faith and was refused without justification. Smith v. Smith, 202 Va. 104, 116 S.E.2d 110, 1960 Va. LEXIS 196 (1960). When a husband went into the armed service he did not desert his wife. Moltz v. Moltz, 1 82 Va. 737, 30 S.E.2d 561, 1944 Va. LEXIS 227 (1944). Matrimonial cohabitation consists of more than sexual relations. It also imports the continuing condition of living together and carrying out the mutual responsibilities of the marital relationship. Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 296, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). In order to be free from legal fault in breaking off matrimonial cohabitation, a party does not have to establish constructive desertion by the other spouse. D'Auria v. D'Auria, 1 Va. App. 455, 340 S.E.2d 164, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 223 (1986). Failure to voice objection does not show separation by mutual consent.  It was error to deny a husband a divorce on the ground that the evidence showed separation by mutual consent, where there was direct proof of the wifes act of leaving and of her accompanying intention to desert her husband. That he voiced no objection to her going was immaterial, for it was her conduct and purpose and not his state of mind that determined whether there was desertion. Miller v. Miller, 196 Va. 698, 85 S.E.2d 221, 1955 Va. LEXIS 141 (1955). Mere denial of sexual intercourse, where other marital duties are performed, does not co nstitute desertion. Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 296, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). Ending desertion.  In order to end a desertion, the parties must resume the matrimonial cohabitation with the intent to end the desertion. Not only is resumption of sexual relations a factor, the parties also must resume the performance of marital duties while living together on a continuous basis. Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 296, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). Single act of intercourse did not show intent to end desertion.  The trial court erred in dismissing husbands cross-bill for divorce on the ground of desertion because of a single act of sexual intercourse between the parti es that occurred during the pendency of the case. The jurisdiction of a trial court to adjudicate a divorce proceeding is not destroyed by conduct of the parties that might require dismissal of the bill or cross-bill. Rather, jurisdiction remains in the court to grant or refuse the requested relief in view of the facts as shown by the evidence. The evidence did not show a break in the separation of the parties with intent to end the desertion. Petachenko v. Petachenko, 232 Va. 296, 350 S.E.2d 600, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1257, 1986 Va. LEXIS 256 (1986). The burden of going forward with evidence of justification or showing that leaving was f or a reason other than the intent to desert rests on the party who claims his or her leaving was without an intent to desert. D'Auria v. D'Auria, 1 Va. App. 455, 340 S.E.2d 164, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 223 (1986). Eviden ce held sufficient, etc. Evidence held sufficient to sustain divorce a mensa on ground of desertion. Good v. Good , 122 Va. 30, 94 S.E. 176, 1917 Va. LEXIS 80 (1917); Bowman v. Bowman, 180 Va. 200, 22 S.E.2d 29, 1942 Va. LEXIS 158 (1942); Nash v. Nash, 200 Va. 890, 108 S.E.2d 350, 1959 Va. LEXIS 182 (1959); Beckner v. Beckner, 204 Va. 580, 132 S.E.2d 715, 1963 Va. L EXIS 188 (1963). Circuit court erred in sustaining a wifes demurrer to a husbands complaint for divorce on the grounds of desertion because the complaint sufficiently show ed that the wife left with the intent to desert by alleging wife was unhappy in the marriage, that she left the home on two prior occasions, and that she finally left for good taking the parties child with her, and the husband did not have to allege that he did not consent to the wifes leaving. Hill v. Thomas, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 102 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2018).

CASE NOTES Jurisdiction is purely statutory.  Power to grant divorces originally resided in the legislature, and neither courts of law nor equity have any inherent power to dissolve marriage, the power being purely statutory. Virginia Const., Art. IV, § 14, makes it mandatory upon the legislature to grant such power, which is given by this section. Richardson v. Richardson, 8 Va. L. Reg. 257 (1922); Blankenship v. Blankenship, 125 Va. 595, 100 S.E. 538, 1 919 Va. LEXIS 48 (1919). Jurisdiction in divorce suits is purely statutory and such jurisdiction of a court of equity does not inherently extend to the disposal of the personal property o f the husband. Watkins v. Watkins, 220 Va. 1051, 265 S.E.2d 750, 1980 Va. LEXIS 200 (1980). Jurisdiction in divorce suits is purely statutory, and it cannot be acquired by the courts inferentially or through indirection. Johnson v. Johnson, 224 Va. 641, 299 S.E.2d 351, 1983 Va. LEXIS 172 (1983). The Virginia Constitution authorizes the General Assembly to confer upon the courts power to grant divorces. Therefore, the power to grant divorces in Virginia is purely statutory. Westbrook v. Westbrook, 5 Va. App. 446, 364 S.E.2d 523, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1770, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (1988). Although a marriage may ultimately be declared void, that does not alter a trial courts power, expressly conferred by statute, to enter certain orders during the pendency of the litigation; those orders are not rendered retroactively void, even if the marriage ultimately proves to be. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182 , 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). And is over subject matter rather than person.  A suit for divorce is in its essence and character very different from a transitory cause of action, over which any court of record has general jurisdiction; and the question really arising from the effect to be given our divorce statutes is rather one of jurisdiction over the subject matter than over the person. Richardson v. Richardson, 8 Va. L. Reg. 257 (1922). This section adds to the authority of the named courts by conferring upon them jurisdict ion of suits for divorce, a jurisdiction not inherent in such courts. Smith v. Smith, 200 Va. 77, 104 S.E.2d 17, 1958 Va. LEXIS 161 (1958). It does not take away any existing jurisdiction.  There is no limitation in this section which restricts the court to decreeing only with respect to the rights of the parties created by the marital relation. It d oes not take away from courts any existing equity jurisdiction. Smith v. Smith, 200 Va. 77, 104 S.E.2d 17, 1958 Va. LEXIS 161 (1958). Court retained in rem jurisdiction over fund although husband died.  Circuit court retained in rem jurisdiction over a fund specifically created by a valid order of that court: The order established the fund until further order of the court. It neither became a nullity, nor became void, nor was it vacated by operation of law, upon the husbands death, which abated the litigation over the parties marital status. Instead, the circuit court, a court of general jurisdiction, re tained power to dispose of the res, the escrow fund that it had created. Sprouse v. Griffin, 250 Va. 46, 458 S.E.2d 770, 1995 Va. LEXIS 81 (1995). Divorce suit a chancery case sui g eneris.  The many limitations, both in respect to jurisdiction and procedure, placed upon divorce suits by the statute, differentiate the divorce case from ordinary suits in equity and render it a chancery case sui generis. McCotter v. Carle, 149 Va. 584, 140 S.E. 670, 1927 Va. LEXIS 197 (1927); Westbrook v. Westbrook, 5 Va. App. 446, 364 S.E.2d 523, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1770, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (1988). The circuit court, sitting as chancery court in divorce case, lacked jurisdiction to ter minate fathers parental rights and, with that termination, fathers child support obligation. Church v. Church, 24 Va. App. 502, 483 S.E.2d 498, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (1997). Jurisdiction to enter inte rlocutory orders.  Interlocutory orders in divorce and annulment suits, including pendente lite support orders, preserve the status quo until the ultimate entry of the decree of div orce or annulment; an annulment decree in a spouses favor does not retroactively defeat the jurisdiction to enter interlocutory orders prior to the entry of the annulment decree. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LE XIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Trial court had subject ma tter jurisdiction.  Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over a 2004 divorce action as: (1) in a 1981 action, a wife alleged that she was and had been a resident and domicilia ry of Buchanan County for more than six months preceding the commencement of the suit; (2) §§ 20-96 and 20-97 required that only one of the parties meet the residency and domiciliary requirements in order to establish jurisdiction; (3) the husband signed a 1981 order awarding pendente lite support and custody, and did not suggest in 1981 that he or the wife were not residents or domiciliaries of Virginia; (4) the husband moved to consolidate the 1981 and the 2004 cases; and (5) the husband never i ntroduced evidence tending to refute the fact that jurisdiction was established in 1981. Kinser v. Kinser, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 483 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2007). Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over an annulment matter under §§ 20-96 and 20-97 because the pleadings and the exhibits established that the pa rties were domiciled in and residents of Virginia for the requisite time period; the former husbands complaint for annulment stated the current Virginia address of each party and that both parties were domiciled in and bona fide residents of Virginia for the past six months, and, in her answer, the former wife admitted to the allegations regarding their residences and stated affirmatively in her counterclaim their current Virginia addresses and that she was domiciled in and a bona fide resident of V irginia for more than six months prior to the commencement of the suit, and also provided the Virginia address of where they last cohabited as husband and wife. Additionally, among other things, application for Virginia marriage license was introduced th at established that both parties lived in Virginia in 2004 and a protective order issued in 2009 stated the parties address in Virginia. Naseer v. Moghal, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 14, 2012). Trial court had jurisdiction to award pendente lite support because it had both subject matter and personal jurisdiction; the trial court had subject matter juris diction over the divorce and annulment suits, and it also had jurisdiction over the parties. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Trial court did not err in awarding the wife $18,283 for her attorneys fees and costs where the parties agreement did not contain language requiring the t rial court to find the husband in contempt before it could enforce the terms of the agreement and the trial court found that the wife had to go to court to enforce the terms of the agreement. Ibrahimi v. Ibrahimi, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 63 (Va. Ct. App. Mar . 1, 2016). Trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.  Circuit court was correct in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter a final decree in the parties divorce action because the wife died after the hearing had concluded and the circuit court announced its ruling but before a decree on the merits had been entered by the circuit court, and therefo...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_20-97"><akn:num>§ 20-97</akn:num><akn:heading>Domicile and residential requirements for suits for annulment, affirmance, or divorce</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text No suit for annulling a marriage or for divorce shall be maintainable, unless one of the parties was at the time of the filing of the suit and had been for at least six months preceding the filing of the suit an actual bona fide resident and domiciliary of the Commonwealth, nor shall any suit for affirming a marriage be maintainable, unless one of the parties be domiciled in, and is and has been an actual bona fide res ident of, the Commonwealth at the time of filing such suit. For the purposes of this section only: 1. If a member of the Armed Forces of the United States has been stationed or resided in the Commonwealth and has lived for a period of six months or more in the Commonwealth next preceding the filing of the suit, then such person shall be presumed to be domicil ed in and to have been a bona fide resident of the Commonwealth during such period of time. 2.

CASE NOTES Object of this section.  The object of this section is to prevent the opening of the courts of the Commonwealth to mere residents, and to restrict them to litigants who have a more perman ent identification with the State. But former § 20-98 (see now § 8.01-261 19) was manifestly a mere matter of venue, which had to be followed if the defendant objected to any other. Towson v. Towson, 126 Va. 640, 102 S.E. 48 (1920). But see Chandle r v. Chandler, 132 Va. 418, 112 S.E. 856 (1922), where this statement as to venue is disapproved. Domi ciliary residence requirements are jurisdictional.  When named, statutory requirements for domiciliary residence are jurisdictional in a suit for divorce. Howe v. Howe, 179 Va. 111, 18 S.E.2d 294, 1942 Va. LEXIS 20 4 (1942). Deposition to establish domiciliary residence requirements.  In a divorce case, depositions of the wife and her mother that the wife was a lifelong resident of Virginia adequately established the jurisdictional requirement to show sufficient domicile and residence. Buka v. Smith, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 129 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 11, 2003). Domicile and cohabitation are distinctly different concepts and should not be equated or confused. Domicile is not determined solely by the location where people reside, while cohabitation is. Cohabitation does not require an intent to remain somewhere indefinitely, while domicile does. Rock v. Rock, 7 Va. App. 198, 372 S.E.2d 211, 5 Va. La w Rep. 431, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 104 (1988). Domicile and residence distinguished .  Where plaintiff exercises the option given him by § 20-98 (now repealed) of bringing a suit for divorce in the . . . corporation of the plaintiffs resi dence, the fact that defendant was not a resident of the State of Virginia, being one of the conditions upon which such option is given by the statute, becomes jurisdictional. But resident, as thus used, is to be distinguished from domici led, and though the domicile of defendant might be in Virginia, still if she occupied a separate place of abode in the City of Washington, she was not a resident of Virginia. Chandler v. Chandler, 132 Va. 418, 112 S.E. 856, 1922 Va. LEXIS 36 (1922). The words domiciled and resident, are technical words, and, according to the usual rule of construction of statutes, are presumed to have been use d in their technical sense. This is specially true where both words are used in the same section of a statute. Towson v. Towson, 126 Va. 640, 102 S.E. 48, 1920 Va. LEXIS 16 (1920). A persons place of abode, or habitation, as contradistinguished from the place of mere transient, or, under some circumstances, even daily presence, for busin ess or pleasure, is the place of ones residence within the meaning of the divorce statute, as it is of statutes of limitations, attachment statutes, and the like. One may be domiciled in one state and be a resident of another, within the meaning of s uch statutes. Chandler v. Chandler, 132 Va. 418, 112 S.E. 856, 1922 Va. LEXIS 36 (1922). The terms residence and domicile are not synonymous as used in this section. Hiles v. Hiles, 164 Va. 131, 178 S.E. 913 (1935). For other cases discussing the distinction between residence and domicile, see Long v. Ryan, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 718 (1878); Williams v. Commonwealth, 116 Va. 272, 81 S.E. 61 ( 1914); Cooper v. Commonwealth, 121 Va. 338, 93 S.E. 680 (1917). For a case in which the court refused to entertain a suit for divorce because neither of the parties was domiciled in Virginia, see Yates v. Yates, 115 Va. 678, 79 S.E. 1040, 1913 Va. LEXIS 82 (1913). Residence, or domicile, as used in statutes dealing in divorce, contemplates intention t o live in the adopted home permanently or certainly for an indefinite period. Abiding in one place for a definite time, until the accomplishment of a certain purpose, unaccompanied by any intention to remain permanently or indefinitely, is not sufficient to give a person a statutory residence. Howe v. Howe, 179 Va. 111, 18 S.E.2d 294, 1942 Va. LEXIS 204 (1942). The fact that wife moved to Virginia in order to obtain a divorce and moved back to the District of Columbia after obtaining said divorce would not invalidate the decree if she had at one time during her residence in Virginia the intention to remain for an indefinite period. Goodloe v. Hawk, 113 F.2d 753, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 3449 (D.C. Cir. 1940), limited, Oliver v. Oliver, 185 F.2d 429, 87 U.S. App. D.C. 334, 1 950 U.S. App. LEXIS 3301 (D.C. Cir. 1950). One may be domiciled in one state and be a resident of another within the meaning of thi s section. Hiles v. Hiles, 164 Va. 131, 178 S.E. 913, 1935 Va. LEXIS 187 (1935). Meaning of bona fide resident.  Within the purview of this section, to have been an actual bona fide resident of this State for one year (now six months) preceding the institution of a s uit for divorce, means to have had in this State throughout that period an actual bona fide permanent abode, as contradistinguished from a sojourn, or transitory abode, in this State or elsewhere. The plaintiff need not have been physically present in Vi rginia every day during that period; but it is essential ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_20-98"><akn:num>§ 20-98</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1977, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>624.

Whether the defendant answers or not, the cause shall be heard independently of the admissions of either party in the pleadings or otherwise. 3. Process or notice in such proceedings shall be served in the Commonwealth by any of the methods prescribed in § 8.01-296 by any person authorized to serve process under § 8.01-29 3. Service may be made on a nonresident by any of the methods prescribed in § 8.01-296 by any person authorized to serve process under § 8.01-320. 4. In cases where such suits have been commenced and an appearance has been made on behalf of the defendant by counsel, then notices to take depositions and of hearings, motions, and othe r proceedings except contempt proceedings, may be served by delivering or mailing a copy to counsel for opposing party, the foot of such notices bearing either acceptance of service or a certificate of counsel in compliance with the Rules of Supreme Cour t of Virginia. Counsel for opposing party shall include a pro se party who (i) has entered a general appearance in person or by filing a pleading or endorsing an order of withdrawal of that partys counsel or (ii) has signed a pleading in the case or who has notified the other parties and the clerk that he appears in the case. 5. In cases where such suits have been commenced, the defendant has been served pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 1 of § 8.01-296, and the defendant has failed to file an answe r to the suit or otherwise appear within the time allowed by law, no further notice to take depositions or conduct an ore tenus hearing is required to be served on the defendant and the court may enter any order or final decree without further notice to the defendant. 6. Costs may be awarded to either party as equity and justice may require. History History.

IV. Admissions of Parties. V. Practice and Procedure. VI. Costs. I.General Consideration. Object of statute.  This section was merely intended to prevent decrees for divorce upon the collusion of the parties, or upon the consent or default of the party charged. Bailey v. Bailey, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 43, 1871 Va. LEXIS 81 (1871) (see Dinsmore v. Dinsmore, 128 Va. 403, 104 S.E. 785 (1920); Raiford v. Raiford, 193 Va. 221, 68 S.E.2d 888 (1952)). Although a circuit court must find authority for divorce in a statute, the statute represents the General Assemblys authorization for circuit courts to fill s tatutory gaps when conducting a divorce suit. Everett v. Tawes, 298 Va. 25, 833 S.E.2d 876, 2019 Va. LEXIS 136 (2019). Differences between suits for divorce and other suits in equity.  This section and § 20-97 show that there are marked differences between suits for divorce and other suits in equity. Among these differences are that the bill shall not be taken for confessed or a divorce granted on the uncorroborated testimony of the parties or either of them, and that, whether the defendant answers or not, the cause shall be heard independently of the admissions of either party in the pleadi ngs or otherwise. Westfall v. Westfall, 196 Va. 97, 82 S.E.2d 487, 1954 Va. LEXIS 205 (1954). Procedure in divorce suits same as other suits in equity.  The process, practice and procedure is the same in suits for divorce as in other proceedings in equity. Bailey v. Bailey, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 43, 1871 Va. LEXIS 81 (1871); Latham v. Latham, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 307, 1878 Va. LEXIS 68 (1878); Hampton v. Hampton, 87 Va. 148, 12 S.E. 340, 1890 Va. LEXIS 104 (1890). In a divorce proceeding commenced by the wife, service of the bill of complaint upon the husbands supervisor was not one of the prescribed methods for serving the bill of complaint; accordingly, the service was invalid and was insufficient to subject the husband to the trial courts jurisdiction. Lee v. Lee, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 516 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 20, 2002). Except bill in divorce suit shall not be taken for confessed.  In suits for divorce the pleadings and rules of evidence are the same as in other suits in equity, except that the bill shall not be taken for confessed, and whet her answered or not shall be heard independently of admissions of either party, and its charges proved by full and clear testimony. Latham v. Latham, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 307, 1878 Va. LEXIS 68 (1878); Throckmorton v. Throckmorton, 86 Va. 768, 11 S.E. 289, 1890 Va. LEXIS 43 (1890); Hampton v. Hampton, 87 Va. 148, 12 S.E. 340, 1890 Va. LEXIS 104 (1890). Jurisdiction of parties gives court jurisdiction of subject matter.  While the requirement that service be by an officer in divorce proceedings may be mandatory and the procedure prescribed a jurisdictional prerequisite, yet circui t courts are given general jurisdiction to hear and determine divorce suits where the parties are brought into court. Where the court has jurisdiction of the parties, it has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the litigation. Scott v. Scott, 142 Va. 31 , 128 S.E. 599, 1925 Va. LEXIS 317 (1925) (decided prior to 1984 amendment). Submission to jurisdiction.  Pursuant to subdivision 4 of § 20-99, the defendant, by submitting an answer, through the plaintiff, to the court, submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. Zedan v. Westheim, 60 Va. App. 556, 729 S.E.2d 785, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 257 (2012). Trial courts obligations in domestic matter when conservator was appo inted, etc.  Upon notification that a husband had died, it was incumbent upon the court to abate the action, transfer the funds in the possession of the conservator to husband s personal representative, in accordance with § 64.1-57.1, and determine the reasonable amount of the conservators fee for which husband was responsible. Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, 44 Va. App. 51, 602 S.E.2d 426, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 454 (20 04). II.Corroboration. The purpose of requiring corroboration of the testimony of a party to a divorce suit is to prevent divorces by collusion. Where it is apparent that there is no collusion, the corroboration needs to be only slight. Forbes v. Forbes, 182 Va. 636, 29 S.E.2d 829, 1944 Va. LEXIS 213 (1944); Graves v. Graves, 193 Va. 659, 70 S.E.2d 339, 1952 Va. LEXIS 177 (1952); Martin v. Martin, 202 Va. 769, 120 S.E.2d 471, 1961 Va. LEXIS 177 (1961); Venable v. Venable, 2 Va. App. 178, 342 S.E.2d 646, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 257 (1986). The main object of the provision of the statute requiring corroboration is to prevent collusion. Collier v. Collier, 2 Va. App. 125, 341 S.E.2d 827, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (1986). Corroboration rests in the facts and circumstances of each case. Only those facts necess ary to the judgment must be supported. Martin v.

In suits fo r divorce, annulment and separate maintenance, and in proceedings arising under subdivision A 3 or subsection L of § 16.1-241, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may, at any time pending a suit pursuant to this chapter, in the discretion of s uch court, make any order that may be proper (i) to compel a spouse to pay any sums necessary for the maintenance and support of the petitioning spouse, including (a) an order that the other spouse provide health care coverage for the petitioning spouse, unless it is shown that such coverage cannot be obtained, or (b) an order that a party pay secured or unsecured debts incurred jointly or by either party, (ii) to enable such spouse to carry on the suit, (iii) to prevent either spouse from imposing any restraint on the personal liberty of the other spouse, (iv) to provide for the custody and maintenance of the minor children of the parties, including an order that either party or both parties provide health care coverage or cash medical support, or bot h, for the children, (v) to provide support, calculated in accordance with § 20-108.2, for any child of the parties to whom a duty of support is owed and to pay or continue to pay support for any child over the age of 18 who meets the requirements set forth in subsection C of § 20-124.2, (vi) for the exclusive use and possession of the family residence during the pendency of the suit, (vii) to preserve the estate of either spouse, so that it be forthcoming to meet any decree which may be made in t he suit, (viii) to compel either spouse to give security to abide such decree, or (ix)(a) to compel a party to maintain any existing policy owned by that party insuring the life of either party or to require a party to name as a beneficiary of the policy the other party or an appropriate person for the exclusive use and benefit of the minor children of the parties and (b) to allocate the premium cost of such life insurance between the parties, provided that all premiums are billed to the policyholder. N othing in clause (ix) shall be construed to create an independent cause of action on the part of any beneficiary against the insurer or to require an insurer to provide information relating to such policy to any person other than the policyholder without the written consent of the policyholder. The parties to any petition where a child whose custody, visitation, or support is contested shall show proof that they have attended within the 12 months prior to their court appearance or that they shall attend within 45 days thereafter an educational seminar or other like program conducted by a qualified person or organization approved by the court except that the court may require the parties to attend such seminar or program in uncontested cases only if the court finds good cause. The seminar or other program shall be a minimum of four hours in length and shall address the effects of separation or divorce on children, parenting responsibilities, options for conflict resolution and financial responsibilitie s. Once a party has completed one educational seminar or other like program, the required completion of additional programs shall be at the courts discretion. Parties under this section shall include natural or adoptive parents of the child, or any p erson with a legitimate interest as defined in § 20-124.1. The fee charged a party for participation in such program shall be based on the partys ability to pay; however, no fee in excess of $50 may be charged. Whenever possible, before participat ing in mediation or alternative dispute resolution to address custody, visitation or support, each party shall have attended the educational seminar or other like program. The court may grant an exemption from attendance of such program for good cause sh own or if there is no program reasonably available. Other than statements or admissions by a party admitting criminal activity or child abuse, no statement or admission by a party in such seminar or program shall be admissible into evidence in any subseq uent proceeding. A1. Any award or order made by the court pursuant to subsection A shall be paid from the post-separation income of the obligor unless the court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise. Upon the request of either party, the court may identify and state in such order or award the specific source from which the financial obligation imposed is to be paid. A2. In any cas e in which the jurisdiction of the juvenile and domestic relations district court has been divested pursuant to § 16.1-244 and no final support order has been entered, any award for child support or spousal support in the circuit court pursuant to sub section A shall be retroactive to the date on which the proceeding was commenced by the filing of the action in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, provided that the petitioner exercised due diligence in the service of the respondent. B. In addition to the terms provided in subsection A, upon a showing by a party of reasonable apprehension of physical harm to that party by such partys family or household member as that term is defined in § 16.1-228, and consistent with rules of the Supreme C ourt of Virginia, the court may enter an order excluding that partys family or household member from the jointly owned or jointly rented family dwelling. In any case where an order is entered under this paragraph, pursuant to an ex parte hearing, the order shall not exclude a family or household member from the family dwelling for a period in excess of 15 days from the date the order is served, in person, upon the person so excluded. The order may provide for an extension of time beyond the 15 days, to become effective automatically. The person served may at any time file a written motion in the clerks office requesting a hearing to dissolve or modify the order. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the court from extending an order entered under this subsection for such longer period of time as is deemed appropriate, after a hearing on notice to the parties. If the party subject to the order fails to appear at this hearing, the court may extend the order for a period not to e xceed six months. C. In cases ot her than those for divorce in which a custody or visitation arrangement for a minor child is sought, the court may enter an order providing for custody, visitation or maintenance pending the suit as provided in subsection A. The order shall be directed t o either parent or any person with a legitimate interest who is a party to the suit. D. Orders ente red pursuant to this section which provide for custody or visitation arrangements pending the suit shall be made in accordance with the standards set out in Chapter 6.1 (§ 20-124.1 et seq.). Orders entered pursuant to subsection B shall be certified b y the clerk and forwarded as soon as possible to the local police department or sheriffs office which shall, on the date of receipt, enter the name of the person subject to the order and other appropriate information required by the Department of Sta te Police into the Virginia crime information network system established and maintained by the Department of State Police pursuant to Chapter 2 (§ 52-12 et seq.) of Title 52. If the order is later dissolved or modified, a copy of the dissolution or mo dification shall also be certified, forwarded and entered in the system as described above. E. There shall be a presumption in any judicial proceeding for pendente lite spousal support and maintenance under this section that the amount of the award that would result from the application of the formula set forth in this section is the correct amount of spousa l support to be awarded. The court may deviate from the presumptive amount as provided in subsection H. F. If the cour t is determining both an award of pendente lite spousal support and maintenance and an award of child support, the court shall first make a determination of the amount of the award of pendente lite spousal support, if any, owed by one party to the other under this section. G. If the part ies have minor children in common, the presumptive amount of an award of pendente lite spousal support and maintenance shall be the difference between 26 percent of the payor spouses monthly gross income and 58 percent of the payee spouses monthl y gross income. If the parties have no minor children in common, the presumptive amount of the award shall be the difference between 27 percent of the payor spouses monthly gross income and 50 percent of the payee spouses monthly gross income. Fo r the purposes of this section, monthly gross income shall have the same meaning as it does in section § 20-108.2. H. The court m ay deviate from the presumptive amount for good cause shown, including any relevant evidence relating to the parties current financial circumstances or the impact of any tax exemption and any credits resulting from such exemptions that indicates the presumptive amount is inappropriate. I. The presump tive formula set forth in this section shall only apply to cases where the parties combined monthly gross income does not exceed $10,000. J. An order en tered pursuant to this section shall have no presumptive effect and shall not be determinative when adjudicating the underlying cause. History History.

CASE NOTES Prescribed procedure is valid.  If this section is followed a divorce so procured is just as valid and binding as if procured on personal service. Taylor v. Taylor, 159 Va. 338, 165 S.E. 414, 19 32 Va. LEXIS 201 (1932). Difference between Virginia and Nevada law.  See Humphreys v. Humphreys, 139 Va. 146, 123 S.E. 554, 1924 Va. LEXIS 92 (1924). When notice of taking of depositions dispensed with.  A nonresident respondent in a suit for divorce upon whom a copy of the bill has been served, accompanied by proof of service, and who does not appear within the p eriod allowed is not entitled to notice of taking of depositions unless the court orders notice. Owens v. Owens, 197 Va. 681, 90 S.E.2d 776, 1956 Va. LEXIS 139 (1956). Notice of taking depositions is required in all divorce cases except where defendant is proceeded against by order of publication, or its equivalent and fails to appear. It is one of those procedural steps to which careful scrutiny must be afforded. Where such a notice is required, it should clearly appear from the record, that proper notic e was served, or was accepted by the opposite party, or was waived by him. Mackey v. Mackey, 203 Va. 526, 125 S.E.2d 194, 1962 Va. LEXIS 179 (1962). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Notice requirements.  Due process notice requirements differed depending on the nature of the underlying proceedings. So, since the husband was unable to make service by posting, the c ourt could still exercise jurisdiction to award a divorce decree upon notice by publication and by default under §§ 8.01-296 and 20-104, but could not exercise in personam jurisdiction to adjudicate issues of support, custody, equitable distributio n, or counsel fees under § 20-99. Nicoli v. Nicoli, 67 Va. Cir. 157, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 170 (Loudoun County Mar. 9, 2005). Venue.  Trial court, in a divorce suit, refused to accept husbands deposition evidence that was taken before service upon the husbands wife was completed and in a venue other than the one in which the suit was filed or any of the parties resided or was employed, despite the wifes signed acknowledgment of a waiver of her rights.

Text Orders of publication as provided for in § 20-104 in any two or more suits for annulment or divorce may be combined into a single order to be published as required b y law; provided that, at such time as the clerk may direct the plaintiff in each case shall pay to the clerk a pro rata share of the expense of such publication.

In any suit for divorce, the trial court may require the whole or any part of the testimony to be given orally in open court, and if either party desires it, such testimony and the rulings of the court on the exceptions thereto, if any, shall be reduced to writing, and the judge shall certify that such evidence was given before him and such rulings made. When so certified the same shall stand on the same footing as a deposition regularly taken in the cause, provided, however, that no such oral evidence shall be gi ven or heard unless and until after such notice to the adverse party as is required by law to be given of the taking of depositions, or when there has been no service of process within the Commonwealth upon, or appearance by the defendant against whom su ch testimony is sought to be introduced. However, a party may proceed to take evidence in support of a divorce by deposition or affidavit without leave of court only in support of a divorce on the grounds set forth in subdivision A (9) of § 20-91, whe re (i) the parties have resolved all issues by a written settlement agreement, (ii) there are no issues other than the grounds of the divorce itself to be adjudicated, or (iii) the adverse party has been personally served with the complaint and has faile d to file a responsive pleading or to make an appearance as required by law.

If either party is incarcerated, neither party shall submit evidence by affidavit without leave of court or the consent in writing of the guardian ad litem for the incarcerated party, or of the incarcerated party if a guardian ad litem is not required pursuant to § 8.01-9. The affidavit shall: 1. Give factual support to the grounds for divorce stated in the complaint or counterclaim, including that the parties are over the age of 18 and not suffering from any condition that renders either party legally incompetent; 2. Verify whether either party is incarcerated; 3. Verify the military status of the opposing party and advise whether the opposing party has filed an answer or a waiver of his rights under the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ( 50 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq.); 4.

CASE NOTES Object of statute.  The provision of this section, putting the certified evidence on the same footing as a deposition, could not have been intended to deprive the trial c ourt of the chief benefit conferred upon it by that section  that of seeing the witnesses and hearing them testify. The judge was to hear the case and decide it on its merits, independently of the admissions of either party in the pleadings or ot herwise, and, in order to reach a righteous judgment, the statute, for the first time in this State, conferred upon the court the right to require the whole or any part of the testimony to be given orally in open court. The object of the stat ute was not to save costs to the parties, nor to keep the testimony from the permanent files of the court, but to give the court the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses. The right to have oral testimony in open court is not conferred upon the parties, but upon the court, and it could only have been for the reasons stated. Barnard v. Barnard, 132 Va. 155, 111 S.E. 227, 1922 Va. LEXIS 14 (1922). Procedure should conform to that in common-law actions.  Nethers v. Nethers, 160 Va. 335, 168 S.E. 428, 1933 Va. LEXIS 213 (1933). Exceptions to general rule that court may require oral testimony in open court.  Subsection A of § 20-106 establishes as a general proposition that a trial court may require that testimony be given orally, in open court, and then provides e xceptions to that rule, by allowing a party to rely on depositions or affidavits without obtaining leave of court where: (1) under clause (i) of subsection A of § 20-106, the divorce is based on the grounds set forth in subdivision A 9 of § 20-91 a nd the parties have resolved all issues by a written settlement agreement; and (2) under clause (ii) of subsection A of § 20-106, there are no issues other than the grounds of the divorce itself to be adjudicated. Cruz v. Cruz, 62 Va. App. 31, 741 S.E .2d 71, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 138 (2013). Exceptions in clauses (ii) and (iii) of subsection A did not apply.  Exceptions to the general rule in subsection A of § 20-106 that a trial court could require that testimony be given orally, in open court set forth in clause ( i) of subsection A of § 20-106 did not apply as the parties had not entered into a separation agreement; the exception in clause (ii) of subsection A of § 20-106 did not apply as there were issues other than the grounds of the divorce itself to be adjudicated since the husband asserted that the parties marriage was void ab initio since the wife was married to someone else at the time. Cruz v. Cruz, 62 Va. App. 31, 741 S.E.2d 71, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 138 (2013). Time of reducing exceptions to writi ng.  Where it was contended that as this section prescribes no time in which the exceptions mentioned and the oral testimony shall be reduced to writing and certified, the same might be done at any time within the appealable period, and if and when so certified it becomes a deposition regularly taken in the cause, it was held that there was no merit in this contention.

However, the court may make such an award notwithstanding the existence of such ground if the court determines from clear and convincing evidence, that a denial of support and maintenance would constitute a manifest injustice, based upon the respect ive degrees of fault during the marriage and the relative economic circumstances of the parties. C. The court, in its discretion, may decree that maintenance and support of a spouse be made in periodic payments for a defined duration, or in periodic payments for an undefined duration, or in a lump sum award, or in any combination thereof. D. In addition to or in lieu of an award pursuant to subsection C, the court may reserve the right of a party to receive support in the future. In any case in which the right to support is so reserved, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the reservation will continue for a period equal to 50 percent of the length of time between the date of the marriage and the date of separation. Once granted, the duration of such a reservation shall not be subject to modification. Unless otherwise provided by stipulation o r contract executed on or after July 1, 2020, or unless otherwise ordered by the court on or after July 1, 2020, a party seeking to exercise his right to support so reserved shall be required to prove a material change of circumstances as a prerequisite for the court to consider exercise of such reservation. E. The court, in determining whether to award support and maintenance for a spouse, shall consider the circumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage, specifically including adultery and any other ground for divorce under the provisions of subdivision A (3) or (6) of § 20-91 or § 20-95. In determining the nature, amount and duration of an award pursuant to this section, the court shall consider the following: 1. The o bligations, needs and financial resources of the parties, including but not limited to income from all pension, profit sharing or retirement plans, of whatever nature; 2. The standard of living established during the marriage; 3. The duration of the marriage; 4. The age and physical and mental condition of the parties and any special circumstances of the family; 5. The extent to which the age, physical or mental condition or special circumstances of any child of the parties would make it appropriate that a party not seek employment outside of the home; 6. The contributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family; 7. The property interests of the parties, both real and personal, tangible and intangible; 8. The provisions made with regard to the marital property under § 20-107.3; 9. The earning capacity, including the skills, education and training of the parties and the present employment opportunities for persons possessing such earning capacity; 10. The opportunity for, ability of, and the time and costs involved for a party to acquire the appropriate education, training and employment to obtain the skills needed to enhance his earning ability; 11. The decisions regarding employment, career, economics, education and parenting arrangements made by the parties during the marriage and their effect on present and future earning po tential, including the length of time one or both of the parties have been absent from the job market; 12. The extent to which either party has contributed to the attainment of education, training, career position or profession of the other party; and 13. Such other factors, including the tax consequences to each party and the circumstances and factors that contributed to the dissolution, specifically including any ground for divorce , as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties. F. In conteste d cases in the circuit courts, any order granting, reserving or denying a request for spousal support shall be accompanied by written findings and conclusions of the court identifying the factors in subsection E which support the courts order. Any or der granting or reserving any request for spousal support shall state whether the retirement of either party was contemplated by the court and specifically considered by the court in making its award, and, if so, the order shall state the facts the court contemplated and specifically considered as to the retirement of the party. If the court awards periodic support for a defined duration, such findings shall identify the basis for the nature, amount and duration of the award and, if appropriate, a speci fication of the events and circumstances reasonably contemplated by the court which support the award. G. For purpose s of this section and § 20-109, date of separation means the earliest date at which the parties are physically separated and at least one party intends such separation to be permanent provided the separation is continuous thereafter and de fined duration means a period of time (i) with a specific beginning and ending date or (ii) specified in relation to the occurrence or cessation of an event or condition other than death or termination pursuant to § 20-110. H. Where there are no minor children whom the parties have a mutual duty to support, an order directing the payment of spousal support, including those orders confirming separation agreements, entered on or after October 1, 1985, whether they are original orders or mo difications of existing orders, shall contain the following: 1. If kn own, the name, date of birth, and social security number of each party and, unless otherwise ordered, each partys residential and, if different, mailing address, residential and employer telephone number, and number appearing on a drivers license or other document issued under Chapter 3 (§ 46.2-300 et seq.) of Title 46.2 or the comparable law of another jurisdiction, and the name and address of each partys employer; however, when a protective order has been issued or the court otherwise f inds reason to believe that a party is at risk of physical or emotional harm from the other party, information other than the name of the party at risk shall not be included in the order; 2. The amount of periodic spousal support expressed in fixed sums, together with the payment interval, the date payments are due, and the date the first payment is due; 3. A statement as to whether there is an order for health care coverage for a party; 4. If support arrearages exist, (i) to whom an arrearage is owed and the amount of the arrearage, (ii) the period of time for which such arrearage is calculated, and (iii) a direction tha t all payments are to be credited to current spousal support obligations first, with any payment in excess of the current obligation applied to arrearages; 5. If spousal support payments are ordered to be paid directly to the obligee, and unless the court for good cause shown orders otherwise, the parties shall give each other and the court at least 30 days written notice, in advance, of any change of address and any change of telephone number within 30 days after the change; and 6. Notice that in determination of a spousal support obligation, the support obligation as it becomes due and unpaid creates a judgment by operation of law.

Procedural Matters. B. Material Change of Circumstances. C. Agreements Between Parties. I.General Consideration. This section expressly gives the court the continuing jurisdi ction to change or modify its decree. This section expressly gives the court the continuing jurisdiction to change or modify its decree as to the custody and maintenance of minor children. Kern v. Lindsey, 182 Va. 775, 30 S.E.2d 707, 1944 Va. LEXIS 232 (1944) (see Morris v. Henry, 193 Va. 631, 70 S.E.2d 417 (1952); DeMott v. DeMott, 198 Va. 22, 92 S.E.2d 342 (1956); Hammers v. Hammers, 216 Va. 30, 216 S.E.2d 20 (1975)). The trial judge may, from time to time, on petition of either of the parents, or upon its own motion, revise and alter its decrees concerning the care, custody, a nd maintenance of children and make a new decree concerning such matters as the circumstances of the parents and the benefit of the children may require. Orms v. Orms, No. 1407-86-4 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 10, 1988). A trial court has continuing jurisdiction to modify child and spousal support upon finding that a material change in circumstances warrants modification. Deane v. Deane, No. 2347-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals July 20, 1999). The trial court is required to consider all of the factors set forth in subsection E.  Because the trial court incorporated the parties marital agreement into the final decree of divorce, it was subject to modification. Potas v. Potas, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 339 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2017). Trial courts discretion as to effective date.  The legislatures use of the word may in this section indicates that the decision whether to make a modification effective as of the date of notice of the petition to the opposing party rests within the discretion of the trial court. Howard v. Howard, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 518 (Va. Ct. App. July 18, 2000). Effectiv e date of modification.  Trial court had the authority, pursuant to § 20-108, to modify a child support order on the fathers motion. However, it erred in modifying the support orde r retroactive to the date when the petition was filed because the mother was not given notice of the motion until over eight months later. The effective date of the modification should have been no earlier than the date the mother was given notice. Barre tt v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 246 (Va. Ct. App. July 26, 2011). Ef fect of custody change on support.  Nothing in this section authorizes an automatic termination of support upon change in custody. Baldwin v. Commonwealth, Dept of Social Servs. ex rel. Martin, No. 2122-96-3 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 15, 1997). Transfer not divestment of continuing jurisdiction.  A transfer of any other matters pertaining to support and maintenance . . . and custody to the juvenile and domestic relations district court purs uant to subsection (c) of § 20-79 conveys concurrent jurisdiction on the juvenile and domestic relations district court to hear those matters, but the transfer does not divest the circuit court of its continuing jurisdiction to consider those issues, should it exercise its discretion to do so. Accordingly, the circuit court had the authority to reinstate the case on its docket and to consider the motions to modify child support and visitation. Crabtree v. Crabtree, 17 Va. App. 81, 435 S.E.2d 883, 10 Va. Law Rep. 331, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 449 (1993). Courts authority.  By granting the father sole discretion to consent to supervised visitation between the mother and the children with a supervisor of the fathers choice if the father believed that the mother was appropriate and would not cause harm to the children, the trial court abdicated its statutory power, and duty, to determine visitation. The trial court also limited its own ability to provide for modification of the de cree if the father were to withhold visitation, as the father arguably could not withhold something that was in his sole discretion to give. Rainey v. Rainey, 74 Va. App. 359, 869 S.E.2d 66, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 56 (2022). Contract between parents cannot prevent court from exercising power.  A contract between the husband and wife cannot prevent the court from exercising power under this section. Hammers v. Hammers, 216 Va. 30, 216 S.E.2d 20, 1975 Va. LEXIS 246 (1975). The emancipation of a child does not constitute an exception to Virginias decisional law that precludes the court from ordering modification of support prospe ctively and without its approval. When an undivided child support award has been made for multiple minor children, the emancipation of a child, except the last remaining in custody, thus does not permit automatic termination or modification of support. S houp v. Shoup, 34 Va. App. 347, 542 S.E.2d 9, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 88, different results reached on reh'g, 37 Va. App. 240, 556 S.E.2d 783, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 704 (2001). This power cannot be taken away by a contract made between their parents; nor can it be rendered nugatory by the device of making only a single provision for the support and maintenance of the wife and child, without definition of their several rights. Gloth v. Gloth, 154 Va. 511, 153 S.E. 879, 1930 Va. LEXIS 232 (1930).

Upon petiti on of either party the court may increase, decrease, or terminate the amount or duration of any spousal support and maintenance that may thereafter accrue, whether previously or hereafter awarded, as the circumstances may make proper. Upon order of the c ourt based upon clear and convincing evidence that the spouse receiving support has been habitually cohabiting with another person in a relationship analogous to a marriage for one year or more commencing on or after July 1, 1997, the court shall termina te spousal support and maintenance unless (i) otherwise provided by stipulation or contract or (ii) the spouse receiving support proves by a preponderance of the evidence that termination of such support would be unconscionable. The provisions of this su bsection shall apply to all orders and decrees for spousal support, regardless of the date of the suit for initial setting of support, the date of entry of any such order or decree, or the date of any petition for modification of support. B. The court m ay consider a modification of an award of spousal support for a defined duration upon petition of either party filed within the time covered by the duration of the award. Upon consideration of the factors set forth in subsection E of § 20-107.1, the c ourt may increase, decrease or terminate the amount or duration of the award upon finding that (i) there has been a material change in the circumstances of the parties, not reasonably in the contemplation of the parties when the award was made or (ii) an event which the court anticipated would occur during the duration of the award and which was significant in the making of the award, does not in fact occur through no fault of the party seeking the modification. The provisions of this subsection shall a pply only to suits for initial spousal support orders filed on or after July 1, 1998, and suits for modification of spousal support orders arising from suits for initial support orders filed on or after July 1, 1998. C. In suits fo r divorce, annulment and separate maintenance, and in proceedings arising under subdivision A 3 or subsection L of § 16.1-241, if a stipulation or contract signed by the party to whom such relief might otherwise be awarded is filed before entry of a f inal decree, no decree or order directing the payment of support and maintenance for the spouse, suit money, or counsel fee or establishing or imposing any other condition or consideration, monetary or nonmonetary, shall be entered except in accordance w ith that stipulation or contract. If such a stipulation or contract is filed after entry of a final decree and if any party so moves, the court shall modify its decree to conform to such stipulation or contract. No request for modification of spousal sup port based on a material change in circumstances or the terms of stipulation or contract shall be denied solely on the basis of the terms of any stipulation or contract that is executed on or after July 1, 2018, unless such stipulation or contract expres sly states that the amount or duration of spousal support is non-modifiable. D. Unless othe rwise provided by stipulation or contract, spousal support and maintenance shall terminate upon the death of either party or remarriage of the spouse receiving support. The spouse entitled to support shall have an affirmative duty to notify the payor spo use immediately of remarriage at the last known address of the payor spouse. E. For purpose s of the modification of an award of spousal support, and without precluding the ability of a party to otherwise file for a modification of spousal support based upon any other material change in circumstances, the payor spouses attainment of full re tirement age shall be considered a material change in circumstances. For the purposes of this subsection, full retirement age means the normal retirement age at which a person is eligible to receive full retirement benefits under the federal Soci al Security Act, but full retirement age does not mean early retirement age as defined under the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 416, as amended). F. In an actio n for the increase, decrease, or termination of spousal support based on the retirement of the payor spouse pursuant to subsection E, where the court finds that there has been a material change in circumstances, the court shall determine whether any modi fication or termination of such spousal support should be granted. In making such determination, the court may consider the factors set forth in subsection E of § 20-107.1 and shall consider the following factors: 1. Wheth er retirement was contemplated by the court and specifically considered by the court when the spousal support was awarded; 2. Whether the retirement is mandatory or voluntary, and the terms and conditions related to such retirement; 3. Whether the retirement would result in a change in the income of either the payor or the payee spouse; 4. The age and health of the parties; 5. The duration and amount of spousal support already paid; and 6. The assets or property interest of each of the parties during the period from the date of the support order and up to the date of the hearing on modification or termination.The provisi ons of this subsection (i) shall be subject to the provisions regarding stipulations or contracts as set forth in subsection C, and (ii) shall not apply to a contract or stipulation that is non-modifiable.The provisions of this subsection and subsection E shall apply to suits for modification or termination of spousal support orders regardless of the date of the suit for initial setting of support or the date of entry of any such order or decree. G. In any acti on for the increase, decrease, or termination of spousal support, if the court finds that there has been a material change in circumstances, the court may consider the factors set forth in subsection E of § 20-107.1 and subsection F of this section in making its determination as to whether any modification or termination of such support should be granted. The court shall further consider the assets or property interest of each of the parties from the date of the support order and up to the time of th e hearing on modification or termination, and any income generated from the asset or property interest. Any order granting or denying a request for the modification or termination of spousal support shall be accompanied by written findings and conclusion s of the court identifying the factors set forth in subsection E of § 20-107.1 and subsection F of this section that support the courts order.

Divorce and Alimony, §§ 58.2, 71. CASE NOTES Editors note. Many of the cases cited below were decided under this section as it existed prior to the 1975 amendment. Alimony (now maintenance and support) shall cease upon remarriage of the recipient. Brown v. Commissioner, 415 F.2d 310, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 10892 (4th Cir. 1969). But court may not eliminate child support payments required by contract.  The fact that the chancellor (now judge) in the a mensa et thoro decree ordered the husband to pay the sum required by the contract and that the a vinculo matrimo nii decree ratified, confirmed and incorporated the contract did not give the court jurisdiction to eliminate the child support payments because of the remarriage of the wife. The directive to pay pursuant to the terms of the agreement only meant the cou rt could use its contempt power to enforce the agreement. McLoughlin v. McLoughlin, 211 Va. 365, 177 S.E.2d 781, 1970 Va. LEXIS 252 (1970). Where a divorced wife enters into a subsequent, voidable marriage, she thereby forfeits her right to alimony (now maintenance and support) from her former husband. McConkey v. McConkey, 216 Va. 106, 215 S.E.2d 640, 1975 Va. LEXIS 255 (1975). Annulment of voidable second marriage does not entitle wife to reinstatement of alimony (now maintenance and support) payments from first husband, where there is a statute providing that alimony (now maintenance and support) shall terminate upon the recipients remarriage. McConkey v. McConkey, 216 Va. 106, 215 S.E.2d 640, 1975 Va. LEXIS 255 (1975). Remittances after wifes remarriage were not income.  Because Virginia law had discharged the husband of a further accounting for alimony (now maintenance and support), and there was no property settlement or like wr itten instrument, the remittances after the wifes remarriage were not pursuant to a legal obligation and thus were not income to the wife. Brown v. Commissioner, 415 F.2d 310, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 10892 (4th Cir. 1969). A divorce decree which approved the contract between the parties but did not incorporate the contract or order the husband to perform its obligations, was not an award of alimony (now maintenance and support). Rather, the decree was an approval of a private, bilateral contract based upon mutual consideration for payments in lieu of alimony. Like other private contracts, such contracts may not be impaired by legislative enactment. Shoosmith v. Scott, 217 Va. 789, 232 S.E.2d 787, 1977 Va.

CASE NOTES This section is cognate with former § 20-107, and the two sections should be read and considered together. Smith v. Smith, 200 Va. 77, 104 S.E.2d 17, 1958 Va. LEXIS 161 (1958). This section takes effect upon the entry of a decree of divorce and affects interests in property owned by the parties at that time and it has no effect upon property acquired subsequent to final divorce. Gant v. Gant, 237 Va. 588, 379 S.E.2d 331, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2322, 1989 Va. LEXIS 65 (1989). Court held without authority to allot wife greater share in jointly-owned property.  Where the property rights of the parties were determined under this section, the trial court had no authority to arbitrarily order that the wife be allotted a gre ater share in the jointly-owned property than that fixed by statute, on account of her greater contribution to the purchase price, or to direct the transfer of any specific property of the husband to her. Equitable principles do not require the return of a gift voluntarily made by a wife to her husband, who was the natural object of her bounty at the time of her gift. Smith v. Smith, 200 Va. 77, 104 S.E.2d 17, 1958 Va. LEXIS 161 (1958). The central characteristic of a tenancy in common is simply that each tenant is deemed t o own by himself, with most of the attributes of individual ownership, a physically undivided part of the entire parcel. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 211 Va. 797, 180 S.E.2d 516, 1971 Va. LEXIS 268 (1971). Responsibi lity of cotenants for taxes and other liens.  Unless something more can be shown than the mere fact that one cotenant is in possession of the premises, each cotenant should be ratably responsible for taxes an d other liens against the property. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 211 Va. 797, 180 S.E.2d 516, 1971 Va. LEXIS 268 (1971). Cotenant who discharges an encumbrance upon common property is entitled to ratable contribution from his cotenant. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 211 Va. 797, 180 S.E.2d 516, 1971 Va. LEXIS 268 (1971). Non-occupying spouse may receive rental value share for post-divorce occupancy.  Where upon their divorce, the parties owned marital residence as tenants in common, and husband was required to bear his share of the financial burden of owning t he property, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding husband one-half of the reasonable rental value of the marital home for the period it was occupied exclusively by wife following their divorce. Ashley v. Ashley, No. 0851-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 30, 1993). Failure to preserve issue for review.  Where the parties failed to preserve or brief an issue for appellate review, under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18, the appellate court did not consider whether the husband s fathers one-third undivided interest in the parties marital residence passed by devise under the fathers will or passed in equal shares, to the husband and wife, upon the fathers death, as tenants in common, pursuant to § 20-111, by virtue of the joint survivorship under the grantee clause of the deed. Binhammer v. Reilly, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2003). Illustrative cases.  The lien of a child support judgment docketed after couples divorce had priority over a recorded deed of trust on entirety property executed solely by the hus band prior to the divorce, despite the banks argument that the entry of the divorce decree, in conjunction with the application of § 55-52 (the after-acquired property doctrine), transformed the banks interest into a viable lien, as the bank s deed of trust with respect to the property was void as to wife and children. Hausman v. Hausman, 233 Va. 1, 353 S.E.2d 710, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1835, 1987 Va. LEXIS 164 (1987). Where statute extinguished the tenancy by the entirety and all contingent rights in the home, including the right of survivorship, and the divorce decree awarded debtor sole ownership of the fee simple interest in the marital home, and where debtors divorce occurred within 180 days of the filing of her bankruptcy petition, her fee simple interest in the home became property of the bankruptcy estate. Cordova v . Mayer, 73 F.3d 38, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 355 (4th Cir. 1996). Where the wifes conduct delayed the sale of the marital residence, thereby allegedly causing the husband to make additional payments on the property, includin g the mortgage for which the husband was solely responsible, the husband, as tenant in common pursuant to § 20-111, was entitled under § 8.01-31 to an evidentiary hearing as to whether the husband was entitled to contribution from the wife, who was ratably responsible for the propertys costs. Morris v. Morris, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 447 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 2004). Trial court erred in classifying a house as marital property because pursuant to § 20-111, upon dissolution of the marriage, the husband and wife owned the hom e as tenants in common; because the husbands undivided one-half interest in the house was acquired prior to the marriage, it was separate property under § 20-107.3, but the one-half interest the wife owned upon the divorce and obtained by the husb and after the marriage was presumptively marital property under § 20-107.3, and it could not be determined from the record the exact manner by which the husband acquired the wifes half-interest in the home. Pratt v. Pratt, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 21, 2012). Where married parties names were both on a deed to real estate, the trial courts final decree of divorce resulted in the parties ownership of the prop erty being converted to tenants in common pursuant to § 20-111. Patron v. Furtado, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 382 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 27, 2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Non-occupying spouse may receive rental value share for post-divorce occupancy.  When a husband and wife divorced, their marital home, which they had owned as tenants by the entirety, became their property as tenants in common, and fell within the scope of § 8.01-31, requiring the husband to account for one-half the fair rental value of the property, as he maintained exclusive control of it. Shaio Hon Yang Yeh v. Guang Huei Yeh, 56 Va. Cir. 439, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 485 (Roanoke Sept. 24, 2 001). Illustrative cases.  Language of a deed of gift was clear, unambiguous, and explicit and showed the intent of a husband to jointly title the marital residence, as well as the donative intent of the husband in making the transfer because that deed made the husband and wife owners of the real estate as tenants by the entireties with the right of survivorship as at common law, and the husband gave one half of the real estate to the wife at that time; as a result of the divorce, the parties each owned a one-half undivided interest in the real estate as tenants in common, without survivorship, pursuant to § 20-111. Gleason v. Gleason, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 34 (Roanoke County Feb. 3, 200 9). § 20-111.1. Revocation of death benefits by divorce or annulment. Text A. Except as o therwise provided under federal law or law of this Commonwealth, upon the entry of a decree of annulment or divorce from the bond of matrimony on and after July 1, 1993, any revocable beneficiary designation contained in a then existing written contract owned by one party that provides for the payment of any death benefit to the other party is revoked. A death benefit prevented from passing to a former spouse by this section shall be paid as if the former spouse had predeceased the decedent. The payor o f any death benefit shall be discharged from all liability upon payment in accordance with the terms of the contract providing for the death benefit, unless the payor receives written notice of a revocation under this section prior to payment. B. The term death benefit includes any payments under a life insurance contract, annuity, retirement arrangement, compensation agreement or other contract designating a beneficiary of any right, property or money in the form of a death benefit. C. This sectio n shall not apply (i) to the extent a decree of annulment or divorce from the bond of matrimony, or a written agreement of the parties provides for a contrary result as to specific death benefits, or (ii) to any trust or any death benefit payable to or u nder any trust. D. If this sec tion is preempted by federal law with respect to the payment of any death benefit, a former spouse who, not for value, receives the payment of any death benefit that the former spouse is not entitled to under this section is personally liable for the amo unt of the payment to the person who would have been entitled to it...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_20-112"><akn:num>§ 20-112</akn:num><akn:heading>Notice when proceedings reopened</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When the proceedings are reopened to increase, decrease or terminate maintenance and support for a spouse or for a child, or to request additional orders to effectuate previous orders entered pursuant to § 20-107.3, the petitioning party shall give such notice to the other party by service of process or by order of publication as is required by law. Except as provided by § 20-110, no support order may be retroact ively modified, but may be modified with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification in any court, but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given to the responding party.

CASE NOTES The provisions of this section are of no aid to a party seeking restitution for spousal support paid pursuant to an order later reversed. Indeed, the provisions contradict the existence of implied authority to grant such relief. Reid v. Reid, 245 Va. 409, 429 S.E.2d 208, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1207, 1993 Va. LEXIS 60 (1993). Parties cannot contractually modify the terms of a support order without the courts approval. Moreover, the trial judge had no authority to modify retroactively spousal support as awarded by a decree from the court. Dolan v. Dolan, No. 0925-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 27, 1994). Child support payments required under a valid court order become vested as they accrue, and the court is without authority to make any change as to past due installments. Commonwealth, Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Comptroller v. Skeens, 18 Va. App. 154, 442 S.E.2d 432, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1126, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1994). Although a court may not retroactively modify a child support obligation, allowing a pay or spouse credit for nonconforming support payments, in the limited situations where permitted, is not a modification of a support order. Commonwealth, Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Comptroller v. Skeens, 18 Va. App. 154, 442 S.E.2d 432, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1126, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1994). Period for which there may be retroactive modification of support order.  By enacting this section, the legislature specifically addressed and provided for retroactive modification of spousal support orders when proceedings are reopened to increase, decrease or terminate maintenance and support for a spouse or for a child, but only with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification, and only from the date that notice of a pending petition for modificat ion has been given to the responding party. Folkes v. Folkes, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 654 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 19, 2000). Where this section provides that no support order may be retroactively modified, but may be modified with respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification, there was no evidence that the parties agreed that father would no longer make child support payments, and where the agreement to pay $100 per mont h in child support was expressly set out in the final divorce decree, even though the children had been living with father for over a year at the time the decree was entered, then no relief to father could be given. Bacon v. Bacon, No. 1820-95-4 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 19, 1996). Child support not retroactivel y modified.  Because the circuit court lacked in personam jurisdiction at the time it entered the divorce decree, the order of child support was a complete nullity and was voi d from the time of entry; consequently, the circuit court could not, and did not, retroactively modify child support. Evans v. Evans, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 208 (Va. Ct. App. July 21, 2020), aff'd, 300 Va. 134, 860 S.E.2d 381, 2021 Va. LEXIS 84 (2021). Finality of support orders.  Statute only requires that support orders address arrearages, not overages, and where a decrease in spousal support is warranted, the statute clearly allows a ret roactive adjustment to support. Shell v. Davis, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 102 (Va. Ct. App. June 29, 2021). Reconsideration of award of pendente lite support.  Statute does not apply to motions to reconsider an award of pendente lite spousal support in a pending case; a pendente lite order is not final, it is subject to modification while the circuit court retains jurisdiction over the case, and if a pendente lite award is still in effect and subject to modification, the proceedings are open and ongoing. Everett v. Tawes, 298 Va. 25, 833 S.E.2d 876, 2019 Va. LEX IS 136 (2019). Suspension of support payments based on changed circumstances.  Because the trial court had the authority to suspend a husbands payments during the period pending its ruling on modification, as well as to require him to ma ke these payments pending its decision, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the modification reducing the amount of support. Pappas v. Pappas, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 391 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 2004). Modification extended too far.  The trial court was prohibited by this section from retroactively modifying the district courts support order prior to February 8, 1992 where a petition for m odification had been pending in that court only since February 8, 1992. Kaplan v. Kaplan, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 420 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 1993). Date of modification.  Statute forbade the circuit court from modifying the husbands support obligation to a date any earlier than the date he served the wife with the modification motion. Miller v. Green, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 201 (Va. Ct. App. June 23, 2015). Termination of support as of hearing proper.  Trial court did not err in holding that termination of a former husbands spousal support obligation would be the date of the hearing pursuant to § 20-112 b ecause the trial court noted that the former husband had been litigious, had been unsuccessful, and had made the former wife incur significant attorneys fees. Dickover v. Seaton, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 121 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2012). Social security payments.  The payment of money to the childs custodian in the form of social security payments is an indirect payment from the obligor parent for which the parent shoul d receive credit. Commonwealth, Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Comptroller v. Skeens, 18 Va. App. 154, 442 S.E.2d 432, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1126, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1994). Whether a trial court elects to credit all or a portion of social security payments against a court-ordered support obligation should depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to the extent to which the original support award was sufficient or deficient in meeting the childs needs, or the parents abilities t o provide support independent of the social security payments, and whether both parents have acted in good faith. Commonwealth, Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Comptroller v. Skeens, 18 Va. App. 154, 442 S.E.2d 432, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1126, 1994 Va. App. LEX IS 204 (1994). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Retroactive mo dification allowed because of fraud.  Retroactive adjustment of temporary child and spousal support awards to wife were warranted, even though retroactive modification appeared at first glance to be f orbidden by statute, as husbands commission of an intrinsic fraud on the court by, inter alia, underreporting his annual income, providing income tax returns that did not contain reliable information, and reporting unrealistic figures, authorized the trial court to retroactively adjust those awards to prevent a manifest injustice from occurring, especially since the evidence viewed without the fraud showed that the husband had an ability to pay increased support. Moorman v. Moorman, 62 Va. Cir. 497, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 276 (Roanoke Sept. 17, 2003). Period f or which child support payments may be modified.  Child support payments may only be modified for the period after a petition for modification has been filed, thus a circuit court had no authority to modify any c hild-support payment that vested before the date a father filed his petition for modification. Poyo v. Kozlow, 63 Va. Cir. 328, 2003 Va. Cir.

In addition, the court may enter a qualified domestic relations order or other order for the purpose of enforcing a support order by attaching or garnishing any pension, profit-sharing, or deferred compensation plan or retire ment benefits pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code or other applicable federal laws. The court may revise and alter its decree as to the child or support and maintenance of the spouse, and grant leave to the petitioner to proceed in the ap propriate juvenile and domestic relations district court in conformity with any applicable law; or it may, at the application of any party or on its own motion certify its final order granting support of the child or support and maintenance of the spouse to such juvenile and domestic relations district court for enforcement of collection as though such order had been made in such juvenile and domestic relations district court, in accordance with § 20-79 (c).

Section seems simi lar in language to § 18.2-456 (5).  This section seems similar in language to the applicable section of the Virginia criminal contempt statute, § 18.2-456 (5). Gowen v. Wilkerson, 364 F. Supp. 10 43, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11697 (W.D. Va. 1973). A contempt proceeding for failing to pay alimony (now support and maintenance) is quasi criminal. Gowen v. Wilkerson, 364 F. Supp. 1043, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11697 (W.D. Va. 1973). And petition er may assert fifth amendment privilege.  Since by the time of the show cause hearing on failure to make child support payments events had proceeded beyond merely the civil stage and petitioner wa s subject to possible criminal punishment, petitioner was entitled to assert his fifth amendment privilege at the hearing. Gowen v. Wilkerson, 364 F. Supp. 1043, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11697 (W.D. Va. 1973). The failure to object during the contempt proceedings probably in itself constitutes a waiver of petitioners right to refrain from testifying, as far as the power of a federal habeas corpus court to review that act is concerned. Gowen v. Wilkerson, 364 F. Supp. 1043, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11697 (W.D. Va. 1973). Defendant entitled to jury trial.  Where defendant, tried for failure to comply with a decree for support, was sentenced to eleven months in jail, and his sentence exceeded six months with no provi sion enabling him to purge his contempt, the trial court erred in denying his request for a jury trial. Kessler v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 14, 441 S.E.2d 223, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1040, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 117 (1994). Sentence under section i s matter for state law.  Whether a petitioners past acts were sufficiently contumacious to warrant six months on the road force upon conviction under this section is strictly a matter of interpretation and application of state law, best left to the state courts. Gowen v. Wilkerson, 364 F. Supp. 1043, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11697 (W.D. Va. 1973). Where the sentence is within the limit set by statute, a federal court is barred, except in the most exceptional circumstances, from any inquiry it might otherwis e be inclined to make. Gowen v. Wilkerson, 364 F. Supp. 1043, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11697 (W.D. Va. 1973). Jurisdiction.  Trial court properly ordered a former husband under § 20-61 to jail for a period of 12 months or until he purged himself of contempt for failure to pay child s upport or support arrearages because while the husband claimed that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hold the contempt hearing based on § 20-67, § 20-115 specifically gave the trial court the authority to hold the hearing. Jagannathan v. Jaga nnathan, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 88 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2008). Consecutive imprisonment.  Where an inmate provided no evidence that he was unable to make good faith payments towards child support arrearages while incarcerated, the inmate did no t show that he would be unable to purge the inmates contempt; thus, there was no error in the trial courts sentence of imprisonment for civil contempt to be served consecutively to the inmates current imprisonment. Thompson v. Commonwealth ex rel. Hornes, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 42 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2003). Confinement for cont empt not to exceed 12 months.  Regardless of whether the contempt was viewed as civil or criminal in nature, this statute placed a limit on how long a party could be confined for failure to mak e a support payment, and the trial courts express statement that this statute, and hence its limitation, did not apply raised significant concerns; thus, the contempt issue was remanded to the trial court for the limited purpose of noting in the orde r that the jail term was until the husband paid any remaining contempt arrears but, in no event, would such term of confinement exceed 12 months. Hassell v. Hassell, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 310 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2016). Power of court to award of counsel fees in contempt proceedings.  An aggrieved party to a divorce suit has the right to petition for relief, and the court has the authority to hold the offending party in contempt for acting in b ad faith or for willful disobedience of its order. In such cases, a court has the discretionary power to award counsel fees incurred by an aggrieved party incident to contempt proceedings instituted and conducted to obtain enforcement of an order of the court. Carswell v. Masterson, 224 Va. 329, 295 S.E.2d 899, 1982 Va. LEXIS 300 (1982). Award of fees upheld.  According to the parties experts, a painting by Red Skelton was worth between $3,500 to $45,000. The trial court noted that the parties purchased the painting for $13,750 in 1992 and that at one time it was offered for sale for $27,500. The artwork was awarded to the husband, but when the wife lost it, the husband claimed contempt. While the court did not assign a specific value to the painting, it was clear from the courts total award that the court estimated its worth at approximately $5,000. Husband presented evidence that he incurred $5,600 in costs and $6,144.50 in attorneys fees in connection with the contempt hearing. The fees of the expert an d of husbands counsel were reasonable and were directly related to the wifes contempt, and thus their award was proper. Theismann v. Theismann, No. 0790-96-4 (Ct. of Appeals March 4, 1997). Applicability in bankruptcy pr oceedings.  District court erred in reversing a bankruptcy courts order that a divorce settlement was not a dischargeable debt under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(15)(B) where the debtor would have faced jail under § 20-115 only by voluntarily and contumaciously taking action that prevented the debtor from making the payment, the bankruptcy court correctly found that the debtor had monthly disposable income with which to ma ke monthly payments. Ferraro v. Ballard (In re Ballard), 69 Fed. Appx. 145, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 12940 (4th Cir. 2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Contempt.  Husband was held in contempt for failing to comply with the provisions of a final decree of divorce, by failing to pay the wife her marital share of his military retirement benefits under a qualifying order which did not violate 10 U.S.C.S. § 1408, despite a decrease in the pay he received, as an indemnification provision obligated him to make up the difference when such occurred, acting as a constructive trus tee for her benefit and protecting her right to the agreed percentage; moreover, the indemnification clause created a separate agreement to maintain a certain level of payments to the wife. Middleton v. Oliver, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 214 (Fairfax County Oct . 13, 2005). Because the husband was unable to comply with the ordered spousal support provisions during and since his incarceration, he was not in contempt, but the court est ablished spousal support arrearages. Martinovich v. Martinovich, 106 Va. Cir. 138, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 192 (Norfolk Oct. 14, 2020).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_20-116"><akn:num>§ 20-116</akn:num><akn:heading>Effect of divorce from bed and board and what court may decree</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In granting a divorce from bed and board, the court may decree that the parties be perpetually separated and protected in their persons and property.

Curtesy, § 17; 6A M.J. Divorce and Alimony, § 52; 6B M.J. Dower, § 48. CASE NOTES Joint application for revoca tion of decree.  A decree granting divorce from bed and board terminates all marital rights and privileges, with the exception that the spouses have the right to make a joint appl ication, supported by evidence of reconciliation, to the same court that awarded the a mensa decree for revocation of that decree. Such a revocation would reinstate the marriage with the rights and privileges thereto pertaining without requiring the part ies to have another marriage ceremony performed. Stewart v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 887, 252 S.E.2d 329, 1979 Va. LEXIS 185 (1979). Effect of decree on property rights.  At common law a decree a mensa et thoro had no effect on the property rights of the parties, as there was no dissolution of the bond of matrimony, and they still remained husband and wife; and the same is true in Virginia in the absence of any order in the sentence of divorce, unless the separation is made perpetual, and, if, in a divorce a mensa et thoro, the separation is made perpetual, then it operates like a divorce a vinculo in respect of after-acquired property, barring the claim of dower or of curtesy as to such property. Gum v. Gum, 122 Va. 32, 94 S.E. 177, 1917 Va. LEXIS 81 (1917) (see Marshall v. Baynes, 88 Va. 1040, 14 S.E. 978 (1892)). Agreement of parties confirmed.  Where pending suit for divorce from bed and board, husband and wife agreed to live separately, each to acquire and hold property free from claims of the other, an d decree was entered confirming the agreement, the decree was in substance for a divorce from bed and board within the meaning of this section. Marshall v. Baynes, 88 Va. 1040, 14 S.E. 978, 1892 Va. LEXIS 70 (1892). Decree allowed wife to testify against husband in criminal trial.  A decree which granted a defendants wife a divorce from bed and board after the charged offense of grand larceny of the wifes personal property was allege dly committed by defendant, terminated defendants privilege of preventing his wife from testifying against him, and, thus, she could testify against him in grand larceny prosecution. Stewart v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 887, 252 S.E.2d 329, 1979 Va. LEXI S 185 (1979). Failure to provide corrobora ting evidence.  On the husbands appeal from the parties final decree of divorce the circuit court did not err in awarding the wife a divorce a vinculo matrimonii and in d enying the husbands request for a divorce a mensa et thoro. A divorce could not be granted on the uncorroborated testimony of the parties or either of them and the husband failed to provide corroborating evidence of his grounds for divorce; rather, t he record established that the parties lived separate and apart for one year prior to the filing of wifes complaint for divorce.

CASE NOTES Merger of divorce a mensa into divorce a vinculo authorized by this section.  Procedure, whereby husband, after divorce a mensa et thoro had been granted, filed supplemental bill alleging adultery, and wife filed cross-bill alleging deserti on and prayed that the former decree for divorce a mensa et thoro be merged into an absolute divorce from the bonds of matrimony, was authorized by this section. Gray v. Gray, 181 Va. 262, 24 S.E.2d 444, 1943 Va. LEXIS 175 (1943). Decree a mensa is no bar to ab solute divorce.  The effect of this section is to announce the public policy of this State to be that even though one spouse be armed with a decree of divorce from bed and board, it cannot be successfully pleaded as a defense by way of recrimination to defeat any charge brought by the other spouse for a divorce upon grounds justifying a decree of divorce a vinculo matrimonii. Haskins v. Haskins, 188 Va. 525, 50 S.E.2d 437, 1948 V a. LEXIS 186 (1948). Nor are grounds for the decree such a bar.  Adhering to the public policy announced by this section, any ground merely justifying a divorce from bed and board does not constitute a defense by way of recrimi nation to a suit based upon a ground made by statute sufficient to justify an absolute divorce. Haskins v. Haskins, 188 Va. 525, 50 S.E.2d 437, 1948 Va. LEXIS 186 (1948). Divorce granted on grounds of separation where both parties had defense of recrimination to ground of fault.  The husbands suit on the ground of willful desertion was proven, but the defense of cruelty, in recrimination, barred the granting of a divorce to him, and th e wifes suit on the ground of cruelty was proven, but the defense of desertion, in recrimination, barred the granting of a divorce to her. Because both parties were at fault, the only ground for divorce was their separation, and the trial court prope rly refused to grant either party a divorce based upon fault, but granted the divorce on the ground that the parties had lived separate and apart without any cohabitation or interruption for one year.

CASE NOTES Child support order continued in effect where divorce decree silent as to support.  It is clear from this section and § 20-79 that a child support order of a juvenile and domestic relations court continues in full force and effect notwithstand ing the entry by a court of record of a divorce decree that is silent as to child support, but if a specific provision for allowance or denial of alimony (now maintenance and support) is included in the final divorce decree, the jurisdiction of the juven ile and domestic relations court would cease under subsection (a) of § 20-79.

Failure to show that separation has continued without interruption.  Where the husband, the guilty party, moves for merger of an a mensa decree secured by his wife into a final decree of divorce, but is shown to have lived with her as man and wife each weekend for six months following entry of the temporary decree, he has not satisfied the requirement of this section that he show that no reconciliation has taken place and that the separation has continued without interruption.

Goodman v. Hamman, 19 Va. App. 71, 448 S.E.2d 677, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 596 (1994). One-year separation period.  Nothing in § 20-91 or § 20-121.02 required that the one-year separation period had to occur prior to the filing of the bill of complaint in order for the tr ial court to have jurisdiction to enter a final decree of divorce; when the trial court entered the final decree awarding appellee wife a divorce, the one-year separation period had occurred.

Section 20-121.02 supported a trial courts ruling allowing appellee wife to amend her bill of complaint to reflect March 5, 2005, as the date of separation, a nd the court found no prejudice to the husband in the trial court allowing the amendment as the husband was already on notice of the March 5, 2005, date (the original bill of complaint referred to it as the date wife moved out of the marital residence). Motley v. Motley, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 133 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 3, 2007), overruled in part, Jay v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 510, 659 S.E.2d 311, 2008 Va. LEXIS 53 (2008). Subdivision A 9 of § 20-91 provides that a person may seek a divorce from his or her spouse after they have lived separate and apart for more than one year. Se ction 20-121.02 provides that a party may move for a divorce based on living separate and apart without amending the complaint for divorce. Nothing in these code sections requires that the one-year separation period must occur prior to the filing of the complaint in order for the circuit court to have jurisdiction to enter a final decree of divorce. Pourbabai v. Pourbabai, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 233 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 21, 2018). Preservation for review.  Because a wifes claim that the parties had lived together within the time period allowed by §§ 20-91 and 20-121.02, the claim was unpreserved and barred by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18; because the wifes case was not supported by law or evidence, the husband was entitled to attorneys fees and costs. Mayo v. Mayo, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 443 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 10, 2006). Final divorce decree was remanded to the trial court so that it could correct a clerical error and add the necessary language to dissolve the parties marriage under subsection B of § 8.01-428 as the decree failed to state that it adjudged, ordered and decreed that a husband was divorced from a wife; the decrees statement that the parties were entitled to a divorce a vinculo matrimonii pursuant to subdi vision 9 of § 20-91 upon the wifes motion pursuant to § 20-121.02 was insufficient to dissolve the bonds of matrimony between the parties. Kramer v. Kramer, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 12, 2013). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No-fault election.  Since wife had proven by duly corroborated evidence that the parties had lived separate and apart without any cohabitation and without interruption for more than one year, the wife was entitled to elect to go forward in the divorce proceedings on a no-fault ground despite the fact that she had initially asked for a divorce on the grounds of cruelty and constructive desertion. Dastejerdi v. Dastejerdi, 2005 Va. Ci r. LEXIS 79 (Loudoun County July 26, 2005). Motion granted.  Wifes motion pursuant to § 20-121.02 was granted and the wife was awarded a divorce a vinculo matrimonii from the husband on the grounds of having lived se parate and apart without any cohabitation and without interruption for one year under subdivision A (9) of § 20-91. Williamson v. Williamson, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 164 (Loudoun County Sept. 23, 2003). Invalid complaint.  Wifes divorce complaint had no vitality because the husband was not allowed to waive service until he filed an answer; although the husband eventually filed a n answer more than a year after suit was filed, no attempt had been made to serve the husband in that year, and, pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:5, therefore, no decree could have been properly entered. In the absence of a pleading in which a claim for div orce was properly stated, a motion pursuant to § 20-121.02 would have had no vitality, and the wife would have been unable to independently prosecute a prayer for divorce. Rathburn v. Rathburn, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 102 (Roanoke County July 12, 2007). § 20-121.03.

History History. 1978, c. 484; 1990, c. 623. Annotations CASE NOTES Trial courts discretion to reopen record.  Trial court did not err in vacating its own order sequestering the record in a divorce action under § 20-124. The husbands undefined concern for his profes sional reputation did not rebut the presumption of openness of judicial records provided in § 17.1-208. Shiembob v. Shiembob, 55 Va. App. 234, 685 S.E.2d 192, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 520 (2009), limited, Schuman v. Schuman, 282 Va. 443, 717 S.E.2d 410, 20 11 Va. LEXIS 215 (2011). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability of Rule 1:1.  When a court exercises its discretion to seal a file, it is not making a decision on the merits of the underlying case; therefore, Rule 1:1 does not apply. Falkof f v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Jurisdiction.  Statute grants a court discretion to seal a file in domestic cases and contains no deadline; the court had jurisdiction in this case to seal the file. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Construction.  While a presumption of openness exists, the General Assembly has granted judges the authority to seal in domestic relations cases but discretion does not extend t o all domestic relations matters, as the statute on sealing records expressly refers to the chapter dealing with divorce, affirmation, and annulment, and therefore excludes the chapter dealing with custody and visitation. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Since the court has clear discretion to seal divorce records, some circumstances will be present where divorce record sealing will cause the ancillary sealing of some related custody and visitation records; this must be balanced on a case-by-case basis. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). While § 20-124 is a grant of discretion absent from § 17.1-208, it is not an exception from the openness principles of § 17.1-208. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 10 3 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Presumption for keeping records open.  Recognizing the strong constitutional and statutory presumption of open files, when a court does seal all or part of the file the reasons for doing so should itse lf be open and public; rarely should the sealing of the file include sealing the very reasons for doing so. Otherwise, the public is unable to determine whether the decision to seal was a reasonable one. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir . LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Standard of review.  Standard of review in a record sealing case is abuse of discretion in the face of the strong presumption of openness. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 V a. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Factors.  Considerations against sealing include: agreement by or desire of the litigants to seal, an unparticularized concern of damage to professional reputation, emotion al damage, or financial harm, public figure status, publicity surrounding the case, and malicious use of court records. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Factors a court may want to consider when assessing whether sealing a file is appropriate include: particularized proof of harm, privileged materials, personally identifiable information, trade secrets, when the material has little relevance to the case, the protection of children, and demonstrably false information. No one factor is dispositive, and no specific combination of these factors should control a decis ion to seal a file in every case. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Record sealed in part.  After considering the various record-sealing factors the court determined needed review, the court sealed the record in part; the complaint was an orphaned pleadi ng, there were no rulings on the merits, the husband introduced credible evidence that the fully open file had caused actual, particularized harm, including loss of clients and professional recognition, and the court doubted the veracity of at least some of the allegations. The presumption against sealing was rebutted. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Discretionary authority.  Both the open records law and the expungement law grant the circuit court discretionary authority to close records using the permissive word may but judic ial records are presumed to be open, persons are presumed innocent, and those who have their cases dismissed thereafter occupy the status of innocent; thus, the presumption against sealing can be lifted when a party points to a real harm that has occurre d as opposed to a theoretical, to-be-determined harm. Falkoff v. Falkoff, 103 Va. Cir. 405, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1168 (Fairfax County Dec. 6, 2019). Sequestration denied.  In a divorce action, the husband, a prominent attorney, was not entitled to sequestration of the file because the information that he sought to have sealed, invol ving the circumstances associated with the wifes arrest and allegedly false claims against the husband, were already in the public domain, and there was a strong interest in open judicial records.

Black v. Powers, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 549 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 4, 2003). Property  not synonymous with separate property.  Section 20-148 does not define separate property, but instead defines only the term property generally; contrary to the arguments of the husband, § 20- 148 did not require the court to interpret property in the parties antenuptial agreements as synonymous with separate property. § 20-148 did not control the determination of whether income was separate or marital.

CASE NOTES Non-final orders.  Where a court order declaring a prenuptial agreement valid pursuant to Virginia law was a non-final, interlocutory order that did not adjudicate the principles of the cause, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal. Black v. Powers, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 549 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 4, 2003). Signature of husband not required.  Failure to personally sign divorce decree did not render the trial courts order void; neither subsection C of § 20-109 nor § 20-149 expressly states or implicitly reveals a legislative intent to precondition the exercise of those powers upon compliance with the signature requirements. De Avies v. De Avies, 42 Va. App. 342, 592 S.E.2d 351, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 46 (2004). Burden of proof on propone nt of oral contract.  In the absence of any understanding that the oral agreement will be reduced to writing, the agreement is not unenforceable, but the proponent of the oral contract has the burden of proving all elements of a valid enforceable contract. Largen v. Largen (Hartis), 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 339 (Va. Ct. App. May 27, 1997). Contract could be enforced although it was an oral postnuptial agreement which was not i n writing. Portion of § 20-155 clearly limits its provisions to those contracts affecting those rights and obligations that arise from the marital relationship. Each spouses contractual intent to benefit third parties after the death of bo th spouses did not affect the rights and obligations arising from the marital relationship. Thus, § 20-155 was inapplicable. Black v. Edwards, 248 Va. 90, 445 S.E.2d 107, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1477, 1994 Va. LEXIS 104 (1994). Sufficient evidence of oral agreemen t.  Terms of oral agreement were sufficiently definite where wife paid over ninety percent of the purchase price of the automobile in furtherance of the parties g oal to purchase a home together and substantial evidence supported conclusion that the parties agreed to jointly title the car but that husband failed to follow through with his obligation under the agreement. Largen v. Largen (Hartis), 1997 Va. App. LEX IS 339 (Va. Ct. App. May 27, 1997). Handwritten documents.  Circuit court properly found that a husbands inheritance was transmuted into marital property because after he received his inheritance, he wrote checks to hi s wife, the checks were deposited into the wifes bank account, the husband did not object to the circuit courts classification ruling, and the handwritten documents presented by the husband did not constitute an agreement between the parties, but merely constituted an attempt to establish an agreement that itemized what the husband claimed were past transactions between the parties. Anderson v. Anderson, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (Va. Ct. App. May 5, 2020). Agreement was valid without consideration.  Letter given by the husband to the wife, wherein the husband gave three marital businesses to the wife, was enforceable even though there was no consideration for the transfer, and validly converted the marital businesses into the wifes separate property. Shenk v. Shenk, 39 Va. App. 161, 571 S.E.2d 896, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 680 (2002). Handwritten agreement giving wife husbands military retiremen t pay and title to the marital home was enforceable.  Handwritten document that a husband signed, wherein he agreed to relinquish his entire military pay to his wife and to transfer title to the marital home and its contents to his wife, was not unconscionable, and trial court did not err by enforcing it. Wilson v. Wilson, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 17 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 13, 2004). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Prenuptial agreement valid.  Prenuptial agreement was a valid agreement and was subject to the rules of construction applicable to contracts generally because the recitals section of the agre ement stated that each party affirmed that the agreement was entered into voluntarily, was not unconscionable, and was not entered into under any duress or undue influence; because the wife admitted that she was not challenging the validity of the prenup , and the parties were married, the prenup could be presumed valid and enforceable. Algabi v. Dagvadorj, 106 Va. Cir. 153, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 193 (Loudoun County Oct. 19, 2020). Parties certificate of marriage was not considered a pre-marital agreement as the wife had submitted no evidence of any written disclosure consistent with § 20-149. Dasher v. Nahidian, 2021 Va. Cir.

For comment, Enforcing Islamic Mahr Agreements: The American Judges Interpretational Dilemma, see 18 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 1085 (2011). CASE NOTES Construction and interpretation.  Antenuptial agreements are subject to the same rules of construction and interpretation as other contracts. Covington v. Covington, No. 0995-96-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 17, 1996). Trial court did not err in finding that the separate property of the late wife that she agreed was part of the prenuptial agreement, and that was identified in ap pendices to the agreement, was not part of the husbands elective share, as parties could contract to exclude such property from the disposition of property upon the happening of an event, such as the death of a spouse, which is what the late wife did . Dowling v. Rowan, 270 Va. 510, 621 S.E.2d 397, 2005 Va. LEXIS 97 (2005). Section 20-150 permits, but does not require, the contracting parties to resolve issues such as spousal support and disposition of property, and § 20-155 does not require the contracting parties to address all of the issues in existence between them in an agreement; therefore, an agreement may nonetheless be valid, enforceable, and comprise the parties full agreement despite its failure to address all issu es between the parties. Cooper v. Cooper, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 79 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 24, 2020). Disposition of p roperty upon marital dissolution.  Language of this section specifically included agreements regarding the disposition of property upon marital dissolutions within its provisions. Flanary v. Milton , 263 Va. 20, 556 S.E.2d 767, 2002 Va. LEXIS 16 (2002). In a divorce case, the trial court did not err in awarding an amount of gold coins to the wife because it found that the amount was due under an Iranian premarita l agreement, which was a premarital contract under § 20-150, and, thus, the coins were not marital property subject to equitable distribution under § 20-107.3.Afghahi v. Ghafoorian, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 118 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 30, 2010). Valuation.  Wife was not entitled to a monetary award under a premarital agreement as her 50 percent share of the net increase in value of the husbands interest in four b usinesses because the total assets figure on tax returns used by the wife to calculate value did not take into account the businesses liabilities and thus, could not be the basis for the actual value of any of the businesses. Cavallo v. Caval lo, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 54 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 25, 2014). Interpretation of premarital agreement required parol evidence.  Chancellor erred in equitably distributing property that the husband claimed to have acquired and titled separately during the marriage, and which was excluded fr om distribution under the parties premarital agreement, as the language contained within said agreement was ambiguous and required extrinsic evidence to discern its plain meaning; moreover, on remand, the chancellor should consider whatever admissibl e extrinsic evidence existed on the proper construction of the agreement and reinterpret it in light of this additional evidence. Vilseck v. Vilseck, 45 Va. App. 581, 612 S.E.2d 746, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 199 (2005). Postnuptial agreement enforceable.  Trial court erred in disregarding the husband and wifes valid postnuptial agreement that state the wife would sign on a loan for the husband in return for the husband agreeing not to sell the marital residence until after the loan was paid in full, and, instead, ordering the immediate sale of the marital residence so that the parties could pay their debts; statutory authority gave the parties the right to ent er into a valid postnuptial agreement and the trial court was not free to ignore it, but, instead, had to enforce it by its terms. Dielman v. Dielman, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 279 (Va. Ct. App. July 19, 2005). Wifes appeal of an order reforming a property settlement agreement (PSA), which was incorporated into a final decree granting her a divorce from her husband, was dismissed because the PSAs provision that a trial courts decision would be non-appealable was binding upon the parties and did not violate any Virginia law; a clause limiting appellate rights does not expressly violate subdivision 8 of § 2 0-150. Burke v. Burke, 52 Va. App. 183, 662 S.E.2d 622, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 303 (2008). Revocation provision ineffective.  Subdivision 8 of § 20-150 did not permit parties to include provisions in abrogation of requirements of § 20-153; a provision in an antenuptial agreement th at allowed the parties to mutually agree to its termination without a writing was ineffective; the parties antenuptial agreement remained valid because, although the parties intended to revoke it when they destroyed it after they were married , there was no signed, written document revoking the agreement, as required by § 20-153.

Rev. 145 (2011). CASE NOTES Failure to disclose assets.  Trial court did not err in finding that there was no disclosure of the assets in a property settlement agreement, in violation of § 20-151, because: (1) one sp ouse did not waive the right to disclosure of the property; (2) the agreement did not include a waiver to disclosure, but, instead, the agreement stated that each party assured the other that full disclosure had been made to the other of any assets in wh ich a party had any interest; (3) the evidence proved that one spouse did not provide a disclosure of the parties assets or obligations; and (4) one spouses assistance with the other spouses business did not negate the other spouses respo nsibility to disclose the assets of the business. Pramagioulis v. Pramagioulis, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 20 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 25, 2011). Fair and reasonable disclosure.  Partys failure to disclose any particular piece of property or any specific financial obligation is not ipso facto fatal to a prenuptial agreement; although t he general assembly could have required total and absolute disclosure, it did not do so,and fairly read, the modifying phrase fair and reasonable can be read only as requiring something less than complete disclosure. Chapin v. Chapin, 2017 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 225 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 29, 2017). Whether any particular disclosure is fair and reasonable is necessarily a fact-intensive inquiry that will turn on multiple factors, including, but not li mited to, the information actually disclosed, the information not disclosed, whether any information regarding obligations is provided, the totality of the partys financial situation, and the relative size of the non-disclosed information to the tota lity of the partys financial situation. Chapin v. Chapin, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 29, 2017). To apply subdivision A 2 of § 20-151, a court must find that the agreement was unconscionable when t he parties signed it.  See O'Connor v. O'Connor, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 629 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 9, 2003). Burden of proof.  Even though the parties had differing accounts of what happened the day that a prenuptial agreement was signed, and both parties appeared credible, the burden of proof under this statute determined the outcome; the wife failed to show that she did not enter into the agreement voluntarily. Gust v. Gust, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (Va. Ct. App. May 10, 2016). Agreement not found unconscionable.  The trial court did not err in rejecting the wifes claim that the parties separation agreement was unconscionable since: (1) the agreement itself recited that each party entered the agreement with full knowledge of the extent and probable value of all the property in the estate of the other; and (2) the inequality in value of the property received by the parties under the agreement was not so extreme as t o require equitable relief. McElraft v. McElraft, No. 0124-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 24, 1998). Lack of consideration without deception or bad faith was not a factor in making a finding of unconscionability; a letter signed by the husband which gave three ma rital businesses to the wife was not unconscionable where the businesses had little or negative value when the letter was signed, the husband was an experienced businessman, was not unaware of the condition of the businesses, and there was no indication of failure to disclose information, trickery, or bad faith. Shenk v. Shenk, 39 Va. App. 161, 571 S.E.2d 896, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 680 (2002). Where the wife filed a motion to compel her husband to execute a separation and property settlement agreement as provided in a signed memorandum, § 20-151 did not bar enforcement of the agreement because the husband never asked the court to make a finding that the agreement was unconscionable. The husband had competent legal counsel and voluntarily signed the memorandum. O'Connor v. O'Connor, 2003 Va. App. LEX IS 629 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 9, 2003). Trial court did not err in refusing to set aside a property settlement agreement on the ground that it was unconscionable because, while the agreement gave the fo rmer husband 94 percent of the marital assets, there was no evidence of overreaching or oppressive behavior by the husband, in that the husband brought the agreement to the former wife the night before it was executed and advised the wife that she could consult an attorney. Galloway v. Galloway, 47 Va. App. 83, 622 S.E.2d 267, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 483 (2005). While the requirements of the agreement were significant and burdensome to husband, it was not the courts role to intervene on behalf of a spouse who chose to enter a disadvantageous agreement when there was no proof of oppressive conduct by the other spouse. Guirguis v. Salib, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 12 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2013). Premarital agreement was not unconscionable where the parties were mature, college-educated adults at the time of their marriage, each was gainfully employed, the agreement did not provide for a gross disparity in the division of any marital assets that might have come into existence during the union, and the evidence failed to establish overreaching or oppressive influences. Makoui v. Makoui, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 360 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2011). Trial court did not err in holding that a post-nuptial agreement was not unconscionable because the distribution of the parties property in the agreement was not so gross as to shock the conscience and the trial court concluded that one spouse was not in some kind of severe mental state when the spouse signed the agreement. Woodward v. Woodward, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 217 (Va. Ct. App. June 3, 2014). Agreement found unconscionable.  Trial court erred in granting a husbands motion to strike a wifes evidence and in concluding that the parties premarital agreement was enforceable bec ause the wife established prima facie that the agreement was unenforceable by presenting evidence that it was unconscionable, that the husband did not provide the necessary disclosures to her prior to the execution of the agreement, and that she did not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, any right to disclosure of the property; the husband failed to disclose his net worth of approximately $20 million dollars to the wife prior to her execution of the agreement pursuant to the Virginia Premarita l Agreement Act. Chaplain v. Chaplain, 54 Va. App. 762, 682 S.E.2d 108, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 396 (2009). Judgment which entered a final decree of divorce that incorporated the property settlement agreement was reversed because the agreement was unconscionable and mus t be set aside; the wife had a third grade education, numerous health problems including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and qualified to receive food stamps. Sims v. Sims, 55 Va. App. 340, 685 S.E.2d 869, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 552 (2009). Circuit court did not err in finding that the premarital agreement signed by the former husband and former wife was unconscionable under Va. Code Ann. § 20-151 (A)(2) and, therefore, unenforceable because the agreement, if enforced, would entail a gross disparity in the division of assets, there were overreaching or oppressive influences at play when the wife signed it, and there was no fair and reasonable disc losure of assets before the parties signed the agreement, and further, the wife did not waive her right to financial disclosure. Remillard v. Remillard, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 417 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 6, 2022). Recitations in agreement provided prima facie evidence that agreement was not unconscion able when husband signed it. Rahnema v. Rahnema, No. 1081-99-1 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 7, 2000). Agreement enforceable.  Premarital agreement was enforceable where, inter alia, the wife, who was from Morocco, was college educated, spoke and understood English very well, and had the intellectual capacity to understand the impact of the prenuptial agreement, and the evidence showed that the wife voluntarily signed the agreement after being told by the husband that he did not want to marry, but would if the wife signed the agreement. Chaplain v. Chaplain, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 15 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 18, 2011). Premarital agreement was enforceable where a recitation provided that each party had given fair and reasonable disclosure of his or her property and financial obl igations, which created a prima facie presumption that the recitation was factually correct, and where the husbands disclosure was fair and reasonable under the standard set forth in § 20-151.

Annotations CASE NOTES Alleged modification ineffective as modification was not in writing.  Chancellor did not modify the separation agreement to relieve the husband of his obligation to pay the wifes rent by issuing a pendente lite decree, as § § 20-153 and 20-155 provided that separation agreements could be modified or rescinded only in writing, and at no time did the parties or the chancellor modify or rescind the rent obligation imposed by the separation agreement in writing. Milner v. Mi lner, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 280 (Va. Ct. App. May 6, 2003). Antenuptial agreement not revoked by parties destruction of it.  Parties antenuptial agreement remained valid because, although the parties intended to revoke it when they destroyed it after they were married, there was no signed, written document revoking the agreement, as required by § 20-153; further, subdivision 8 of § 20-150 did not permit parties to include provisions in abrogation of requirements of § 20-153, and thus a provision in the antenuptial agreemen t that allowed the parties to mutually agree to its termination without a writing was ineffective. Miller v. Miller, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 340 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 11, 2007). Husbands statement that he had torn up the parties premarital agreement did not constitute an abandonment or repudiation of it because pursuant to § 20 -153 the agreement was revocable only by a written agreement signed by the parties. Thus, the wife failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence sufficient facts to estop the husband from relying on the agreement. Although the husband apparently l ied to wife when he said that he had torn up the agreement, the trial court did not find that the wife proved that she relied on his misrepresentation. Makoui v.

Carpenter, 19 Va. App. 147, 449 S.E.2d 502, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 634 ( 1994). Agreement signed in Paki stan not enforceable.  Marriage contract or nikah nama signed by the parties prior to their marriage in Pakistan in 1982 was not an enforceable prenuptial agreement barring wife from receiving anything from husband upon their divorce, as it did not satisfy the requirements of Virginia law covering prenuptial agreements. It was not negotiable, it required no disclosure of assets, there was no evidence that wife received independ ent advice prior to signing it, and nothing on the face of the agreement purported to deal with wifes rights upon dissolution of the marriage nor with her right to spousal support upon divorce.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Section 20-150 permits, but does not require, the contracting parties to resolve issues such as spousal support and disposition of property, and § 20-155 does not require the contracting parties to address all of the issues in existence between them in an agreement; therefore, an agreement may nonetheless be valid, enforceable, and comprise the parties full agreement despite its failure to address all issu es between the parties. Cooper v. Cooper, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 79 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 24, 2020). Final sentence of this section applies only to separation and property settlement agreements, a subset of the broader category of marital agreements addre ssed in the first two sentences of the statute. Wills v. Wills, 72 Va. App. 743, 853 S.E.2d 536, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 20 (2021), aff'd, 301 Va. 51, 870 S.E.2d 314, 2022 Va. LEXIS 20 (2022). Separate property found.  Although the property was marital when acquired by the parties as tenants by the entireties in 1989, husband and wife executed a deed of gift transferring the wif es interest to husband immediately after closing and that deed provided that the property was to be held by husband in his own right as his separate and equitable estate as if he were an unmarried man . . . free from the control and marital right s of his present . . . spouse and with full and complete power . . . [to] dispose of the . . . property . . . during his lifetime . . . [or by] devise, therefore, that property was husbands separate property. McDavid v. McDavid, 19 Va. Ap p. 406, 451 S.E.2d 713, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 768 (1994). Circuit court properly determined that the former marital home was the wifes separate property because a deed, transferring the home from the husband and the wife to the wife only, after the last separation of the parties was a marital agreement, and the husbands other arguments on appeal were not preserved for review. Oberlander v. Oberlander, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 209 (Va. Ct. App. July 31, 2018). Agreement not binding until signed.  Property settlement agreement did not become a binding agreement until it was signed by both parties; hence, because trial court assumed agreement became enforcea ble before wifes attempted revocation, and made no findings concerning the validity of this attempted revocation in the context of the then unsigned agreement, case would be reversed and remanded for further findings. Kreiter v. Kreiter, 2002 Va. App . LEXIS 396 (Va. Ct. App. July 23, 2002). Writing requirement.  Chancellor properly did not modify the agreement to relieve the husband of his obligation to pay the wifes rent by issuing a pendente lite decree, as §§ 20-153 and 20-155 provided that separation agreements could be modified or rescinded only in writing, and at no time did the parties or the chancellor modify or rescind the rent obligation imposed by the separation agreement in writing. Milner v. Milner , 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 280 (Va. Ct. App. May 6, 2003). Verbal marital agreements were not authorized by § 20-155. Mosteller v. Brooks, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 565 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 23, 2008). Exception to writing requirement.  Exception to the writing requirement applied because the terms of the agreement were recorded and transcribed into the record by a court reporter, and both partie s personally, specifically, and affirmatively manifested their assent to those terms on the record. Cooper v. Cooper, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 79 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 24, 2020). A property settlement agreement, entered into prior to an unsuccessful reconciliation attempt, was enforceable because it was not revoked by a written agreement signed by the parties. Smith v. Smith, 19 Va. App. 155, 449 S.E.2d 506, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 640 (1994). Separation agreement entered into prior to an unsuccessful reconciliation.  Circuit courts incorporation of a contested separation agreement  which was actually unenforceable at the time it was incorporated into a pendente lite or der because of the parties failed reconciliation after the execution of the agreement  without first inquiring as to the validity of the agreement was reversible error. The husband was entitled to a credit towards the husbands future spousal support obligations, based on the amounts that the husband had already paid that exceeded the monthly spousal support ordered in the final decree. Ruane v. Ruane, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 320 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2016). Wifes oral agreement made in conjunction with divorce proceedings was subject to § 20-155. As the agreement was not in writing and not signed by the parties, as required by that statute, the court erred in finding it valid and in dismissing wifes petition as surviving spouse pursuant to § 64.1-151.1.Flanary v. Milton, 263 Va. 20, 556 S.E.2d 767, 2002 Va. LEXIS 16 (2002). Contract could be enforced although it was an oral postnuptial agreement which was not i n writing. Portion of this section clearly limits its provisions to those contracts affecting those rights and obligations that arise from the marital relationship. Each spouses contractual intent to benefit third parties after the death of b oth spouses did not affect the rights and obligations arising from the marital relationship. Thus, this section was inapplicable. Black v. Edwards, 248 Va. 90, 445 S.E.2d 107, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1477, 1994 Va. LEXIS 104 (1994). Oral agreement not enforceable.  Trial court erred in holding that an oral agreement constituted a valid property settlement agreement under § 20-155 where the husband unambiguously manifested his intent that his affirmation of the terms of an oral agreement that had been read into the record was subject to the execution of a formal, written agreement, the husbands manifested assent distinctly differed from the manifested assent of the wi fe, and no formal, written agreement had been executed. Bryant v. McDougal, 49 Va. App. 78, 636 S.E.2d 897, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 519 (2006). Waiver of relief.  Wife knew that she had a right to present evidence at a trial rather than enter into the marital agreement and that any relief not stated in the agreement would n ot be provided, yet she accepted it; therefore, she waived her right to present evidence on any other relief she prayed for in her complaint, including spousal support and a monetary payment. Cooper v. Cooper, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 79 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 24 , 2020). Failure to introduce at trial.  While § 20-155 allowed the parties to a divorce action to enter a valid, written, property settlement agreement, signed by both parties to settle the rights an d obligations of either or both of them with regard to temporary support, because the husband failed to introduce the agreement into evidence at trial, the trial court had no way to know its content or provisions, to interpret it, or to enforce its terms . Thus, due to the lack of an adequate record, the husbands claim of error regarding the agreement, which allowed for temporary support, was not reviewed. Robinson v. Robinson, 50 Va. App. 189, 648 S.E.2d 314, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 291 (2007). Deed of partition.  Deed of partition executed by a husband, his uncle, and their wives, which adjusted title in properties the husband and uncle held as tenants in common, did not v iolate § 20-155 but was an enforceable estate-planning device, as its purpose was clear and unambiguous. Simpson v. Simpson, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 169 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 26, 2005). Property settlement agreement unconscionable.  Judgment which entered a final decree of divorce that incorporated the property settlement agreement was reversed because the agreement was unconscionable and mus t be set aside; the wife had a third grade education, numerous health problems including diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, and qualified to receive food stamps. Sims v. Sims, 55 Va. App. 340, 685 S.E.2d 869, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 552 (2009). Agreem ent giving wife marital property was enforceable.  Marital agreements were not limited to actions taken in contemplation of divorce, and were enforceable without consideration; a letter signed by the husband, whic h gave three marital businesses to the wife, was enforceable, and validly converted the marital businesses to the wifes separate property.

Determinati on of parentage, generally.  Except as provided in subsections B, C, D, and E, the parentage of any child resulting from the performance of assisted conception shall be determined as follows: 1. The g estational mother of a child is the childs mother. 2. The spouse of the gestational mother of a child is the childs other parent, notwithstanding any declaration of invalidity or annulment of the marriage obtained after the performanc e of assisted conception, unless such spouse commences an action in which the mother and child are parties within two years after such spouse discovers or, in the exercise of due diligence, reasonably should have discovered the childs birth and in wh ich it is determined that such spouse did not consent to the performance of assisted conception. 3. A donor is not the parent of a child conceived through assisted conception, unless the donor is the spouse of the gestational mother. B. Death of sp ouse.  Any child resulting from the insemination of a gestational mothers ovum using her spouses sperm, with his consent, is the child of the gestational mother and her spouse notwithstanding that, during the 10-month period immediately prece ding the birth, either party died.However, any person who dies before in utero implantation of an embryo resulting from the union of the spouses sperm or gestational mothers ovum with another gamete, whether or not the other gamete is that of the persons spouse, is not the parent of any resulting child unless (i) implantation occurs before notice of the death can reasonably be communicated to the physician performing the procedure or (ii) the person consents to be a parent in writing execute d before the implantation. C. Divorce.  Any child resulting from insemination of a gestational mothers ovum using her spouses sperm, with his consent, is the child of the gestational mother and her spouse notwithstanding that either party filed for a divorce or annulment during th e 10-month period immediately preceding the birth. Any person who is a party to an action for divorce or annulment commenced by filing before in utero implantation of an embryo resulting from the union of the spouses sperm or gestational mothers ovum with another gamete, whether or not the other gamete is that of the persons spouse, is not the parent of any resulting child unless (i) implantation occurs before notice of the filing can reasonably be communicated to the physician performing th e procedure or (ii) the person consents in writing to be a parent, whether the writing was executed before or after the implantation. D. Birth pursu ant to court approved surrogacy contract.  After approval of a surrogacy contract by the court and entry of an order as provided in subsection D of § 20-160, the intended parent is the parent of any resulting child. However, if the court vacates t he order approving the agreement pursuant to subsection B of § 20-161, the surrogate who is the genetic parent is the mother of the resulting child and her spouse, if any, is the other parent. The intended parent may only obtain parental rights throug h adoption as provided in Chapter 12 (§ 63.2-1200 et seq.) of Title 63.2. E. Birth pursu ant to surrogacy contract not approved by court.  In the case of a surrogacy contract that has not been approved by a court as provided in § 20-160, the parentage of any resulting child shall be determined as follows: 1. The g estational mother is the childs mother unless the intended mother is a genetic parent, in which case the intended mother is the mother. 2. If an intended parent is a genetic parent of the resulting child, such intended parent is the childs parent. However, if (i) the surrogate is a genetic parent, (ii) the surrogate i s married and her spouse is a party to the surrogacy contract, and (iii) the surrogate who is a genetic parent exercises her right to retain custody and parental rights to the resulting child pursuant to § 20-162, then the surrogate and her spouse are the parents. If the surrogate is unmarried and (a) is a genetic parent, (b) is a party to the surrogacy contract, and (c) exercises her right to retain custody and parental rights to the resulting child pursuant to § 20-162, then the surrogate is the parent. 3. If no intended parent is a genetic parent of the resulting child, but the embryo that was used is subject to the legal or contractual custody of an intended parent, then such intended parent is the parent. However, if no intended parent is a genetic parent, and the embryo that was used is not subject to the legal or contractual custody of such intended parent, then the surrogate is the mother and her spouse, if any, is the childs other parent if such other parent is a party to the contract. In such an event, the intended parent may only obtain parental rights through adoption as provided in Chapter 12 (§ 63.2-1200 et seq.) of Title 63.2. 4. After the signing and filing of the surrogate consent and report form in conformance with the requirements of subsection A of § 20-162, the intended parent is the parent of the chil d and the surrogate and her spouse, if any, shall not be the parents of the child. History History. 1991, c. 600; 1997, c. 81; 2000, c. 830; 2019, c. 375. Annotations The 2000 amendments. The 2000 amendment by c. 830 substituted Chapter 10.2 (§ 63.1-219.7 et seq.) for Chapter 11 (§ 63.1-220 et seq.) near the end of subsections D and E 3. The 2019 amendments. The 2019 amendment by c. 375 substituted spouse or such spouse for both husband and he throughout; substituted other parent  for father throughout; substituted gestational mother for both wife and her throughout; substituted parent for parents throughout; in the first paragraph of subsection B and subsection C, substituted gestational mother and her spouse for husband and wife; in subsection D, inserted who is the genetic parent and if any; rewrote subdivisions E 2 and 3, which read: 2.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Because marital status is not a suspect classification, Virginia has a significant interest in encouraging the institution of marriage, and subdivision A 3s o bjective of protecting married couples from potential interference by donors is rationally related to that legitimate governmental purpose, subdivision A 3 of § 20-158 does not violate the Equal Protection Clause. L.F. v. Breit, 285 Va. 163, 736 S.E.2 d 711, 2013 Va. LEXIS 4 (2013). Constitutional rights of donors.  As the father of a child conceived by in vitro fertilization actively participated in the childs life, agreed to be listed as the father on her birth certific ate, acknowledged paternity, and agreed with the mother regarding parental rights and responsibilities, the Due Process Clause protected his fundamental right to make decisions concerning the childs care, custody and control, despite his status as an unmarried sperm donor. L.F. v. Breit, 285 Va. 163, 736 S.E.2d 711, 2013 Va. LEXIS 4 (2013). Right to litigate paternity issue.  Trial court  in a paternity action filed by a known sperm donor, pursuant to § 20-49.2, who was acknowledged under oath by the biological and gestational m other, to whom the donor was never married, to be the biological father of the child at issue  erred in sustaining pleas in bar to the sperm donors petition to determine parentage of the child conceived as a result of assisted conception in that subdivision B 2 of § 20-49.1 and subdivision A 3 of § 20-158 did not bar the parentage action on the basis, pursuant to subsection D of § 32.1-257, that the parties cohabited, but never married. Breit v. Mason, 59 Va. App. 322, 718 S.E.2d 482, 2 011 Va. App. LEXIS 414 (2011), aff'd, 285 Va. 163, 736 S.E.2d 711, 2013 Va. LEXIS 4 (2013). Trial court erred in dismissing a petition to determine parentage filed by the childs biological father, as subdivision A 3 of § 20-158 and subsection D of § 32.1-257 did bar an unmarried, biological father from establishing legal parentage of his child conceived through assisted conception, pursuant to a voluntary written agreement as authorized by subdivision B 2 of § 20-49.1.L.F. v.

Assisted conception not found.  Virginias assisted conception statute, § 20-156 et seq., was not applicable when a childs mother artificially inseminated herself with the fathers sperm without a physicians assistance through the use of a turkey baster in her own home because the mother did not become pregnant through conventional medical and surgical treatment in that the term medical technology as used in the statute did not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster.

Any provision in a surrogacy contr act that attempts to reduce the rights or responsibilities of the intended parent, the surrogate, or her spouse, if any, or the rights of any resulting child shall be reformed to include the requirements set forth in this chapter. A provision in the cont ract providing for compensation to be paid to the surrogate is void and unenforceable. Such surrogacy contracts shall be enforceable and shall be construed only as follows: 1. The s urrogate, her spouse, if any, and the intended parent shall be parties to any such surrogacy contract. 2. The contract shall be in writing, signed by all the parties, and acknowledged before an officer or other person authorized by law to take acknowledgments. 3. Upon expiration of three days following birth of any resulting child, the surrogate may relinquish her parental rights to the intended parent, if at least one intended parent is the ge netic parent of the child, or the embryo was subject to the legal or contractual custody of such intended parent, by signing a surrogate consent and report form naming the intended parent as the parent of the child.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the statement from the physician accurately states the genetic relationships among the child, the surrogate, and the intended parent. Where a physicians statement is not available and at least one intended pare nt is a genetic parent, DNA testing establishing the genetic relationships between the child, the surrogate, and the intended parent may be substituted for the physicians statement. 4. Upon the filing of the surrogate consent and report form and the required attachments, including the physicians statement, DNA testing establishing the genetic relationships betwee n the child, the surrogate, and the intended parent, or proof of the legal or contractual custody of the embryo, within 180 days of the birth, a new birth certificate shall be established by the State Registrar for the child naming the intended parent as the parent of the child as provided in § 32.1-261. B. Any contrac t governed by the provisions of this section shall include or, in the event such provisions are not explicitly covered in the contract or are included but are inconsistent with this section, shall be deemed to include the following provisions: 1.

If the surrogate is a genetic parent and voluntarily terminates the contract during the pregnancy, without consent of the intended parent, the intended parent shall be responsible for one-half of the reasonable medical and ancillary costs incurred prior to the termination. 3. If, after the birth of any resulting child, the surrogate is also a genetic parent and fails to relinquish parental rights to the intended parent pursuant to the contract, the intended parent shall be responsible for one-half of the reasonable medical and ancillary costs incurred prior to the birth.
