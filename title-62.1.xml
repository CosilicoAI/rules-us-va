At its regular session of 1966 the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to revise certain titles of the Code, including Title 62, relating to waters of t he State, ports and harbors. In December of 1967, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly a report containing the proposed revision of Title 62, which was published as House Document 9 of the 1968 session. This report contained revisor s notes and other explanatory matter. The Commissions draft of the revision of Title 62, as amended by the General Assembly, became chapter 659 of the Acts of 1968. Effective Oct. 1, 1968, it repealed Title 62 of the Code and enacted a new Title 62.1. Pursuant to § 30-152, the Code Commission incorporated in Title 62.1 the amendments to Title 62 enacted at the 1968 session of the General Assembly. Subsequently, Acts 1992, c. 836, which revised and recodified the tidal fishing and habitat laws of Virginia, by inter alia, adding a Title 28.2 and repealing Tit le 28.1, repealed §§ 62.1-1 through 62.1-4, 62.1-9.1, 62.1-13.1 through 62.1-13.20, 62.1-13.21 through 62.1-13.28, and 62.1-194.1:1. Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 62.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_62.1-5"><akn:num>§ 62.1-5</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1987, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>488.

The trial court should have, but did not, consider the settlement amount in determining the reasonable and necessary costs of the occurrence, as the reimbursement amount was neither limited to judgments nor the reduction in market value of the property damaged, especially since the goal of the laws regarding reimbursement was to protect the qua lity of state waters and prevent any increase in pollution. 7-Eleven, Inc. v.

Article I The Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin shall consist of three members from each signatory body and three members appointed by the President of the United States. Said Commissioners, other than those appointed by the President, shall be chosen in a manner and for the terms provided by law of the signatory body from which they are appointed and shall serve without compensation from the Commission but shall be paid by the Commission their actual expenses incurred and incident to the performance of their duties. (A) The Commission shall meet and organize within thirty days after the effective date of this compact, shall elect from its number a chairman and vice-chairman, shall adopt suitable bylaws, shall make, adopt, and promulgate such rules and regulations as are nec essary for its management and control, and shall adopt a seal. (B) The Commission shall appoint and, at its pleasure, remove or discharge such officers and legal, engineering, clerical, expert and other assistants as may be required to carry the pr ovisions of this compact into effect, and shall determine their qualifications and fix their duties and compensation. Such personnel as may be employed shall be employed without regard to any civil service or other similar requirements for employees of a ny of the signatory bodies. The Commission may maintain one or more offices for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place within the area of the signatory bodies. (C) The Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall make an annual report thereof and shall in such report set forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact. The Commission, however, shall not incur any obligations for administrative or other expenses prior to the making of appropriations adequate to meet the same nor shall it in any way pledge the credi t of any of the signatory bodies. Each of the signatory bodies reserves the right to make at any time an examination and audit of the accounts of the Commission. (D) A quorum of the Commission shall, for the transaction of business, the exercise of any powers, or the performance of any duties, consist of at least six members of the Commission wh o shall represent at least a majority of the signatory bodies; provided, however, that no action of the Commission relating to policy or stream classification or standards shall be binding on any one of the signatory bodies unless at least two of the Com missioners from such signatory body shall vote in favor thereof. Article II The Commission shall have the power: (A) To c ollect, analyze, interpret, coordinate, tabulate, summarize and distribute technical and other data relative to, and to conduct studies, sponsor research and prepare reports on, pollution and other water problems of the Conservancy District. (B) To cooperate with the legislative and administrative agencies of the signatory bodies, or the equivalent thereof, and with other commissions and federal, local governmental and nong overnmental agencies, organizations, groups and persons for the purpose of promoting uniform laws, rules or regulations for the abatement and control of pollution of streams and the utilization, conservation and development of the water and associated la nd resources in the said Conservancy District. (C) To disseminate to the public information in relation to stream pollution problems and the utilization, conservation and development of the water and associated land resources of the Conservancy District and on the aims, views, purposes and recommendations of the Commission in relation thereto. (D) To cooperate with, assist, and provide liaison for and among, public and nonpublic agencies and organizations concerned with pollution and other water problems in the formulation an d coordination of plans, programs and other activities relating to stream pollution or to the utilization, conservation or development of water or associated land resources, and to sponsor cooperative action in connection with the foregoing. (E) In its discretion and at any time during or after the formulation thereof, to review and to comment upon any plan or program of any public or private agency or organization relating to stream pollution or the utilization, conservation, or development of water or associated land resources. (F) (1) T o make, and, if needful from time to time, revise and to recommend to the signatory bodies, reasonable minimum standards for the treatment of sewage and industrial or other wastes now discharged or to be discharged in the future to the streams of the Con servancy District, and also, for cleanliness of the various streams in the Conservancy District. (2) To establish reasonable physical, chemical and bacteriological standards of water quality satisfactory for various classifications of use. It is agreed that each of the signatory bodies through appropriate agencies will prepare a classification of its interstate waters in the District in entirety or by portions according to present and proposed highest use, and for this purpose technical experts employed by appropriate state wat er pollution control agencies are authorized to confer on questions relating to classification of interstate waters affecting two or more states. Each signatory body agrees to submit its classification of its interstate waters to the Commission with its recommendations thereon. The Commission shall review such classification and recommendations and accept or return the same with its comments. In the event of return, the signatory body will con sider the comments of the Commission and resubmit the classification proposal, with or without amendment, with any additional comments for further action by the Commission. It is agreed that after acceptance of such classification, the signatory body through its appropriate state water pollution control agencies will work to establish prog rams of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes which will meet or exceed standards established by the Commission for classified waters. The Commission may from time to time make such changes in definitions of classifications and in standards as may be required by changed conditions or as may be necessary for uniformity and in a manner similar to that in which these standards and classifications were originally established. It is recognized, owing to such variable factors as location, size, character and flow and the many varied uses of the waters subject to the terms of this compact, that no single standard of sewage and waste treatment and no single standard of quality of receiving waters is practical and that the degree of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes should take into account the classification of the receiving waters acco rding to present and proposed highest use, such as for drinking water supply, bathing and other recreational purposes, maintenance and propagation of fish life, industrial and agricultural uses, navigation and disposal of wastes. Article III For the purposes of dealing with the problems of pollution and of water and associated land resources in specific areas which directly affect two or more, but not all, signatory bodies, the Commission may establish sections of the Commission consisting of the Commissioners from such affected signatory bodies; provided, however, that no signatory body may be excluded from any section in which it wishes to participate. T he Commissioners appointed by the President of the United States may participate in any section. The Commission shall designate, and from time to time may change, the geographical area with respect to which each section shall function. Each section shall , to such extent as the Commission may from time to time authorize, have authority to exercise and perform with respect to its designated geographical area any power or function vested in the Commission, and ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_62.1-66"><akn:num>§ 62.1-66</akn:num><akn:heading>Potomac River Basin Commission of Virginia</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text There is hereby created a Commission of three members to be known as the Potomac River Basin Commission of Virginia, but the Commission shall not come into being unless and until the Governor shall have executed the compact hereinabove authorized.

Each of the signatory states pledges to each of the other signatory states faithful cooperation in the control of future pollution in and abatement of existing pollutio n from the rivers, streams, and waters in the Ohio River Basin which flow through, into or border upon any of such signatory states, and in order to effect such object agrees to enact any necessary legislation to enable each such state to police and main tain the waters of that basin in a satisfactory sanitary condition, available for safe and satisfactory use as public and industrial water supplies after reasonable treatment, suitable for recreational usage, capable of maintaining fish and other aquatic life, free from unsightly or malodorous nuisances due to floating solids or sludge deposits, and adaptable to such other uses as may be legitimate. Article II. The signatory states hereby create a district to be known as the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation District, hereinafter called the district, which shall embra ce all territory within the signatory states, the water in which flows ultimately into the Ohio River, or its tributaries. Article III. The signatory states hereby create the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission, hereinafter called the Commission, which shall be a body corporate, with t he powers and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the signatory states or by act or acts of the Congress of the United States. Article IV. The Commission shall consist of three commissioners from each state, each of whom shall be a citizen of the state from which he is appointed, and three commissioners re presenting the United States government. The commissioners from each state shall be chosen in the manner and for the terms provided by the laws of the state from which they shall be appointed, and any commissioner may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state from which he shall be appointed. The Commissioners representing the United States shall be appointed by the President of the United States, or in such other manner as may be provided by Congress. The Commissioners sha ll serve without compensation, but shall be paid their actual expenses incurred in and incident to the performance of their duties; but nothing herein shall prevent the appointment of an officer or employee of any state or of the United States government .

The Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind prior to the making of appropriations adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Commission pledge the credit o f any of the signatory states, except by and with the authority of the legislature thereof. Article VI. It is recognized by the signatory states that no single standard for the treatment of sewage or industrial wastes is applicable in all parts of the district due to such variable factors as size, flow, location, character, self-purification, and usage of waters within the district. The guiding principle of this compact shall be that pollution by sewage or industrial wastes originating within a signatory state shall not injuriously affect the various uses of the interstate waters as hereinbefore defined. All sewage from municipalities or other political subdivisions, public or private institutions, or corporations, discharged or permitted to flow into these portions of the Ohio River and its tributary waters which form boundaries between, or are contiguous to, two or more signatory states, or which flow from one signatory state into another signatory state, shall be so treated, within a time reasonable for the construc tion of the necessary works, as to provide for substantially complete removal of settleable solids and the removal of not less than forty-five per centum of the total suspended solids; provided that, in order to protect the public health or to preserve t he waters for other legitimate purposes, including those specified in Article I, in specific instances such higher degree of treatment shall be used as may be determined to be necessary by the Commission after investigation, due notice and hearing. All industrial wastes discharged or permitted to flow into the aforesaid waters shall be modified or treated, within a time reasonable for the construction of the neces sary works, in order to protect the public health or to preserve the waters for other legitimate purposes, including those specified in Article I, to such degree as may be determined to be necessary by the Commission after investigation, due notice and h earing. All sewage or industrial wastes discharged or permitted to flow into tributaries of the aforesaid waters situated wholly within one state shall be treated to that exten t, if any, which may be necessary to maintain such waters in a sanitary and satisfactory condition at least equal to the condition of the waters of the interstate stream immediately above the confluence. The Commission is hereby authorized to adopt, prescribe and promulgate rules, regulations and standards for administering and enforcing the provisions of this article. Article VII. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit the powers of any signatory state, or to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or the enforcement of an y requirement by any signatory state, imposing additional conditions and restrictions to further lessen or prevent the pollution of waters within its jurisdiction. Article VIII. The Commission shall conduct a survey of the territory included within the district, shall study the pollution problems of the district, and shall make a comprehensive report for the prevention or reduction of stream pollution therein.

Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Waters within the Commonwealth.  The term waters of the Commonwealth is defined in this section to include navigable streams and any stream or part thereof . . . in which the construc tion of any dam or works as authorized by this chapter would affect the interests of interstate or foreign commerce. While the term waters within the Commonwealth is not defined, it is obviously meant to include all streams not described as waters of the Commonwealth. Vaughan v. VEPCO, 211 Va. 500, 178 S.E.2d 682, 1971 Va. LEXIS 201 (1971). Relationship of first and second portions of subdivision (c) construed.  Where it was contended that since the first portion of subdivision (c) of this section dealt with streams suitable for or used for water transportation, the secon d part dealing with works which would affect foreign or interstate commerce, under a familiar canon of construction, must deal with some other situation or be meaningless (that is to say, that it must apply whenever land-borne, foreign or interstate comm erce is affected), it was held that this was not necessarily true, as a case might arise where, without extending the second part to land-borne commerce, the construction put upon the portion by the Corporation Commission would be far from meaningless. G arden Club v. Virginia Pub. Serv. Co., 153 Va. 659, 151 S.E. 161, 1930 Va. LEXIS 260 (1930). Land-borne traffic in interstate commerce unaffected.  To extend the provision in subdivision (c) of this section to the interruption of land-borne traffic in interstate or foreign commerce, would hamper the growth of waterpower and would at times impose impossible burdens. Garden Club v. Virginia Pub. Serv. Co., 153 Va. 659, 151 S.E. 161, 1930 Va. LEXIS 260 (1930). The only traffic con templated being water-borne.  The only traffic contemplated under this section, whose interruption might necessitate the Commissions judgment, is water-borne traffic, that traffic possible on the waters of the State. Garden Club v. Virginia Pub. Serv. Co., 153 Va. 659, 151 S.E. 161, 1930 Va. LEXIS 260 (1930). Projects generating energy for the interstate transmission of electricity affect commerc e among the states. It follows that construction of the dam in and across the North Anna River as part of a project employing nuclear fuel in the production of electricity would affect the interests of interstate or foreign commerce within the me aning of this section and constitute that stream a water of the State under § 62.1-83. These circumstances required licensing of the project pursuant to § 62.1-85, thus vesting authority in the Commission to grant the license in question to VEPCO. Vaughan v. VEPCO, 211 Va. 500, 178 S.E.2d 682, 1971 Va. LEXIS 201 (1971). The necessity for relocating highways was held not to bring a case within the purview of this chapter. Garden Club v. Virginia Pub.

The purpose of this last provision is patent. It was designed to prevent preemption of dam sites taken to forestall competition, to prevent speculation and to force present adequat e development which without such safeguards might be retarded rather than promoted.

Such corporation may, by the exercise of such right for such purpose, acquire all necessary lands, property and rights of whatsoever nature, whether or not such lands, property or rights have been theretofore appropriated or devoted, or sought to be appropria ted or devoted to public use, including but not restricted to, the lands, property and rights necessary for any storage, diversion, regulation, detention, or interference with the flow of any water and for any waterway and including also, but not restric ted to, any lands, structures, property or rights owned, used or held by or for public or private, religious, charitable, educational or cemetery purposes; any dwelling houses and any public or private roads and bridges, and any other property, public or private, when necessary for such purpose; provided, however, that the right of eminent domain under this section shall not be available against existing public-carrier railroads; and provided further that, in the event of the condemnation under this cha pter of any roads or bridges, the commissioners or jurors in assessing the compensation and damages therefor, shall consider the cost of relocating and constructing such roads or bridges upon other reasonable convenient locations, and the damage, if any, to persons and corporations because of relocation and construction.

If the parties in interest fail to agree as to the location and area of the additional lands to be acquired in which to reinter the bodies and on which to rest the monuments and other structures, the same shall be determined by the court. 4. For the purpose of relocating any railway, pipeline, wire line, road or bridge occupying the area on which any such water-power development or enlargement thereof is to be located, suc h corporation may acquire by the exercise of the right of eminent domain, any needful additional lands or other property, whether within or without the area upon such water-power development or enlargement thereof is to be located, and shall have the rig ht for such purpose and shall convey such lands or other property or rights to the owner of such railway, pipeline, wire line, road or bridge. 5.

The cases below were decided under prior law. When inquisition sufficient.  The inquisition in a mill case is sufficient, where upon a fair and reasonable construction, it is substantially responsive to the requirements of the statute. Ma irs v. Gallahue, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 94, 1852 Va. LEXIS 53 (1852). Commissioners may name height of dam where application omits it.  Where the petition does not specify the height proposed to be erected, it is proper and correct for the commissioners to name that height in their inquisition. Ma irs v. Gallahue, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 94, 1852 Va. LEXIS 53 (1852). Duti es where application is to raise a dam already erected.  It is as necessary that an inquest should be had as to injuring the health of neighbors, obstructing navigation, etc., on an application to raise a milldam alread y erected as to construct it originally. The verdict in such case responding only to the damage done a contiguous owner by flooding his land and not to the health of neighbors, etc., is imperfect; and the inquest will be quashed. Kownslar v. Ward, 21 Va. (Gilmer) 127, 1820 Va. LEXIS 14 (1820). On a petition for leave to add to the height of a milldam, the only proper subject of inquiry is, what damages will be occasioned by the proposed addition. It is error, therefore, to direct the commissioners to assess such other damages, accruing from the dam already erected, as were not contemplated by the original jury (now commission). But an error in this respect should be regarded as surplusage, if the commi ssioners assessed such erroneous damages separately, and the court did not direct the same to be paid, but only the damages properly assessed. Eppes v. Cralle, 15 Va. (1 Munf) 258, 1810 Va. LEXIS 53 (1810). Accidental injury ne ed not be set forth in report.  It is not necessary that the inquisition should set forth the injury which the land below the dam may sustain through accidental means which might never occur. Wr oe v. Harris, 2 Va. (2 Wash.) 126, 2 Wash. 126, 1795 Va. LEXIS 18 (1795). And report need not set out by metes and bounds land injured.  It is not necessary in a mill case that the land injured should be set out by the metes and bounds, and the finding in the inquest that the proprietors land h ad been injured by the overflowing of the waters produced by the erection of the dam, and that the damages assessed were on that account, is sufficiently specific. Nash v. Upper Appomattox Co., 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 332, 1848 Va. LEXIS 49 (1848). Sufficient compliance where one commissioner signs report for others.  Where commissioners, appointed to inquire and report upon the propriety and expediency of flooding land by a milldam, meet upon the land and agree upon a report w hich they authorize one of their number to write out and sign for them, and such report is so written out and signed, and afterwards acknowledged and adopted by all the commissioners in open court, this is a reasonable and sufficient compliance with the law.

If it be granted, the court shall lay the applicant under such terms and conditions as shall seem to it right. It shall, in particular, provide, that ordinary navigation and the passage of fish shall not be obstructed, nor the convenien t crossing of the watercourse impeded; and where, under such leave, an existing mill, manufactory, machine, or engine is to be supplied with water by a canal, the court shall prescribe a time within which the dam, whereby water had before been supplied, shall be abated, which time shall not be more than one year from the completion of the canal. Whenever such leave is granted, the tenant of any land through which any canal may be cut, may cross it with such fencing, and bridges, and erect such water gat es as he may from time to time deem necessary, not obstructing the passage of the water to the mill, manufactory, machine, or engine.

The cases below were decided under prior law. When report of commissioners is conclusive against applicant.  The report of commissioners, duly appointed under the provisions of § 62.1-118, that if leave is granted to erect a milldam at a given place the health of the neighborhood will be annoyed by the stagnation of water caused by said pond producing malaria, chills and fever, is, under the provisions of this section, conclusive against the applicant to erect the dam, and no evidence will be heard against it .

CASE NOTES Virginia International Terminal not a mere alter ego of state.  While noting that Virginia International Terminal (VIT) has many attributes of a state agency, the court was compelled to place particular significance on the fac t that state treasury funds cannot be used to satisfy any judgment against VIT. This factor, combined with VITs independent corporate existence, compelled the conclusion that VIT is not a mere alter ego of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes. T his conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Virginia, by the attorney generals opinion, has expressed the view that VIT is not an agency of the state. Artist v.

All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments un der the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction and control of po rt facilities or the portion thereof for which such bonds shall have been issued, or, in the case of refunding bonds, to refund such bonds including any unpaid interest accrued and to accrue and any redemption premium thereon and all costs and expenses i ncident to the authorization and issuance of such bonds as shall be determined by the Authority upon the issuance of such refunding bonds, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the Authority may provide in the reso lution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the same.

If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed such cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for such bonds, or, if such bonds shall ha ve been issued for paying the cost of a portion of the project, such surplus may be applied to the payment of the cost of any remaining portion of the project.Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The Authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become m utilated or shall be destroyed or lost.The Authority shall not issue any bonds, other than revenue bonds or any refunding bonds issued by the Authority pursuant to the second paragraph of subsection B of § 62.1-140, which are not specifically authoriz ed by a bill or resolution passed by a majority vote of those elected to each house of the General Assembly. Refunding bonds may only be issued with the consent of the Governor. However, the Governor, in his sole discretion, may approve bonds which hav e not been authorized by the General Assembly if such bonds are to finance capital projects that emerge between legislative sessions, provided the debt is required to stimulate commerce consistent with § 62.1-132.3 and provided that: 1. The t otal amount of such bonds added to the total amount of Virginia Port Authority bonds currently authorized does not exceed the limit in § 62.1-140 B; 2. Funds are available within the appropriations, if needed, without adverse effect on other projects or programs, or from unappropriated nongeneral fund revenues or balances; 3. In the Governors opinion such action may result in a measurable benefit to the Commonwealth; 4. The authorization includes a detailed description of the project, the project need, the total project costs, the estimated operating costs, and the fund sources for the project and its operating costs; 5. The requirements of Chapter 11.1 (§ 10.1-1182 et seq.), Title 10.1, regarding environmental impact statements, will be met as a precondition for the approval of the project; and 6. The authorization of any such debt as provided for in this section shall be promptly communicated to the Chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees. History History.

Upon this soil, the owner may erect wharves, piers, or bulkheads for his own use, or the use of the public, subject to such rules and regulations as the General Assembly may impose for the publics protection, and the enjoyment of this right is made subject by this section to the limitation that its exercise shall not result in obstruction of navigation or in injury to private rights.

Carr v. Kidd, 261 Va. 81, 540 S.E.2d 884, 2001 Va. LEXIS 6 (2001). Pursuant to governing law, the property owners rights only extended to the low-water mark, and no further; title to land between the low-water mark and the li ne of navigability was in the Commonwealth, to be exercised for the benefit of the people, and, thus, the Commonwealth could and did authorize the State Marine Resources Commission to determine that the property owners roof and second-story deck adde d to his private pier without the State Marine Resources Commissions permission or approval violated the governing laws and had to be removed because they were not essential to the private piers placement for the limited purpose of accessing navi gable waters or vessels moored in those waters.

The cases below were decided under prior law. This chapter is not merely a criminal statute to prevent depredation of the shores of th e waters of the State by the indiscriminate removal of sand. United States v. Smoot Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., 248 F.2d 822, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4787 (4th Cir. 1957). It gives to riparian owner rights of which he cannot be divested without just compensation.  This chapter gives the owner of riparian land the right to dig and sell sand and gravel from deposits which extended uninterruptedly from low-water mark into abut ting tidal waters, and for the loss of this right through condemnation, the owner was entitled to be compensated. United States v. Smoot Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., 248 F.2d 822, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4787 (4th Cir. 1957). This does not mean that the State has divested itself of title to the land beyond the low-water mark. It has, however, conferred certain rights while retaining ti tle, and the riparian owner may not by condemnation be divested of these rights, which are valuable, without just compensation. United States v. Smoot Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., 248 F.2d 822, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4787 (4th Cir. 1957). Riparian rights have been extended to include the exclusive right to dredge, and to recover damages when this right has been infringed by anyone. Norfolk Dredging Co. v.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Authority within C ommerce and Trade Secretariat.  Virginia Resources Authority, as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth, is a state-created governmental entity within the Commerce and Trade Secretariat for state government organizational purposes; however, such inclusion does not alter the independent nature of the Authority to govern its own affairs in accordance with its enabling statutes.

This need can be alleviated in part through the creation of a resources authority. Its purpose is to encourage the investment of both public and private funds and to make loans, grants, and credit enhancements available to local governments to finance water and sewer projects, land conservation or land preservation programs or projects, oyster restoration projects, drainage projects, solid waste treatment, disposal and management projects, recycling projects, energy conservation and energy efficiency projects, professional sports facilities, resource recovery projects, pub lic safety facilities, airport facilities, the remediation of brownfields and contaminated properties including properties contaminated by defective drywall, the design and construction of roads, public parking garages and other public transportation fac ilities, and facilities for public transportation by commuter rail, site acquisition and site development work for the benefit of economic development projects, technology, construction of local government buildings, including administrative and operatio ns systems and other local government equipment and infrastructure, infrastructure for broadband services, recovered gas energy facilities, federal facilities or former federal facilities, and renewable energy projects. The General Assembly determines th at the creation of an authority for this purpose is in the public interest, serves a public purpose and will promote the health, safety, welfare, convenience or prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth.
