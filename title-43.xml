CASE NOTES General contractor broadly d efined.  For purposes of the mechanics lien provisions of this title, the term general contractor is definitionally broader than its colloquial counterpart. We st Alexandria Properties, Inc. v. First Va. Mtg. &amp; Real Estate Inv. Trust, 221 Va. 134, 267 S.E.2d 149, 1980 Va. LEXIS 224 (1980). There may be more than one general contractor.  Where several contractors contracted directly with the owner, under the statutory definition they were all general contractors. Northern Va.

Privity of contract.  A person making improvements to land is deemed a general contractor if that person is in contractual privity with the owner. West Alexandria Properties, Inc. v. F irst Va. Mtg. &amp; Real Estate Inv. Trust, 221 Va. 134, 267 S.E.2d 149, 1980 Va. LEXIS 224 (1980). Joint venturer.  Joint venturer could not enforce a mechanics lien for value of work done on co-joint venturers portion of land, which had been dedicated to the public, wh ere the remaining land of the co-joint venturer had been transferred to a third party in fee simple and who was never in contractual privity with the joint venturer seeking to enforce the lien.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Interpleader not allowed, as it would limit remedies under mechanics liens.  Trial court denied interpleader plaintiffs motion to interplead funds, pursuant to § 8.01-364, arising from a terminated construction contract dispute, whe re the amount sought to be tendered to the court was still subject to judicial determination and was not a set fund; additionally, the court noted that allowing such a motion and filing of funds would limit the remedy available to all defendants under th e mechanics lien statutes, § 43-1 et seq. Goel v. Osage Contr., Inc., 62 Va. Cir. 335, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 99 (Fairfax County July 22, 2003). Failure to perfect mechanics lien.  Subcontractor could not perfect a mechanics lien against a stores interest in property because it omitted the store from the memorandum of mechanics l ien and thus, failed to provide the store notice as owner of an interest in the property.

Text For the purpose of this chapter, a well, excavation, sidewalk, driveway, pavement, parking lot, retaining wall, curb and/or gutter, breakwater (either salt or fresh wat er), underground or field-constructed above-ground storage tank and connected dispensing equipment, water system, drainage structure, filtering system (including septic or waste disposal systems) or swimming pool shall be deemed a structure permanently a nnexed to the freehold, and all shrubbery, earth, sod, sand, gravel, brick, stone, tile, pipe or other materials, together with the reasonable rental or use value of equipment and any surveying, grading, clearing or earth moving required for the improvem ent of the grounds upon which such building or structure is situated shall be deemed to be materials furnished for the improvement of such building or structure and permanently annexed to the freehold. History History. Code 1919, § 6426; 1922, p. 867; 1932, p. 332; 1962, c. 152; 1 968, c. 568; 1976, c. 213; 1996, c. 513. Annotations CASE NOTES Items subject to lien rights.  Only those items specifically enumerated in this section are deemed a structure permanently annexed to the freehold and, therefore, subject to lien rights. Becaus e subdivision streets are not enumerated in this section such streets are not permanently annexed to the freehold. Likewise, the roads upon which plaintiff performed its work in the instant case cannot be deemed permanently annexed to the freehold under this section because roads are not specifically enumerated in this statute. Dominion Trust Co. v. Kenbridge Constr. Co., 248 Va. 393, 448 S.E.2d 659, 1994 Va. LEXIS 129 (1994). Items furnished to the hotel were not for the improvement of the building within the meaning of this section and the bankruptcy court erred by focusing solely on the removability of materials, as opposed to their connection to the encumbered property. Some greater connection to the building or structure was necessary in order to sustain a mechanics lien. Summit Cmty. Bank v. Blue Ridge Shadows Hotel &amp; Conf. C tr., 428 Bankr. 231, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32157 (W.D. Va. 2010).

Cole, 237 Va. 572, 379 S.E.2d 323, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2304, 1989 Va. LEXIS 72 (1989). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Proof that work description was inaccurate.  In a case in which a real estate company filed a motion for the release of a memorandum of mechanics lien filed by a contractor and the contractor replied tha t the description of work was inaccurate in that it omitted surveying done in the course of preparing the exhibits and, that in their view, they were entitled to cure the inaccuracy under § 43-15 because their memorandum substantially complied with th e statutory requirements of § 43-4, the contractor was entitled to present proof that the description of work was an inaccuracy within the meaning of § 43-15, and to establish whether the work fell within the class of work entitled to the protectio n of a mechanics lien under the statute.

All persons performing labor or furnishing materials of the value of $150 or more, including the reasonable rental or use value of equipment, for the construction, removal, repair or improvement of any building or structure permanently annexed to the freehold, and all persons performing any labor or furnishing materials of like value for the construction of any railroad, shall have a lien, if perfected as hereinafter provided, upon such building or structure, and so much land therewith as shall be necessary for th e convenient use and enjoyment thereof, and upon such railroad and franchises for the work done and materials furnished, subject to the provisions of § 43-20. But when the claim is for repairs or improvements to existing structures only, no lien shall attach to the property repaired or improved unless such repairs or improvements were ordered or authorized by the owner, or his agent.If the building or structure being constructed, removed or repaired is part of a condominium as defined in § 55.1-19 00 or under the Horizontal Property Act (§ 55.1-2000 et seq.), any person providing labor or furnishing material to one or more units or limited common elements within the condominium pursuant to a single contract may perfect a single lien encumbering the one or more units which are the subject of the contract or to which those limited common elements pertain, and for which payment has not been made. All persons providing labor or furnishing materials for the common elements pertaining to all the uni ts may perfect a single lien encumbering all such condominium units. Whenever a lien has been or may be perfected encumbering two or more units, the proportionate amount of the indebtedness attributable to each unit shall be the ratio that the percentage liability for common expenses appertaining to that unit computed pursuant to subsection D of § 55.1-1964 bears to the total percentage liabilities for all units which are encumbered by the lien. The lien claimant shall release from a perfected lien a n encumbered unit upon request of the unit owner as provided in subsection B of § 55.1-1908 upon receipt of payment equal to that portion of the indebtedness evidenced by the lien attributable to such unit determined as herein provided. In the event t he lien is not perfected, the lien claimant shall upon request of any interested party execute lien releases for one or more units upon receipt of payment equal to that portion of the indebtedness attributable to such unit or units determined as herein p rovided but no such release shall preclude the lien claimant from perfecting a single lien against the unreleased unit or units for the remaining portion of the indebtedness. B. Any person providing labor or materials for site development improvements or for streets, stormwater facilities, sanitary sewers or water lines for the purpose of providing access or service to the individual lots in a development or condominium units as defined in § 55.1-1900 or under the Horizontal Property Act (§ 55.1-2000 et seq.) shall have a lien on each individual lot in the development for the fractional part of the total value of the work contracted for by the claimant in the subdivision as is obtai ned by using one as the numerator and the number of lots being developed as the denominator and in the case of a condominium on each individual unit in an amount computed by reference to the liability of that unit for common expenses appertaining to that condominium pursuant to subsection D of § 55.1-1964, provided, however, that no such lien shall be valid as to any lot or condominium unit unless the person providing such work shall, prior to the sale of such lot or condominium unit, file wi th the clerk of the circuit court of the jurisdiction in which such land lies a document setting forth a full disclosure of the nature of the lien which may be claimed, the total value of the work contracted for by the claimant in the subdivision and the portion thereof allocated to each lot as required herein, and a description of the development or condominium, and shall, thereafter, comply with all other applicable provisions of this chapter. Site development improvements means improvements w hich are provided for the development, such as project site grading, traffic signalization, and installation of electric, gas, cable, or other utilities, for the benefit of the development rather than for an individual lot. In determining the individual lots in the development for the purpose of allocating value of the work contracted for by the claimant, parcels of land within the development which are common area, or which are being developed for the benefit of the development as a whole and not for r esale, shall not be included in the denominator of the disclosure statement.Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the filing of a mechanics lien under the provisions of subsection A, or require the lien claimant to elect under which subsection the lien may be enforced. C. Any right t o file or enforce any mechanics lien granted hereunder may be waived in whole or in part at any time by any person entitled to such lien, except that a general contractor, subcontractor, lower-tier subcontractor, or material supplier may not waive or diminish his lien rights in a contract in advance of furnishing any labor, services, or materials. A provision that waives or diminishes a general contractors, subcontractors, lower-tier subcontractors, or material suppliers lien rights in a contract executed prior to providing any labor, services, or materials is null and void. In the event that payments are made to the contractor without designating to which lot the payments are to be applied, the payments shall be deemed to apply to any lot previously sold by the developer such that the remaining lots continue to bear liability for an amount up to but not exceeding the amount set forth in any disclosure statement filed under the provisions of subsection B. D. A person wh o performs labor without a valid license or certificate issued by the Board for Contractors pursuant to Chapter 11 (§ 54.1-1100 et seq.) of Title 54.1, or without the proper class of license for the value of the work to be performed, when such a licen se or certificate is required by law for the labor performed shall not be entitled to a lien pursuant to this section.

Time of Filing. III. The Memorandum and Affidavit; Recordation and Indexing Thereof. I.General Consideration. The provisions of this chapter are, each and all, indispensable to the creation of the l ien; hence if any one of them is not complied with, no lien is acquired. Trustees Franklin St. Church v. Davis, 85 Va. 193, 7 S.E. 245, 1888 Va. LEXIS 27 (1888). Perfection of mechanics liens is completed upon filing the memorandum required by th is section and does not involve the separate, second step of filing an enforcement suit under § 43-22; once a memorandum is properly filed in proper form perfection is complete. Concrete Structures, Inc. v. Tidewater Crane and Rigging Co., 261 Bankr. 627, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3675 (E.D. Va. 2001). The 150-day limitation period is one of the prerequisites, etc. required by this section in order to perfect a mechanics lien, and violation of this rule renders the entire mechanics lien unenforceable. Carolina Builders Corp. v. Cenit Equity Co., 257 Va. 405, 512 S.E.2d 550, 1999 Va. LEXIS 28 (1999). Suppliers mechanics liens were invalid and unenforceable under § 43-4 because they included sums due for materials furnished more than 150 days prior t o the last day on which materials were supplied to the jobs preceding the filing of the memoranda; the supplier violated one of the prerequisites required by § 43-4 in order to perfect its mechanics liens, and § 43-15 had no application. Smith Mt. Bldg. Supply, LLC v. Windstar Props., LLC, 277 Va. 387, 672 S.E.2d 845, 2009 Va. LEXIS 24 (2009). Perfection statute contrasted with enforcement statutes.  A lien created by § 43-3 is one in derogation of the common law. Once perfected in accordance with this section, the lien can be enforced by suit brought as p rovided in §§ 43-17 and 43-22. In Virginia provisions of the enforcement statutes are to be construed liberally while the requirements of the perfection statute are to be construed strictly. American Std. Homes Corp. v. Reinecke, 245 Va. 113, 425 S.E.2d 515, 9 Va. Law Rep. 776, 1993 Va. LEXIS 5 (1993). Legislative intent.  Recognizing that 150-day limitation period might necessitate that claimant file multiple liens during the course of a construction project, the legislature specif ically authorized the filing of any number of memoranda. Therefore, a correct application of the statutory 150-day limitation period does not render meaningless the 90-day filing limitation, but instead comports with the legislatures desire t o prevent undisclosed or inchoate liens. Carolina Builders Corp. v. Cenit Equity Co., 257 Va. 405, 512 S.E.2d 550, 1999 Va. LEXIS 28 (1999). Interest allowed in excess of legal rate on debts underlying liens.  Materialmans right to a mechanics lien included interest on the unpaid cost of material furnished at a rate fixed in its contract in excess of the legal r ate. American Std. Homes Corp. v. Reinecke, 245 Va. 113, 425 S.E.2d 515, 9 Va. Law Rep. 776, 1993 Va. LEXIS 5 (1993). Chancellor did not err in excluding attorneys fees as an element of the liens enforc ed by the final decree. The General Assembly expressly approved inclusion of interest as an element of the claim in the perfection and enforcement of a mechanics lien. The legislature was at liberty to do, but did not do, the same for attorneys fees. American Std. Homes Corp. v. Reinecke, 245 Va. 113, 425 S.E.2d 515, 9 Va. Law Rep. 776, 1993 Va. LEXIS 5 (1993). A substantial compliance with this section is essential to the creation of the lien. Gil man v. Ryan, 95 Va. 494, 28 S.E. 875, 1898 Va. LEXIS 5 (1898).

CASE NOTES Relation back of perfection may defeat rights of bankruptcy trustee.  So long as state law permits a relation-back type of perfection which would defeat an intervening lien creditor, 11 U.S.C. § 546(b) allows the creditor to perf ect and allows the relation-back feature to defeat the rights of the bankruptcy trustee. The Virginia mechanics lien statutes allow for such a relation back. H.T. Bowling, Inc. v. Bain, 52 Bankr. 58, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5430 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1985), aff 'd in part and rev'd in part, 64 Bankr. 581, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26191 (W.D. Va. 1986). Determining substantial compliance.  Verification requirement for the memoranda was substantially met where the trustee was confused or misled in anyway by the signature of the design firms vice- president, and the memoranda clearly identified the design firm as the claimant. Ulka Desai v. A. R. Design Grp., Inc., 293 Va. 426, 799 S.E.2d 506, 2017 Va. LEXIS 76 (2017). Design firm was entitled to the safe harbor of § 43-5 where the memoranda closely tracked the required form, they sufficiently noticed that the owner claimed t he amount due, and any defect did not thwart notice to third parties. Ulka Desai v. A. R. Design Grp., Inc., 293 Va. 426, 799 S.E.2d 506, 2017 Va. LEXIS 76 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure of memorandum of mechanics lien to substantially conform.  Memorandum of mechanics lien failed to comply with the requirements of §§ 43-4 and 43-5 because the affidavit wholly failed to identify the capacity of the person executing the document on behalf of the complainant or the agent or that such person was an agent for the complainant; because the claimant was a corporation, its oath had to be verified by its agent, and there was no indication that the perso n making the oath possessed any such authority.

Any subcont ractor, in order to perfect the lien given him by § 43-3 shall comply with § 43-4, and in addition give notice in writing to the owner of the property or his agent of the amount and character of his claim. But the amount for which a subcontractor m ay perfect a lien under this section shall not exceed the amount in which the owner is indebted to the general contractor at the time the notice is given, or shall thereafter become indebted to the general contractor upon his contract with the general co ntractor for such structure or building or railroad. It shall be an affirmative defense or affirmative partial defense, as the case may be, to a suit to perfect a lien of a subcontractor that the owner is not indebted to the general contractor or is inde bted to the general contractor for less than the amount of the lien sought to be perfected. B. Where the p roperty referred to in subsection A hereof is a time-share unit, as defined by § 55.1-2200, the word agent, as used in subsection A, shall be deemed to include the developer, during the developer control period, or the time-share estate owners  association, after the developer control period.Within ten days of receipt of the notice, the developer or the time-share estate owners association shall mail by first class mail a copy of the notice to all time-share estate owners whose interes ts are affected by the subcontractors lien on the time-share unit. Failure on the part of the developer or time-share estate owners association to so notify the appropriate time-share estate owners within the time period set forth above shall res ult in the developers or the associations being liable for the full amount of the subcontractors claim, but such failure shall not affect the validity of any lien perfected under this section. Assessments levied by the estate owners assoc iation to pay the liability hereby imposed shall be made only against the time-share estate owners of record in the time-share estate project at the time the liability was incurred. C. Where the p roperty referred to in subsection A hereof is a time-share unit, as defined by § 55.1-2200, the memorandum required to be filed pursuant to § 43-4 need show only the name of the developer during the developer control period, or the time-share estat e owners association, after the developer control period.

No. 6-506 Memorandum for Mechanics Lien by Subcontractor; No. 6-507 Memorandum for Mechanics Lien by Subcontractor  P reprinted Form. CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Consideration. II. Notice. I.General Consideration. Optional remedies of subcontractor.  The subcontractor, under the provisions of § 43-18, may rely on the general contractors lien or, under the provisions of this section and §§ 43-3 and 43-4, he may file and undertake to enforce his own independent lien. VNB Mtg. Corp. v. Lone Star Indus., Inc., 215 Va. 366, 209 S.E.2d 909, 1974 Va. LEXIS 293 (1974). Subcontractors and materialmen are not deprived of their independent liens unless they e ither expressly waived their lien rights or expressly accepted, or by clear implication, agreed to be bound by the general contractors stipulation in the general contract against liens. VNB Mtg. Corp. v. Lone Star Indus., Inc., 215 Va. 366, 209 S.E.2 d 909, 1974 Va. LEXIS 293 (1974). This section was designed to protect subcontractors, and create a liability which would not otherwise exist. Coleman v. Pearman, 159 Va. 72, 165 S.E. 371, 1932 Va. LEXIS 175 (1932), overruled, Mills v. Moore's Super Stores, 217 Va. 276, 227 S.E.2d 719, 1976 Va. LEXIS 271 (1976). But the terms of the section must be met before its benefits can be enjoyed. Coleman v. Pearman, 159 Va. 72, 165 S.E. 371, 1932 Va. LEXIS 175 (1932), overruled, Mills v. Moore's Super Stores, 217 Va. 276, 227 S.E.2d 719, 1976 Va. LEXIS 271 (1976). Substantial compliance is essential.  A substantial compliance with this section is essential to the creation of the lien. Gilman v. Ryan, 95 Va. 494, 28 S.E. 875, 1898 Va. LEXIS 5 (1898). There must be a substantial compliance with that portion of this chapter which relates to the creation of the lien, although the provisions with respect to its en forcement should be liberally construed. H.N. Francis &amp; Co. v. Hotel Rueger, Inc., 125 Va. 106, 99 S.E. 690, 1919 Va. LEXIS 12 (1919) (see Clement v. Adams Bros.-Paynes Co., 113 Va. 546, 75 S.E. 294 (1912); Maddux v. Buchanan, 121 Va. 102, 92 S.E. 830 (1 917); Coleman v. Pearman, 159 Va. 72, 165 S.E. 371 (1932), overruled on other grounds, Mills v. Moores Super Stores, 217 Va. 276, 227 S.E.2d 719 (1976)). The limitations of this section are for the protection of the owner from double liabilit y. Concrete Ready-Mix of Lynchburg, Inc. v. County Green Ltd. Partnership, 438 F. Supp. 701, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14474 (W.D. Va. 1977), rev'd, 604 F.2d 289, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 12803 (4th Cir. 1979). The statutory limitation of the owners liability is designed to relieve the owner of the possibility of having to make double payment under the contract. Sini crope v. Black Diamond Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 21 Bankr. 476, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 4248 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1982). Under this section, the owner is the same person who is referred to in § 43-4. Wallace v. Brumback, 177 Va. 36, 12 S.E.2d 801, 1941 Va. LEXIS 194 (1941). Owners liability on mechanics liens is limited by statute to the amount of the r etainage. Sinicrope v. Black Diamond Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 21 Bankr. 476, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 4248 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1982). Surety s liability not affected.  The limitation of the owners liability to the amount remaining unpaid under the contract in no way affects the liability of the surety. Sinicrope v. Black Dia mond Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 21 Bankr. 476, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 4248 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1982). Mechanics liens cannot be perfected against public buildings and other public improv ements. Thomas Somerville Co. v. Broyhill, 200 Va. 358, 105 S.E.2d 824, 1958 Va. LEXIS 196 (1958). Work must be performed or material furnished.  Before a subcontractor is entitled to claim a lien on a building he must, under his contract with the general contractor, have performed some work or furnished so me material for which the general contractor is under contractual obligation to pay. John T. Wilson Co. v. McManus, 162 Va. 130, 173 S.E. 361, 1934 Va. LEXIS 241 (1934). It is apparent from the language of § 43-4 that no lien can be perfected under this section before the work for which the subcontractor engages is done, i.e., before his contract is completed. Moore v. Rolin, 89 Va. 107, 15 S.E. 520, 1892 Va. LEXIS 77 (1892). Owner must be indebted to general contractor.  Where it satisfactorily appears from the evidence that there was no time after notice to the defendant owner of the claim of the subcontractors when he was indebt ed in any amount to the general contractor, the owner was under no liability towards the subcontractors. Maddux v. Buchanan, 121 Va. 102, 92 S.E. 830, 1917 Va. LEXIS 14 (1917). The owner, at or after the time it was notified of the lienors claim, was not indebted to the general contractor. It follows that the trial court did not err in ruling that the mechanics lien could not be enforced against the owners property. Henderson &amp; Russell Assocs. v. Warwick Shopping Center, Inc., 217 Va. 486, 229 S.E.2d 878, 1976 Va. LEXIS 309 (1976). And general contractor must be indebted to subcontractor.  If the general contractor is not indebted to the subcontractor, the subcontractor is not entitled to a lien. John T. Wilson Co. v. McManus, 162 Va. 130, 173 S.E. 361, 1934 Va. LEXIS 241 (1934). Extent of lien is limited by amount of indebtedness.  A well-defined legislative policy in Virginia, as expressed in this section and §§ 43-9, 43-11 and 43-16, is that generally the extent of the liability of a n owner to a subcontractor or subcontractors is limited to the amount in which the owner is indebted to the general contractor at the time notice to the owner is given by the subcontractor or subcontractors. This policy likely found its source in what is known as the New York System, under which the lien of a subcontractor or materialman depends on, and is limited by, the amount remaining due the general contractor at or subsequent to notice by the subcontractor served on the owner. Nicholas v. Miller, 182 Va. 831, 30 S.E.2d 696, 1944 Va. LEXIS 239 (1944) (see Maddux v. Buchanan, 121 Va. 102, 92 S.E. 830 (1917)). The maximum amount for which the subcontractor is entitled to claim a lien is governed by the condition of accounts between the owner and the general contractor a t the time notice is given. John T. Wilson Co. v. McManus, 162 Va. 130, 173 S.E. 361, 1934 Va. LEXIS 241 (1934). Under this section, a subcontractor may perfect his own lien, but the amount secured by this lien cannot exceed the amount in which the owner is indebted to th...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_43-8"><akn:num>§ 43-8</akn:num><akn:heading>Sufficiency of memorandum, affidavit and notice required by § 43-7</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The memorandum, affidavit and notice required by § 43-7 shall be sufficient if substantially in form and effect as follows: Memorandum for Mechanics Lien Claimed by Subcontractor.

No. 6-506 Memorandum for Mechanics Lien by Subcontractor. CASE NOTES Relation back of perfection may defeat rights of bankruptcy trustee.  So long as state law permits a relation-back type of perfection which would defeat an intervening lien creditor, 11 U.S.C. § 546(b) allows the creditor to perf ect and allows the relation-back feature to defeat the rights of the bankruptcy trustee. The Virginia mechanics lien statutes allow for such a relation back. H.T. Bowling, Inc. v. Bain, 52 Bankr. 58, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5430 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1985), aff 'd in part and rev'd in part, 64 Bankr. 581, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26191 (W.D. Va. 1986). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Claimant not properly identified.  Subcontractor could not perfect a mechanics lien against a stores interest in property because it omitted the store from the memorandum of mechanics l ien and thus, failed to provide the store notice as owner of an interest in the property. Lin R. Rogers Elec. Contrs. Inc. v. Flynn Constr. Mgmt. Gen. Contr., Inc., 99 Va. Cir. 515, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 367 (Essex County Dec. 9, 2010).

No. 6-508 Memorandum for Mechanics Lien by Sub-subcontractor; No. 6-509 Memorandum for Mechanics Lien by Sub-Subcontracto r  Preprinted Form. CASE NOTES The language of this section is plain and unambiguous, and its meaning reasonably clear. John T. Wilson Co. v. McManus, 162 Va. 130, 173 S.E. 361, 1934 Va. LEXIS 241 (1934). Sub-subcontractors are placed on same basis as subcontractors.  By this section the legislature has placed those who under agreement with a subcontractor perform work or furnish material used in the building on the same basis as a subcontractor. John T. Wilson Co. v. McManus, 162 Va. 130, 173 S.E. 361, 1934 Va. LEXIS 241 (1934). Lien must be filed within time prescribed by § 43-4.  A claim of mechanics lien filed by a sub-subcontractor more than 60 days after work on a building has terminated and the owner has accepted it, and settled wi th the general contractor, comes too late. The filing of the claim within the time prescribed by § 43-4 is one of the essential requisites in perfecting the lien. If not so filed no lien is acquired. Furst-Kerber Cut Stone Co. v. Wells, 116 Va. 95, 81 S.E. 22, 1914 Va. LEXIS 12 (1914). General co ntractor must be indebted to subcontractor.  By virtue of the last sentence of this section, one furnishing materials or performing labor for a subcontractor is not entitled to lien unless the general contra ctor is indebted at the time the notice is served, or thereafter becomes indebted, to the subcontractor under the contract. John T. Wilson Co. v. McManus, 162 Va. 130, 173 S.E. 361, 1934 Va. LEXIS 241 (1934). Under this section, the owner is the same person who is referred to in § 43-4. Wallace v. Brumback, 177 Va. 36, 12 S.E.2d 801, 1941 Va. LEXIS 194 (1941). Mechanics liens cannot be perfected against public buildings and other public improv ements. Thomas Somerville Co. v. Broyhill, 200 Va. 358, 105 S.E.2d 824, 1958 Va. LEXIS 196 (1958). Effect of failure to perfect lien.  If a materialman fails to perfect a mechanics lien on the building into which his materials are placed, the amount due him therefor by a subcontractor is a ge neral unsecured debt due to the materialman, and upon the bankruptcy of the subcontractor, the amount due him by the general contractor passes to his trustee as assets of the bankrupt. Furst-Kerber Cut Stone Co. v. Wells, 116 Va. 95, 81 S.E. 22, 1914 Va. LEXIS 12 (1914). Relation back of perfection may defeat rights of bankruptcy trustee.  So long as state law permits a relation-back type of perfection which would defeat an intervening lien creditor, 11 U.S.C. § 546(b) allows the creditor to perf ect and allows the relation-back feature to defeat the rights of the bankruptcy trustee. The Virginia mechanics lien statutes allow for such a relation back. H.T. Bowling, Inc. v. Bain, 52 Bankr. 58, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5430 (Bankr. W.D.

Any subcont ractor or person furnishing labor or material to the general contractor or subcontractor, may give a preliminary notice in writing to the owner or his agent or the general contractor, stating the nature and character of his contract and the probable amou nt of his claim. 2. Additionall y, if such subcontractor, or person furnishing labor or material shall at any time after the work is done or material furnished by him and before the expiration of thirty days from the time such building or structure is completed or the work thereon othe rwise terminated furnish the owner thereof or his agent and also the general contractor, or the general contractor alone in case he is the only one notified, with a second notice stating a correct account, verified by affidavit, of his actual claim again st the general contractor or subcontractor, for work done or materials furnished and of the amount due, then the owner, or the general contractor, if he alone was notified, shall be personally liable to the claimant for the actual amount due to the subco ntractor or persons furnishing labor or material by the general contractor or subcontractor, provided the same does not exceed the sum in which the owner is indebted to the general contractor at the time the second notice is given or may thereafter becom e indebted by virtue of his contract with the general contractor, or in case the general contractor alone is notified the sum in which he is indebted to the subcontractor at the time the second notice is given or may thereafter become indebted by virtue of his contract with the general contractor.

DeWitt v. Coffey, 150 Va. 365, 143 S.E. 710, 1928 Va. LEXIS 319 (1928). There is no conflict between this section and §§ 43-19 through 43-21. DeWitt v. Co ffey, 150 Va. 365, 143 S.E. 710, 1928 Va. LEXIS 319 (1928). This section is not exclusive.  The subcontractor can, by mutual agreement with the owner, still have the latter guarantee his account, and if the owner does so, he is entitled to deduct the amo unt so guaranteed from the contract price, both as against the general contractor and the other subcontractors. This rule applies especially when it is reasonably necessary to do so in order to complete the building, and this is true even when it would r esult in a preference of one subcontractor over another. Nicholas v. Miller, 182 Va. 831, 30 S.E.2d 696, 1944 Va. LEXIS 239 (1944). Laborers and materialmen may obtain additional security in three ways.  Laborers and materialmen unwilling to extend credit to a general contractor may obtain additional security: (1) by taking the steps prescribed by this section to fasten personal responsibility upon the owner; (2) by filing separate and independent liens under § 43-7; (3) by taking advantage of a lien perfected by the general contractor. Coleman v. Pearman, 159 Va. 72, 165 S.E. 371, 1932 Va. LEXIS 175 (1932), o verruled, Mills v. Moore's Super Stores, 217 Va. 276, 227 S.E.2d 719, 1976 Va. LEXIS 271 (1976). The methods open to materialmen for obtaining additional security for their claims out of the funds due or to become due under a building contract are: (1) by tak ing the steps prescribed in this section to fasten personal liability upon the owner; (2) by filing separate and independent liens under § 43-9; and (3) by taking advantage of a lien perfected by the general contractor. Perrin &amp; Martin, Inc. v. United States, 233 F. Supp. 1016, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9654 (E.D. Va. 1964). Deduction of obligation owner required to incur to complete building.  While it is true that under this section the owner, under certain conditions, may be made personally liable to a subcontractor, yet this liability is not permitte d to exceed the sum in which the owner is indebted to the general contractor at the time he receives notice of the mechanics lien, and such indebtedness excludes the obligation the owner may have been required to incur in order to complete the buildi ng, so that what remains in the owners hands after deducting such an obligation is applicable to the liens of the subcontractors, under this section. Nicholas v. Miller, 182 Va. 831, 30 S.E.2d 696, 1944 Va. LEXIS 239 (1944)See § 43-16. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Owner must be indebted to general contractor.  In five consolidated actions by subcontractors to perfect mechanics liens, a property owners plea in bar was granted relying on an affirmative defense und er §§ 43-7 and 43-11 that the owner was not indebted to the general contractor where the owners obligation to pay the general contractor depended upon financing and, although it made great efforts, the owner was unable to secure financing. W.O . Grubb Steel Erection, Inc. v. 515 Granby, L.L.C., 78 Va. Cir. 463, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 185 (Norfolk Aug. 14, 2009). Failure to file lien.  Because a subcontractor established the trifecta of quantum meruit elements, and because a decision on the issue of equitable preclusion regarding the subcontract ors failure to timely file a mechanics lien in accordance with § 43-11 was premature, the owners demurrer was overruled. Gutterman Iron &amp; Metal Corp. v. Figg Bridge Developers, L.L.C., 82 Va. Cir. 304, 2011 Va. Cir.

The use by any such contractor or subcontractor or any officer, director, or employee of such contractor or subcontractor of any moneys paid under the contract before p aying all amounts due or to become due for labor performed or material furnished for such building or structure for any other purpose than paying such amounts due on the project shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud. Any breach or violation of this section may give rise to a civil cause of action for a party in contract with the general contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate; however, this right does not affect a contractors or subcontractors right to withhold payment for failu re to properly perform labor or furnish materials on the project. Any contract or subcontract provision that allows a contracting party to withhold funds due under one contract or subcontract for alleged claims or damages due on another contract or subco ntract is void as against public policy.

CASE NOTES Object of section.  This section has for its object additional protection and security to subcontractors, laborers, or materialmen furnishing labor or material for work undertaken by the contractor, as well as to relieve the owner of claims, liens, and litigation. Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875, 1951 Va. LEXIS 244 (1951). This section was enacted in the exercise of the police power, in that its object is the prevention of fraud, and it becomes a part of every contract covered by it s terms. Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875, 1951 Va. LEXIS 244 (1951). The object of this section is to prevent the misappropriation of funds, and it is not designed to imprison for debt. Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S .E.2d 875, 1951 Va. LEXIS 244 (1951). The purpose of this section is not for collection of the debt but punishment for the fraud. Salecki v. Virginia, 51 Bankr. 364, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5767 (Bankr. E.D . Va. 1985). This section does not expressly provide for any private right of action imposing civil liability, and a private right of action cannot be implied by the provisions of this section. Vansant &amp; Gusler, Inc. v. Washington, 245 Va. 356, 429 S.E.2d 31, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1177, 1993 Va. LEXIS 72 (1993). This section is a criminal statute. This statute extends the definition of larceny in Vi rginia beyond the traditional common law meaning. Specifically, this section determines that a contractors use of funds for a purpose other than to pay the provider of materials is prima facie evidence of larceny. The purpose of the statute is to p unish fraud; prosecution of a contractor for violating this code section does not affect the debt itself. Builders Supply Co. v. Lane, 115 Bankr. 81, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 1250 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1990). This section does not interfere with the liberty to contract, since contractors enter in to their engagements with the knowledge of the statute just as they enter into their engagements with the knowledge of other statutes relating to mechanics and materialmens liens. Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875, 1951 Va. L EXIS 244 (1951). It is the intent to defraud and not the indebtedness which is made the determining feature in establishing guilt under this section. Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875, 1951 Va. LEXIS 244 (1951); Perrin &amp; Martin, Inc. v. United States, 233 F. Supp. 1016, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9654 (E.D. Va. 1964). A prosecution under this section does not affect the debt owed by the contractor. Overstr eet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875, 1951 Va. LEXIS 244 (1951). Intent of second paragraph.  The second paragraph of this section was intended to relieve the Commonwealth from the necessity of producing further specific proof of intent to defraud, when ci rcumstances reveal personal use of moneys paid under contract by the contractor. Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875, 1951 Va. LEXIS 244 (1951). Former penalty provisions construed.  See Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875, 1951 Va. LEXIS 244 (1951). Interpretation of civil statutes not changed by Overstreet v. Commonwealth.  Overstreet v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875 (1951), does not, by the application of a criminal statute, change the Supreme Courts interpretation of civil statutes governing the relationship of subcontractors and materialmen. Perrin &amp; Martin, Inc. v. United States, 233 F. Supp. 1016, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9654 (E.D. Va. 1964). Funds not held in trust.  Funds retained by a contractor from payments made by the owner and owing to the subcontractors are not held in trust for the benefit of the subcontractors. Glen C onstr. Co. v. Bank of Vienna, 410 F. Supp. 402, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15749 (E.D. Va. 1976), rev'd, 557 F.2d 1050, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 12629 (4th Cir. 1977). While this criminal statute creates a moral obligation, it contains no language creating a legal trust for the benefit of materialmen and laborers. Nor does it pu rport to affect or extend the rights and remedies otherwise available in a civil proceeding to materialmen and workmen under the mechanics lien statutes. Kayhoe Constr. Corp. v. United Va. Bank, 220 Va. 285, 257 S.E.2d 837, 1979 Va. LEXIS 261 (1979). Therefore, a general contractor would not be entitled under a trust theory to recovery o n behalf of two unpaid suppliers of a subcontractor of payments received by the subcontractor as partial payments to the suppliers but paid by the subcontractor to the bank. Kayhoe Constr. Corp. v. United Va. Bank, 220 Va. 285, 257 S.E.2d 837, 1979 Va. L EXIS 261 (1979). Bankruptcy court refused to enjoin a prosecution under this section against a debtor, wh ere the court was unable to conclude that the Commonwealth was using a criminal proceeding to compel payment of a debt discharged in bankruptcy. Salecki v. Virginia, 51 Bankr. 364, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5767 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). Where criminal action under this section is instituted some time prior to filing of bankruptcy petition, a rational conclusion may be reached that its purpose was not to force collection of the debt. Where the criminal action is instituted at approximately the same time the rationalization is less clear and not as compelling. Salecki v. Vi rginia, 51 Bankr. 364, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5767 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). Larceny found.  Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for larceny because it was defendants duty, as a general contractor retained to build a home, to use the funds received by defendant from the buyers of the home for the payment of subcontractor and supplier accounts before using them for any other purpose. However, defendants failure to provide an accounting for the funds that the buyers paid de fendant constituted prima facie evidence of intent to defraud, but defendant was unable to produce evidence to the contrary. Holloway v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 25, 2014). Larceny not found.  Although a debtor received payment from construction projects but failed to distribute the funds to subcontractors and laborers, he received the funds lawfully un der contract, which did not constitute federal common-law larceny; for purposes of 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4), whether larceny exists is a matter of federal law and not with debtors failure to comply with this section, the debt is therefore discharge able.

Metro Printing &amp; Mailing Servs., Inc., 229 Va. 150, 326 S.E.2d 662, 1985 Va. LEXIS 186 (1985). Defects not ment ioned in this section are not cured.  The legislature in this section having designated but two defects that could be disregarded, it would seem that, under the doctrine of inclusio unius, exclusio al terius, it intended that defects not mentioned were to be regarded. Clement v. Adams Bros.-Paynes Co., 113 Va. 546, 75 S.E. 294 (1912). Duty to pl ace lien only upon property worked and no more.  Where a mechanic files a memorandum of mechanics lien against two or more parcels but has not worked on all the parcels and where the mechanic attempts to enf orce that lien against the several properties, that lien must be declared invalid in its entirety since it is the mechanics duty to place his lien upon the property on which he worked and no more. Woodington Elec., Inc. v. Lincoln Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 238 Va. 623, 385 S.E.2d 872, 6 Va. Law Rep. 780, 1989 Va. LEXIS 161 (1989). Substantial compliance is essential.  To obtain the benefit of this section the provisions of §§ 43-5, 43-8 and 43-10 must be substantially complied with. H.N. Francis &amp; Co. v. Hotel Rueger, Inc ., 125 Va. 106, 99 S.E. 690, 1919 Va. LEXIS 12 (1919). By this section a substantial compliance is declared to be sufficient, but nothing less than a substantial compliance will answer. Gilman v. Ryan, 95 Va. 494, 28 S.E. 875, 1898 Va. LEXIS 5 (1898). Determining substantial compliance.  To determine whether a lienors actions substantially complied with § 43-4, a courts inquiry should be directed to whether the filing put the world on n otice of the lienors claim. The creditor substantially complied with the requirements of § 43-4 when it listed only one co-owner of real property held as tenants by the entirety on the Memorandum of Mechanics Lien, because its filing satisfied the essential purpose of that statute. Kiser v. Russell County, 344 Bankr. 423, 2003 Bankr. LEXIS 2212 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2003). This section not applicable where the lien is invalid and unenforceable.  Suppliers mechanics liens were invalid and unenforceable under § 43-4 because they included sums due for materials furnished more than 150 days prior t o the last day on which materials were supplied to the jobs preceding the filing of the memoranda; the supplier violated one of the prerequisites required by § 43-4 in order to perfect its mechanics liens, and § 43-15 had no application. Smith Mt. Bldg. Supply, LLC v. Windstar Props., LLC, 277 Va. 387, 672 S.E.2d 845, 2009 Va. LEXIS 24 (2009). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Work description inaccuracy.  In a case in which a real estate company filed a motion for the release of a memorandum of mechanics lien filed by a contractor and the contractor replied tha t the description of work was inaccurate in that it omitted surveying done in the course of preparing the exhibits and, that in their view, they were entitled to cure the inaccuracy under § 43-15 because their memorandum substantially complied with th e statutory requirements of § 43-4, the contractor was entitled to present proof that the description of work was an inaccuracy within the meaning of § 43-15, and to establish whether the work fell within the class of work entitled to the protectio n of a mechanics lien under the statute. BP Realty, LP v. Urban Eng'g &amp; Assocs., Inc., 79 Va. Cir. 176, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 48 (Fairfax County Aug. 4, 2009). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Notice requirements.  Notice stating that the owner is notified of the filing of a lien that is recorded with a general contractors mechanics lien, which merely indicates on it s face that it is addressed to the owner at its last known address and lists the certified mail number, is not sufficient to satisfy the strict statutory requirement of § 43-4. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Ken Cuccinelli, II, Membe r, Senate of Virginia, 09-005, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 24 (7/8/09). A lien that does not contain the particular mailing certification language, does not meet the definition of inaccuracy adopted by the Virginia Supreme Cou rt. Therefore, § 43-15 is not applicable.

History History. Code 1919, § 6432. Annotations CASE NOTES The legislative intent implicit in this section is to permit an owner who has not comple ted a building project that has been abandoned by a defaulting contractor to set off against withheld funds the cost of completion. Henderson &amp; Russell Assocs. v. Warwick Shopping Center, Inc., 217 Va. 486, 229 S.E.2d 878, 1976 Va. LEXIS 309 (1976). Owners right does not de pend upon contract.  Independent of any contract stipulation, the owner may supply any deficiencies in the performance of agreements in a building contract and deduct the cost from an y money due or to become due to the contractor, and under this section the owner has this right as against mechanics liens. Thomas &amp; Co. v. McCauley, 143 Va. 451, 130 S.E. 396, 1925 Va. LEXIS 280 (1925). Amount guaranteed by owner to subcontractor to complete building has priority.  If a subcontractor is unwilling to continue his work on the building because of the credit standing of the general contractor, under this section the owner may co mplete the building, and may obligate himself to the subcontractor to do so, in order that the work may go on, and the amount for which the owner is required to so obligate himself takes priority over all other mechanics liens. Nicholas v. Miller, 18 2 Va. 831, 30 S.E.2d 696, 1944 Va. LEXIS 239 (1944); Anderson v. White, 183 Va. 302, 32 S.E.2d 72, 1944 Va. LEXIS 154 (1944). Surety who completes contract does not take priority over lienors.  Where a surety under its contract of suretyship, upon default of its principal, a building contractor, completes the contract, the suretys relation to the own er is identical with that of the original contractor, and in such a case it is the right as well as the duty of the owner to prevent any diversion of the funds from those who had perfected statutory liens upon the structure. Their right to have their lie ns discharged out of the unpaid balance in the hands of the owner is as clear against the surety as it would have been against the contractor principal. Electric Transmission Co. v. Pennington Gap Bank, Inc., 137 Va. 94, 119 S.E. 99, 1923 Va. LEXIS 140 ( 1923). For he succeeds to rights of contractor, not owner.  A surety succeeds to the rights of the contractor, and it cannot consistently be held that he at the same time succeeds to the rights of the owner, to use the bal ance due and to become due on the contract by it for the completion of the structure according to the contract, to the exclusion of mechanics liens, as the interest of the surety as the successor of the contractor is adverse to the interest of the ow ner. Electric Transmission Co. v. Pennington Gap Bank, Inc., 137 Va. 94, 119 S.E. 99, 1923 Va. LEXIS 140 (1923). Owner must adduc e evidence as to cost of completion.  In order for an owner to take advantage of the provisions of this section, he must adduce evidence as to the cost of completion, whether or not the building has b een completed. Henderson &amp; Russell Assocs. v. Warwick Shopping Center, Inc., 217 Va. 486, 229 S.E.2d 878, 1976 Va. LEXIS 309 (1976). The burden is on the owner to go forward with the evidence and show what claims, if any, he has against the remaining fund. If the owner completes the building and shows that the cost of doing so has exhausted the fund, the liens of the subcontractors would be wiped out under the express terms of this section. But where the owner did not co mplete the building and did not offer any evidence as to the cost of completion, there was no evidence that the owner had any setoff or counterclaims against the funds which he was withholding from the general contractor. In the absence of such evidence the lower court correctly held that the owner was indebted to the general contractor in a sum exceeding the aggregate amount of the subcontractors claims. Knight v. Ferrante, 202 Va. 243, 117 S.E.2d 283, 1960 Va. LEXIS 213 (1960). Equitable interest must be recorded.  The mechanics lien statutes and the recording statutes must be read together, with the result that the owner of an equitable interest is protected by this sec tion only if the contract or other document evidencing his interest is recorded. Where owner of equitable interest did not record her contract before mechanics lien was filed, she was not eligible for the priority granted by this section. E.E. Stump Well Drilling, Inc. v.

History History. Code 1919, § 6433; 1926, p. 43; 1956, c. 399. Annotations Cross references. As to limitation of actions generally, see §§ 8.01-228 through 8.01-256. CASE NOTES Pe rfection statute contrasted with enforcement statutes.  A lien created by § 43-3 is one in derogation of the common law. Once perfected in accordance with § 43-4, the lien can be enforced by suit brought as prov ided in this section and § 43-22. In Virginia provisions of the enforcement statutes are to be construed liberally while the requirements of the perfection statute are to be construed strictly. American Std. Homes Corp. v. Reinecke, 245 Va. 113, 425 S.E.2d 515, 9 Va. Law Rep. 776, 1993 Va. LEXIS 5 (1993). Expiration of right.  Where a statute creates a right unknown at common law and makes a time limitation the essence of the right as well as a constriction upon the remedy, the right ex pires upon the expiration of the limitation; and the expiration of the right is an absolute defense which can be asserted either by demurrer or by plea of the statute of limitations. Neff v. Garrard, 216 Va. 496, 219 S.E.2d 878, 1975 Va. LEXIS 320 (1975) . The filing of a mechanics lien is a judicial proceeding entitling filer to an absolu te privilege against slander. Donohoe Constr. Co. v. Mount Vernon Assocs., 235 Va. 531, 369 S.E.2d 857, 4 Va. Law Rep. 3040, 1988 Va. LEXIS 80 (1988). The mechanics lien itself is not self-enforcing and is extinguished unless the lienh older files a bill in equity within six months and obtains a decree against the debtors property. W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foodco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1963). Both perfection and en forcement must be timely.  A duly perfected mechanics lien will be extinguished unless the suit to enforce is timely filed. Similarly, the suit to enforce will be dismissed unless there has been a timely perfection of the lien. Accordingly, both perfection and enforcement must meet the statutory requisites before a claimant can recover under the mechanics lien statute. Donohoe Constr. Co. v. Mount Vernon Assocs., 235 Va. 531, 369 S .E.2d 857, 4 Va. Law Rep. 3040, 1988 Va. LEXIS 80 (1988). Section applies in suit by owner to determine validity of liens.  Where a subcontractors lien was barred by this section his claim could not be allowed in a suit brought by the owner of the building to determine the validity of certain claims for a mechanics lien, to which suit the subcontractor was a party, he not having been a party to earlier suits brought to establish mechanics liens, and the account of liens ordered in these suits not having been made until aft er his lien was barred. H.N. Francis &amp; Co. v. Hotel Rueger, Inc., 125 Va. 106, 99 S.E. 690, 1919 Va. LEXIS 12 (1919). Allegation of timely perfection of lien.  A bill to enforce a mechanics lien contains a sufficient allegation that the lien was perfected before the expiration of 30 (now 90) days from the termination of the work, when it alleges that the lien was filed as provided for in §§ 43-3 and 43-4, and the copy of the record of the lien exhibited with the bill shows a part performance within 30 (now 90) days of the recordation of the lien. Richlands Fli nt Glass Co. v. Hiltebeitel, 92 Va. 91, 22 S.E. 806, 1895 Va. LEXIS 91 (1895). Bill to enforce lien is no t part of perfection.  Filing of a bill to enforce the mechanics lien within the time specified is not part of the perfection process. Virginia law as applied in a bankruptcy situat ion does not require the commencement of an action in order to perfect a mechanics lien. Therefore, an action to enforce the lien would not be exempt from the automatic stay provisions in bankruptcy. H.T. Bowling, Inc. v. Bain, 52 Bankr. 58, 1985 Ban kr. LEXIS 5430 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1985), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 64 Bankr. 581, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26191 (W.D. Va. 1986). A creditor may plead the statute of limitations in a suit to enforce a mechanics lie n. McCartney v. Tyrer, 94 Va. 198, 26 S.E. 419, 1897 Va. LEXIS 63 (1897); Monk v. Exposition Deepwater Pier Corp., 111 Va. 121, 68 S.E. 280, 1910 Va. LEXIS 13 (1910). But the right must be barred as between the lienor and the debtor. Monk v. Exposition Dee pwater Pier Corp., 111 Va. 121, 68 S.E. 280, 1910 Va. LEXIS 13 (1910). Time of impl eading subsequent lienors is immaterial.  If a suit to enforce a mechanics lien is brought within due time against the debtor upon whose property the lien rests, the failure to implead subsequent lien ors within six months does not defeat the lien so far as such encumbrances are concerned. They are proper but not necessary parties to such suits, and may be brought in at a subsequent time. Monk v. Exposition Deepwater Pier Corp., 111 Va. 121, 68 S.E. 2 80, 1910 Va. LEXIS 13 (1910). Statute is not suspended by suit to enforce another lien.  The institution of a suit in equity which was not a general creditors suit or a general creditors lien suit, but had for its sole object the enforcement o f a mechanics lien and other alleged rights of the plaintiff, did not suspend the running of limitations as to another mechanics lienor who was not made a party and did not in any way become a party until it filed its petition to enforce its lien more than six months after the entire amount covered by its lien became due and payable. Richmond Eng'r &amp; Mfg. Corp. v. Loth, 135 Va. 110, 115 S.E. 774, 1923 Va. LEXIS 5 (1923). Unless lienor is made a party.  A suit by a subcontractor suspends the running of limitations as to the general contractor and all claiming under him, where he is made a party and his recorded l ien properly set forth in bill. Spiller v. Wells, 96 Va. 598, 32 S.E. 46, 1899 Va. LEXIS 107 (1899), limited, Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors, Inc. v. Standard Federal Sav. &amp; Loan, 222 Va. 330, 281 S.E.2d 811, 1981 Va. LEXIS 309 (1981). Intervening petition in suit of an other.  When read together, it is clear that this section and § 43-22 require that a lienors intervening petition in a suit to enforce a mechanics lien be file d within the limitation period provided in this section. Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors v. Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 222 Va. 330, 281 S.E.2d 811, 1981 Va. LEXIS 309 (1981). Where appellant mechanics lienors sought to enforce their liens over two years after the filing of their memoranda of mechanics liens by filing intervenin g petitions in a pending suit by appellee lienor which named them as defendants, the trial court properly sustained appellee lienors demurrer to the petitions. The enforcement of appellants liens was barred because the intervening petitions were not filed within the limitation period set out in this section. Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors v. Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 222 Va. 330, 281 S.E.2d 811, 1981 Va. LEXIS 309 (1981). Being named as a defendant.  Merely being named as a defendant in an enforcement action of another lienor is not the equivalent of either filing an independent suit or intervening in the suit of another; there is no relevant difference between being a named party defendant in a bill to enforce a mechanics lien and being a named defendant in interpleader action; neither constitutes an affirmative act on the part of the lienor to enforce i ts lien, and neither complies with the statutory requirements. Isle of Wight Materials Co. v. Cowling Bros., 246 Va. 103, 431 S.E.2d 42, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1466, 1993 Va. LEXIS 98 (1993). Necessary party.  In a mechanics lien dispute, a general contractor was not a necessary party to a subcontractors lien enforcement action because it did not have a pecuniar y interest since it was neither the principal nor the surety on the bond, and it had no ability to be awarded a judgment to be paid out from the bond. The general contractor failed to perfect its mechanics lien on the real estate because it did not f ile a memorandum of lien and a certification of mailing of a copy of the memorandum of lien to the owner of the property in the county clerks office; the lien was lost as a result. Synchronized Constr. Servs. v. Prav Lodging, LLC, 288 Va. 356, 764 S.E.2d 61, 2014 Va. LEXIS 155 (2014). Being named party defendant not suit.  Although the filing of an intervening petition in a suit filed by another lienor is the equivalent of instituting a suit under this section, being named a party d efendant in a suit by a lienor is not. Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors v. Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 222 Va. 330, 281 S.E.2d 811, 1981 Va. LEXIS 309 (1981). Beneficiary of an inferior deed of trust is a necessary party in mechanic lien holder s suit to enforce its mechanics lien and was required to be named as a defendant within the statutory time period; failure to do so defeats mechanic lien holders suit to enforce its mechanics lien. James T. Bush Constr. Co. v. Patel, 243 Va. 84, 412 S.E.2d 703, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1774, 1992 Va. LEXIS 24 (1992). Beneficiary of a superior deed of trust had substantial interest in be ing given opportunity to challenge lien.  Because the proceeds from a judicial sale of property may be insufficient to satisfy both a mechanics lien and a deed of trust lien, the beneficiary of a supe rior deed of trust had a substantial interest in being given the opportunity to challenge the validity of the mechanic...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_43-18"><akn:num>§ 43-18</akn:num><akn:heading>Lien of general contractor to inure to benefit of subcontractor</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The perfected lien of a general contractor on any building or structure shall inure to the benefit of any subcontractor, and of any person performing labor or furnishin g materials to a subcontractor who has not perfected a lien on such building or structure, provided such subcontractor, or person performing labor or furnishing materials shall give written notice of his claim against the general contractor, or subcontra ctor, as the case may be, to the owner or his agent before the amount of such lien is actually paid off or discharged.

Miller, 80 Va. 821, 1885 Va. LEXIS 117 (1885). But subcontractor is not obliged to claim through general contractor.  Under this section the subcontractor may claim through the general contractor, but he is not obliged to do so. Under § 43-7, the subcontractor may perfect his own independent lien. Knight v. Ferrante, 202 Va. 243, 117 S.E.2d 283, 1960 Va. LEXIS 213 (1960). The subcontractor, under the provisions of this section, may rely on the general contractors lien or, under the provisions of §§ 43-3, 43-4 and 43-7, he may file and undertake to enforce his own independent lien. VNB Mtg. Corp. v. Lone Star Indus., Inc., 215 Va. 366, 209 S.E.2d 909, 1974 Va. LEXIS 293 (1974).

CASE NOTES Section is considere d written into assignments.  The words of this section as to assignments by a contractor are written into such assignments as effectually as if the assignment in terms stated as a condition p recedent that it should be void and ineffective until after the payment in full of all debts due by the assignor to subcontractors, supply men and laborers for the construction of the building, and the section in its legal effect is a direction to the ow ner thus to distribute the fund. DeWitt v. Coffey, 150 Va. 365, 143 S.E. 710, 1928 Va. LEXIS 319 (1928). It applies to contract of suretyship with option to complete.  This section, which preserves the validity and priority of the liens of laborers, mechanics and materialmen against assignments or transfers by a contractor eithe r of any part of his contract with the owner, or of any money or consideration coming to him under such contract, applies to a contract of suretyship by which the surety is given the option of completing the contract on default of the contractor.

And to assignment to subcontractors.  Under this section, every assignment of every kind by a general contractor to any party of any funds due, or to become due, to the general contractor under a cont ract for the erection of a building is subject to the mechanics liens given by this chapter, even though the assignees involved are subcontractors. Anderson v. White, 183 Va. 302, 32 S.E.2d 72, 1944 Va. LEXIS 154 (1944). Assignments given to subcontractors for work performed on the building, or supplies furnished, are not excepted. Anderson v.

Priority o f inchoate but potential liens is preserved.  This section is without meaning or effect unless it preserves the priority of the inchoate but potential liens created by the chapter, because liens which attache d before the assignment need no such protection.

But assignment is good against subcontractors who have no potential liens.  Assignments are not void as to subcontractors who have permitted the time given by § 43-4 to expire without taking the necessary steps to perfect their liens, and thus have no potential right to perfect liens. Coleman v. Pearman, 159 Va. 72, 165 S.E. 371, 1932 Va. LEXIS 175 (1932), overruled, Mills v. Moore's Super Stores, 217 Va. 276, 227 S.E.2d 719, 1976 Va. LEXIS 271 (1976). Disbursements before l ien notice not affected.  In the absence of fraud or wrongful conversion, this section does not affect disbursements against the contract price made before lien notice is given. Kayhoe Con str. Corp. v. United Va. Bank, 220 Va. 285, 257 S.E.2d 837, 1979 Va. LEXIS 261 (1979). Subcontractors entitled to protection despite assignment.  Under the facts of the case, the subcontractors, who, so far as the evidence showed, contracted with the assignee in good faith, are not to be denied the protecti on of this chapter merely because the owners did not know of the assignment. Mills v. Moore's Super Stores, 217 Va. 276, 227 S.E.2d 719, 1976 Va.

The cases in the following annotations were decided under this section as it read prior to the 1968 amendment. Section 43-3 construed with this s ection.  Section 43-3, which provides in general terms that all persons performing labor or furnishing material for the construction of buildings shall have a mechanics  lien upon the structure and the land necessary for its use, must be construed in connection with this section. It is clear that the General Assembly only intended to authorize mechanics liens upon the interest or estate in the land of the person requiring or authorizing the work to be done. Feuchtenberger v. Williamson, Carroll &amp; Saunders, 137 Va. 578, 120 S.E. 257, 1923 Va. LEXIS 181 (1923). Lessors interest is not affected where building erected by lessee.  When the provisions of § 43-3 and this section are read together, it is clear that the interest of a lessor in a lot upon which the lessee has erected a buildi ng cannot be subjected to the liens of mechanics for erecting such building, unless the lessor or his duly authorized agent caused the building to be erected thereon. Atlas Portland Cement Co. v. Main Line Realty Corp., 112 Va. 7, 70 S.E. 536, 1911 Va. L EXIS 45 (1911) (see Carter v. Keeton, 112 Va. 307, 71 S.E. 554 (1911)). Though building is erected under lessees contract with lessor.  Where a lessee has covenanted to erect a building on the leased premises, and such building is erected thereon by a mechanic under a contract with the lessee, by which the lessor is in no way bound, directly or indirectly, the building is not caused to be erected by the lessor, within the meaning of this section and the mechanic cannot assert a lien against the interest of the lessor in the leased premise s. Atlas Portland Cement Co. v. Main Line Realty Corp., 112 Va. 7, 70 S.E. 536, 1911 Va. LEXIS 45 (1911). Liens against equitable estates.  When mechanics liens are entered against an equitable estate, their value depends upon that particular estate, and they survive or perish with it. Feuchtenber ger v. Williamson, Carroll &amp; Saunders, 137 Va. 578, 120 S.E. 257, 1923 Va. LEXIS 181 (1923). Personal decree may be entered against person ordering improvements without authority.  In a suit in equity against the owner of land to enforce a mechanics lien for repairs, a personal decree may be rendered against the person who, having no int erest in the land, ordered the repairs without authority from the owner, if such person is a party to the suit. Carter v. Keeton, 112 Va. 307, 71 S.E. 554, 1911 Va. LEXIS 84 (1911). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Complaint insufficient to enforce lien.  Complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to show a cause of action to enforce the subcontractors lien against trusts because it did not claim any party aut horized improvement of the property under a construction contract; for the construction contract to correspond to the subcontractors enforcement of its lien against the ownership interests of either one or both of the trusts, it had to be alleged tha t one or both trusts authorized through the contract the work on a store. Lin R. Rogers Elec. Contrs. Inc. v. Flynn Constr. Mgmt. Gen. Contr., Inc., 99 Va. Cir. 515, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 367 (Essex County Dec. 9, 2010). Limited recovery when owner did not order or authorize improvements.  Because a tenant did not act as an owners agent in ordering or authorizing improvements to the owners property, the subcontractors and the general contrac tor were limited in recovery of their mechanics lien and quantum meruit claims to the tenants leasehold interest.

Unless otherwise provided in the subordination agreement, if the holder of the prior recorded lien of a purchase money deed of trust subordinates to the lien of a const ruction money deed of trust, such subordination shall be limited to the construction money deed of trust and said prior lien shall not be subordinate to mechanics and materialmens liens to the extent of the value of the land by virtue of such agr eement. In the enforcement of the liens acquired under the previous sections of this chapter, any lien or encumbrance created on the land before the work was commenced or mater ials furnished shall be preferred in the distribution of the proceeds of sale only to the extent of the value of the land estimated, exclusive of the buildings or structures, at the time of sale, and the residue of the proceeds of sale shall be applied t o the satisfaction of the liens provided for in the previous sections of this chapter. Provided that liens filed for performing labor or furnishing materials for the repair or improvement of any building or structure shall be subject to any encumbrance a gainst such land and building or structure of record prior to the commencement of the improvements or repairs or the furnishing of materials or supplies therefor. Nothing contained in the foregoing proviso shall apply to liens that may be filed for the c onstruction or removal of any building or structure. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C of § 43-3, a general contractor may, prior to or after providing any labor, services, or materials, contract to subord inate his lien rights to prior recorded and later recorded deeds of trust, provided that such contract is (i) in writing and (ii) signed by any general contractor whose lien rights are subordinated pursuant to such contract.

When another l ien or encumbrance is created before the work is commenced or the materials furnished it does not operate on the building until the mechanics lien is satisfied; if created after the work is commenced or the materials furnished it does not operate on the land or building until the mechanics lien is satisfied. Kinnier Co. v. Cofer, 13 Va. L. Reg. 238 (1927) (see also DeWitt v. Coffey, 150 Va. 365, 143 S.E. 710 (1928); Rust v. Indiana Flooring Co., 151 Va. 845, 145 S.E. 321 (1928)). This section modifies § 55-96.  The effect of this section is to modify the registry law as contained in § 55-96 so far as to give priority to a mechanics lien on the lands of the grantee who has failed to record his deed over judgments subsequently obtained against his grantor. Pace v. Moorman, 99 Va. 246, 37 S.E. 911, 1901 Va. LEXIS 35 (1901). Priority of lien created on land before work was begun.  Under this section, where a lien was created on the land before the work for which the mechanics lien is claimed was begun or the materials were furnished, th e former lien is the first lien on the land and the second lien on the building or structure. Federal Land Bank v. Clinchfield Lumber &amp; Supply Co., 171 Va. 118, 198 S.E. 437, 1938 Va. LEXIS 263 (1938). A deed of trust recorded before the work began is entitled to priority to the extent of the estimated value of the property without the improvements for which the lien is claimed. Fidelity Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Dennis, 93 Va. 504, 25 S.E. 546, 1896 Va. LEXIS 104 (1896); Hudson v. Barham, 101 Va. 63, 43 S.E. 189, 1903 Va. LEXIS 3 (1903). A mechanics lien was not entitled to priority over a claim of the United States based on an unpaid Small Business Administration loan. W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foo dco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1963). Lien a ttaches when work commences or supplies furnished.  Fact that a deed of trust was recorded prior to delivery of some of the building materials provided by a supplier had no effect on the priority of the supplier s mechanics lien as to those materials vis-a-vis those previously delivered; all of the materials supplied for the construction had the same lien priority as the materials supplied on the first day regardless of intervening liens. Kiser v. Russel l County, 344 Bankr. 432, 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 2459 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2004). Section inef fective against claims of United States.  However effective this section may be on its face to secure their liens against competing nonfederal claims, it is ineffective against claims of the United States . W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foodco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1963). Hence, when the Small Business Administration has joined a private bank in making a construction loan secured by a recorded deed of trust and the borrower becomes insolvent, the SBAs interest in the unpaid balance of the loan is not subordinate to mechanics liens accorded priority over deeds of trust by state law. W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foodco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1 963). And state laws purporting to fix priorities among lienholders must yield to the federal insolvency statute (31 U.S.C. § 3713) in any nonbankruptcy insolvency proceeding where it is applicable and seasonably invoked by the United States. W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foodco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1963). Federal common law prevails.  Federal common law, by which the first in time is the first in right, prevails over state law in matters affecting the priority of claims of the United St ates. W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foodco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1963). Even if federal common law is inapplicable, a debt owing to the United States would be in any event paramount to mechanics liens by virtue of the fede ral insolvency statute (31 U.S.C. § 3713). W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foodco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1963). Effect of filing and recording against claim of United States.  As against claim of United States, the interim steps of filing and recording the lien, without obtaining a final judgment enforcing the lien against the property, serve merely as a caveat of a more perfect lien to come. W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foodco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1963). Whether a vendors or a mechanics lien has priority is a question that may be aff ected by extraneous circumstances, and in such case where the masters report of the liens and their priorities is confirmed without exception thereto, the court will not give relief against alleged errors therein on a bill of review. Phipps v. Wise H otel Co., 116 Va. 739, 82 S.E. 681, 1913 Va. LEXIS 1 (1913). Extinguishing pr iority does not extinguish claim.  The remedy of the mechanics lien statute is to grant a priority, but the extinguishing of such priority does not in and of itself extinguish the claim. United States Elevator Corp. v. 1616 Reminc Ltd. Partnership, 9 Bankr. 679, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 4852 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981). Duty to pl ace lien only upon property worked and no more.  Where a mechanic files a memorandum of mechanics lien against two or more parcels but has not worked on all the parcels and where the mechanic attempts to enf orce that lien against the several properties, that lien must be declared invalid in its entirety since it is the mechanics duty to place his lien upon the property on which he worked and no more. Woodington Elec., Inc. v. Lincoln Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 238 Va. 623, 385 S.E.2d 872, 6 Va. Law Rep. 780, 1989 Va. LEXIS 161 (1989). Mechanics  lienor cannot demand release of prior lien.  The mortgagor, as owner of the land, had no right to tender to the mortgagee the estimated value of the land necessary for the enjoyment of the building and deman d a release of the mortgage thereon, nor did the holder of the mechanics lien have any such right, either under the express language of this section or within its implied intent. Federal Land Bank v. Clinchfield Lumber &amp; Supply Co., 171 Va. 118, 198 S.E. 437, 1938 Va. LEXIS 263 (1938). Liens against legal and equitabl e titles.  If the owner of the full equitable estate in land causes buildings to be erected thereon, for the cost of which a mechanic records a lien, such lien, by the terms of this section, takes priority, as to both land and buildings, over all liens thereafter acquired on the land, and also over all judgments thereafter recovered against the equitable owners grantor, who holds the mere legal title to the land. If the mechanics lien has been enforced by the sale of the property, the purchaser has the right to stand in the shoes of the mechanic before the sale. Pace v. Moorman, 99 Va. 246, 37 S.E. 911, 1901 Va. LEXIS 35 (1901).

The plaintiff shall file with his bill an itemized statement of his account, showing the amount and character of the work done or materials fu rnished, the prices charged therefor, the payments made, if any, the balance due, and the time from which interest is claimed thereon, the correctness of which account shall be verified by the affidavit of himself, or his agent. When suit is brought for the enforcement of any such lien against the property bound thereby, all parties entitled to such liens upon the property or any portion thereof may file petitions in such suit asking for the enforcement of their respective liens to have the same effect as if an independent suit were brought by each claimant.

Virginia Forms (Matthew Bender). No. 6-510 Complaint by General Contractor to Enforce Mechanics Lien; Nos. 6-511 et seq. CASE NOTES Pe rfection statute contrasted with enforcement statutes.  A lien created by Code § 43-3 is one in derogation of the common law. Once perfected in accordance with § 43-4, the lien can be enforced by suit brought as provided in § 43-17 and this section. In Virginia provisions of the enforcement statutes are to be construed liberally while the requirements of the perfection statute are to be construed strictly. American Std. Homes Corp. v. Reinecke, 245 Va. 113, 425 S.E.2d 515, 9 Va. Law Rep. 776, 1993 Va. LEXIS 5 (1993). Perfection of mechanics liens is completed upon filing the memorandum required by § 43-4 and does not involve the separate, second step of filing an enforcement suit under this section; once a memorandum is properly filed in proper form perfection is complete. Concrete Structures, Inc. v. Tidewater Crane and Rigging Co., 261 Bankr. 627, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3675 (E.D. Va. 2001). A proceeding under this section is analogous to a lien creditors suit, and is contro lled by the same consideration, and is subject to similar rules of equitable practice. Monk v. Exposition Deepwater Pier Corp., 111 Va. 121, 68 S.E. 280, 1910 Va. LEXIS 13 (1910). The mechanics lien itself is not self-enforcing and is extinguished unless the lienh older files a bill in equity within six months and obtains a decree against the debtors property. W.T. Jones &amp; Co. v. Foodco Realty, Inc., 318 F.2d 881, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 5236 (4th Cir. 1963). A mechanics lien is enforceable only under the conditions established by statute and , in the absence of compliance with those statutory provisions, a court has no jurisdiction to enforce the mechanics lien. Isle of Wight Materials Co. v. Cowling Bros., 246 Va. 103, 431 S.E.2d 42, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1466, 1993 Va. LEXIS 98 (1993). The claim of mechanics lien creditors is not a personal claim but is against the bui lding and can only be enforced in a court of equity in the manner prescribed by this section. Nicholas v. Harrisonburg Bldg. &amp; Supply Co., 181 Va. 207, 24 S.E.2d 452, 1943 Va. LEXIS 169 (1943). Suit is not one against othe r lien creditors.  A suit under this section to enforce a mechanics lien is not a suit against other lien creditors, even when convened as parties defendant. They are impleaded as matter of convenience. The suit is analogous to a lien creditors suit. Monk v. Exposition Deepwater Pier Corp., 111 Va. 121, 68 S.E. 280, 1910 Va. LEXIS 13 (1910). They are proper, but not necessary, parties. All known lien creditors, and all disclosed by the records, may be made parties, but a failure to do so is not fatal to the proceedings. Monk v. Exposition Deepwater Pier Corp., 111 Va. 121, 68 S.E. 280, 1910 Va. LEXIS 13 (1910). Bill must sh ow on its face that suit was brought in time.  A bill to enforce the lien which does not show on its face that suit was brought within the time prescribed by § 43-17 is demurrable. Savings Bank v. Powhatan Clay Mfg. Co., 102 Va. 274, 46 S.E. 294, 1904 Va. LEXIS 66 (1904). Unless fact appears in record.  Where the record shows that a suit to enforce a mechanics lien was brought within the time fixed by § 43-17, that fact need not be alleged in the bill, as the court will take judicial notice of the time when the suit was instituted. Sands v. Stagg, 105 Va. 444, 52 S.E. 633, 1906 Va. LEXIS 47 (1906). The filing of a memorandum of mechanics lien is a judicial proceeding entitling file r to an absolute privilege against slander. Donohoe Constr. Co. v. Mount Vernon Assocs., 235 Va. 531, 369 S.E.2d 857, 4 Va. Law Rep. 3040, 1988 Va. LEXIS 80 (1988). Allegation of timely perfection of lien.  A bill to enforce a mechanics lien contains a sufficient allegation that the lien was perfected before the expiration of 30 (now 60) days from the termination of the work, when it alleges that the lien was filed as provided for in §§ 43-3 and 43-4, and the copy of the record of the lien exhibited with the bill shows a part performance within 30 (now 60) days of the recordation of the lien. Richlands Fli nt Glass Co. v. Hiltebeitel, 92 Va. 91, 22 S.E. 806, 1895 Va. LEXIS 91 (1895). Limitation on lienor s intervening petition.  When read together, it is clear that § 43-17 and this section require that a lienors intervening petition in a suit to enforce a mechanics lien be file d within the limitation period provided in § 43-17. Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors v. Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 222 Va. 330, 281 S.E.2d 811, 1981 Va. LEXIS 309 (1981). Where appellant mechanics lienors sought to enforce their liens over two years after the filing of their memoranda of mechanics liens by filing intervenin g petitions in a pending suit by appellee lienor which named them as defendants, the trial court properly sustained appellee lienors demurrer to the petitions. The enforcement of appellants liens was barred because the intervening petitions were not filed within the limitation period set out in § 43-17. Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors v. Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 222 Va. 330, 281 S.E.2d 811, 1981 Va. LEXIS 309 (1981). Being named as a defendant.  Merely being named as a defendant in an enforcement action of another lienor is not the equivalent of either filing an independent suit or intervening in the suit of another; there is no relevant difference between being a named party defendant in a bill to enforce a mechanics lien and being a named defendant in interpleader action; neither constitutes an affirmative act on the part of the lienor to enforce i ts lien, and neither complies with the statutory requirements. Isle of Wight Materials Co. v. Cowling Bros., 246 Va. 103, 431 S.E.2d 42, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1466, 1993 Va. LEXIS 98 (1993). Being named defendant not su it under § 43-17.  Although the filing of an intervening petition in a suit filed by another lienor is the equivalent of instituting a suit under § 43-17, being named a party def endant in a suit by a lienor is not. Commonwealth Mechanical Contractors v. Standard Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan, 222 Va. 330, 281 S.E.2d 811, 1981 Va. LEXIS 309 (1981). Each separate house and lot is separate debtor.  Where each of several mechanics liens is separate and distinct and asserted against separate parcels of real estate, the ultimate validity of each lien is dep endent upon when the specific building upon which the work was done was completed or the work thereon otherwise terminated. Each house and lot, and none other, stands as a separate debtor  an in rem defendant  against which liability for the work done on that particular building can be enforced. Shelton v. Ogus, 201 Va. 417, 111 S.E.2d 408, 1959 Va. LEXIS 243 (1959). Trustee in an antecedent deed of trust recorded on unimproved land is necessary party in suit to enforce mechanics lien on the improvements. Walt Robbins, Inc. v. Damon Corp., 232 Va. 43, 348 S.E.2d 223, 3 Va. Law Rep. 490, 1986 Va. LEXIS 225 (1986). And the beneficiary of the antecedent deed of trust was a necessary party to the suits t o enforce the mechanics liens. Walt Robbins, Inc. v. Damon Corp., 232 Va. 43, 348 S.E.2d 223, 3 Va. Law Rep. 490, 1986 Va. LEXIS 225 (1986). General contractor not a necessa ry party.  In a mechanics lien dispute, a general contractor was not a necessary party to a subcontractors lien enforcement action because it did not have a pecuniar y interest since it was neither the principal nor the surety on the bond, and it had no ability to be awarded a judgment to be paid out from the bond. The general contractor failed to perfect its mechanics lien on the real estate because it did not f ile a memorandum of lien and a certification of mailing of a copy of the memorandum of lien to the owner of the property in the county clerks office; the lien was lost as a result. Synchronized Constr. Servs. v. Prav Lodging, LLC, 288 Va. 356, 764 S.E.2d 61, 2014 Va. LEXIS 155 (2014). Chancellor must have jurisdiction over person of trustee before divesting him of title.  If legal title is vested in the trustee of an antecedent deed of trust, and the property is to be sold free of the trust lien, the chancellor must have jurisdicti on over the person of the trustee before he can enter a decree divesting him of title.

History History. Code 1919, § 6437; 1920, p. 485. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 12A M.J. Liens, § 11. CASE NOTES Assignment to subcontractor is void as to other subcontractors.  Assignments received by subcontractors from the general contractor before he defaulted in the performance of his contract, which assignments were upon the owner f or amounts due for labor and materials furnished, were clearly prohibited by this section and § 43-19 insofar as other subcontractors were concerned, and there was no priority by reason of them. Anderson v. White, 183 Va. 302, 32 S.E.2d 72, 1944 Va. L EXIS 154 (1944). Priority to subcontractor liens.  County commissioners finding that pursuant to § 43-23, there was no priority among mechanics liens, except that the lien of a subcontractor shall be pr eferred to that of his general contractor and his decision to give priority to subcontractor liens over the general contractors lien, and to give priority to the general contractors lien over the lenders lien pursuant to § 43-23 was not pl ainly wrong or without evidence to support his determination concerning priority. Glasser &amp; Glasser, PLC v. Jack Bays, Inc., 285 Va. 358, 741 S.E.2d 599, 2013 Va. LEXIS 29 (2013). § 43-23.1. Forfeiture of lien. Text Any person who shall, with intent to mislead, include in his memorandum of lien work not performed upon, or materials not furnished for, the property described in his m emorandum shall thereby forfeit any right to a lien under this chapter. History History. 1968, c. 568; 1976, c. 253. Annotations CASE NOTES Purpose of 1976 amendment.  When the General Assembly amended this section by substituting the words with intent to mislead for the word knowingly, the amendment did not cons titute a substantive change in the statute. Rather, the amendment was enacted simply to reinforce the original legislative intent by clarifying an after-discovered semantical ambiguity. Prior to the amendment, knowingly meant more than with k nowledge. Rather, knowingly in this context was an antonym of innocently and a synonym of designedly and with intent to mislead. First Nat'l Bank v. Roy N. Ford Co., 219 Va. 942, 252 S.E.2d 354, 1979 Va. LEXIS 193 (197 9). A lienor may not enforce a lien against one project for the cost of labor or materials furnished on another. First Nat'l Bank v. Roy N. Ford Co., 219 Va. 942, 252 S.E.2d 354, 1979 Va. LEXIS 193 (1979). Forfeiture not warranted.  The act of a subcontractor in including in his memorandum of mechanics lien debts due on projects other than the project in question did not constitute a forf eiture of the subcontractors right to a mechanics lien under this section where the statement of account filed prior to the memorandum contained data which corresponded fully with invoices and with the amount claimed in memorandum and where no ev idence of an intent to mislead was produced. First Nat'l Bank v. Roy N. Ford Co., 219 Va. 942, 252 S.E.2d 354, 1979 Va. LEXIS 193 (1979). Beneficiary of antecedent deed of trust entitled to notice and opportunity to challenge.  Because the proceeds of a judicial sale under a decree enforcing a mechanics lien may prove to be insufficient to pay both lien creditors in full, the benefic iary of an antecedent deed of trust has a property right which entitles him to notice and an opportunity to challenge the perfection of the mechanics lien or to invoke the forfeiture provisions of this section. Walt Robbins, Inc. v. Damon Corp., 232 Va. 43, 348 S.E.2d 223, 3 Va. Law Rep. 490, 1986 Va. LEXIS 225 (1986). § 43-23.2. Remedies cumulative.

Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Commercial Law, § 97. CASE NOTES Chancellor did not err in excluding attorneys fees as an element of the liens enforc ed by the final decree. The General Assembly expressly approved inclusion of interest as an element of the claim in the perfection and enforcement of a mechanics lien. The legislature was at liberty to do, but did not do, the same for attorneys fees. American Std. Homes Corp. v. Reinecke, 245 Va. 113, 425 S.E.2d 515, 9 Va. Law Rep. 776, 1993 Va. LEXIS 5 (1993).

No mortgage, deed of trust, sale, hypothecation or conveyance executed since the first day of May, 1888, shall defeat or take precedence over such lien. The lien secure d by this section to parties furnishing supplies, shall be subordinate to that allowed to clerks, mechanics, foremen, superintendents, and laborers for services furnished as aforesaid.

Construction of chap ter.  There must be a substantial compliance with the requirement of that portion of this chapter which relates to the creation of the laborers lien, but the provis ions with respect to its enforcement should be liberally construed. Mathews v. Meyers, 151 Va. 426, 145 S.E. 352, 1928 Va. LEXIS 243 (1928) (see Wright v. Chase Natl Bank, 92 F.2d 271 (4th Cir. 1937)). Necessity for section.  In the nature of things, those who work for corporations seldom have possession of products of their labor, and unless the statutory lien given by this section at taches to them, the remedy designed by the legislature for their protection is in most instances but a shadow. Mathews v. Meyers, 151 Va. 426, 145 S.E. 352, 1928 Va. LEXIS 243 (1928). This section is not contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as being special and class legislation. Virginia Dev. Co. v. Crozer Iron Co., 90 Va. 126, 17 S.E. 806, 1893 Va. LEXIS 21 (1893); First Nat'l Bank v. William R. Trigg Co., 106 Va. 327, 56 S.E. 158, 1907 Va. LEXIS 93 (1907), dismissed, 218 U.S. 693, 31 S . Ct. 218, 54 L. Ed. 1212, 1910 U.S. LEXIS 2175 (1910) (see also Robert Bunts Eng'g &amp; Equip. Co. v. Palmer, 169 Va. 206, 192 S.E. 789, 1937 Va. LEXIS 167 (1937). But it is unconstitutional as to liens existing prior to its date, and valid as to those arising thereafter. Citizens' &amp; Marine Bank v. Mason, 2 F.2d 352, 1924 U.S. App. LEXIS 2046 (4th Cir. 1924); Mathews v. Meyers, 151 Va. 426, 145 S.E. 352, 1928 Va. LEXIS 243 (1928). It did not impair the charter right of a corporation to issue bonds and secure the same, where the corporation was organized prior to the effective date of this section, and the charter was taken subject to the general law then in effect and any changes that might be made therein; hence bondholders who took the bonds after the enactment of the section were bound by its provisions as to priority of liens. Virginia Dev. Co. v. Crozer Iron Co., 90 Va. 126, 17 S.E. 806, 1893 Va. LEXIS 21 (1893). For the history of this section, see Newgass v. Atlantic &amp; D.

Supply lien not inconsistent with lien of car-trust contract.  A lien for the purchase money of rolling stock reserved under a car-trust contract, recorded pursuant to former § 55-89, was no wise inconsistent with the exis tence of a supply lien under this section. Newgass v. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry., 56 F. 676, 1893 U.S. App. LEXIS 2704 (C.C.D. Va. 1893). II.Against Whom Lien May Be File d. Section applies only to companies strictly engaged in businesses named.  The legislature, in placing railroad, canal and other transportation companies and mining and manufacturing companies all in one section, plainly had in mind corp orations extensive in character, and at least those actually and chiefly so engaged, and not such as might incidentally, from a technical viewpoint, be engaged partially in manufacturing something used, or capable of being used, in connection with the bu siness in hand. Mining or manufacturing companies in this section manifestly was intended to apply to companies strictly engaged in the businesses named, which considered along with other portions of the section applicable to railroad, canal, and other transportation companies, clearly indicated the actual engaging in one of the five things named in the section, to wit, operating a railroad, canal, or transportation company, or a mining or manufacturing business. Citizens' &amp; Marine Bank v. Mason , 2 F.2d 352, 1924 U.S. App. LEXIS 2046 (4th Cir. 1924). But manufacturing company may buy and sell raw material.  A company whose general business, well recognized and understood, was that of the manufacture of rough lumber into flooring, ceiling, box shooks and other dressed material, was a manufacturing company within the meaning of this section, notwithstanding that it bought and sold rough lumber as an incident in connection with its regular business. In re W. Norfolk Lumber Co., 112 F. 759, 1902 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 405 (D. Va. 1902). A boilermaker is a manufacturer. First Nat'l Bank v. William R. Trigg Co., 106 Va. 327, 5 6 S.E. 158, 1907 Va.

And a shipbuilding company may be a manufacturing company.  A company which manufactured ships of all sorts and sizes, and all necessary fittings and furniture therefor, and in addition did a considerable amount of origina l and repair work for other manufacturing concerns, was held to be a manufacturing company within the meaning of this section. First Nat'l Bank v. William R. Trigg Co., 106 Va. 327, 56 S.E. 158, 1907 Va. LEXIS 93 (1907), dismissed, 218 U.S. 693, 31 S. Ct . 218, 54 L. Ed. 1212, 1910 U.S. LEXIS 2175 (1910).

The manager of a manufacturing company is not a laborer or traveling representative entitled to a preferred lien for salary under this section, although he spent about half his time traveling. Wright v. Chase Nat'l Bank, 92 F.2d 271, 1937 U.S. App. LEXIS 4544 (4th Cir. 1937). Nor is the president and general manager.  The president of a manufacturing company is not given priority of lien to secure his salary by this section. And to designate him as general manager does not chan ge his official relation to the company, nor does it bring him within any of the classes to whom priority is given. Seventh Nat'l Bank v. Shenandoah Iron Co., 35 F. 436, 1887 U.S. App. LEXIS 2958 (C.C.D. Va. 1887). Nor the secretary and treasurer.  Claims for salaries by the manager and the secretary and treasurer of a corporation were properly disallowed as labor claims, these officers not being within the provisions of this section giving labor claims a priority. Fidelity Ins., Trust &amp; Safe-Deposit Co. v. Roanoke Iron Co., 81 F. 439, 1896 U.S. App. LEXIS 3061 (C.C.D. Va. 1896). A telegraph company is not a laborer.  A telegraph company rendering services to a railroad is not a laborer within the intent and reason of this section and § 43-25. Newgass v. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry., 7 2 F. 712, 1894 U.S. App. LEXIS 3167 (C.C.D. Va. 1894). Laborers and contractors distinguished.  Where the lien claimant laid the track, constructed the overhead line and strung the necessary feeder wire for an electric railway, under an agreement with the ra ilway whereby payment was to be made at a fixed price per foot or mile, the railway furnishing all the materials and the lien claimant furnishing all his own tools and labor, the claimant was a contractor, and not a laborer, and did not come within the p urview of this section.

CASE NOTES Substantial compliance is required.  While the provisions of this chapter should be liberally construed, there must be a substantial compliance with the requirements of this section, which relates to the creation of the lien. Wilson v. Hall, 81 F.2d 918, 1936 U.S. App. LEXIS 3581 (4th Cir. 1936). An affidavit made before a notary public in another state and not verified as required b y § 49-5 in such cases is not a nullity, and the omission to have an officer of a court of record of the state where the affidavit was made certify that the notary was authorized to administer the oath can be supplied. Fidelity Ins., Trust &amp; Safe-Depo sit Co. v. Roanoke Iron Co., 81 F. 439, 1896 U.S. App. LEXIS 3061 (C.C.D. Va. 1896). Time of filing memorandum is governed by date when claim matures.  The time within which the memorandum must be filed is governed by the date when the claim matures; the date of furnishing the supplies is immaterial. If the claim is payable in installments, this section means that the memorandum must be filed within 90 days after the last installment is due. Newgass v. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry., 56 F. 676, 1893 U.S. App. LEXIS 2704 (C.C.D. Va. 1893). But time i s not extended by acceptance of note for wages.  This section does not contemplate that a company may give its note, due 60 days or one or two years after date, for the amount due its laborer, and that then, whe n the note is due, 90 days shall be allowed thereafter in which to file a memorandum claiming a lien; it means that a claim for a lien shall be made within 90 days from the time the labor was performed  from the day the laborer was entitled to demand his wages. Liberty Perpetual Bldg. &amp; Loan Co. v. M.A. Furbush &amp; Son Mach. Co., 80 F. 631, 1897 U.S. App. LEXIS 2240 (4th Cir. 1897). And memorandum may be filed before claim becomes due.  The language of this section, within ninety days after the last item of his bill becomes due and payable, is not used to designate the beginning and the e nd of the period in which the memorandum may be filed, but to fix a period not later than or beyond which the memorandum cannot be filed. A lien claimant who has extended credit may file his memorandum from the time the supplies are furnished, although t he term of credit has not expired. In re W. Norfolk Lumber Co., 112 F. 759, 1902 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 405 (D. Va. 1902). Lien relates back to date supplies were furnished.  The lien dates from the time of furnishing the supplies, and it may be claimed at any time after the supplies are furnished, whether the goods are sold for cash o r on credit, provided the claim is filed not later than 90 days after the last item of the account becomes due and payable. If the claim is filed within that time, the lien secured relates back to the time the supplies were furnished. In re W. Norfolk Lu mber Co., 112 F. 759, 1902 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 405 (D. Va. 1902). Time runs from last it em of continuous contract.  If the supplies are furnished under a single contract, and are in fulfillment thereof, the items of the account are continuous, and the lien claimant has 90 days from the due date of the last item within which to file his memorandum and perfect his lien. On the other hand, if the several items of the account, or a portion of them, are furnished under separate contracts, then the lien should be filed 90 days from the due date of the last item under each independent contract. Frick Co. v. Norfolk &amp; O.V.R.R., 86 F. 725, 1898 U.S. App. LEXIS 2332 (4th Cir. 1898); First Nat'l Bank v. William R. Trigg Co., 106 Va. 327, 56 S.E. 158, 1907 Va.

Limitati on is suspended by order of reference to master.  An order of reference to a master suspends the running of the statutory limitation of 90 days within which the memorandum must be filed in order to secure a lien. Seventh Nat'l Bank v. Shenandoah Iron Co., 35 F. 436, 1887 U.S. App. LEXIS 2958 (C.C.D. Va. 1887); Newgass v. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry., 56 F. 676, 1893 U.S. App. LEXIS 2704 (C.C.D.

But not by pendency of suit and appointment of receivers.  The limitation in this section is not suspended by the pendency of a suit in which receivers have been appointed. Seventh Nat'l Bank v. Shenandoah Iron Co., 35 F. 436, 1887 U.S. App. LEXIS 2958 (C.C.D. Va. 1887). Claims are enforceable in bankruptcy.  When a lien for wages has been perfected in the manner prescribed by this section it is enforceable under § 67d of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides for the p reservation and enforcement of liens given in good faith and not repugnant to the Bankruptcy Act. Harrington v. Sencindiver, 173 Va. 33, 3 S.E.2d 381, 1939 Va. LEXIS 174 (1939). And memorandum may be filed after adjudication.  The lien given by § 43-24 attaches at the time the supplies are furnished, and is not destroyed by the adjudication in bankruptcy of the debtor intervening bet ween the time when the last item on the account for supplies is due and the filing and recording of the claim. Mott v. Wissler Mining Co., 135 F. 697, 1905 U.S. App. LEXIS 4361 (4th Cir. 1905). Effect of failur e to perfect lien against bankrupt.  Where wage claims are not perfected in the manner prescribed by this section, such claims are not enforceable in bankruptcy as prior liens on the property of a co rporation. But failure to perfect the liens under this section does not mean that the wage claims are not entitled to priority under the Bankruptcy Act and under the provisions of the deed of assignment.

And he shall have the same remedy for the enforcement of such lien by distress when the claim is due, or by attachment when the claim is not yet payable, as is given a landlord for the recovery of rent under § 8.01-130.4; provided, that he or his agent, shall, before suing out the distress warrant, make affidavit before the magistrate issuing the same to t he amount of his claim, that it is then due and is for advances made under contract to a tenant cultivating or raising livestock on his land, or a laborer working or raising livestock on the same; and before suing out the attachment, make the like affida vit, and also at what time the claim will become payable, and that the debtor intends to remove, or is removing from such land such crops or livestock, or his portion thereof, or share therein, so that there will not be left enough to satisfy the claim. The person, whose crops or livestock are so distrained or attached, shall have all the rights and be entitled to all the remedies allowed a tenant against a distress or attachment for rent.

And in case the person claiming advances fails to render to the sheriff of such county the verified itemized statement above provided for within ten days after the request has been made, he shall foreve r lose the benefit of the lien on the crops or livestock for advances granted him under this section. (3) When furth er showing as to advances required.  If the execution creditor or attachment creditor desires to contest the validity of the claims for advances, he may cause the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which such crops are grown or livestock rai sed to summon the person claiming the lien for advances to appear before such court and show to the satisfaction of the court that such money, supplies or other things of value were advanced for the purpose of, and were necessary in and about the cultiva tion of the crops or the raising of the livestock upon which the lien is claimed.

Woodyard, 4 Bankr. 124, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5312 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). Priority of lien over homestead deed.  See Epperley v. Woodyard, 4 Bankr. 124, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5312 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). Underl ying interest not transformed into judicial lien.  Even where enforcement of a livery stable keepers lien, provided for by statute, contemplates effectuation through the court system, such proceedings do not t ransform the underlying interest into a judicial lien. O'Malley v. Rapidan River Farm, 24 Bankr. 900, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15829 (E.D. Va. 1982). Amount to which claimant entitled where limit increased by amendment during proceedings.  Claimant was entitled to the $150.00 amount provided under this section for alterations and repairs when the transactions took place, rather than the $500.00 amou nt in effect when an adversary proceeding was filed in federal bankruptcy court, since the claims for alterations and repairs to the boat giving rise to a lien arose before the passage of the 1984 amendment. Blue Ridge Recreation, Inc. v. Dean, 55 Bankr. 332, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 4889 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1985). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Possession of property not required.  Nothing within subsection A of § 43-32 states that a lienor must maintain possession of the property in order to assert a lien upon it; in fact, subsection D o f § 43-32 states that remaining in possession of the property is merely an option for the potential lienor. Gold Key Aviation, L.L.C. v. Int'l Jet Charter, Inc., 56 Va. Cir. 421, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 482 (Norfolk Sept. 19, 2001). Manager found to be keeper.  Manager was a keeper within the plain meaning of the word for purposes of establishing a lien on an aircraft where it arranged for and provided hangar space for t he owners aircraft, coordinated and provided services necessary to maintain and legally operate the aircraft, and, as a lessee, was accountable for all activities that occurred in the hangar and/or tie-down space. Gold Key Aviation, L.L.C. v. Int'l J et Charter, Inc., 56 Va. Cir. 421, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 482 (Norfolk Sept. 19, 2001). Dollar amount of lien not limited.  Subsection A of § 43-32 does not limit the dollar amount of a keepers lien for the support, keeping, and care of an aircraft; subsection B of § 43-32 si mply establishes the priority of a secured creditor over the lienor and limits a storage lien to $300 for property subject to a chattel mortgage or other security interest. Gold Key Aviation, L.L.C. v. Int'l Jet Charter, Inc., 56 Va. Cir. 421, 2001 Va. C ir. LEXIS 482 (Norfolk Sept. 19, 2001). Lien was valid, perfected, a nd enforceable.  Where a manager asserted and provided proof that the claim was filed in accordance with § 43-34.1, as modified by § 55-100, the managers nonpossessory l ien for the usual and reasonable charges for storage, alteration, or repair performed by the manager upon an aircraft, was valid, perfected, and enforceable.

In addition, such mechanic shall be entitled to a lien against the proceeds, if any, remaining after the sat isfaction of all prior security interests or liens and may retain possession of such property until such charges are paid. In any action to enforce the lien hereby given all persons having an interest in the property sought to be subjected shall be made parties defendant. If the owner of the property held by the mechanic shall desire to obtain possession thereof, he shall make the mechanic defendant in proceeding in the county or municip al court to recover the property. The owner may give a bond payable to the court, in a penalty of the amount equal to the lien claimed by the mechanic and court costs, with security to be approved by th e clerk, and conditioned for the performance of the final judgment of the court on the trial of the proceeding, and with a further condition to the effect that, if upon the hearing, the judgment of the court be that the lien of the mechanic on such prope rty, or any part thereof, be enforced, judgment may thereupon be entered against the obligors on such bond for the amount due the mechanic and court costs, if assessed against the owner, without further or other proceedings against them thereon.

The filing of a financing statement to perfect the security interest in a motor vehicle is not required.  The $600 amount mentioned in the third sentence of this section (see now the second paragraph) has no application to the sale of motor vehicles; that amount relat es to a requirement of notice to any secured party who has filed a financing statement against the subject property. The filing of a financing statement to perfect the security interest in a motor vehicle is not required. Instead, the sale of such motor vehicles is governed by the specific provisions of the fourth and fifth sentences of this section. Newport News Shipbuilding Employees' Credit Union, Inc. v.

CASE NOTES The holder of a mechanics lien that is bonded off, pursuant to this section, must still establish the priority of the lien. York Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. William A. Hazel, Inc., 256 Va. 599, 506 S.E.2d 315 (1998). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Necessary parties.  Once a mechanics lien on an owners property was released by the posting of a bond, the owners property interest could not be defeated or diminished by the underlying breach of construction contract litigation. The bonding off process substituted the bond for the real estate and, under those circumstances, it made no difference whether the property owner remained a nominal party or was released from the lawsuit.

CASE NOTES The legislative purpose of this section was to facilitate the financing and expedite the completion of construction and repair projects by creating an alternative security device which provides those who supply the labor and materials to those projects protection equivalent to the protection afforded by mechanics liens. George W. Kane, Inc. v. Nuscope, Inc., 243 Va. 503, 416 S.E.2d 701, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2848, 1992 Va. LEXIS 43 (1992). Necessary parties.  The owner of property encumbered by a subcontractors mechanics lien and the trustees and the beneficiary of a deed of trust recorded prior to commencement of the improvements are not necessary parties to the subcontractors suit to enforce its lien when that lien has been bonded off and released pursuant to this section. George W. Kane, Inc. v. Nuscope, Inc., 243 Va. 503, 416 S.E.2d 701, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2848, 1992 Va. LEXIS 43 (1992). Remand from federal court not requir ed.  Remand was not required under the Princess Lida doctrine where a mechanics lien ceased to exist once a bond was posted pursuant to Virginias bonding-o ff procedure in § 43-71, and the action on the bond was simply an in personam contract claim. Pax, Inc. v. Veolia Water N. Am. Operating Servs., 347 F. Supp. 2d 281, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24931 (W.D. Va. 2004). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Amended pleading time-barred.  Pursuant to § 43-17, the subcontractor was required to commence its action to enforce its lien within six months from the time the lien was recorded. Because m ore than six months had passed, the subcontractor was time-barred from amending its complaint to add the general contractor as a party to the subcontractors suit on bond. ADS Constr., Inc. v. Bacon Constr., Co., 85 Va. Cir. 456, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 9 (Loudoun County Oct. 18, 2012). Supplier could not amend its complaint to add a subcontractor as a defendant on a bond claim since: (1) the claim was time-barred under § 43-17; (2) the relati on back provision in § 8.01-6.1 did not apply to mechanics liens; and (3) when a party sought enforcement of a bond posted under § 43-71, the substantive and procedural requirements of the mechanics lien statutes applied. Johnson Controls v . Norair Eng'g Corp., 86 Va. Cir. 138, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 3 (Fairfax County Jan. 10, 2013). Necessary parties.  Once a mechanics lien on an owners property was released by the posting of a bond, the owners property interest could not be defeated or diminished by the underlying breach of construction contract litigation. The bonding off process substituted the bond for the real estate and, under those circumstances, it made no difference whether the property owner remained a nominal party or was released from the lawsuit. Trident Elec., Inc. v. John S. Clark, Inc., 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 5 (Roanoke County Feb. 8, 2008). Because the bond did not absolve the general contractor from liability to the subcontractor, the general contractor retained an immediate interest in resisting th e demand made in the suit on bond; Thus, the general contractor was a necessary party to the subcontractors suit. ADS Constr., Inc. v. Bacon Constr., Co., 85 Va. Cir. 456, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 89 (Loudoun County Oct. 18, 2012). Bond claim was dismissed for failure to name a subcontractor, which as bond principal was a necessary party since a bond had been substituted for a suppliers mechanics lien under § 43-71; the subcontractor did not have an opportunity to defend the suppliers perfection of the mechanics lien or a right to present defenses to the bond claim generally.
