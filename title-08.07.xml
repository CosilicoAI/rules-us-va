OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Former Section 7-101. Changes: Rev ised for style only. This Article is a revision of the 1962 Official Text with Comments as amended since 1962. The 1962 Official Text was a consolidation and revision of the Uniform W arehouse Receipts Act and the Uniform Bills of Lading Act, and embraced the provisions of the Uniform Sales Act relating to negotiation of documents of title. This Article does not contain the substantive criminal provisions found in the Uniform Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading Acts. These criminal provisions are inappropriate to a Commercial Code, and for the most part duplicate portions of the ordinary criminal law relating to frauds. This revision deletes the former Section 7-105 that provided that courts could apply a rule from Parts 2 and 3 by analogy to a s ituation not explicitly covered in the provisions on warehouse receipts or bills of lading when it was appropriate. This is, of course, an unexceptional proposition and need not be stated explicitly in the statute. Thus former Section 7-105 has been dele ted. Whether applying a rule by analogy to a situation is appropriate depends upon the facts of each case. The Article does not attempt to define the tort liability of bailees, except to hold certain classes of bailees to a minimum standard of reasonable care. For impo rtant classes of bailees, liabilities in case of loss, damages or destruction, as well as other legal questions associated with particular documents of title, are governed by federal statutes, international treaties, and in some cases regulatory state la ws, which supersede the provisions of this Article in case of inconsistency. See Section 7-103. VIRGINIA COMMENT This title replaces the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, adopted in Virginia in 1908, and set forth in the 1950 Code as former §§ 61-1 through 61-58. The UCC does not cover the criminal aspects of this act, now contained in §§ 61.1-1 through 61.1-6. Former sections 61-1 to 61-52 were repealed by the act enacting the UCC. The UCC also replaces the Uniform Sales Act and the Uniform Bills of Lading Act, neither of which was ever adopted in Virginia. This title does not replace other regulatory statutes as the Cold Storage Warehouses Act, Code 1950, former §§ 61.1-7 through 61.1-21, the Refrigerated Lock er Plants Act, Code 1950, former §§ 61-78 through 61-94; the acts regulating tobacco warehouses and the handling and sale of tobacco, Code 1950, §§ 61.1-38 through 61.1-46.1; and the several acts relating to public service companies set forth in Title 56.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.7-102"><akn:num>§ 8.7-102</akn:num><akn:heading>Definitions and index of definitions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) In this ti tle, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) Bailee means the person who by a warehouse receipt, bill of lading or other document acknowledges p ossession of goods and contracts to deliver them.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Bailments, § 18. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Former Section 7-102. Changes: New definitions of carrier, good faith, record, sign, and shipper. Other definitions revised to accommodate electronic mediums. Purposes: 1. Bailee is used in this Article as a blanket term to designate carriers, warehousemen and others who normally issue documents of title on the basis of g oods which they have received. The definition does not, however, require actual possession of the goods. If a bailee acknowledges possession when it does not have possession, the bailee is bound by sections of this Article which declare the bailee s obligations. (See definition of Issuer in this section and Sections 7-203 and 7-301 on liability in case of non-receipt.) A carrier is one type of bailee and is defined as a person that issues a bill of lading. A shipper is a person who enters into the contract of transportation with the carrier. The definitions of bailee, consignee, consignor, goods, and issuer, are unchanged in substance from prior law. Document of title is defined in Article 1, and may be in either tangible or electronic form. 2. The definition of warehouse receipt contained in the general definitions section of this Act (Section 1-201) does not require that the issuing warehouse be lawfully engaged in business or for profit. The warehouses compliance with applicable state regulations such as the filing of a bond has no bearing on the substantive issues dealt with in this Article. Certainly the issuers violations of law should not diminish its responsibility on documents the issuer has put in commercial circulation. But it is still essential that the business be storing goods for hire (Section 1-201 and this section). A person does not become a warehouse by storing its own goods. 3. When a delivery order has been accepted by the bailee it is for practical purposes indistinguishable from a warehouse receipt. Prior to such acceptance there i s no basis for imposing obligations on the bailee other than the ordinary obligation of contract which the bailee may have assumed to the depositor of the goods. Delivery orders may be either electronic or tangible documents of title. See definition of document of title in Section 1-201. 4. The obligation of good faith imposed by this Article and by Article 1, Section 1-304 includes the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing . 5. The definitions of record and sign are included to facilitate electronic mediums. See Comment 9 to Section 9-102 discussing record and the comment to amended Section 2-103 discussing sign. 6. Person entitled under the document is moved from former Section 7-403. 7. These definitions apply in this Article unless the context otherwise requires. The context is intended to refer to the context in which the defined ter m is used in the Uniform Commercial Code. The definition applies whenever the defined term is used unless the context in which the defined term is used in the statute indicates that the term was not used in its defined sense.

Changes: Del etion of references to tariffs and classifications; incorporation of former Section 10-104 into subsection (b), provide for intersection with federal and state law governing electronic transactions. Purposes: 1. To make clear what would of course be true without the Section, that applicable federal law is paramount. 2. To make clear also that regulatory state statutes (such as those fixing or authorizing a commission to fix rates and prescribe services, authorizing different charges for goods of different values, and limiting liability for loss to the declared value on which the charge was based) are not affected by the Article and are controlling on the matters which they cover unless preempted by federal law. The reference in former Section 7-103 to tariffs, classifications, and regulations filed or issued pursuant to regulatory state statutes has been deleted as inappropriate in the modern era of diminished regulation of carriers and warehouses. If a regulatory scheme re quires a carrier or warehouse to issue a tariff or classification, that tariff or classification would be given effect via the state regulatory scheme that this Article recognizes as controlling. Permissive tariffs or classifications would not displace t he provisions of this act, pursuant to this section, but may be given effect through the ability of parties to incorporate those terms by reference into their agreement. 3. The document of title provisions of this act supplement the federal law and regulatory state law governing bailees. This Article focuses on the commercial impo rtance and usage of documents of title.

Section 102 of the federal act allows a State statute to modify, limit, or supersede the provisions of Section 101 of the f ederal act. See the comments to Revised Article 1, Section 1-108. 5.

The 2004 amendment by c. 200 rewrote the introductory paragraph in subsection (1); in subsection (2), substituted A for Any other and inserted other than one described in susection 1 in the first sentence and substituted an for written and inserted in a record in the last sentence; and added subsection (3). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Former Section 7-104. Changes: Sub section (a) is revised to reflect modern style and trade practice. Subsection (b) is revised for style and medium neutrality. Subsection (c) is new. Purposes: 1. This Article deals with a class of commercial paper representing commodities in storage or transportation. This commodity paper is to be distinguished from what might be called money paper dealt with in the Article of this Act on Commercial Paper (Article 3) and investment paper dealt with in the Article of this Act on Investment Securities (Article 8). The class of commodity paper  is designated document of title following the terminology of the Uniform Sales Act Section 76. Section 1-201. The distinctions between negotiable and nonnegotiable documents in this section makes the most important subclassification employed in the Article, in that the holder of negotiable documents may acquire more rights than its transferor had (See Section 7-502). The former Section 7-104, which provided that a document of title was negotiable if it runs to a named person or assigns if s uch designation was recognized in overseas trade, has been deleted as not necessary in light of current commercial practice. A document of title is negotiable only if it satisfies this section. Deliverable on proper indorsement and surrender of this receipt will not render a doc ument negotiable. Bailees often include such provisions as a means of insuring return of nonnegotiable receipts for record purposes. Such language may be regarded as insistence by the bailee upon a particular kind of receipt in connection with delivery o f the goods. Subsection (a) makes it clear that a document is not negotiable which provides for delivery to order or bearer only if written instructions to that effect are given by a named person. Either tangible or electronic documents of title may be n egotiable if the document meets the requirement of this section. 2. Subsection (c) is derived from Section 3-104(d). Prior to issuance of the document of title, an issuer may stamp or otherwise provide by a notation on the docu ment that it is nonnegotiable even if the document would otherwise comply with the requirement of subsection (a). Once issued as a negotiable document of title, the document cannot be changed from a negotiable document to a nonnegotiable document. A docu ment of title that is nonnegotiable cannot be made negotiable by stamping or providing a notation that the document is negotiable. The only way to make a document of title negotiable is to comply with subsection (a). A negotiable document of title may fa il to be duly negotiated if the negotiation does not comply with the requirements for due negotiation stated in Section 7-501.

Reissuance in alternative medium. Text (1) Upon reque st of a person entitled under an electronic document, the issuer of the electronic document may issue a tangible document as a substitute for the electronic document if: (a) the person entitled under the electronic document surrenders control of the document to the issuer; and (b) the tangible document when issued contains a statement that it is issued in substitution for the electronic document. (2) Upon issua nce of a tangible document in substitution for an electronic document in accordance with subsection (1): (a) the electronic document ceases to have any effect or validity; and (b) the person that procured issuance of the tangible document warrants to all subsequent persons entitled under the tangible document that the warrantor was a person entitled under the electronic document when the warrantor surrendered control of the electronic document to the issuer. (3) Upon reque st of a person entitled under a tangible document, the issuer of the tangible document may issue an electronic document as a substitute for the tangible document if: (a) the person entitled under the tangible document surrenders possession of the document to the issuer; and (b) the electronic document when issued contains a statement that it is issued in substitution for the tangible document. (4) Upon issua nce of an electronic document in substitution for a tangible document in accordance with subsection (3): (a) the tangible document ceases to have any effect or validity; and (b) the person that procured issuance of the electronic document warrants to all subsequent persons entitled under the electronic document that the warrantor was a person entitled under the tangible document when the warrantor surrendered possession of the tangible document to the issuer. History History. 2004, c. 200. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provisions: None. Other relevant law: UNCITRAL Draft Instrument on the Carriage of Goods by Sea Transport Law. Purposes: 1. This section allows for documents of title issued in one medium to be reissued in another medium. This section applies to both negotiable and nonnegotiable doc uments. This section sets forth minimum requirements for giving the reissued document effect and validity. The issuer is not required to issue a document in an alternative medium and if the issuer chooses to do so, it may impose additional requirements. Because a document of title imposes obligations on the issuer of the document, it is imperative for the issuer to be the one who issues the substitute document in order for the substitute document to be effective and valid. 2. The request must be made to the issuer by the person entitled to enforce the document of title (Section 7-102(a)(9)) and that person must surrender possession or control of the original document to the issuer. The reissued document must have a notation that it has been issued as a substitute for the original document. These minimum requirements must be met in order to give the substitute document effect and va lidity. If these minimum requirements are not met for issuance of a substitute document of title, the original document of title continues to be effective and valid. Section 7-402. However, if the minimum requirements imposed by this section are met, in addition to any other requirements that the issuer may impose, the substitute document will be the document that is effective and valid. 3. To protect parties who subsequently take the substitute document of title, the person who procured issuance of the substitute document warrants that it was a p erson entitled under the original document at the time it surrendered possession or control of the original document to the issuer. This warranty is modeled after the warranty found in Section 4-209. Cross References: Sections 7-106, 7-402 and 7-601.

History History. 2004, c. 200. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Uniform Electronic Transactions Act Section 16. Purposes: 1. The section defines control for electronic documents of title and derives its rules from the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act § 16 on transferrab le records. Unlike UETA § 16, however, a document of title may be reissued in an alternative medium pursuant to Section 7-105. At any point in time in which a document of title is in electronic form, the control concept of this section is relevant. As under UETA § 16, the control concept embodied in this section provides the legal framework for developing systems for electronic documents of title. 2. Control of an electronic document of title substitutes for the concept of indorsement and possession in the tangible document of title context. See Section 7-5 01. A person with a tangible document of title delivers the document by voluntarily transferring possession and a person with an electronic document of title delivers the document by voluntarily transferring control. (Delivery is defined in Section 1-201 ). 3. Subsection (a) sets forth the general rule that the system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the electronic document reliably establishe s that person as the person to which the electronic document was issued or transferred. The key to having a system that satisfies this test is that identity of the person to which the document was issued or transferred must be reliably established. Of great importance to the functioning of the control concept is to be able to demonstrate, at any point i n time, the person entitled under the electronic document. For example, a carrier may issue an electronic bill of lading by having the required information in a database that is encrypted and accessible by virtue of a password. If the computer system in which the required information is maintained identifies the person as the person to which the electronic bill of lading was issued or transferred, that person has control of the electronic document of tit le. That identification may be by virtue of passwords or other encryption methods. Registry systems may satisfy this test. For example, see the electronic warehouse receipt system established pursuant to 7 C.F.R. Part 735. This Article leaves to the mark et place the development of sufficient technologies and business practices that will meet the test. An electronic document of title is evidenced by a record consisting of information stored in an electronic medium. Section 1-201. For example, a record in a compu ter database could be an electronic document of title assuming that it otherwise meets the definition of document of title. To the extent that third parties wish to deal in paper mediums, Section 7-105 provides a mechanism for exiting the electronic envi ronment by having the issuer reissue the document of title in a tangible medium. Thus if a person entitled to enforce an electronic document of title causes the information in the record to be printed onto paper without the issuers involvement in iss uing the document of title pursuant to Section 7-105, that paper is not a document of title. 4. Subsection (a) sets forth the general test for control. Subsection (b) sets forth a safe harbor test that if satisfied, results in control under the general te st in subsection (a). The test in subsection (b) is also used in Section 9-105 although Section 9-105 does not include the general test of subsection (a). Under subsection (b), at any point in time, a party should be able to identify the single authorita tive copy which is unique and identifiable as the authoritative copy. This does not mean that once created that the authoritative copy need be static and never moved or copied from its original location. To the extent that backup systems exist which resu lt in multiple copies, the key to this idea is that at any point in time, the one authoritative copy needs to be unique and identifiable. Parties may not by contract provide that control exists. The test for control is a factual test that depends upon whether the general test in subsection (a) or th e safe harbor in subsection (b) is satisfied. 5. Article 7 has historically provided for rights under documents of title and rights of transferees of documents of title as those rights relate to the goods cov ered by the document. Third parties may possess or have control of documents of title. While misfeasance or negligence in failure to transfer or misdelivery of the document by those third parties may create serious issues, this Article has never dealt wi th those issues as it relates to tangible documents of title, preferring to leave those issues to the law of contracts, agency and tort law. In the electronic document of title regime, third party registry systems are just beginning to develop. It is ver y difficult to write rules regulating those third parties without some definitive sense of how the third party registry systems will be structured. Systems that are evolving to date tend to be closed systems in which all participants must sign on to the master agreement which provides for rights as against the registry system as well as rights among the members. In those closed systems, the document of title never leaves the system so the parties rely upon the master agreement as to rights again st the registry for its failures in dealing with the document. This article contemplates that those closed systems will continue to evolve and that the control mechanism in this statute provides a method for the participants in the closed system to achieve the benefits of obtaining control allowed by this article. This article also contemplates that parties will evolve open systems where parties need not be subject to a master agreement. In an open system a party that is ex pecting to obtain rights through an electronic document may not be a party to the master agreement. To the extent that open systems evolve by use of the control concept contained in this section, the law of contracts, agency, and torts as it applies to t he registrys misfeasance or negligence concerning the transfer of control of the electronic document will allocate the risks and liabilities of the parties as that other law now does so for third parties who hold tangible documents and fail to delive r the documents.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-202. Changes: Lan guage is updated to accommodate electronic commerce and to reflect modern style. Purposes: 1. This section does not displace any particular legislation that requires other terms in a warehouse receipt or that may require a particular form of a warehouse receipt. This section does not require that a warehouse receipt be issued. A warehouse receipt that is issued need not contain any of the terms listed in subsection (b) in order to qualify as a warehouse receipt as long as the receipt falls within the d efinition of warehouse receipt in Article 1. Thus the title has been changed to eliminate the phrase essential terms as provided in prior law. The only consequence of a warehouse receipt not containing any term listed in subsection (b) is that a person injured by a terms omission has a right as against the warehouse for harm caused by the omission. Cases, such as In re Celotex Corp., 134 Bankr. 993 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1991), that held that in order to have a valid warehouse receipt all of the terms listed in this section must be contained in the receipt, are disapproved. 2. The unique identification code referred to in subsection (b)(3) can include any combination of letters, number, signs, and/or symbols that provide a unique ide ntification. Whether an electronic or tangible warehouse receipt contains a signature will be resolved with the definition of sign in Section 7-102. Cross references: Sections 7-103 and 7-401.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Under the original § 20 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act a principal was not bound by the act of his agent in issuing a warehouse receipt for goods which had not actually been received. A substitute § 20 was proposed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1922, which would have imposed liability in such circumstances, but this substitute amendment was not adopted in Virgin ia. Consequently, this section changes Virginia law as it relates to the liability of a warehouseman for his agents fraudulent issue of warehouse receipts when no goods have been received.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.7-204"><akn:num>§ 8.7-204</akn:num><akn:heading>Duty of care; contractual limitation of warehousemans liability</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) A warehous eman is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by his failure to exercise such care in regard to them as a reasonably careful man would exercise under like circumstances but unless otherwise agreed he is not liable for damages that could not have been avoided by the exercise of such care. (2) Damages ma y be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage, beyond which the warehouseman shall not be liable. On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing such storage a greement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehousemans liability may be increased on part or all of the goods thereunder. In this event, increased rates may be charged based on such increased valuation. No suc h limitation is effective with respect to the warehousemans liability for conversion to his own use. (3) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and instituting actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement. History History.

Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Public Storage, 743 F. Supp. 2d 525, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97807 (E.D. Va. 2010). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-204. Changes: Upd ated to reflect modern, standard commercial practices. Purposes of changes: 1. Subsection (a) continues the rule without change from former Section 7-204 on the warehouses obligation to exercise reasonable care. 2. Former Section 7-204(2) required that the term limiting damages do so by setting forth a specific liability per article or item or of a value per unit of weigh t. This requirement has been deleted as out of step with modern industry practice. Under subsection (b) a warehouse may limit its liability for damages for loss of or damage to the goods by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement without the term constituting an impermissible disclaimer of the obligation of reasonable care. The parties cannot disclaim by contract the warehouses obligation of care. Section 1-302. For example, limitations based upon per unit of weight, per package, per oc currence, or per receipt as well as limitations based upon a multiple of the storage rate may be commercially appropriate. As subsection (d) makes clear, the states or the federal government may supplement this section with more rigid standards of respon sibility for some or all bailees. 3. Former Section 7-204(2) also provided that an increased rate can not be charged if contrary to a tariff. That language has been deleted. If a tariff is require d under state or federal law, pursuant to Section 7-103(a), the tariff would control over the rule of this section allowing an increased rate. The provisions of a non-mandatory tariff may be incorporated by reference in the parties agreement. See Com ment 2 to Section 7-103. Subsection (c) deletes the reference to tariffs for the same reason that the reference has been omitted in subsection (b). 4. As under former Section 7-204(2), subsection (b) provides that a limitation of damages is ineffective if the warehouse has converted the goods to its own use. A mere failure to redeliver the goods is not conversion to the warehouses own use. See Adams v. Ryan &amp; Christie Storage, Inc., 563 F. Supp. 409 (E.D. Pa. 1983) affd 725 F.2d 666 (3rd Cir. 1983). Cases such as I.C.C. Metals Inc. v. Municipal Wareh oue Co., 409 N.E. 2d 849 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1980) holding that mere failure to redeliver results in a presumption of conversion to the warehouses own use are disapproved. Conversion to its own use is narrower than the idea of conversion generally . Cases such as Lipman v. Peterson, 575 P.2d 19 (Kan. 1978) holding to the contrary are disapproved. 5. Storage agreements commonly establish the contractual relationship between warehouses and depositors who have an on-going relationship. The storage agreement m ay allow for the movement of goods into and out of a warehouse without the necessity of issuing or amending a warehouse receipt upon each entry or exit of goods from the warehouse.

The 2004 amendment by c. 200 inserted the goods and substituted the receipt is negotiable and for it. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-205. Changes: Cha nges for style only. Purposes: 1. The typical case covered by this section is that of the warehouse-dealer in grain, and the substantive question at issue is whether in case the warehouse becom es insolvent the receipt holders shall be able to trace and recover grain shipped to farmers and other purchasers from the elevator. This was possible under the old acts, although courts were eager to find estoppels to prevent it. The practical difficult y of tracing fungible grain means that the preservation of this theoretical right adds little to the commercial acceptability of negotiable grain receipts, which really circulate on the credit of the warehouse. Moreover, on default of the warehouse, the receipt holders at least share in what grain remains, whereas retaking the grain from a good faith cash purchaser reduces the purchaser completely to the status of general creditor in a situation where there was very little the purchaser could do to guar d against the loss. Compare 15 U.S.C. Section 714p enacted in 1955. 2. This provision applies to both negotiable and nonnegotiable warehouse receipts. The concept of due negotiation is provided for in Section 7-501. The definitio n of buyer in ordinary course is in Article 1 and provides, among other things, that a buyer must either have possession or a right to obtain the goods under Article 2 in order to be a buyer in ordinary course. This section requires actual delive ry of the fungible goods to the buyer in ordinary course. Delivery requires voluntary transfer of possession of the fungible goods to the buyer. See amended Section 2-103. This section is not satisfied by the delivery of the document of title to the buye r in ordinary course. Cross references: Sections 2-403 and 9-320.

(3) If as a re sult of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouseman had no notice at the time of deposit the goods are a hazard to other property or to the warehouse or to persons, the warehouseman may sell the goods at public or private sale without a dvertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.

History History. Code 1950, § 61-37; 1964, c. 219; 2004, c. 200. Annotations The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendment by c. 200 substituted 30 for thirty in the first sentence of subsection (1); deleted for notification, advertisement and sa le preceding the warehouseman may in subsection (2); and inserted or posting in the first sentence of subsection (3). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-206. Changes: Cha nges for style. Purposes: 1. This section provides for three situations in which the warehouse may terminate storage for reasons other than enforcement of its lien as permitted by Section 7-210. Most warehousing is for an indefinite term, the bailor being entitled to delivery on reasonable demand. It is necessary to define the warehouses power to terminate the bailment, since it would be commercially intolerable to allow warehouses to order removal of the goods on short notice. The thirty day period provided where the document does not carry its own period of termination corresponds to commercial practice of computing rates on a monthly basis. The right to terminate under subsection (a) includes a right to require payment of any charges, but does not depend on the existence of upaid charges. 2. In permitting expeditious disposition of perishable and hazardous goods the pre-Code Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, Section 34, made no distinction between ca ses where the warehouse knowingly undertook to store such goods and cases where the goods were discovered to be of that character subsequent to storage. The former situation presents no such emergency as justifies the summary power of removal and sale. S ubsections (b) and (c) distinguish between the two situations. The reason of this section should apply if the goods become hazardous during the course of storage. The process for selling the goods described in Section 7-210 governs the sale of goods unde r this section except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) for the situations described in those subesctions respectively. 3. Protection of its lien is the only interest which the warehouse has to justify summary sale of perishable goods which are not hazardous. This same interest mus t be recognized when the stored goods, although not perishable, decline in market value to a point which threatens the warehouses security. 4. The right to order removal of stored goods is subject to provisions of the public warehousing laws of some states forbidding warehouses from discriminating amo ng customers. Nor does the section relieve the warehouse of any obligation under the state laws to secure the approval of a public official before disposing of deteriorating goods. Such regulatory statutes and the regulations under them remain in force a nd operative. Section 7-103. Cross references: Sections 7-103 and 7-403. Definitional cross references: Delivery.

Code 1950, § 61-16; 1964, c. 219; 2004, c. 200. Annotations The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendment by c. 200, in the first sentence, inserted good faith and substituted lack for want, and inserted tangible or elect ronic in the last sentence. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-208. Changes: To accommodate electronic documents of title. Purposes: 1. The execution of tangible warehouse receipts in blank is a dangerous practice. As between the issuer and an innocent purchaser the risks should clearly fall on the former. The purchaser must have purchased the tangible negotiable warehouse receipt in good faith and for value to be protected under the rule of the first sentence which is a limited exception to the general rule in the second sentence. Electronic document of title systems should have protection against unauthorized access and unauthorized changes. See Section 7-106. Thus the protection for good faith purchasers found in the first sentence is not necessary in the context of electronic documents. 2. Under the second sentence of this section, an unauthorized alteration whether made with or without fraudulent intent does not relieve the issuer of its liabili ty on the warehouse receipt as originally executed.

If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for like charges or expen ses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouseman also has a lien against the goods covered by th e warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in his possession for such charges and expenses whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouseman. But against a person to whom a negotiable warehouse receipt is dul y negotiated a warehousemans lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified on the receipt or if no charges are so specified then to a reasonable charge for storage of the goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the rec eipt. (2) The wareho useman may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for a maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (1), such as for money advanced and interest. Such a security interest is governed by the ti tle on secured transactions (Title 8.9A). (3) A warehous emans lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) or a security interest under subsection (2) is also effective against any person who so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good faith pur chaser for value would have been valid but is not effective against a person who before issuance of a document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not: (a) deli ver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailors nominee with: (i) actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell; (ii) power to obtain delivery under § 8.7-403; or (iii) power of disposition under §§ 8.2-403, 8.2A-304(2), 8.2A-305(2), 8.9A-320, or § 8.9A-321(c) or other statute or rule of law; or (b) acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document. (4) A warehous emans lien under subsection (1) on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit. The term household goods means furniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling. Such lien shall be effective against a prior security interest that has been otherwise perfected as required by law only to the extent of $150. (5) A warehous eman loses his lien on any goods that he voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver. History History.

Commercial Law, § 98. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Sections 7-209 and 7-503. Changes: Exp anded to recognize warehouse lien when a warehouse receipt is not issued but goods are covered by a storage agreement. Purposes: 1. Subsection (a) defines the warehouses statutory lien. Other than allowing a warehouse to claim a lien under this section when there is a storage agreement and not a warehouse receipt, this section remains unchanged in substance from former Section 7-209(1). Under the first sentence, a specific lien attaches automatically without express notation on the receipt or storage agreement with regard to goods stor ed under the receipt or the storage agreement. That lien is limited to the usual charges arising out of a storage transaction. Example 1: Bailor stored goods with a warehouse and the warehouse issued a warehouse receipt. A lien against those goods arose as set forth in subsection (a), the first sentence, for the charges for storage and the other expenses of those goods. The warehouse may enforce its lien under Section 7-210 as against the bailor. Whether the warehouse receipt is negotiable or nonnegotiable is not important to the warehou ses rights as against the bailor. Under the second sentence, by notation on the receipt or storage agreement, the lien can be made a general lien extending to like charges in relation to other goo ds. Both the specific lien and general lien are as to goods in the possession of the warehouse and extend to proceeds from the goods as long as the proceeds are in the possession of the warehouse. The same rules apply whether the receipt is negotiable or non-negotiable. Example 2: Bailor stored goods (lot A) with a warehouse and the warehouse issued a warehouse receipt for those goods. In the warehouse receipt it is stated that t he warehouse will also have a lien on goods covered by the warehouse receipt for storage charges and the other expenses for any other goods that are stored with the warehouse by the bailor. The statement about the lien on other goods does not specify an amount or a rate. Bailor then stored other goods (lot B) with the warehouse. Under subsection (a), first sentence, the warehouse has a lien on the specific goods (lot A) covered by the warehouse receipt. Under subsection (a), second sentence, the warehou se has a lien on the goods in lot A for the storage charges and the other expenses arising from the goods in lot B. That lien is enforceable as against the bailor regardless of whether the receipt is negotiable or nonnegotiable. Under the third sentence, if the warehouse receipt is negotiable, the lien as against a holder of that receipt by due negotiation is limited to the amount or rate specified on the receipt for the specific lien or the general lien, or, if none is specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt for storage after the date of the receipt. Example 3: Same facts as Example 1 except that the warehouse receipt is negotiable and has been duly negotiated (Section 7-501) to a person other than the bailor. Under the last sentence of subsection (a), the warehouse may enforce its lien against the bailors goods stored in the warehouse as against the person to whom the negotiable warehouse receipt has been duly negotiated. Section 7-502. That lien is limi ted to the charges or rates specified in the receipt or a reasonable charge for storage as stated in the last sentence of subsection (a). Example 4: Same facts as Example 2 except that the warehouse receipt is negotiable and has been duly negotiated (Section 7-501) to a person other than the bailor. Under the last sentence of subsection (a), the lien on lot A goods for the storage charges and the other expenses arising from storage of lot B goods is not enforceable as against the person to whom the receipt has been duly negotiated. Without a statem ent of a specified amount or rate for the general lien, the warehouses general lien is not enforceable as against the person to whom the negotiable document has been duly negotiated. However, the warehouse lien for charges and expenses related to sto rage of lot A goods is still enforceable as against the person to whom the receipt was duly negotiated. Example 5: Same facts as Examples 2 and 4 except the warehouse had stated on the negotiable warehouse receipt a specified amount or rate for the general lien on o ther goods (lot B). Under the last sentence of subsection (a), the general lien on lot A goods for the storage charges and the other expenses arising from storage of lot B goods is enforceable as against the person to whom the receipt has been duly negot iated. 2. Subsection (b) provides for a security interest based upon agreement. Such a security interest arises out of relations between the parties other than bailment for storage or transportation, as where the bailee assumes the role of financier or performs a manufacturing operation, extending credit in reliance upon the goods covered by the receipt. Such a security interest is not a statutory lien. Compare Sections 9-109 and 9-333. It is governed in all respects by Article 9, except that subsection (b) requires that the receipt specify a maximum amount and limits the security interest to the amount specified. A warehouse could also take a security interest to secu re its charges for storage and the other expenses listed in subsection (a) to protect these claims upon the loss of the statutory possessory warehouse lien if the warehouse loses possession of the goods as provided in subsection (e). Example 6: Bailor stores goods with a warehouse and the warehouse issues a warehouse receipt that states that the warehouse is taking a sec...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.7-210"><akn:num>§ 8.7-210</akn:num><akn:heading>Enforcement of warehousemans lien</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), a warehousemans lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods in bloc or in parcels, at any time or place and on any terms which are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an inte rest in the goods. Such notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a differ ent method from that selected by the warehouseman is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the warehouseman either sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, o r sells at the price current in such market at the time of his sale, or has otherwise sold in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold, he has sold in a commercially reasonable manner. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to insure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence. (2) A warehous emans lien on goods other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of his business may be enforced only as follows: (a) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified. (b) The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than 10 days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place. (c) The sale must conform to the terms of the notification. (d) The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to that where the goods are held or stored. (e) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulat ion where the sale is to be held. The advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account they are being held, and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least 15 days after the first public ation. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be posted at least 10 days before the sale in not less than six conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale. (3) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred under this section. In that event, the goods must not be sold, but must be retained by the ware houseman subject to the terms of the receipt and this title. (4) The wareho useman may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section. (5) A purchase r in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehousemans lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid, despite the warehousemans noncompliance with the requirements of this section. (6) The wareho useman may satisfy his lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but must hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to whom he would have been bound to deliver the goods. (7) The rights provided by this section shall be in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against his debtor. (8) Where a li en is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of his business, the lien may be enforced in accordance with either subsection (1) or (2). (9) The wareho useman is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of willful violation, is liable for conversion. History History.

Chapter 27 Property Actions. § 27.13 Trover and Conversion. Friend. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-210. Changes: Upd ate to accommodate electronic commerce and for style. Purposes: 1. Subsection (a) makes commercial reasonableness the standard for foreclosure proceedings in all cases except non-commercial storage with a warehouse. Th e latter category embraces principally storage of household goods by private owners; and for such cases the detailed provisions as to notification, publication and public sale are retained in subsection (b) with one change. The requirement in former Sect ion 7-210(2)(b) that the notification must be sent in person or by registered or certified mail has been deleted. Notification may be sent by any reasonable means as provided in Section 1-202. The swifter, more flexible procedure of subsection (a) is app ropriate to commercial storage. Compare sellers power of resale on breach by buyer under the provisions of the Article on Sales (Section 2-706). Commercial reasonableness is a flexible concept that allows for a wide variety of actions to satisfy the rule of this section, including electronic means of posting and sale. 2. The provisions of subsections (d) and (e) permitting the bailee to bid at public sales and confirming the title of purchasers at foreclosure sales are designed to secure more bidding and better prices and remain unchanged from former Section 7-210. 3. A warehouse may have recourse to an interpleader action in appropriate circumstances. See Section 7-603. 4. If a warehouse has both a warehouse lien and a security interest, the warehouse may enforce both the lien and the security interest simultaneously by using the procedures of Article 9. Section 7-210 adopts as its touchstone commercial reasonableness for the enforcement of a warehouse lien. Following the procedures of Article 9 satisfies commercial reasonableness. Cross references: Sections 2-706, 7-403, 7-603, and Part 6 of Article 9. Definitional cross references: Bill of lading.

(2) When goods are loaded by an issuer of a bill of lading, the issuer must count the packages of goods, if shipped in packages, and ascertain the kind and quantity if shipped in bulk. In such cases shippers weight, load and count or other words indicatin g that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods concealed by packages. (3) When bulk goods are loaded by a shipper who makes available to the issuer of a bill of lading adequate facilities for weighing such goods, the issuer must ascertain the kind and quantity within a reasonable time after receiving, in a record, the shippers reque st to do so. In such cases shippers weight or other words of like purport are ineffective. (4) The issuer of a bill of lading, by inserting in the bill the words shippers weight, load and count or other words of like purport, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper; and if such statement is true, the issuer shall not be liable for damages caused by the improper loading. However, their omission does not imply liability for such damages. (5) The shippe r shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition and weight, as furnished by him; and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the issuer to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-301. Changes: Cha nges for clarity, style and to recognize deregulation in the transportation industry. Purposes: 1. This section continues the rules from former Section 7-301 with one substantive change. The obligations of the issuer of the bill of lading under former subsec tions (2) and (3) were limited to issuers who were common carriers. Subsections (b) and (c) apply the same rules to all issuers not just common carriers. This section is compatible with the policies stated in the federal Bills of Lading Act, 49 U.S.C. § 80113 (2000). 2. The language of the pre-Code Uniform Bills of Lading Act suggested that a carrier is ordinarily liable for damage caused by improper loading, but may relieve i tself of liability by disclosing on the bill that shipper actually loaded. A more accurate statement of the law is that the carrier is not liable for losses caused by act or default of the shipper, which would include improper loading. D.H. Overmyer Co. v. Nelson Brantley Glass Co., 168 S.E.2d 176 (Ga. Ct. App. 1969). There was some question whether under pre-Code law a carrier was liable even to a good faith purchaser of a negotiable bill for such losses, if the shippers faulty loading in fact caus ed the loss. Subsection (d) permits the carrier to bar, by disclosure of shippers loading, liability to a good faith purchaser. There is no implication that decisions such as Modern Tool Corp. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 100 F. Supp. 595 (D.N.J.1951), ar e disapproved. 3. This section is a restatement of existing law as to the method by which a bailee may avoid responsibility for the accuracy of descriptions which are made by or in reliance upon information furnished by the depositor or shipper. The wording in this section  contents or condition of contents of packages unknown or shippers weight, load and count  to indicate that the shipper loaded th e goods or that the carrier does not know the description, condition, or contents of the loaded packages continues to be appropriate as commonly understood in the transportation industry. The reasons for this wording are as important in 2002 as when the prior section initially was approved. The issuer is liable on documents issued by an agent, contrary to instructions of his principal, without receiving goods. No disclaimer of this liability is permitted since it is not a matter either of the care of th e goods or their description. 4. The shippers erroneous report to the carrier concerning the goods may cause damage to the carrier. Subsection (e) therefore provides appropriate indemnity. 5. The word freight in the former Section 7-301 has been changed to goods to conform to international and domestic land transport usage in which freight means the price paid for carriage of the goods and not the goods themselves. Hence, changing the word freight to the word goods is a clarifying change that fits both international and domestic practice. Cross references: Sections 7-203, 7-309 and 7-501.

CASE NOTES Liability of initial car rier under former law.  See Adams Express Co. v. Green, 112 Va. 527, 72 S.E. 102, 1911 Va. LEXIS 113 (1911). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-302. Changes: To conform to current terminology and for style. Purposes: 1. This section continues the rules from former Section 7-302 without substantive change. The term performing carrier is substituted for the term conn ecting carrier to conform the terminology of this section with terminology used in recent UNCITRAL and OAS proposals concerning transportation and through bills of lading. This change in terminology is not substantive. This section is compatible with liability on carriers under federal law. See 49 U.S.C. §§ 11706, 14706 and 15906. The purpose of this section is to subject the initial carrier under a through bill to suit for breach of the contract of carriage by any performing carrier and to make it clear that any such performing carrier holds the goods on terms which are defined by the document of title even though such performing carrier did not issue the document. Since the performing carrier does hold the goods on the terms of the docum ent, it must honor a proper demand for delivery or a diversion order just as the original bailee would have to. Similarly it has the benefits of the excuses for non-delivery and limitations of liability provided for the original bailee who issued the bil l. Unlike the original bailee-issuer, the performing carriers responsibility is limited to the period while the goods are in its possession. The section does not impose any obligation to issue through bills. 2. The reference to documents other than through bills looks to the possibility that multi-purpose documents may come into use, e.g., combination warehouse receip ts and bills of lading. As electronic documents of title come into common usage, storage documents (e.g., warehouse receipts) and transportation documents (e.g., bills of lading) may merge seamlessly into one electronic document that can serve both the s torage and transportation segments of the movement of goods. 3. Under subsection (a) the issuer of a through bill of lading may become liable for the fault of another person. Subsection (c) gives the issuer appropriate righ ts of recourse. 4. Despite the broad language of subsection (a), Section 7-302 is subject to preemption by federal laws and treaties. Section 7-103. The precise scope of federal preemption in the transportation sector is a question determined under federal law. Cross reference: Section 7-103. Definitional cross references: Agreement.

VIRGINIA COMMENT This section imposes liability on the issuer of a through bill of lading for damages caused by connecting carriers, with a right over by the initial carrier again st the connecting carrier who is primarily liable. This represents some change in Virginia law, to the extent that prior Virginia statutes are applicable to bills of lading. Under Code 1950, §§ 56-120 and 56-121, repealed by the act enacting the UC C, the initial carrier is prima facie liable, but it will be relieved of liability if it can establish that some other party caused the loss. Big Sandy and Cumberland Railroad Co. v. Ball, 133 Va. 431, 438-39, 113 S.E. 722 (1922) (failure to deliver); So uthern Express Co. v. Jacobs, 109 Va. 27, 33, 63 S.E. 17 (1908) (injury to a horse); Norfolk and Western Railway Co. v. Wilkinson, 106 Va. 775, 780-81, 56 S.E. 808 (1907) (delay in delivery). The repealed Virginia statute, § 56-120, by its terms was not applicable where the shipment originates outside the state. Southern Railway Co. v. Russell, 133 Va. 292, 294-95, 112 S.E. 700 (1922). The constitutionality of the Virginia statutes was upheld, as not being in conflict with the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, in Richmond and Alleghany Railroad Co. v. Patterson Tobacco Co., 169 U.S . 311 (1898), affg. 92 Va. 670, 24 S.E. 261 (1896). In light of the Carmack Amendment, though, the statutes were limited to intrastate commerce. Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co. v. National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk, 122 Va. 471, 488, 95 S.E. 454 (1 918); Old Dominion Steamship Co. v. Flanary &amp; Co., 111 Va. 816, 819, 60 S.E. 1107 (1911); Radford-Portsmouth Veneer Co. v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co., 1 Va. Law Reg. (N.S.) 598, 602 (Radford Corp. Ct. 1915). The UCC is in accord with Vaughn Machine Co. v. Staunton Tanning Co., 106 Va. 445, 451-52, 56 S.E. 140 (1907), in recognizing that the consignee is entitled to su e for damages to goods consigned to him.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.7-303"><akn:num>§ 8.7-303</akn:num><akn:heading>Diversion; reconsignment; change of instructions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text (1) Unless the bill of lading otherwise provides, the carrier may deliver the goods to a person or destination other than that stated in the bill or may otherwise dispose of the goods, without liability for misdelivery, on instructions from: (a) the holder of a negotiable bill; or (b) the consignor on a nonnegotiable bill notwithstanding contrary instructions from the consignee; or (c) the consignee on a nonnegotiable bill in the absence of contrary instructions from the consignor, if the goods have arrived at the billed destination or if the consignee is in posse ssion of the tangible bill or in control of the electronic bill; or (d) the consignee on a nonnegotiable bill if he is entitled as against the consignor to dispose of them. (2) Unless suc h instructions are noted on a negotiable bill of lading, a person to whom the bill is duly negotiated can hold the bailee according to the original terms. History History. 1964, c. 219; 2004, c. 200. Annotations The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendment by c. 200 inserted without liability for misdelivery in the introductory paragraph of subsection (1); and inserted tangible and or in control of the electronic bill in subdivision (1)(c). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-303. Changes: To accommodate electronic documents and for style. Purposes: 1. Diversion is a very common commercial practice which defeats delivery to the consignee originally named in a bill of lading. This section continues former Sect ion 7-303s safe harbor rules for carriers in situations involving diversion and adapts those rules to electronic documents of title. This section works compatibly with Section 2-705. Carriers may as a business matter be willing to accept instructions from consignees in which case the carrier will be liable for misdelivery if the consignee was not the owner or otherwise empowered to dispose of the goods under subsection (a)(4). The section imposes no duty on carriers to undertake diversion. The carri er is of course subject to the provisions of mandatory filed tariffs as provided in Section 7-103. 2. It should be noted that the section provides only an immunity for carriers against liability for misdelivery. It does not, for example, defeat the titl e to the goods which the consignee-buyer may have acquired from the consignor-seller upon delivery of the goods to the carrier under a nonnegotiable bill of lading. Thus if the carrier, upon instructions from the consignor, returns the goods to the consi gnor, the consignee may recover the goods from the consignor or the consignors insolvent estate. However, under certain circumstances, the consignees title may be defeated by diversion of the goods in transit to a different consignee. The rights that arise between the consignor-seller and the consignee-buyer out of a contract for the sale of goods are governed by Article 2. Cross references: Point 1: Sections 2-705 and 7-103.

The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of this subsection. (2) Where a bi ll of lading is lawfully drawn in a set of parts, each of which is numbered and expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been delivered against any other part, the whole of the parts constitute one bill. (3) Where a bi ll of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts and different parts are negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to whom the first due negotiation is made prevails as to both the document and the goods even though any later holder may h ave received the goods from the carrier in good faith and discharged the carriers obligation by surrender of his part. (4) Any person who negotiates or transfers a single part of a bill of lading drawn in a set is liable to holders of that part as if it were the whole set. (5) The bailee is obliged to deliver in accordance with part 4 of this title against the first presented part of a bill of lading lawfully drawn in a set. Such delivery discharges the bailees obligation on the whole bill. History History. 1964, c. 219. Annotations OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-304. Changes: To limit bills in a set to tangible bills of lading and to use terminology more consistent with modern usage. Purposes: 1. Tangible bills of lading in a set are still used in some nations in international trade. Consequently, a tangible bill of lading part of a set could be at issu e in a lawsuit that might come within Article 7. The statement of the legal effect of a lawfully issued set is in accord with existing commercial law relating to maritime and other international tangible bills of lading. This law has been codified in the Hague and Warsaw Conventions and in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the provisions of which would ordinarily govern in situations where bills in a set are recognized by this Article. Tangible bills of lading in a set are prohibited in domestic trade. 2. Electronic bills of lading in domestic or international trade will not be issued in a set given the requirements of control necessary to deliver the bill to an other person. An electronic bill of lading will be a single, authoritative copy. Section 7-106. Hence, this section differentiates between electronic bills of lading and tangible bills of lading. This section does not prohibit electronic data messages ab out goods in transit because these electronic data messages are not the issued bill of lading. Electronic data messages contain information for the carriers management and handling of the cargo but this information for the carriers use is not the issued bill of lading.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-305. Changes: To accommodate electronic bills of lading and for style. Purposes: 1. Subsection (a) continues the rules of former Section 7-305(1) without substantive change. This proposal is designed to facilitate the use of order bills in con nection with fast shipments. Use of order bills on high speed shipments is impeded by the fact that the goods may arrive at destination before the documents, so that no one is ready to take delivery from the carrier. This is especially inconvenient for c arriers by truck and air, who do not have terminal facilities where shipments can be held to await the consignees appearance. Order bills would be useful to take advantage of bank collection. This may be preferable to C.O.D. shipment in which the car rier, e.g., a truck driver, is the collecting and remitting agent. Financing of shipments under this plan would be handled as follows: seller at San Francisco delivers the goods to an airline with instructions to issue a bill in New York to a named bank. Seller receives a receipt embodying this undertaking to issue a destination bill. Airline wires its New York freight agent to issue the bill as instructed by the seller. Seller wires the New York bank a draft on buyer. New York bank indorses the bill to buyer when the buyer honors the draft. Normally seller would act through its own bank in San Francisco, which would extend credit in reliance on the airlines contract to deliver a bill to the order of its New York correspondent. This section is enti rely permissive; it imposes no duty to issue such bills. Whether a performing carrier will act as issuing agent is left to agreement between carriers. 2. Subsection (b) continues the rule from former Section 7-305(2) with accommodation for electronic bills of lading. If the substitute bill changes from an electr onic to a tangible medium or vice versa, the issuance of the substitute bill must comply with Section 7-105 to give the substitute bill validity and effect.

Purposes: An unauthorized alteration or filling in of a blank, whether made with or without fraudulent intent, does not relieve the issuer of its liability on the document as originally executed. This section applies to both tangible and electronic bills of lading, applying the same rule to both types of bills of lading. The control concept of Section 7-106 requires that any changes to the electronic document of title be r eadily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized. Section 7-306 should be compared to Section 7-208 where a different rule applies to the unauthorized filling in of a blank for tangible warehouse receipts. Cross references: Sections 7-106 and 7-208.

However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading, a carriers lien is limited to charges stated in the bill , or, if no charges are stated, a reasonable charge. (2) A lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) on goods that the carrier was required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authorit y to subject the goods to such charges and expenses.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Former Section 7-307. Changes: Exp anded to cover proceeds of the goods transported. Purposes: 1. The section is intended to give carriers a specific statutory lien for charges and expenses similar to that given to warehouses by the first sentence of Sectio n 7-209(a) and extends that lien to the proceeds of the goods as long as the carrier has possession of the proceeds. But because carriers do not commonly claim a lien for charges in relation to other goods or lend money on the security of goods in their hands, provisions for a general lien or a security interest similar to those in Section 7-209(a) and (b) are omitted. Carriers may utilize Article 9 to obtain a security interest and become a secured party or a carrier may agree to limit its lien rights in a transportation agreement with the shipper. As the lien given by this section is specific, and the storage or transportation often preserves or increases the value of the goods, subsection (b) validates the lien against anyone who permitted the bailo r to have possession of the goods. Where the carrier is required to receive the goods for transportation, the owners interest may be subjected to charges and expenses arising out of deposit of his goods by a thief. The crucial mental element is the c arriers knowledge or reason to know of the bailors lack of authority. If the carrier does not know or have reason to know of the bailors lack of authority, the carrier has a lien under this section against any person so long as the conditions of subsection (b) are satisfied. In light of the crucial mental element, Sections 7-307 and 9-333 combine to give priority to a carriers lien over security interests in the goods. In this regard, the judicial decision in In re Sharon Steel Corp., 25 U.C.C. Rep.2d 503, 176 Bankr. 384 (W.D. Pa. 1995) is correct and is the controlling precedent. 2. The reference to charges in this section means charges relating to the bailment relationship for transportation. Charges does not mean that the bill of lading must state a specific rate or a specific amount. However, failure to state a specific rate or a specific amount has legal consequences under the second sentence of subsection (a). 3. The carriers specific lien under this section is a possessory lien. See subsection (c). Part 3 of Article 7 does not require any particular form for a bill of lading. The carriers lien arises when the carrier has issued a bill of lading. Cross references: Point 1: Sections 7-209, 9-109 and 9-333. Point 3: Sections 7-202 and 7-209.

Such notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the carr ier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the carrier either sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor or if he sells at the price current in such market at the time of his sale or if he has otherwise sold in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold he has sold in a commercially reasonable manner. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered t o ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence. (2) Before any sale pursuant to this section any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred under this section. In that event the goods must not be sold, but must be retained by the carrie r subject to the terms of the bill and this title. (3) The carrie r may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section. (4) A purchase r in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carriers lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid, despite noncompliance by the carrier with the requirements of this section. (5) The carrie r may satisfy his lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but must hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to whom he would have been bound to deliver the goods. (6) The rights provided by this section shall be in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against his debtor. (7) A carrier s lien may be enforced in accordance with either subsection (1) or the procedure set forth in subsection (2) of § 8.7-210. (8) The carrie r is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and in case of willful violation is liable for conversion. History History.

Sydnor &amp; Hundley, Inc. v. Wilson Trucking Corp., 213 Va. 704, 194 S.E.2d 733, 1973 Va. LEXIS 212 (1973). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Former Section 7-309. Changes: Ref erences to tariffs eliminated because of deregulation, adding reference to transportation agreements, and for style. Purposes: 1. A bill of lading may also serve as the contract between the carrier and the bailor. Parties in their contract should be able to limit the amount of damages for breach of that contract including breach of the duty to take reasonable care of the goods. The parties cannot disclaim by contract the carriers obligation of care. Section 1-302. Federal statutes and treaties for air, maritime and rail transport may alter the standard of care. These federal statutes and treaties preempt this section when a pplicable. Section 7-103. Subsection (a) does not impair any rule of law imposing the liability of an insurer on a common carrier in intrastate commerce. Subsection (b), however, applies to the common carriers liability as an insurer as well as to li ability based on negligence. Subsection (b) allows the term limiting damages to appear either in the bill of lading or in the parties transportation agreement. Compare 7-204(b). Subsection (c) allows the parties to agree to provisions regarding time and manner of presenting claims or commencing actions if the provisions are either in the bill of lading or the transportation agreement. Compare 7-204(c). Transportation agreements are commonly used to establish agreed terms between carriers and shipper s that have an on-going relationship. 2. References to public tariffs in former Section 7-309(2) and (3) have been deleted in light of the modern era of deregulation. See Comment 2 to Section 7-103. I f a tariff is required under state or federal law, pursuant to Section 7-103(a), the tariff would control over the rule of this section. As governed by contract law, parties may incorporate by reference the limits on the amount of damages or the reasonab le provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims set forth in applicable tariffs, e.g., a maximum unit value beyond which goods are not taken or a disclaimer of responsibility for undeclared articles of extraordinary value. 3. As under former Section 7-309(2), subsection (b) provides that a limitation of damages is ineffective if the carrier has converted the goods to its own use. A mere failure to redeliver the goods is not conversion to the carriers own use. Conversion to its own use is narrower than the idea of conversion generally. Art Masters Associates, Ltd. v. United Parcel Service, 77 N.Y.2d 200, 567 N.E.2d 226 ( 1990); See, Kemper Ins. Co. v. Fed. Ex. Corp., 252 F.3d 509 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1020 (2001 ) (opinion interpreting federal law). 4. As used in this section, damages may include damages arising from delay in delivery. Delivery dates and times are often specified in the parties contract. See Section 7-403. Cross references: Sections 1-302, 7-103, 7-204, and 7-403. Definitional cross references: Action.

VIRGINIA COMMENT The last sentence of subsection 8.7-309(1) saves Code 1950, § 56-119, which invalidates contractual provisions purporting to exempt transportation companies fr om their liability as common carriers. The supreme court of appeals in Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co. v. Osborne, 154 Va. 477, 494, 153 S.E. 865 (1930), discussed this liability in these terms: The liability of the carrier is practically that of an in surer of the property to the full amount of its value against all loss or damage of whatever kind, due to whatever cause, with the exception of loss or damage caused by the act of God or the public enemy, to which exception in modern times there have bee n added loss or damage from the inherent nature of the property. In the case of loss or destruction of the property for which the carrier is liable, it is liable for the full value of the property, and in the event of injury or damage to the property for which the carrier is liable, it is liable for the full amount of the damage thereto. See also Adams Express Co. v. Allen, 125 Va. 530, 544-45, 100 S.E. 473 (1919); Southern Express Co. v. Keeler, 109 Va. 459, 468-69, 64 S.E. 38 (1909); Chesapeake an d Ohio Railway Co. v. Pew, 109 Va. 288, 294, 64 S.E. 35 (1909). Subsection 8.7-309(2) permits the carrier to limit the amount of damages on the basis of declared values. The prior Virginia statute did not cover this, but the V irginia cases have recognized that a shipper who knowingly misrepresents the value of goods is estopped, after the goods have been lost or damaged, to assert that the value was different from what he had represented it to be. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co . v. Osborne, 154 Va. 477, 503-06, 153 S.E. 865 (1930); Adams Express Co. v. Green, 112 Va. 527, 533-35, 72 S.E. 102 (1911); Southern Express Co. v. Keeler, 109 Va. 459, 469, 64 S.E. 38 (1909). The prior Virginia statute did not expressly cover the effect of provisions in bills of lading relating to the time and manner of presenting claims and institutin g actions. Apparently, the question was never presented in Virginia as regards an intrastate shipment, but the supreme court of appeals, applying federal law, several times gave effect to such provisions in bills of lading and covering interstate shipmen ts.

Norfolk and Western Railway Co., 107 Va. 323, 330, 58 S.E. 569 (1907). Although not covered, the UCC is consistent with the holding in Norfolk and Western Railway Co. v. Stuarts Draft Milling Co., 109 Va. 184, 189-90, 63 S.E. 415 (1909), that the liability of a carrier is converted into the liability of a warehouseman when the consignee refuses to receive the goods.

The 2004 amendment by c. 200 substituted even if for of title regardless of the fact that in the introductory paragraph. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-401. Changes: Cha nges for style only. Purposes: The bailees liability on its document despite non-receipt or misdescription of the goods is affirmed in Sections 7-203 and 7-301. The purpose of this section is to make it clear that regardless of irregularities a document which falls within the definition of document of title imposes on the issuer the obligations stated in this Article. For example, a bailee will not be permitted to avoid its obligation to d eliver the goods (Section 7-403) or its obligation of due care with respect to them (Sections 7-204 and 7-309) by taking the position that no valid document was issued because it failed to file a statutory bond or did not pay stamp taxes or did n ot disclose the place of storage in the document.

Annotations The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendment by c. 200, in the first sentence, deleted of title preceding purporting to cover, inserted tangible and of parts,  deleted and following fungible goods, and inserted or substitute documents issued pursuant to § 8.7-105.1; and in the last sentence, deleted But at the beginning and on its face at the end. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-402. Changes: Cha nges to accommodate electronic documents. Purposes: 1. This section treats a duplicate which is not properly identified as a duplicate like any other overissue of documents: a purchaser of such a document acquires no title but only a cause of action for damages against the person that made the deception possible, except in the cases noted in the section. But parts of a tangible bill lawfully issued in a set of parts are not overissue (Section 7-304). Of co urse, if the issuer has clearly indicated that a document is a duplicate so that no one can be deceived by it, and in fact the duplicate is a correct copy of the original, the issuer is not liable for preparing and delivering such a duplicate copy. Section 7-105 allows documents of title to be reissued in another medium. Re-issuance of a document in an alternative medium under Section 7-105 requires that the original document be surrendered to the issuer in order to make the substitute document the effective document. If the substitute document is not issued in compliance with Section 7-105, then the document should be treated as a duplicate under this sect ion. 2. The section applies to nonnegotiable documents to the extent of providing an action for damages for one who acquires an unmarked duplicate from a transferor wh o knew the facts and would therefore have had no cause of action against the issuer of the duplicate. Ordinarily the transferee of a nonnegotiable document acquires only the rights of its transferor. 3. Overissue is defined so as to exclude the common situation where two valid documents of different issuers are outstanding for the same goods at the same time. Thus freight forwarders commonly issue bills of lading to their customers for small shipments to be combined into carload shipments for which the railroad will issue a bill of lading to the forwarder. So also a warehouse receipt may be outstanding agains t goods, and the holder of the receipt may issue delivery orders against the same goods. In these cases dealings with the subsequently issued documents may be effective to transfer title; e.g., negotiation of a delivery order will effectively transfer ti tle in the ordinary case where no dishonesty has occurred and the goods are available to satisfy the orders. Section 7-503 provides for cases of conflict between documents of different issuers. Cross references: Point 1: Sections 7-105, 7-207, 7-304, and 7-601. Point 3: Section 7-503.

(2) A person c laiming goods covered by a document must satisfy the bailees lien where the bailee so requests or where the bailee is prohibited by law from delivering the goods until the charges are paid. (3) Unless the person claiming the goods is one against whom the document confers no right under § 8.7-503 (1), he must surrender possession or control, for cancellation or notation of partial deliveries, any outstanding negotiable document covering the goods, and the bailee must cancel the document or conspicuously note the partial delivery thereon or be liable to any person to whom the document is duly negotiated. (4) Person entitled under the document means holder, in the case of a negotiable document, or the person to whom delivery of the goods is to be made by the terms of, or pursuant to instructions in a record under, a nonnegotiable document.

The official text of the Uniform Commercial Code offers as optional language at the end of subsection (1) (b) of the section, the following: but the burden of establishing negligence in such cases is on the person entitled under the document. The optional language was omitted to accord with Virginia law as noted in the Virginia Comment to this section.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Bailments, § 18. CASE NOTES Burden of proof.  Action by a bailor against a bailee for damages arising out of an alleged breach of the warehousemans duty to deliver goods stored under a warehouse receipt i s subject to the provisions of Virginias UCC, including the burden of proof requirements of subsection (1) (b) of this section. Otto Gerdau Co. v. Lambert's Point Docks, Inc., 733 F.2d 343, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 22859 (4th Cir. 1984). Any action brought by a bailor against a bailee under the provisions of UCC is subject to the burden-shifting rule established in John Nix &amp; Co. v. Herbert, 149 V a. 131, 140 S.E. 121 (1927) and incorporated in subsection (1) (b) of this section. Otto Gerdau Co. v. Lambert's Point Docks, Inc., 733 F.2d 343, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 22859 (4th Cir. 1984). Effect of section on bailees burden of proof when goods are lost.  The effect of this section is not to shift the ultimate burden of proof from bailor to bailee, but merely to shift to the bailee the burden of going forward with the evidence to prove that loss was not due to failure to exercise due care. Canty v. Wyatt Storage Corp., 208 Va. 161, 156 S.E.2d 582, 1967 Va. LEXIS 200 (1967). In action in contract, plaintiffs having established their title and right to the household goods and furniture, and having shown the delivery to a warehouseman f or their account and the warehousemans failure to return it to them on demand, they made a prima facie case, and the burden shifted to the warehouseman to show that the loss by fire was not due to its negligence. Canty v. Wyatt Storage Corp., 208 Va. 161, 156 S.E.2d 582, 1967 Va. LEXIS 200 (1967). Duty to defend.  Under Washington law, an insurer had no duty to defend against a claim that the insured, a storage company, breached the Virginia Commercial Code by failing to fu lfill its obligation as warehouseman and bailee to deliver bailed goods to a person entitled to them because a care, custody, or control exclusion operated to relieve the insurer of the duty to defend the bailment claim. Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Public Sto rage, 743 F. Supp. 2d 525, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97807 (E.D. Va. 2010). OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-403. Changes: Def inition in former Section 7-403(4) moved to Section 7-102; bracketed language in former Section 7-403(1)(b) deleted; added cross reference to Section 2A-526; changes for style. Purposes: 1. The present section, following former Section 7-403, is constructed on the basis of stating what previous deliveries or other circumstances operate to excuse t he bailees normal obligation on the document. Accordingly, justified deliveries under the pre-Code uniform acts now find their place as excuse under subsection (a). 2. The principal case covered by subsection (a)(1) is delivery to a person whose title is paramount to the rights represented by the document. For example, if a t hief deposits stolen goods in a warehouse facility and takes a negotiable receipt, the warehouse is not liable on the receipt if it has surrendered the goods to the true owner, even though the receipt is held by a good faith purchaser. See Section 7-503( a). However, if the owner entrusted the goods to a person with power of disposition, and that person deposited the goods and took a negotiable document, the owner receiving delivery would not be rightful as against a holder to whom the negotiable documen t was duly negotiated, and delivery to the owner would not give the bailee a defense against such a holder. See Sections 7-502(a)(2), 7-503(a)(1). 3. Subsection (a)(2) amounts to a cross reference to all the tort law that determines the varying responsibilities and standards of care applicable to commercial bailees. A restatement of this tort law would be beyond the scope of this Act. Much of the applicable law as to responsibility of bailees for the preservation of the goods and limitation of liability in case of loss has been codified for particular class es of bailees in interstate and foreign commerce by federal legislation and treaty and for intrastate carriers and other bailees by the regulatory state laws preserved by Section 7-103. In the absence of governing legislation the common law will prevail subject to the minimum standard of reasonable care prescribed by Sections 7-204 and 7-309 of this Article. The bracketed language found in former Section 7-403(1)(b) has been deleted thereby leaving the allocations of the burden of going forward with the evidence and t he burden of proof to the procedural law of the various states. Subsection (a)(4) contains a cross reference to both the sellers and the lessors rights to stop delivery under Article 2 and Article 2A, respectively. 4. As under former Section 7-403, there is no requirement that a request for delivery must be accompanied by a formal tender of the amount of the charges due. Rat her, the bailee must request payment of the amount of its lien when asked to deliver, and only in case this request is refused is it justified in declining to deliver because of nonpayment of charges. Where delivery without payment is forbidden by law, t he request is treated as implicit. Such a prohibition reflects a policy of uniformity to prevent discrimination by failure to request payment in particular cases. Subsection (b) must be read in conjunction with the priorities given to the warehouse lien and the carrier lien under Sections 7-209 and 7-307, respectively. If the parties are in dispute about whether the request for payment of the lien is legally proper, the bailee may have recourse to interpleader. See Section 7-603. 5. Subsection (c) states the obvious duty of a bailee to take up a negotiable document or note partial deliveries conspicuously thereon, and the result of failure in that duty. It is subject to only one exception, that stated in subsection (a)(1) of this section and in Section 7-503(a). Subsection (c) is limited to cases of delivery to a claimant; it has no application, for example, where goods held under a negot iable document are lawfully sold to enforce the bailees lien. 6. When courts are considering subsection (a)(7), any other lawful excuse, among others, refers to compliance with court orders under Sections 7-601, 7-60 2 and 7-603. Cross references: Point 2: Sections 7-502 and 7-503. Point 3: Sections 2-705, 2A-526, 7-103, 7-204, 7-309 and 10-103. Point 4: Sections 7-209, 7-307 and 7-603. Point 5: Section 7-503(1).

Changes: Cha nges reflect the definition of good faith in Section 1-201 [7-102] and for style. Purposes: This section uses the test of good faith, as defined in Section 1-201 [7-102], to continue the policy of former Section 7-404. Good faith now means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. The section states explicitly that the common law rule of innocent conversion by unauthorized intermeddling with anothers property is inapplicable to the operations of commercial carriers and warehousemen that in good faith perform obligations that they have assumed and that generally they are under a legal compulsion to assume. The section applies to delivery to a fraudulent holder of a valid document a s well as to delivery to the holder of an invalid document. Of course, in appropriate circumstances, a bailee may use interpleader or other dispute resolution process. See Section 7-603. Cross reference: Section 7-603. Definitional cross references: Bailee.

The 2004 amendment by c. 200 rewrote the section. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-501. Changes: To accommodate negotiable electronic documents of title. Purposes: 1. Subsection (a) has been limited to tangible negotiable documents of title but otherwise remains unchanged in substance from the rules in former Section 7-501. Subsection (b) is new and applies to negotiable electronic documents of title. Delivery of a negotiable electronic document is through voluntary transfer of control. Section 1-201 definition of delivery. The control concept as applied to negotiab le electronic documents of title is the substitute for both possession and indorsement as applied to negotiable tangible documents of title. Section 7-106. Article 7 does not separately define the term duly negotiated. However, the elements of duly negotiated are set forth in subsection (a)(5) for tan gible documents and (b)(3) for electronic documents. As under former Section 7-501, in order to effect a due negotiation the negotiation must be in the regular course of business or financing in order to transfer greater rights than those held by the person negotiating. The foundation of the mercantile doctrine of good faith purchase for value has always been, as shown by the case situations, the furtherance and protection of the regular course of trade. The reason for allowing a person, in bad faith or in error, to convey away rights which are not its own has from the beginning been to make possible the speedy handling of that great run of commercial transactions which are patently usual and normal. There are two aspects to the usual and normal course of mercantile dealings, namely, the person making the transfer and the nature of the transaction itself. The first question which arises is: Is the transferor a person with whom it is reasonable to deal as having full powers? In regard to documents of title the only holder whose possession or control appears, commercially, to be in order is almost invariably a person in the trade. No commercial purpose is served by allowing a tramp or a professor to duly negotiate an order bill of lading for hides or cotton not their own, and since such a transfer is obviously not in the regular course of business, it is excluded from the scope of the protection of subsections (a)(5) or (b)(3). The second question posed by the regular course qualification is: Is the transaction one which is normally proper to pass full rights without inquiry, eve n though the transferor itself may not have such rights to pass, and even though the transferor may be acting in breach of duty? In raising this question the regular course criterion has the further advantage of limiting, the effective wrongful d isposition to transactions whose protection will really further trade. Obviously, the snapping up of goods for quick resale at a price suspiciously below the market deserves no protection as a matter of policy: it is also clearly outside the range of reg ular course. Any notice on the document sufficient to put a merchant on inquiry as to the regular course quality of the transaction will frustrate a due negotiatio n. Thus irregularity of the document or unexplained staleness of a bill of lading may appropriately be recognized as negating a negotiation in regular course. A pre-existing claim constitutes value, and due negotiation does not require new value. A usual and ordinary transaction in which documents are re ceived as security for credit previously extended may be in regular course, even though there is a demand for additional collateral because the creditor deems himself insecure. But the matter has moved out of the regular course of financi ng if the debtor is thought to be insolvent, the credit previously extended is in effect cancelled, and the creditor snatches a plank in the shipwreck under the guise of a demand for additional collateral. Where a money debt is paid in commodity paper, any question of regular course disappears, as the case is explicitly excepted from due negotiation. 2. Negotiation under this section may be made by any holder no matter how the holder acquired possession or control of the document. 3. Subsections (a)(3) and (b)(2) make explicit a matter upon which the intent of the pre-Code law was clear but the language somewhat obscure: a negotiation resul ts from a delivery to a banker or buyer to whose order the document has been taken by the person making the bailment. There is no presumption of irregularity in such a negotiation; it may very well be in regular course. 4. This Article does not contain any provision creating a presumption of due negotiation to, and full rights in, a holder of a document of title akin to that crea ted by Uniform Commercial Code Article 3. But the reason of the provisions of this Act (Section 1-307) on the prima facie authenticity and accuracy of third party documents, joins with the reason of the present section to work such a presumption in favor of any person who has power to make a due negotiation. It would not make sense for this Act to autho rize a purchaser to indulge the presumption of regularity if the courts were not also called upon to do so.

VIRGINIA COMMENT Under the original §§ 40 and 47 of the Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act, a warehouse receipt can only be negotiated by the owner or by a person to whom the po ssession or custody of the receipt has been entrusted by the owner, so that a person who obtained the receipt by trespass or by finding could not negotiate the document. In 1922 the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws proposed subs titute sections, under which a person within the tenor of the document and in possession, however such possession may have been acquired, could negotiate the document. Virginia never adopted these substitute sections. Since the UCC follows the su bstitute sections, the UCC changes Virginia law as regards warehouse receipts in this respect.

In the case of a delivery order the bailees obligation accrues only upon acceptance and the obligation acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any endorser will procure the acceptance of the bailee. (2) Subject to § 8.7-503, title and rights so acquired are not defeated by any stoppage of the goods represented by the document or by surrender of such goods by the bailee, and are not impaired even though (a) the negotiation or any prior negotiation constituted a breach of duty, (b) any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible document or control of a negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft or conversion, or (c) a previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made to a third person.

Changes: To accommodate electronic documents of title and for style. Purposes: 1. This section applies to both tangible and electronic documents of title. The elements of duly negotiated, which constitutes a due negotiation, are set forth in Section 7-501. The several necessary qualifications of the broad principle that the holder of a document acquired in a due negotiation is the owner of the document and the goods have been brought together in the next section (Section 7-503). 2. Subsection (a)(3) covers the case of feeding of a duly negotiated document by subsequent delivery to the bailee of such goods as the document falsely p urported to cover; the bailee in such case is estopped as against the holder of the document. 3. The explicit statement in subsection (a)(4) of the bailees direct obligation to the holder precludes the defense that the document in question was spen t after the carrier had delivered the goods to a previous holder. But the holder is subject to such defenses as nonnegligent destruction even though not apparent on the document. The sentence on delivery orders applies only to delivery orders in nego tiable form which have been duly negotiated. On delivery orders, see also Section 7-503(b) and Comment. 4. Subsection (b) continues the law which gave full effect to the issuance or due negotiation of a negotiable document. The subsection adds nothing to the effect of the rules stated in subsection (a), but it has been included since such explicit reference was provided under former Section 7-502 to preserve the right of a purchaser by due negotiation. The listing is not exhaustive. The language any stoppage  is included lest an inference be drawn that a stoppage of the goods before or after transit might cut off or otherwise impair the purchasers rights.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior uniform statutory provision: Former Section 7-503. Changes: Cha nges to cross-reference to Article 2A and for style. Purposes: 1. In general it may be said that the title of a purchaser by due negotiation prevails over almost any interest in the goods which existed prior to the procuremen t of the document of title if the possession of the goods by the person obtaining the document derived from any action by the prior claimant which introduced the goods into the stream of commerce or carried them along that stream. A thief of the goods ca nnot indeed by shipping or storing them to the thiefs own order acquire power to transfer them to a good faith purchaser. Nor can a tenant or mortgagor defeat any rights of a landlord or mortgagee which have been perfected under the local law merely by wrongfully shipping or storing a portion of the crop or other goods. However, acquiescence by the landlord or mortgagee does not require active consent under subsection (a)(2) and knowledge of the likelihood of storage or shipment with no obje ction or effort to control it is sufficient to defeat the landlords or the mortgagees rights as against one who takes by due negotiation of a negotiable document. In re Sharon Steel, 176 Bankr. 384 (Bankr. W.D. Pa. 1995); In re R.V. Segars Co., 5 4 Bankr. 170 (Bankr. S.C. 1985); In re Jamestown Elevators, Inc., 49 Bankr. 661 (Bankr. N.D. 1985). On the other hand, where goods are delivered to a factor for sale, even though the factor has made no advances and is limited in its duty to sell for cash, the go ods are entrusted to the factor with actual . . . authority . . . to sell under subsection (a)(1), and if the factor procures a negotiable document of title it can transfer the owners interest to a purchaser by due negotiation. Furthe r, where the factor is in the business of selling, goods entrusted to it simply for safekeeping or storage may be entrusted under circumstances which give the factor apparent authority to ship, store or sell under subsection (a)(1), or power of d isposition under Section 2-403, 2A-304(2), 2A-305(2), 7-205, 9-320, or 9-321(c) or under a statute such as the earlier Factors Acts, or under a rule of law giving effect to apparent ownership. See Section 1-103. Persons having an interest in goods also frequently deliver or entrust them to agents or servants other than factors for the purpose of shipping or warehousing or under circumstances reasonably contemplating such action. This Act is clear that such persons assume full risk that the agent to whom the goods are so delivered may ship or store in breach of duty, take a document to the agents own order and then pr oceed to misappropriate the negotiable document of title that embodies the goods. This Act makes no distinction between possession or mere custody in such situations and finds no exception in the case of larceny by a bailee or the like. The safeguard in such situations lies in the requirement that a due negotiation can occur only in the regular course of business or financing and that the purchase be in good faith and without notice. See Section 7-501. Documents of title have no market among the commercially inexperienced and the commercially experienced do not take them without inquiry from persons known to be truck drivers or petty clerks even though such persons purport to be operating in their own names. Again, where the seller allows a buyer to receive goods under a contract for sale, though as a conditional delivery or under cash sale terms and o n explicit agreement for immediate payment, the buyer thereby acquires power to defeat the sellers interest by transfer of the goods to certain good faith purchasers. See Section 2-403. Both in policy and under the language of subsection (a)(1) that same power must be extended to accomplish the same result if the buyer procures a negotiable document of title to the goods and duly negotiates it. This Comment 1 should be considered in interpreting delivery, entrustment or acquiescence in application of Section 7-209(c). 2. Under subsection (a) a delivery order issued by a person having no right in or power over the goods is ineffective unless the owner acts as provided in subsect ion (a)(1) or (2). Thus the rights of a transferee of a non-negotiable warehouse receipt can be defeated by a delivery order subsequently issued by the transferor only if the transferee delivers or entrusts to the person procuring the del ivery order or acquiesces in that persons procurement. Similarly, a second delivery order issued by the same issuer for the same goods will ordinarily be subject to the first, both under this section and under Section 7-402. After a delivery order is validly issued but before it is accepted, it may nevertheless be defeated under subsection (b) in much the same way that the rights of a transferee may be defeated under Section 7-504. For example, a buyer in ordinary course from the issuer may defeat the rights of the holder of a prior delivery order if the bailee receives notification of the buyers rights before notification of the holders rights. Section 7-504(b)(2). But an accepted delivery order has the same effect as a document is sued by the bailee. 3. Under subsection (c) a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subordinated to the freight forwarders document of title, since the bill on its face gives notice of the fact that a freight forwarder is in the picture and the freight forwarder has in all probability issued a document of title. But the carrier is protected in following the terms of its own bill of lading. Cross references: Point 1: Sections 1-103, 2-403, 2A-304(2), 2A-305(2), 7-205, 7-209, 7-501, 9-320, 9-321(c), and 9-331.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Former Section 7-504. Changes: To include cross-references to Article 2A and for style. Purposes: 1. Under the general principles controlling negotiable documents, it is clear that in the absence of due negotiation a transferor cannot convey greater rights tha n the transferor has, even when the negotiation is formally perfect. This section recognizes the transferors power to transfer rights which the transferor has or has actual authority to convey. Thus, where a negotiable document of title is be ing transferred the operation of the principle of estoppel is not recognized, as contrasted with situations involving the transfer of the goods themselves. (Compare Section 2-403 on good faith purchase of goods.) This section applies to both tangible and electronic documents of title. A necessary part of the price for the protection of regular dealings with negotiable documents of title is an insistence that no dealing which is in any way irreg ular shall be recognized as a good faith purchase of the document or of any rights pertaining to it. So, where the transfer of a negotiable document fails as a negotiation because a requisite indorsement is forged or otherwise missing, the purchaser in g ood faith and for value may be in the anomalous position of having less rights, in part, than if the purchaser had purchased the goods themselves. True, the purchasers rights are not subject to defeat by attachment of the goods or surrender of them t o the purchasers transferor (contrast subsection (b)); but on the other hand, the purchaser cannot acquire enforceable rights to control or receive the goods over the bailees objection merely by giving notice to the bailee. Similarly, a consignee who makes payment to its consignor against a straight bill of lading can thereby acquire the position of a good faith purchaser of goods under provisions of the Article of this Act on Sales (Section 2-403), whereas the same payment made in good faith ag ainst an unendorsed order bill would not have such effect. The appropriate remedy of a purchaser in such a situation is to regularize its status by compelling indorsement of the document (see Section 7-506). 2. As in the case of transferas opposed to due negotiationof negotiable documents, subsection (a) empowers the transferor of a nonnegotiable docum ent to transfer only such rights as the transferor has or has actual authority to convey. In contrast to situations involving the goods themselves the operation of estoppel or agency principles is not here recognized to enable the transferor to c onvey greater rights than the transferor actually has. Subsection (b) makes it clear, however, that the transferee of a nonnegotiable document may acquire rights greater in some respects than those of his transferor by giving notice of the transfer to th e bailee. New subsection (b)(3) provides for the rights of a lessee in the ordinary course. Subsection (b)(2) and (3) require delivery of the goods. Delivery of the goods means the voluntary transfer of physical possession of the goods. See amended Secti on 2-103. 3. Subsection (c) is in part a reiteration of the carriers immunity from liability if it honors instructions of the consignor to divert, but there is added a provision protecting the title of the substituted consignee if the latter is a buyer in ordinary course of business. A typical situation would be where a manufacturer, having shipped a lot of standardized goods to A on nonnegotiable bill of lading, diver ts the goods to customer B who pays for them. Under pre-Code passage-of-title-by-appropriation doctrine A might reclaim the goods from B. However, no consideration of commercial policy supports this involvement of an innocent third party in the default o f the manufacturer on his contract to A; and the common commercial practice of diverting goods in transit suggests a trade understanding in accordance with this subsection. The same result should obtain if the substituted consignee is a lessee in ordinar y course. The extent of the lessees interest in the goods is less than a buyers interest in the goods. However, as against the first consignee and the lessee in ordinary course as the substituted consignee, the lessees rights in the goods as granted under the lease are superior to the first consignees rights. 4. Subsection (d) gives the carrier an express right to indemnity where the carrier honors a sellers request to stop delivery. 5. Section 1-202 gives the bailee protection, if due diligence is exercised where the bailees organization has not had time to act on a notification.

The indorsement of a tangible document of title is generally understood to be directed towards perfecting the transferees rights rather than towards assuming additional obligations. The lang uage of the present section, however, does not preclude the one case in which an indorsement given for value guarantees future action, namely, that in which the bailee has not yet become liable upon the document at the time of the indorsement. Under such circumstances the indorser, of course, engages that appropriate honor of the document by the bailee will occur. See Section 7-502(a)(4) as to negotiable delivery orders. However, even in such a case, once the bailee attorns to the transferee, the indors ers obligation has been fulfilled and the policy of this section excludes any continuing obligation on the part of the indorser for the bailees ultimate actual performance.

Electronic documents of ti tle will be transferred by delivery of control. Section 7-106. From a commercial point of view the intention to transfer a tangible negotiable document of title which requires an indorsement for its transfer, is incompatible with an intention to withhold such indorsement and so defeat the effective use of the document. Further, the preceding section and the Comment thereto make it clear that an indorsement generally imposes no responsibility on the indorser. 2. Although this section provides that delivery of a tangible document of title without the necessary indorsement is effective as a transfer, the transferee, of c ourse, has not regularized its position until such indorsement is supplied. Until this is done the transferee cannot claim rights under due negotiation within the requirements of this Article (Section 7-501(a)(5)) on due negotiation. Similarly, d espite the transfer to the transferee of the transferors title, the transferee cannot demand the goods from the bailee until the negotiation has been completed and the document is in proper form for surrender.

If the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document without the claimants posting security unless it finds that any person who may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession or control of the document is adequately protected against the los s. If the document was not negotiable, the court may require security. The court may also in its discretion order payment of the bailees reasonable costs and attorneys fees in any action under this subsection. (2) A bailee w ho, without court order, delivers goods to a person claiming under a missing negotiable document is liable to any person injured thereby. If the delivery is not in good faith, the bailee becomes liable for conversion. Delivery in good faith is not conver sion if the claimant posts security with the bailee in an amount at least double the value of the goods at the time of posting to indemnify any person injured by the delivery who files a notice of claim within one year after the delivery.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: Former Section 7-601. Changes: To accommodate electronic documents; to provide flexibility to courts similar to the flexibility in Section 3-309; to update to the modern era of deregulation; and for style. Purposes: 1. Subsection (a) authorizes courts to order compulsory delivery of the goods or compulsory issuance of a substitute document. Compare Section 7-402. Using langua ge similar to that found in Section 3-309, courts are given discretion as to what is adequate protection when the lost, stolen or destroyed document was negotiable or whether security should be required when the lost, stolen or destroyed document was non negotiable. In determining whether a party is adequately protected against loss in the case of a negotiable document, the court should consider the likelihood that the party will suffer a loss. The court is also given discretion as to the bailees cos ts and attorney fees. The rights and obligations of a bailee under this section depend upon whether the document of title is lost, stolen or destroyed and is in addition to the ability of the bailee to bring an action for interpleader. See Section 7-603. 2. Courts have the authority under this section to order a substitute document for either tangible or electronic documents. If the substitute document will be in a different medium than the original document, the court should fashion its order in light of the requirements of Section 7-105. 3. Subsection (b) follows prior Section 7-601 in recognizing the legality of the well established commercial practice of bailees making delivery in good faith whe n they are satisfied that the claimant is the person entitled under a missing (i.e., lost, stolen, or destroyed) negotiable document. Acting without a court order, the bailee remains liable on the original negotiable document and, to avoid conversion lia bility, the bailee may insist that the claimant provide an indemnity bond. Cf. Section 7-403. 4. Claimants on nonnegotiable instruments are permitted to avail themselves of the subsection (a) procedure because straight (nonnegotiable) bills of lading somet imes contain provisions that the goods shall not be delivered except upon production of the bill. If the carrier should choose to insist upon production of the bill, the consignee should have some means of compelling delivery on satisfactory proof of ent itlement. Without a court order, a bailee may deliver, subject to Section 7-403, to a person claiming goods under a nonnegotiable document that the same person claims is lost, stolen, or destroyed. 5. The bailees lien should be protected when a court orders delivery of the goods pursuant to this section. Cross References: Point 1: Sections 3-309, 7-402 and 7-603. Point 2: Section 7-105.

The bailee shall not be compelled to deliver the goods pursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to him or the court. One who purchases the document for value without notice of the process or injunction takes free of the lien imposed by judicial process. History History.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provisions: Former Section 7-602. Changes: Cha nges to accommodate electronic documents of title and for style. Purposes: 1. The purpose of the section is to protect the bailee from conflicting claims of the document of title holder and the judgment creditors of the person who deposi ted the goods. The rights of the former prevail unless, in effect, the judgment creditors immobilize the negotiable document of title through the surrender of possession of a tangible document or control of an electronic document. However, if the documen t of title was issued upon deposit of the goods by a person who had no power to dispose of the goods so that the document is ineffective to pass title, judgment liens are valid to the extent of the debtors interest in the goods. 2. The last sentence covers the possibility that the holder of a document who has been enjoined from negotiating it will violate the injunction by negotiating to an innocent purchaser for value. In such case the lien will be defeated. Cross references: Sections 7-106 and 7-501 through 7-503. Definitional cross references: Bailee. Section 7-102. Delivery.

Chapter 27 Property Actions. § 27.20 Interpleader. Friend. OFFICIAL COMMENT Prior Uniform Statutory Provisions: Former Section 7-603. Changes: Cha nges for style only. Purposes: 1. The section enables a bailee faced with conflicting claims to the goods to compel the claimants to litigate their claims with each other rather than with the b ailee. The bailee is protected from legal liability when the bailee complies with court orders from the interpleader. See e.g., Northwestern National Sales, Inc. v. Commercial Cold Storage, Inc., 162 Ga.App. 741, 293 S.E.2d 30 (1982). 2. This section allows the bailee to bring an interpleader action but does not provide an exclusive basis for allowing interpleader. If either state or federal pr ocedural rules allow an interpleader in other situations, the bailee may commence an interpleader under those rules. Even in an interpleader to which this section applies, the state or federal process of interpleader applies to the bailees action for interpleader. For example, state or federal interpleader statutes or rules may permit a bailee to protect its lien or to seek attorneys fees and costs in the interpleader action.
