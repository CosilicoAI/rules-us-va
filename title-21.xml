CASE NOTES The powers of sanitary districts are restricted to those specifically granted, rather th an unlimited except for those specifically prohibited. Marsh v. Gainesville-Haymarket San. Dist., 214 Va. 83, 197 S.E.2d 329, 1973 Va. LEXIS 259 (1973). As creatures of statute, sanitary districts function within the ambit of powers conferred by the legislature. Marsh v. Gainesville-Haymarket San. Dist., 214 Va. 8 3, 197 S.E.2d 329, 1973 Va. LEXIS 259 (1973). From time to time, powers have been broadened.  From time to time the powers vested in the boards of supervisors that constitute the governing bodies of sanitary districts have been broadened by statutory amend ment. The governing bodies are now authorized to engage in extensive activities in addition to those relating to the furnishing of water and sewer service. Marsh v. Gainesville-Haymarket San. Dist., 214 Va. 83, 197 S.E.2d 329, 1973 Va. LEXIS 259 (1973). A sanitary district is a limited purpose corporation. Marsh v. Gainesville-Haymarket San. Dist., 214 Va. 83, 197 S.E.2d 329, 1973 Va. LEXIS 259 (1973). But within its jurisdiction its governing body has authority to exercise any and all powers vested therein by statute to effectuate the purposes for which the district exists. Marsh v. Gainesville-Haymarket San. Dist., 214 Va. 83, 197 S.E.2d 329, 1973 Va. LEXIS 259 (1973). A municipality, as part of a sanitary district, need not utilize all the services available. Marsh v. Gainesville-Haymarket San. Dist., 214 Va. 83, 197 S.E.2d 329, 1973 Va. LEXIS 259 (1973). But it must enter the district unconditionally. Marsh v. Gainesville-Haymarket San.

The obvious legislative intent in prohibiting the reduction of a sanitary district after bonds have been issued was to prevent impairment of the security for the payment of the outstanding bonds. Th e sanitary district statutes make no other provision for the protection of bondholders. County of Fairfax v. City of Alexandria, 193 Va. 82, 68 S.E.2d 101, 1951 Va. LEXIS 242 (1951).

Under the Sanitation Districts Law no one is compelled to connect with the disposal system. He has the option of providing his own disposal facilities if he choos es, but when he connects with the disposal system he must pay his portion of the cost of it. One cannot discharge the sewage from four apartment buildings into the system, with knowledge of the Sanitation Districts Law, accepting the services and benefit s of it, and at the same time claim that he has not contracted for the same. The law under such circumstances will imply a contract on his part.

Annotations CASE NOTES Cost of relocating facilities due to street improvements.  The sanitation district, a public utility and political subdivision of the Commonwealth, must bear the cost of relocation of a sewer line installed by it in a str eet right-of-way of a city when required for street improvements. Hampton Rds. San. Dist. Comm'n v. City of Chesapeake, 218 Va. 696, 240 S.E.2d 819, 1978 Va. LEXIS 138 (1978). Acts 1960, c. 66, cl. 10(k) does not alter the common-law rule that a public utility is required to relocate and/or adjust at its own expense its facilities locat ed in public streets and highways when such relocation and/or adjustment is necessary to facilitate street and highway improvements. Hampton Rds. San. Dist. Comm'n v. City of Chesapeake, 218 Va. 696, 240 S.E.2d 819, 1978 Va. LEXIS 138 (1978). There is nothing in Acts 1960, c. 66, cl. 10(k) to indicate it was the intent of the legislature that if it became necessary to relocate Hampton Roads Sanitation District Commissions lines, due to improvements to a street made by a city, then the city would bear the expense of relocating the districts facilities. Hampton Rds. San. Dist. Comm'n v. City of Chesapeake, 218 Va. 696, 240 S.E.2d 819, 1978 Va. L EXIS 138 (1978). City not i mmune from liability for its own wrongful act.  Although Section 46 of the enabling act, Acts 1960, c. 66, immunizes a city from liability for a wrongful act committed by a sanitation district commission, it do es not immunize the city from liability for its own alleged wrongful act, i.e., the delivery of an excessive amount of nonsewage water to the sanitation district commissions pump station.

CASE NOTES The General As sembly may create drainage districts.  There seems to be no doubt whatever, in the absence of some constitutional inhibition, of the power of the General Assembly to provide for the drainage and reclam ation of swamp lands by the creation of local drainage districts, to delegate their power to local agencies to organize and control systems of drainage within their boundaries, and to assess the cost thereof against the property thereby benefited.

Which are governmental agencies and not private corporations.  A drainage district is not a private corporation, and Va. Const., Art. IX, § 7, defining the term corporation, has no application to such a district. S uch a district is not a private association, a municipal corporation or a public institution owned or controlled by the State. It is a governmental agency, an unincorporated community, organized for a specified and limited public purpose under the police power of the State. Strawberry Hill Land Corp. v.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality of chapter.  Statutes of the same general character as the drainage laws, embodied in this chapter, have been in force in many of the states for a long time and their constitu tionality is too well settled to admit of serious doubt. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, 120 Va. 492, 91 S.E. 644, 1917 Va. LEXIS 135 (1917), overruled, Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975) (holding that the constitut ional question could not be considered when raised for the first time on appeal). The primary question of the public use and necessity of drainage rights in general has been determined by the legislature, and this will be controlling with the c ourts, in the absence of something to show a palpable want of foundation for the legislative pronouncement. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, 120 Va. 492, 91 S.E. 644, 1917 Va. LEXIS 135 (1917), overruled, Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 19 75 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975). Application of this section is unconstitutional where the trial court, under the authori ty of this section, found taking proper, the effect being to decree that private property be taken for private use. Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975). Where there was an attempt to develop a tract for private gain which was the genesis and basis for condemnation of easement across private land, any incidental pu blic benefit was ancillary to and collateral to the underlying and primary purpose of the taking. That purpose was for the improvement of ones land at his neighbors expense, and for the establishment of a prosperous private enterprise by the form er to the detriment of the latter. Such a taking is not for a public use within constitutional limitations, and amounts to an unconstitutional application of this section. Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975). Salient consideration in analyzing constitutionality of this section is not whether a pu blic benefit results from condemnation, but whether a public use is predominant. Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975). The statute prescribes no special form of procedure, and its terms are very general. Hod ges v. Richmond Cedar Works, 120 Va. 492, 91 S.E. 644, 1917 Va. LEXIS 135 (1917), overruled, Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975). An d the right of drainage depends upon the facts of each case.  The statute leaves it for the court to determine in each case whether it is proper to grant the right. And in a proceeding under the statute, where none of the ev idence is certified on writ of error by defendant, it will be presumed that a proper case was made out. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, 120 Va. 493, 91 S.E. 644 (1917). Public use and public benefit are not synonymous terms. Phillips v. Foste r, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975). Public use implies a possession, occupation and enjoyment of the land by the pub lic at large, or by public agencies. A due protection to the rights of private property will preclude the government from seizing it in the hands of the owner, and turning it over to another on vague grounds of public benefit to spring from the more prof itable use to which the latter may devote it. Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975). Mode of drainage proposed by applica nt.  There is no requirement that the applicant should specify in his application the mode of drainage proposed by him. It is sufficient that this mode be made to appe ar in some satisfactory way to the defendant landowner and to the commissioners, so that the latter may hear both parties, obtain full information, and report intelligently to the court with regard to the matter. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, 120 Va. 4 92, 91 S.E. 644, 1917 Va. LEXIS 135 (1917), overruled, Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va. LEXIS 187 (1975). May be changed by commissioners.  In a proceeding under this chapter the commissioners reported and the court approved a different location for the drain from that asked for in the original petiti on. There is nothing in the statute to indicate a purpose to confine the applicant to the mode of drainage originally contemplated or proposed by him if he is willing to accept another which the commissioners and the court deem proper. The new or modifie d mode then becomes the mode proposed by the applicant within the meaning of § 21-430. Hodges v. Richmond Cedar Works, 120 Va. 492, 91 S.E. 644, 1917 Va. LEXIS 135 (1917), overruled, Phillips v. Foster, 215 Va. 543, 211 S.E.2d 93, 1975 Va.
