CASE NOTES How indebtedness declared.  Where the bill of particulars sets forth the items of account in sterling money, but its value is calculated and expressed in federal money, and the declaration a lleges an indebtedness in money of account of the State, this is sufficient to admit the introduction of evidence of transactions between the parties in sterling money. The better practice, however, is to set forth in the declaration the indebtedness in sterling money, and leave it to the jury to ascertain its value in domestic money, or to state the indebtedness to be in foreign money of the value of so much domestic currency.

Interest defined.  The word interest imports a compensation taken for the loan or use of money, and in this sense it must always be taken and construed, except when it is ma de satisfactorily to appear that it was not used in its proper sense. Turner v. Turner, 80 Va. 379, 1885 Va. LEXIS 76 (1885) (see also Mayo v. Judah, 19 Va. (5 Munf.) 495 (1817)). Why allowed.  Interest is allowed because it is natural justice that he who has the use of anothers money should pay interest for it. Jones v. Williams, 6 Va. (2 Call) 102, 1799 Va. LEXIS 34 (1799) (see also Washington &amp; Old Dominion Ry. v. Westinghouse Elec. &amp; Mfg. Co., 120 Va. 620, 89 S.E. 131 (1916)). This doctrine (of allowing interest for use of money) is founded in good conscience and correct morals. McVeigh's Ex'r v. Howard, 87 Va. 599, 13 S.E. 31, 1891 Va. LEXIS 112 (1891). Interest is favored both by the legislative and judicial bodies of the State. Tazewell's Ex'r v. Saunders Ex'r, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 354, 1856 Va. LEXIS 20 (1856). It may be by express contract.  It has always been lawful in Virginia for parties to contract for the payment of interest for the use of forbearance of money within the limits prescribed by stat ute. Roberts' Adm'r v. Cocke, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 207, 1877 Va. LEXIS 65 (1877); McVeigh's Ex'r v. Howard, 87 Va. 599, 13 S.E. 31, 1891 Va. LEXIS 112 (1891). Or by contract implied.  When there is no express contract to pay interest there is an implied contract to do so. Chapman's Adm'rs v. Shepherd's Adm'r, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 377, 1874 Va. LE XIS 19 (1874); McVeigh's Ex'r v. Howard, 87 Va. 599, 13 S.E. 31, 1891 Va. LEXIS 112 (1891). An agreement to pay the legal rate of interest is implied in the absence of an express agreement fixing a lower rate. Campbell v. Sickels, 197 Va. 298, 89 S.E.2d 14, 1955 Va. LEXIS 222 (1955). Where plaintiff partner successfully sued defendant partner for unjust enrichment, he was awarded damages plus interest pursuant to §§ 6.1-330.53 [now this section] and 8.01-382, consisting of his initial and subsequent investments, but not profits that defendant enjoyed from those payments as plaintiff was not entitled to a disgorgement of the profits, nor was it inequitable for defendant to retain them. T he initial investment was not barred by the three-year statute of limitations that was applicable to oral contracts under § 8.01-246 because, given that there was no agreed upon repayment date of an alleged obligation to pay money, it was deemed payab le on demand; thus, the statute of limitations accrued from the time that the money was transferred from plaintiff to defendant, and, as the unjust enrichment did not occur until one year before filing, any timeliness issues were dismissed. Clarke v. New ell, No. 1:05cv1013, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74251 (E.D. Va. Oct. 12, 2006). Time from which computed.  Generally, he who has the use of anothers money must pay interest upon it from the time he receives it until he repays it, unless there is an agreement, expre ss or implied, to the contrary. Hall v. Graham, 112 Va. 560, 72 S.E. 105, 1911 Va. LEXIS 119 (1911). It is the settled rule that when no day is named in a bond or note given for the payment of a precedent debt, it is due and payable on the day of its date, and be ars interest from that date. Kent's Adm'r v. Kent's Adm'r, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 840, 1877 Va. LEXIS 107 (1877); McVeigh's Ex'r v. Howard, 87 Va. 599, 13 S.E. 31, 1891 Va. LEXIS 112 (1891). It may be payable in installments.  Where the time is 12 months or more, it is no violation of either the letter or the spirit of the statutes to contract that the legal rate due shall be payable in installments during the specified period. Blanchard v. Dominion Nat'l Bank, 130 Va. 633, 108 S.E. 649, 1921 Va. LEXIS 181 (1921). Partial payments applied fir st to interest.  Where partial payments are made, so much of the payment as is equal to the interest is to be applied to the discharge thereof, and the residue toward discharging the principal, unless the debtor, at the time of the payment or before, directed otherwise. Lightfoot v. Price, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 431, 1809 Va. LEXIS 70 (1809); Mercer's Adm'r v. Beale, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 189, 1833 Va. LEXIS 8 (1833).

(1 Call) 2 05, 1798 Va. LEXIS 5 (1798); Cecil v. Hicks, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 1, 1877 Va. LEXIS 1 (1877). Increase for nonpayment is penalty.  Where the parties agree upon a certain rate of interest and further provide that the rate is to be increased in case of nonpayment of the debt when due, the incre ase will be regarded as a penalty, and relief in equity may be had, although the increased rate is not more than the rate provided by statute. Waller v. Long, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 71, 1818 Va. LEXIS 8 (1818). Agreement for decrease in rate.  Where the agreed rate was to be decreased in case of punctual payment, it was held that the higher rate could be recovered in case payment was not made when due. Waller v. Long, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 71, 1818 Va. LEXIS 8 (1818). The general rule of law is that interest shall not bear interest.  Bird's Comm. v. Bird, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 712, 1872 Va. LEXIS 79 (1872); Stuart v. Hurt, 88 Va. 343, 13 S.E. 438, 1891 Va. LEXIS 39 (1891). Contract for compound interest is not usurious.  An agreement made in advance that interest shall become principal at the end of the year is not usurious, but it is considered hard and oppressive and will not be allowed. Pindall's Ex'x v. Bank of Marietta, 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 481, 1839 Va. LEXIS 50 (1839); Fultz v. Davis, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 903, 1875 Va. LEXIS 63 (1875). But will not be implied.  Where the principal of the debt is ascertained and there has been a continuing default in the payment of interest, although the contract provides for its payment upon recurring and for specified periods, a court in settling the account, in the absence of a specified agreement to pay lawful interest upon the installments thus in default, will only allow simple interest upon the principal sum due. Blanchard v. Domi nion Nat'l Bank, 130 Va. 633, 108 S.E. 649, 1921 Va. LEXIS 181 (1921). Nor is taking of discount in advance usurious.  The taking of the discount in advance, upon discounting a note at a bank, is not usurious; and including the day of payment of the first note in the second, where by the bank receives under each note interest for the same day, is not usury. State Bank v. Cowan, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 238, 1837 Va. LEXIS 18 (1837) (citing as its authority Crump v. Trytitle, 1834 Va. LEXIS 35, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 251 (1834), and Stribling v. Bank of Valley, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 132 (1827)) (see also Parker v. Cousins, 43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 372 (1845)). Where the obligation was contractual, not a duty imposed by law, the legal rate was inap plicable because the construction contract contained no obligation to pay interest. J.W. Creech, Inc. v. Norfolk Air Conditioning Corp., 237 Va. 320, 377 S.E.2d 605, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1859, 1989 Va. LEXIS 50 (1989). New bond may be given for whole am ount due.  Where settlements are made between parties from time to time, and new items of debt are brought in and interest calculated on amounts justly due and a second bond given for the whole, such transaction does not constitute usury. Hamilton v. Stephenson, 106 Va. 77, 55 S.E. 577, 1906 Va. LEXIS 109 (1906). Federal district court not bound by interest rate of forum state where case involves fed eral contract to be performed on federal enclave. United States v. Dollar Rent a Car Sys., 712 F.2d 938, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 25452 (4th Cir. 1983). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Finance ch arge not an interest rate; just a late charge.  There was no violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act, § 59.1-200 A 5, 10, and 14, where homeowners claims that a heating system repairer misrepre sented his hours and the success of his work were unsubstantiated; a two-percent finance charge was not subject to a defense of usury because it was not an interest charge that was regulated by § 6.1-330.77:1 but, rather, it was found to just be a lat e charge.

The judgmen t rate of interest shall be an annual rate of six percent, except that a money judgment entered in an action arising from a contract shall carry interest at the rate lawfully charged on such contract, or at six percent annually, whichever is higher.

If the cont ract or other instrument does not fix an interest rate, the court shall apply the judgment rate of six percent to calculate prejudgment interest pursuant to § 8.01-382 and to calculate post-judgment interest. C. The rate of interest for a judgment shall be the judgment rate of interest in effect at the time of entry of the judgment on any amounts for which judgment is entered and shall not be affected by any subsequent changes to the rate of interest stated in this section . History History. 1987, cc. 622, 623, 630, § 6.1-330.54; 1991, c. 508; 2004, c. 646; 2005, c. 455; 2010, cc. 550, 794. Annotations Cross references. As to interest on support debts pursuant to an order enforced by the Department of Social Services, see § 63.2-1952. Editors note. Prior to enactment of former § 6.1-330.10 in 1975, it appears that there was no separate statute pertaining to the judgment rate of interest. The legal rate of interest was 6% from the time of adoption of the original Code in 1950 until § 6.1-330.53 was enacted on July 1, 1987, at which time the rate was increased to 8%. Former § 6.1-330.10, as enacted in 1975, provided for a judgment rate of interest of 8%. This rate was increased to 10% in 1981 and to 12% in 1983. In 1987, th e rate was reduced to 8%, and in 1991, the rate was increased to 9%. Acts 2004, c. 646, decreased the judgment rate of interest to 6%. Acts 2010, c. 550 amended former § 6.1-330.54, from which this section is derived. Pursuant to § 30-152 and Acts 2010, c. 794, cl. 4, the 2010 amendment by c. 550 has been given effect in this section as set out above, by inserting on any amounts for which judgment is entered in subsection C. CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under former § 6.1-330.54 or prior law. Post-award interest on condemnation awards is controlled by § 33.1-128 [now § 33.2-1026].  In a condemnation proceeding, owner was not entitled to post-award interest at the judgment rate, pursuant to former § 6.1-330.10, from the date of the order o verruling exceptions to the commissioners report until the completion of the case on appeal. Post-award interest on condemnation awards is controlled by § 33.1-128 [now § 33.2-1026], which describes the situations in which interest is to be awa rded and provides that in no other instance shall interest be allowed on any award. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Cardinal Realty Co., 232 Va. 434, 350 S.E.2d 660, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1440, 1986 Va. LEXIS 275 (1986). Interest allowed in excess of legal rate on debts underlying liens.  Materialmans right to a mechanics lien included interest on the unpaid cost of materials furnished at a rate fixed in its contract in excess of the legal rate. American Std. Homes Corp. v. Reinecke, 245 Va. 113, 425 S.E.2d 515, 9 Va. Law Rep. 776, 1993 Va. LEXIS 5 (1993). Legislative intent as to interest allowed on mechanics liens.  The order of priorities among those entitled to rights in land and improvements put upon land as provided in the mechanics lien statutes is a matter of public policy, one within the exclusive domain of the General Assembly. If the legislature had so intended, it could have excluded interest as an element of a mechanics lien or limited it to the legal rate. It did neither. Instead, it expressly approved inclusion of interest as an element of the claim in the perfection and enforcement of a mechanics lien. American Std. Homes Corp. v. Reinecke, 245 Va. 113, 425 S.E.2d 515, 9 Va. Law Rep. 776, 1993 Va. LEXIS 5 (1993). Wrongful appropriation by bank of customers funds on deposit, and its use of money during litigation, makes bank liable for interest on fund. The legal rate of interest applies only in the absence of a lawful contract rate. Where the specified rate of interest is contracted for upon an obligation, and the rate is lawful, that rat e will continue to apply after maturity of the obligation, and even after judgment, until the debt is fully paid. The reason for this is the courts lack of power to dispense with the obligations of lawful and valid private contracts. Fleming v. Bank of Va., 231 Va. 299, 343 S.E.2d 341, 1986 Va. LEXIS 193 (1986). Rescissional damages.  The court is not constrained by the provisions of this section where it makes an award of rescissional damages. American Gen. Ins. Co. v. Equitable Gen. Corp., 49 3 F. Supp. 721, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11200 (E.D. Va. 1980). Determination of interest rate.  Because the amount of interest owed by a husband was dependent on the ultimate determination of the husbands child support arrearage, if any, and because the matter was remanded to the trial court for the recalculation of his child support arrearage, the courts interest award had to be reversed and remanded for reconsideration. Insofar as the husbands underlying argument as to the amount of child supp ort owed remained pertinent on remand, the trial court did not err in applying the judgment rate of interest from the date each payment of support was due until paid in full or in determining the applicable judgment rate was 9 percent through a certain d ate and 6 percent thereafter. Wolfe v. Arthur, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 135 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2008). Because plaintiff insurance company had been without its $1 million contribution for over a year, and nothing suggested that it would have been inequitable to req uire defendants to pay prejudgment interest on the liquidated amount to make the insurance company whole, the court exercised its discretion to award the insurance company prejudgment interest at a rate of 6 percent accruing from the date when the insura nce companys contribution to the global settlement was transferred from its account. Admiral Ins. Co. v. Ace Am. Ins. Co., No. 5:08cv00055, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37587 (W.D. Va. May 1, 2009). In a case in which a district court determined that the loss payee on two insurance policies was entitled to prejudgment interest at the rate of six percent per a nnum, the appropriate date from which prejudgment interest would accrue was the date that the insurer decided to deny coverage. On that date, more than a year of investigation and time to review the policies terms, the insurer made its determination; from that date forward, it was appropriate for the insurer to bear the consequences of its conclusion. Wells Fargo Equip. Fin., Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 823 F. Supp. 2d 364, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115533 (E.D. Va. 2011). In an action under 29 U.S.C.S. § 185, where a labor arbitrators award directing reinstatement of a coal mine employee who was fired under a zero-tolera nce drug policy after testing positive for marijuana use was upheld, the employee was entitled to prejudgment interest at the rate of six percent as set forth in Virginias judgment interest statute, subsection A of § 6.2-302, to fully compensa te him for the employers rejection of the award. Dickenson-Russell Coal Co., LLC v. Int'l Union, United Mine Workers, 840 F. Supp. 2d 961, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114 (W.D. Va. 2012). Applicable rate equal to or lesser than the rate cap in effect on the date judgment is entered.  Language of § 6.1-330.54 [now § 6.2-302] demands that a court awarding prejudgment interest use an interest rate equal to or lesser than the rate cap in eff ect on the date judgment is entered. Lambert v. Callahan, 347 Bankr. 508, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57034 (W.D. Va. 2006). Erroneous rate applied.  Trial court erred in not applying the one percent interest rate applied by the jury to the compensatory damages awarded in the first trial where the joint venture sued the public authority for breach of contract. The one percent interest rate was implied in the parties contract pursuant to the Prompt Payment Act, § 2.2-4352, and, thus, the trial court erred in applying a nine percent rate for a certain tim e period pursuant to § 6.1-330.54 [now § 6.2-302]. Upper Occoquan Sewage Auth. v. Blake Constr. Co., 275 Va. 41, 655 S.E.2d 10, 2008 Va. LEXIS 17 (2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Proper rate.  Trial court found that interest continued to run after an award of prejudgment interest was made; § 8.01-382 required that a judgment was required to bear inte rest at the judgment rate of interest as provided for in § 6.1-330.54 [now § 6.2-302] from its date of entry or from the date that the jury verdict was rendered. Blake Constr. Poole v. Upper Occoquan Sewage Auth., 71 Va. Cir. 248, 2006 Va. Cir. LE XIS 135 (Fairfax County June 30, 2006), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 275 Va. 41, 655 S.E.2d 10, 2008 Va. LEXIS 17 (2008) (decided under prior law). Interest.  Because the amount of the value of goods was ascertainable and liquidated, the broker was entitled to prejudgment interest from the date on which the carrier brea ched the broker/carrier agreement.

As to historical rates on legal rates of interest and judgment rates of interest, see Editors notes under §§ 6.2-301 and 6.2-302. Editors note. From the adoption of the 1950 Code until March 1, 1968, the charging of a greater rate of interest on a contract than allowed by law was proscribed (the l egal rate of interest being 6% at that time). The contract rate of interest was changed to 8% effective March 1, 1968, and to 12% effective July 1, 1987. Acts 2010, c. 477, effective October 1, 2010, amended former § 6.1-330.55, from which this section is derived. Pursuant to § 30-152 and Acts 2010, c. 794, c l. 4, the 2010 amendment by c. 477 has been given effect in this section as set out above, by adding subdivision B 4, and redesignating former subdivisions B 4 through B 8 as subdivisions B 5 through B 9, respectively. Acts 2020, cc. 1215 and 1258, cl. 5 provides: That the provisions of the first and second enactments of this act shall become effective on January 1, 2021, ex cept that the database required by § 6.2-1810 of the Code of Virginia, as amended by this act, shall be modified to accommodate the provisions of this first enactment of this act by January 1, 2022. The 2020 amendments. The 2020 amendments by cc. 1215 and 1258 are identical, effective January 1, 2021, and in subdivision B 3, substituted short-term loans for payday len ders and added subsections E and F.

Purging Transaction of Usury. I.General Consideration. Editors note.  Some of the cases cited below were decided under former § 6.1-330.11, as it read prior to the 1968 amendment to former § 6.1-319, or prior law. Before that amendment, the section provided that contracts and assurances for more than the legal rate of interest should be deemed to be for an illegal consideration as to the excess beyond the principal amount. Some of the cases cited were decided under former § 6.1-330.55. This sections operation is limited to contracts providing for the payment of interest. J.W. Creech, Inc. v. Norfolk Air Conditioning Corp., 237 Va. 320, 377 S.E.2d 605, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1859, 1989 Va. LEXIS 50 (1989). The maximum rate of interest which a jury may impose under § 8.01-382 is the maximum a llowed under former § 6.1-330.11. Marsteller Corp. v. Ranger Constr. Co., 530 F.2d 608, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 12988 (4th Cir. 1976). Usury.  Usury is defined as being a premium or compensation paid or stipulated to be paid for the use of money borrowed or returned beyond the legal rate of interest esta blished by law. Wherever, therefore, by the terms of a contract money is lent, and the lender is paid or stipulated to be paid a valuable consideration in excess of the rate allowed by law, the contract is usurious. Carter v. Hook, 116 Va. 812, 83 S.E. 3 86, 1914 Va. LEXIS 92 (1914). Legislature may designate what transactions shall be subject t o or exempt from the laws of usury.  Bryan v. Augusta Perpetual Bldg. &amp; Loan Co., 104 Va. 611, 52 S.E. 357, 1905 Va. LEXIS 140 (1905). And it may take away the defense of usury and declare valid contracts which were usuriou s at the time they were entered into. Bosang v. Iron Belt Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 96 Va. 119, 30 S.E. 440, 1898 Va. LEXIS 68 (1898). Usury laws m ay be retroactive.  Statutes relative to the defense of usury are not necessarily unconstitutional because retroactive in their operation. Smoot v. Peoples Perpetual Loan &amp; Bldg. Ass 'n, 95 Va. 686, 29 S.E. 746, 1898 Va. LEXIS 36 (1898). Violation of Pub lic Policy.  Choice of tribal law to govern loans made by tribal lenders was unenforceable because it violated Virginias strong public policy against unregulated usurious lending. Hengle v. Treppa, 19 F.4th 324, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 33964 (4th Cir. 2021), cert. dismissed, 142 S. Ct. 2093, 212 L. Ed. 2d 795, 2022 U.S. LEXIS 2496 (2022), cert. dismissed, 142 S. Ct. 2093, 212 L. Ed. 2d 795, 2022 U.S. LEXIS 2495 (2022). II.Elements Of Usury. A.Intention and Knowledge. Intent is necessary.  There must be an intention to take more than the legal rate of interest, although there need not be the actual corrupt intent to do an illegal act. Brockenbrough' s Ex'rs v. Spindle's Adm'rs, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 21, 1866 Va. LEXIS 6 (1866); Town of Danville v. Sutherlin, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 555, 1871 Va. LEXIS 21 (1871). Mutuality of intent.  The intent which constitutes usury is the intentional taking or receiving, under any circumstances, of more than the legal interest, on the part of the lender or creditor, with or without the concurrence of the borrower. Whitworth &amp; Yancey v. Adams, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 333, 1827 Va. LEXIS 15 (1827). Knowledge of illeg ality.  If a mode of calculating interest which gives to the creditor more than legal interest is adopted and the creditor knows it will have that effect, he is guilty of usury, although he may not suspect that he is violating the law. Childers v. Deane, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 406, 1826 Va. LEXIS 53 (1826). Mist ake of fact is not sufficient.  Mistake of fact due to innocent miscalculation or the error of a scrivener, will never charge a party with usury. Grigsby v. Weaver, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 197, 1834 Va . LEXIS 32 (1834); Crump v. Trytitle, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 251, 1834 Va. LEXIS 35 (1834). B.Loan or Forbearance. Necessity.  Where there is neither a loan nor a forbearance to collect an existing debt there can be no usury. Town of Danville v. Sutherlin, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 555, 1871 Va. LEXIS 21 (1871); Graeme v. Adams, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 225, 1873 Va. LEXIS 33 (1873); Myers v. Roller, 85 Va. 621, 8 S.E. 483, 1889 Va. LEXIS 74 (1889). Forbearance.  Forbearance, in the sense of this section, is the giving of a future day for the return of a loan when the time originally agreed on is passed. If the rate of int erest agreed on for such forbearance is over the authorized rate, it is usurious. Graeme v. Adams, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 225 (1873). Forbearance is included in the term loan. Whitworth &amp; Yancey v. Adams, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 333, 1827 Va. LEXIS 15 (1827). Loan of property other than money may be usurious.  Where a person, in response to an application to lend money, furnishes at exorbitant prices stocks or other property instead of money, or as a condition upon whic h it is advanced, the transaction is a loan and usurious. Gibson v. Fristoe, 5 Va. (1 Call) 62, 1797 Va. LEXIS 11 (1797); Brockenbrough's Ex'rs v. Spindle's Adm'rs, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 21, 1866 Va. LEXIS 6 (1866). But actual sale of property cannot be usurious.  An actual sale of stocks, goods, bonds, notes, bills or any other property at more or less than its value or its face amount is not usurious. Kraker v. Shields, 6 1 Va. (20 Gratt.) 377, 1871 Va. LEXIS 11 (1871); Evans v. Rice, 96 Va. 50, 30 S.E. 463, 1898 Va. LEXIS 59 (1898). A man may sell property greatly above its market value, knowing that the purchaser intends to sell it again at its market value for the purpose of raising money, and the sale will not be usurious if it is a sale. Selby v. Morgan, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 577, 1832 Va. LEXIS 11 (1832); Brockenbrough's Ex'rs v. Spindle's Adm'rs, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 21, 1866 Va. LEXIS 6 (1866).

If the cour t determines that the contract is usurious, judgment shall be rendered only for the principal sum. History History. 1987, c. 622, § 6.1-330.56; 2010, c. 794. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2010, c. 794, cl. 9 provides: That the provisions of §§ 6.2-304, 6.2-305, and 6.2-306 shall apply to all loans made under (i) § 6.2-327, (ii) fo rmer § 6.1-330.71 that closed between July 1, 1987, and the effective date of this act, or (iii) former § 6.1-330.16 as amended in 1986, that closed between July 1, 1986, and July 1, 1987. For the purposes of this enactment, a loan shall be deemed closed upon the initial recordation of the deed of trust or mortgage securing the loan. CASE NOTES Editors note. A number of cases cited below were decided under former § 6.1-319 or prior law. Former § 6.1-319, prior to its amendment in 1968 provided that contracts and assurances for more than the legal rate of interest should be deemed to be for an illegal consideration. This section embraces the common-law rule. Richeson v. Wood, 158 Va. 269, 163 S.E. 339, 1 932 Va. LEXIS 253 (1932). Who may plead usury.  Any defendant may plead in general terms that the contract or assurance on which the action is brought was for a greater rate of interest than is allowed by law. Turner v. Turner, 80 Va. 379, 1885 Va. LEXIS 76 (1885). The policy of the legislature in adopting statutes of usury is the protection of borrowers against the oppressive exactions of lenders. It does not tend to the pr omotion of that policy that persons other than the victims of the usury should have the benefit of such statutes, and accordingly as a general rule usury is considered to be a ground of relief available only to the debtor or to one in legal privity with him. Stuart Court Realty Corp. v. Gillespie, 150 Va. 515, 143 S.E. 741, 1928 Va. LEXIS 332 (1928). A surety on a debt may plead usury, just as the principal may, where the sole consideration of the promise of the surety is the same as that of the principal debt or; that is, a loan or credit given to the principal debtor. Such is the position of an accommodation indorser. Ruckdeschall v. Seibel, 126 Va. 359, 101 S.E. 425, 1919 Va. LEXIS 101 (1919). Who may not plead usury.  The Virginia rule does not permit the holder of a junior encumbrance to attack the prior mortgage as being usurious. Stuart Court Realty Corp. v. Gillespie, 150 V a. 515, 143 S.E. 741, 1928 Va. LEXIS 332 (1928). The plea of usury is a defense personal to the debtor, and the purchaser of land subject to a previous lien, which he assumes to pay as a part of the purchase mon ey, cannot object that the lien is usurious, but is bound to discharge the lien, as part of the purchase price of the land. Spengler v. Snapp, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 478, 1834 Va. LEXIS 60 (1834); Saunders v. Baltimore Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 99 Va. 140, 37 S.E. 7 75, 1901 Va. LEXIS 20 (1901). No plea is necessary where usury appears on face of written contract.  The clause in this section that if no such plea is made, and the contract or assurance be in writing and shows that usurious interest has been therein contrac ted for, judgment shall be rendered for the principal sum only, obligates the court to adjudge a contract usurious if it be in writing and the usury appears upon its face. Roanoke Mtg. Co. v. Henritze, 151 Va. 220, 144 S.E. 430, 1928 Va. LEXIS 226 (1 928). This section specifically provides that where an instrument on its face reserves more than the legal rate of interest, it is usurious in its inception, and judgme nt shall be rendered for the principal sum only, although the defendant may have filed no plea of usury. Turner v. Turner, 80 Va. 379, 1885 Va. LEXIS 76 (1885). Time to plead.  If a plea of usury, where such plea is necessary, is not offered within a reasonable time, it will be rejected as coming too late. Keckley v. Union Bank, 79 Va. 4 58, 1884 Va. LEXIS 102 (1884). The defense of usury cannot be set up for the first time in argument in the appellate court. Michie v. Jeffries, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 334, 1871 Va. LEXIS 57 (1871). In court of equity.  The plea ought to be received in a court of equity, at any time before the decree is final, if there be strong reasons, from the statement in the bill, for believ ing that the matter of such plea may be true. Ellzey v. Lane's Ex'x, 18 Va. (4 Munf) 66, 1813 Va. LEXIS 21 (1813). A plea of usury of a foreign state must set out the law of usury of that state. Fant v. Miller, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 47, 1866 Va. LEXIS 7 (1866) (see also Bowman v. Miller &amp; Co., 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 331 (1874)). Arbitration.  Debtors allegation that creditors terms were usurious such that it was not entitled to any interest under Virginia law attacked loans creditor made to deb tor as null and void, and bankruptcy court would make that determination in its consideration of validity of creditors proof of claim pursuant to its constitutionally mandated duties; thus, it would conflict with Congresss vision of bankruptcy pr ocess to refer this allegation to arbitration. Taylor v. Allied Title Lending, LLC (In re Taylor), 594 Bankr. 643, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 3634 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2018), aff'd, 420 F. Supp. 3d 436, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183729 (E.D. Va. 2019). Necessary averments.  A plea of usury should, on its face, either present such facts, with certainty to every intent, as in themselves distinctly amount to an agreement to receive more than the value of $6.00 for the loan of $100.00 for a year, or it must state the facts with such necessary averments of an intent to evade the statute that a jury, upon the trial, might decide that the agreement was in substance a contract for usurious interest, and a shift to evade the operation of the law. Steptoe's Adm'rs v. Harvey's Ex'rs, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 501, 1836 Va. LEXIS 53 (1836); State Bank v. Cowan, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 238, 1837 Va. LEXIS 18 (1837); Smith v. Nicholas, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 330, 183 7 Va. LEXIS 24 (1837). The court will not presume a contract to be usurious. M'Guire v. Warder, 1 Va. (1 Wash.) 368, 1 Wash. 368, 1784 Va. LEXIS 1 (1784). Rather, the party who pleads usury must prove it. Harnsbarger's Adm'r v. Kinney, 47 Va. ( 6 Gratt.) 287, 1849 Va. LEXIS 46 (1849). Usury must be proved by clear and satisfactory evidence. A simple preponderance of the e vidence will not suffice to establish usury. Evans v. Rice, 96 Va. 50, 30 S.E. 463, 1898 Va. LEXIS 59 (1898). But need not be shown be yond a reasonable doubt.  The recent decisions do not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt as the rule was stated in Brockenbroughs Exrs v. Spindles Admrs, 58 Va. (17 Gr att.) 21 (1866), but only proof by a clear and satisfactory preponderance of evidence. Ruckdeschall v. Seibel, 126 Va. 359, 101 S.E. 425, 1919 Va. LEXIS 101 (1919). Admissible evidence.  All evidence relevant and material to show the real consideration for the contract is admissible, including evidence showing the facts and circumstances leading u p to, connected with and attending the making of the contract, the acts done in pursuance thereof, and, where relevant, the agreements collateral thereto. Richeson v. Wood, 158 Va. 269, 163 S.E. 339, 1932 Va. LEXIS 253 (1932). The borrower may always prove by extrinsic evidence that the contract, though legal on its face, was in fact made for an usurious consideration. This is true, tho ugh the written contract may be a sealed instrument which on its face is complete, states a legal consideration, and shows no appearance of usury, and though such extrinsic evidence may vary, add to, or contradict the written instrument. Richeson v. Wood , 158 Va. 269, 163 S.E. 339, 1932 Va. LEXIS 253 (1932). Answer as evidence.  Where a crossbill exhibited as a bill of discovery charged usury, an answer under oath responsive to the crossbill containing statements, which, if true, disclose d a transaction free of usury, is evidence against the charge of usury which may be overcome by the testimony of two witnesses, or one witness and corroborative circumstances, and a different state of facts established. Ruckdeschall v. Seibel, 126 Va. 35 9, 101 S.E. 425, 1919 Va. LEXIS 101 (1919). Usury as question of law or fact.  Whether a contract is usurious or not is generally a question of fact for the jury. But where there is no material conflict in the evidence, and only one conclusi on can reasonably be drawn from the facts proven, usury becomes a question of law for the court. Richeson v. Wood, 158 Va. 269, 163 S.E. 339, 1932 Va. LEXIS 253 (1932). Where the facts are found by a special verdict, agreed upon by the parties or admitted by the pleadings or a demurrer, it is the province of the court to say whet her they amount to usury or not. Brockenbrough's Ex'rs v. Spindle's Adm'rs, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 21, 1866 Va. LEXIS 6 (1866); Brummel &amp; Co. v. Enders, Sutton &amp; Co., 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 873, 1868 Va. LEXIS 40 (1868). Usurious contract is not void.  No part of a usurious contract is void, but the contract is only deemed to be for an illegal consideration as to the excess beyond the principal so loaned or forb orne. Fischer v. Lee, 98 Va. 159, 35 S.E. 441, 1900 Va. LEXIS 21 (1900) (see also Munford v. McVeighs Admr, 92 Va. 446, 23 S.E. 857 (1896)). And the lender may recover the pri ncipal.  If a loan is usurious, the lender can only recover the principal sum lent, when it becomes due, and failure to pay interest notes according to their tenor does no t constitute a default for which the lender may foreclose a deed of trust securing payment of the loan. Chakales v. Djiovanides, 161 Va. 48, 170 S.E. 848, 1933 Va. LEXIS 299 (1933). But a contract given as consideration for a usurious loan is void. Where such a contract is supported by several considerations, only one of which is tainted with usury, but is not so severable that any part...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_6.2-305"><akn:num>§ 6.2-305</akn:num><akn:heading>Recovery of twice total usurious interest paid; limitation of action; injunction to prevent sale of property pending action; effect of errors in compu tation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. If interest in excess of that permitted by an applicable statute is paid upon any loan, the person paying may bring an action within two years from the first to occur of: (i) the date of the last scheduled loan payment or (ii) the date of payment of the loan in ful l, to recover from the person taking or receiving such payments: 1. The t otal amount of the interest paid to such person in excess of that permitted by the applicable statute; 2. Twice the total amount of interest paid to such person during the two years immediately preceding the date of the filing of the action; and 3. Court costs and reasonable attorney fees. B. If the sale of property in which an interest has been conveyed to secure the payment of the debt is scheduled or anticipated, an injunction may be granted to prevent such sale pending the completion of an action brought pursuant to subsection A. C. Any credito r who proves that interest or other charges in excess of those permitted by law were imposed or collected as a result of a bona fide error in computation or similar mistake shall not be liable for the penalties prescribed in this section. In such event, the creditor shall only be liable to return to the borrower the amount of interest or other charges collected in excess of the amount permitted by applicable statute. History History. 1987, c. 622, § 6.1-330.57; 2010, c. 794. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2010, c. 794, cl. 9 provides: That the provisions of §§ 6.2-304, 6.2-305, and 6.2-306 shall apply to all loans made under (i) § 6.2-327, (ii) fo rmer § 6.1-330.71 that closed between July 1, 1987, and the effective date of this act, or (iii) former § 6.1-330.16 as amended in 1986, that closed between July 1, 1986, and July 1, 1987. For the purposes of this enactment, a loan shall be deemed closed upon the initial recordation of the deed of trust or mortgage securing the loan. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases cited below were decided under prior law. Construction with other law.  Because citations to Utah usury law provided the court with sufficient information regarding the substance of Utah law on that subject, pursuant to the choice of law provision of a loan agreement, the circuit court erred in refusing to apply such in construing that agreement. Thus a judgment entered in favor of a debtor based on a claim of usury under former § 6.1-330.57, and awarding damages, costs and attorn eys fees under that statute was reversed. Settlement Funding, LLC v. Neumann-Lillie, 274 Va. 76, 645 S.E.2d 436, 2007 Va. LEXIS 85 (2007). When loan discount fee paid.  A borrower had paid a loan discount fee at the time of settlement for purposes of this section even though the fee had been included in the total amount o f the loan and the repayment of it amortized over the term of the loan. In re Williams, 241 Bankr. 387, 1999 Bankr. LEXIS 1416 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1999), aff'd, 11 Fed. Appx. 344, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 13246 (4th Cir. 2001). Recovery may exceed usur ious interest amount.  Recovery of twice the amount of all interest paid, lawful as well as usurious, is permissible for amounts paid within the allowed two-year statutory period of rec overy. Skinner v. Cen-Pen Corp., 243 Va. 279, 414 S.E.2d 824, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2194, 1992 Va. LEXIS 12 (1992). When statute of limitations begi ns to run.  For purpose of determining when statute of limitations begins to run on claim under this section, each payment of an installment of interest is considered as a us urious transaction and actions are permitted seeking recovery of all usurious interest paid within the time period designated by this section preceding the filing of the action. Skinner v. Cen-Pen Corp., 243 Va. 279, 414 S.E.2d 824, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2194, 1992 Va. LEXIS 12 (1992). Time limitation on debtors recover y.  Where a debtor has consented to his creditors application of the usurious interest payments to the interest obligation, the debtors recovery was limited t o those payments made within the statutory period described in this section. Debtor could not recover initial mortgage fee or interest paid before the statutory period began. Skinner v. Cen-Pen Corp., 243 Va. 279, 414 S.E.2d 824, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2194, 199 2 Va.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under former § 6.1-319, or prior law. Former § 6.1-319, prior to its amendment in 1968 provided that contracts an d assurances for more than the legal rate of interest should be deemed to be for an illegal consideration. Some of the cases cited below were decided under former § 6.1-330.58. Usury statutes are penal.  The statutes against usury are regarded in Virginia as highly penal in their character. Crenshaw's Adm'r v. Clark, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 65, 1834 Va. LEXIS 17 (1834); Brockenbrough's Ex'rs v. Spindle's Adm'rs, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 21, 1866 Va. LEXIS 6 (1866); Town of Danville v. Pace, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 1, 1874 Va. LEXIS 37 (1874). But liberally construed.  Usury statutes are not to be construed strictly, but liberally with a view to advance the remedy, and suppress the mischief. Whitworth &amp; Yancey v. Adams, 26 Va. ( 5 Rand.) 333, 1827 Va. LEXIS 15 (1827). This section is applicable only to usury which has been in fact paid to the person with whom the usurious contract was made, or to whom the usurious assurance was given, and where the usury which has been so paid is sought to be recovered back or applied as a credit on that portion of the debt which is justly due, which is, in effect, the s ame thing. Ruckdeschall v. Seibel, 126 Va. 359, 101 S.E. 425, 1919 Va. LEXIS 101 (1919). Common-law rule as to appl ication of payments.  In interpretation of statutes on the subject of recovery back of usurious interest or the recovery of a penalty, the common-law rule of letting stand payments of principal and of legal interest actually made, and even payments by usury where the statute of limitation applicable to action of assumpsit has run, will not be held to be changed, except as to changes plainly made by the statute. Baker v. Lynchburg Nat' l Bank, 120 Va. 208, 91 S.E. 157, 1917 Va. LEXIS 101 (1917). Conflict of laws.  A contract for the loan of money made in one state to be performed in another, is, as a general rule, governed by the law of the place of performance; and if the rate of interest allowed by the latter is higher than that of the place of contract, the parties may stipulate for the higher rate without incurring the penalties of usury. Ware v. Bankers Loan &amp; Inv. Co., 95 Va. 680, 29 S.E. 744, 1898 Va. LEXIS 35 (1898 ); Peoples Bldg., Loan &amp; Sav. Ass'n v. Tinsley, 96 Va. 322, 31 S.E. 508, 1898 Va. LEXIS 95 (1898). But if a contract made in this State is by agreement of the parties to be performed elsewhere, and the court is satisfied that the place of performance was select ed as a mere shift to evade the usury laws of this State, the contract should be stripped of its disguise, and subjected to the penalties which the law denounces against the offense. Ware v. Bankers Loan &amp; Inv. Co., 95 Va. 680, 29 S.E. 744, 1898 Va. LEXI S 35 (1898). Where no application of payments made by parties.  Where payments on an usurious obligation made by the maker and indorsers were not applied by them to the usurious portion of the debt or to any of the interest on such portion, and such application was not made by the payee, the court, where the usury is in issue before it, and is established, will eliminate the usurious principal and all interest, and will apply the payments on the principal sum justly due, and will allow the lender to recover only the balance of the principal thus found to be owing to him, without any interest. Munford v. McVeigh's Adm'r, 92 Va. 446, 23 S.E. 857, 1896 Va. LEXIS 4 (1896); Ruckdeschall v. Seibel, 126 Va. 359, 101 S.E. 425, 1919 Va. LEXIS 101 (1919). The creditor may apply payments when the debtor does not. Turner v. Turner, 80 Va. 379, 1 885 Va. LEXIS 76 (1885). But he cannot apply them to what is not a legal or equitable demand against the debtor. Turner v. Turner, 80 Va. 379, 1885 Va. LEXIS 76 (1885). However, payments may be applied by borrower or with his consent.  Where payments have been made upon a usurious contract and the borrower himself applies the payment to the interest, or the lender so applies it with the assent o f the borrower, the appropriation so made will not be disturbed, unless within one year thereafter a suit be instituted by the borrower for its recovery, or a suit be brought by the lender within that period, in which case the borrower may set it off aga inst the demand for which he is sued. Munford v. McVeigh's Adm'r, 92 Va. 446, 23 S.E. 857, 1896 Va. LEXIS 4 (1896); Crabtree v. Old Dominion Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 95 Va. 670, 29 S.E. 741, 1898 Va. LEXIS 34 (1898); Bank of Radford v. Kirby, 100 Va. 498, 42 S.E. 303, 1902 Va. LEXIS 51 (1902). Recovery p recluded on expiration of statutory period.  Where the borrower and the lender have agreed to appropriate, and have actually applied, payments made by the borrower to the extinguishment of the interest as it accrued on the sum loaned, the borrower cannot, after the lapse of nearly six years, recover back the amount so paid, even though the interest be in excess of the rate allowed by law. Exchange &amp; Deposit Bank v. Fugate, 93 Va. 821, 23 S.E. 884, 1896 Va. LEXIS 136 (1896). Usury in the contract itself.  Under this section, where there is usury in the contract, as distinguished from the reservation of a greater rate of interest than is allowed by law, as where the contract is expressed to be for a greater sum than that actually loaned or forborne, in a suit either by the borrower or lender, at law or in equity, it is the duty of the court, usury being established, to eliminate the usurious principal, and then app ly the rule as to payments as hereinbefore declared  applying all unappropriated payments in satisfaction of the principal sum justly due, and leaving undisturbed such payments as the parties have themselves applied  and upon the principal so asc ertained interest should be allowed at the legal rate from the date of the judgment or decree. Munford v. McVeigh's Adm'r, 92 Va. 446, 23 S.E. 857, 1896 Va. LEXIS 4 (1896). Payment of illegal interest after maturity.  Payment of illegal interest after maturity of notes, in return for forbearance, is usury, and the usurious premium may be recovered back, but the usury not being in the inception, the lender is entitled to his principal and legal interest, less the sum paid him at the dates of payment. Moseley v. Brown, 76 Va. 419, 1882 Va. LEXIS 47 (1882). Retention by the lender of part of the loan, with the assent of the borrower given after the loan was made, is, in effect, a payment by the borrower of an excess beyond the lawful interest for the loan; and the borrower may both at common law and under this section recover the excess beyond legal interest so paid by him. But to do so in Vir ginia he must, by reason of the provision of this section, bring his action within one year from the time such excess was, in effect, paid by him. The original valid contract is not vitiated either as to payment of the principal or the legal interest sti pulated for. Chakales v. Djiovanides, 161 Va. 48, 170 S.E. 848, 1933 Va. LEXIS 299 (1933). Presumption of rate of usury.  Where defendant admits he has exacted usury but says he does not remember the rate, the court should consider the rate to have been that charged in the plaintiff s bill. Fulcher v. Baker, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 453, 1829 Va. LEXIS 39 (1829). Carrying charg es of landlord held illegal interest.  Evidence held to support finding that annual 10% carrying charges added by landlord to amounts owed by share tenant constituted illegal interest charges which ten ant was entitled to recover under this section. Smith v. Smith, 195 Va. 722, 80 S.E.2d 415, 1954 Va. LEXIS 151 (1954). Timely action to recover illegal carrying charges.  Where annual payments by share tenant to landlord did not exceed amount of lawful demands of landlord against tenant, no amount of such payments could be applied to accumulated illegal carrying charges until the date that payments exceeded lawful charges. And action brought under this section within less than one year from that time was timely brought. Smith v. Smith, 195 Va. 722, 80 S.E.2d 415, 1954 Va. LEXIS 15 1 (1954). Choice of Law.  Choice of tribal law to govern loans made by tribal lenders was unenforceable because it violated Virginias strong public policy against unregulated usurious lending. Hengle v.

Any seller of goods or services who extends credit under a closed-end installment credit plan or arrangement may impose finance charges at such rate or rates as the seller and the purchaser have agreed. Deferrals and extensions of the time for payment, if allowed b y a seller of goods or services who extends credit under a closed-end installment credit plan or his assignee, may be subject to a finance charge if agreed to in the original contract or at the time of the renewal or extension. No additional finance char ge shall be made for the extension of credit under such a plan or arrangement. If the total finance charge on the transaction is precomputed according to the actuarial method, the finance charge shall be calculated on the assumption that all scheduled pa yments will be made when due. The balance on which such finance charge may be imposed may include the deferred portion of the sales price, costs and charges incidental to the transaction, including (i) any insurance premium financed in connection therewi th and (ii) the amount actually paid or to be paid by the seller to discharge a security interest or lien on the property traded in. The payment by a lessor to discharge a security interest or lien on the property traded in may be included in the gross c apitalized cost of the goods leased and, for purposes of this chapter and Chapter 6 (§ 55.1-600 et seq.) of Title 55.1, shall not constitute a loan. B. The debtor shall have the right to prepay in full on precomputed transactions and receive a rebate of unearned finance charge determined in accordance with the Rule of 78, as illustrated in § 6.2-403, or other method elected by the seller under which the finance charge imposed does not exceed the amount that results from application of the Rule of 78 on extensions of credit with an initial maturity of 61 months or less. On extensions of credit with an initial maturity of more than 61 months, the debtor shall re ceive a rebate computed under a method at least as favorable to the debtor as the actuarial method. The seller may also condition such rebate upon receiving a minimum of $25 in finance charges. This amount, to the extent not earned, may be withheld from the rebate required hereunder. C. In connecti on with such a credit plan, the seller may also: 1. Impos e a late charge pursuant to § 6.2-400; and 2. Charge and collect a document fee as may be agreed upon by the seller and purchaser in connection with such credit plan. The document fee shall (i) be for the preparation, handling, an d processing of documents relating to the goods or services and to the closing of the transaction and (ii) not be considered a finance charge for the purposes of this chapter. D. Premiums fo r credit life insurance and credit accident and health insurance purchased by the debtor shall not be construed as an additional charge for the extension of credit if such insurance coverage is purchased voluntarily by the debtor. Premiums for property i nsurance on the goods purchased or leased, including vendors single interest insurance on such goods, shall not be construed as additional charges for the extension of credit if a clear and conspicuous statement in writing is furnished by the seller or lessor to the buyer or lessee setting forth the cost of the insurance if obtained from or through the seller or lessor and stating that the buyer or lessee may choose the person through which the insurance is to be obtained.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Pleadings.  Complaint sufficiently pleaded that a lender violated the Virginia Consumer Finance Act, § 6.2-1500 et seq., either as an unlicensed consumer finance lender or as an open-end credit plan lender, because the lender allegedly imposed annual interest rates on consumer loans in excess of 12 percent without meeting any of the statutory exceptions. Specifically, the lender charged more than 12 percent interest witho ut having a license, as required by statute, and without abiding by the statutory requirements of open-end credit lenders.

A lender who extends open-end credit pursuant to § 6.2-312 may charge borrowers an annual membership fee in connection with the provision of open-end credit, regar dless of whether the borrower repays the balance in full by the close of a minimum 25-day billing cycle.

Applicability where security is subordinate deed of trust on qualifying residential property.  This section is not limited in application only to business purpose loans secured by first deeds of trust, subordinate deeds of trust on commercial or nonqualifyi ng residential real estate, or to unsecured loans, but is also applicable to loans secured by subordinate deeds of trust on residential property improved by housing consisting of four or less family units. Piatkowski v. Ralph D. Kaiser Co., 219 Va. 1015, 254 S.E.2d 68, 1979 Va. LEXIS 204 (1979). Consideration of facts and cir cumstances.  In determining whether a transaction is usurious, the court has both the right and the duty to probe behind the written instruments and to examine all facts and c ircumstances which shed light on the true nature of the transaction. Radford v. Community Mtg. &amp; Inv. Corp., 226 Va. 596, 312 S.E.2d 282, 1984 Va. LEXIS 301 (1984). Proof of prima facie case.  Usury, when pleaded, must be shown by clear and cogent proof, but the introduction in evidence of a contract expressly providing for a greater rate of interest th an the law allows will establish a prima facie case. Thereupon, the burden shifts to the opposing party to go forward with evidence which would bring the transaction within an exception to the usury laws, or to show some other valid reason to avoid their application. Radford v. Community Mtg. &amp; Inv. Corp., 226 Va. 596, 312 S.E.2d 282, 1984 Va. LEXIS 301 (1984). Loan held to b e for personal rather than business use.  Where the federal business taxes referred to in the wifes handwritten note were in fact, and were known by the lender to be, family and personal oblig ations of the husband and wife, accordingly, neither the wifes handwritten statement nor the evidence of surrounding circumstances established that the loan was for any purpose other than family, household, or personal purposes. The lender thus faile d to overcome their prima facie showing of usury. Radford v. Community Mtg. &amp; Inv. Corp., 226 Va. 596, 312 S.E.2d 282, 1984 Va.

Estoppel to set up defense of usury.  A borrowers initiation of, or fraud contributing to, a usurious transaction estops the borrower from setting up the defense of usury. Heubusch v.

Where misrepresentations of attorneys were designed to and did induce a creditor to accept deeds of trust as security for a loan in violation of this section, the attorneys were estopped from profiting by that illegality in asserting the defense of usury to the collection of the loan. Heubusch v. Boone, 213 Va. 414, 192 S.E.2d 783, 1972 Va. LEXIS 376 (1972), limited, Jeun v. Kang, 31 Va. Cir. 18, 1993 Va. Cir. LE XIS 125 (Fairfax County Feb. 16, 1993). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Loan fees not improper.  Where fees represented the cost of a credit report, recording fees, attorneys fees, insurance fees, appraisal fees, and broker fees, none of which were prohib ited, there was no violation of § 6.1-330.72 [now this section]. Massenburg v. Wilshire Credit Corp., 57 Va. Cir. 100, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 520 (Richmond Sept. 21, 2001). Banks demurrer was sustained because fees and hidden charges could be subsumed within those charges permitted by the statute or collateral services that were contracted for and performed in good faith. Bekenstein v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 355 (Richmond Sept. 28, 2017). Complaint of a husband and a wife against a bank failed to allege that a tax service was not contracted for and performed in good faith because they only listed t he Tax Service Fee as another example of a possibly usurious charge. Bekenstein v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 355 (Richmond Sept. 28, 2017). Release fee could not be usurious since it was tabulated as part of a settlements Recording Fee, which was expressly permitted by statute. Bek enstein v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 355 (Richmond Sept. 28, 2017). Broker fee not usurious.  Where a broker fee of $1118.60 did not exceed 5 percent of the principal amount of the loan, the borrower had not satisfied the statutory requirements for proving a violation of Virginias usury statutes.

B. Any lender or seller may impose a late charge for failure to make timely payment of any installment due on a debt, whether installment or single maturity, provided that such late charge does not exceed five percent of the amount of such installment payment and that the charge is specified in the contract between the lender or seller and the debtor. C.

Applicability.  In action regarding application of telecommunications carriers interconnection agreements, late-fee award was not limited to 5% per year because telecommunica tions carriers interconnection agreements  which provided for late fees at 18% per year  had been approved by Virginias utilities commission, so their provisions were not subject to attack on state-law grounds.

Exclusive remedy for late charges exceeding amount allowed.  This section makes clear that the exclusive remedy where a contract provides for late charges in excess of five percent is to void the amount in excess of the all owable; the amount in excess may not be considered as interest to support a claim that the contract is usurious. Alston v. Crown Auto, Inc., 224 F.3d 332, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15081 (4th Cir. 2000). Failure of lender to obtain approval from bankruptcy court or trustee.  The lender or supplier generally acts at its peril where it seeks without specific authority either of the bankruptcy court or the trustee to assert debt service upon its obligation, whether it is interest, service charges or late charge penalties. In re Kenney's Franchise Corp., 21 Bankr. 461, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 4349 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1982). Late charges are allowed to holder of allowed secured claim in bankruptcy proceeding pur suant to 11 U.S.C. § 506(b) if a creditor can meet certain criteria. First the creditor must be oversecured. His security must be higher in value than the amount of the debt. The other criterion is that the late charges must be reasonable. Mack Fin. C orp. v. Ireson, 53 Bankr. 118, 1985 U.S. Dist.

The Rule of 78 is so named because the integers one through 12 added together total 78. B. The amount of the rebate of unearned interest to be credited upon the acceleration or anticipation of a loan on which such rebate is required to be calculated under the Rule of 78 shall be calculated as follows: 1. Deter mine the denominator of the fraction, to be used as provided in subdivision 3, by adding the integers corresponding to the number of months over which the loan is to be repaid according to its terms, which in the example of a four-year loan would be the sum obtained by adding all of the integers in the series one through 48. 2. Determine the numerator of the fraction, to be used as provided in subdivision 3, by adding in inverse sequence the integers corresponding to the number of months remaining on the loan after payment is anticipated, which in the example of a four-year loan anticipated after the third month, would be the sum obtained by adding all of the integers in the series 45 through one. 3. Multiply the original amount of interest that would have been paid over the life of the loan by a fraction that has as its denominator the number determined as in subdivision 1 and as its numerator the number determined as in subdivision 2. The product is the amount of unearned interest to be rebated under the Rule of 78. C.

The term does not include a refusal to extend additional credit under an existing credit arrangement where the applicant is delinq uent or otherwise in default, or where such additional credit would exceed a previously established credit limit. Applicant means any person who applies to a creditor directly for an extension, renewa l, or continuation of credit, or applies to a creditor indirectly by use of an existing credit plan for an amount exceeding the previously established credit limit. Credit means the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or t o incur debt and defer its payment or to purchase property or services and defer payment therefor. Creditor means any person who regularly extends, renews, or continues credit; any pers on who regularly arranges for the extension, renewal, or continuation of credit; or any assignee of an original creditor who participates in the decision to extend, renew, or continue credit.

[now see § 6.2-500 et seq.], as the bonds do not involve a right to defer payment on a debt, and instead, the tra nsaction involves insurance, rather than any debt or credit; thus, the owner of a contractor and his wife, who was required to sign an indemnity agreement in favor of a surety which issued surety bonds, could not invoke the protection of the equal credit opportunity statutes.

To make an inquiry of the applicants age or of whether the applicants income derives from any public assistance or social services program if such inquiry is for the purpose of determining the amount and probable continuance of income levels, credit history, or other pertinent element of creditworthiness as provided in regulations of the Commission; 3.

CASE NOTES Exception for special purpose credit programs.  The Virginia Housing Development Authoritys credit assistance program clearly falls within this statutes exception for credit assistance programs authoriz ed by state law for the benefit of economically disadvantaged homebuyers and, therefore, such program may consider an otherwise prohibited basis, such as marital status, to determine whether an applicant possesses a characteristic needed for eligibility.

Debtor-creditor relationship between depositor and bank prerequisite to existence of account.  Relationship between a financial institution and its depositor is that of debtor and creditor. The funds become the property of the bank immediately on deposit, a nd the bank becomes the debtor of the depositor. This relationship is prerequisite to the existence of any contract of deposit or checking account . . . [or] other like arrangement included within the definition of account in this section.

Treasury bill not an account.  Where funds on deposit in decedent account were removed by bank, acting as his agent and at his direction, and were used to purchase an obligation of the United S tates, which was due not to the depositor, but to the bank, the treasury bill was not an account within the meaning of this section, insofar as joint depositors were concerned, and § 6.1-125.5 was therefore inapplicable.

The annotations below were decided under former § 6.1-125.3. General Assembly intended to place husband and wife in more favorable position.  It was the intent of the General Assembly to place a husband and wife in a position more favorable in relation to creditors than that of other joint depositors by providing a presumption protecting from creditors one-half of their joint funds, regardless of the amount of contributions made by each to the account. Lewis v. House, 232 Va. 28, 348 S.E.2d 217, 3 Va. Law Rep. 470, 1986 Va. LEXIS 222 (1986). Equally as used in subsection A means in equal proportions.  The placement of this provision in a statute governing the proportionate ownership interests of joint depositors supports this view. Indeed, the General Assembly obviously intended such a construction, as it elsewhere referred to the proportions provided in § 6.1-125.3 A [now § 6.2-606 A] for ownership of joint accounts between husband and wife. Lewis v. House, 232 Va. 28, 348 S.E.2d 217, 3 Va. Law Rep. 470, 1986 Va. LEXIS 222 (1986). Husband and wife presumed to own account equally.  Initially, husbands and wives were presumed to own the funds on deposit in joint accounts in proportion to their respective contributions. Following amendment, ho wever, they are presumed to own the account equally. Lewis v. House, 232 Va. 28, 348 S.E.2d 217, 3 Va. Law Rep. 470, 1986 Va. LEXIS 222 (1986). Presumption inapplicable to funds previously held in individual account.  This statute, and particularly the presumption it provides, is not applicable where the funds were originally held in an individual account in the name of one spo use and there is no evidence that that spouse was ever aware that funds, following their withdrawal, had been deposited by the other spouse in a joint account. Patterson v. Patterson, 257 Va. 558, 515 S.E.2d 113, 1999 Va. LEXIS 60 (1999). Inapplicable to equitable distribution analysis.  Trial court erred in using this section, a banking statute relevant to controversies between the account holders and their creditors, to determine the status of t he funds in the account for equitable distribution purposes. Subdivision A 3 d of § 20-107.3, which allows for retracing of separate contributions to marital property, is the applicable Code section. Tschippert v. Tschippert, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 514 ( Va. Ct. App. June 13, 1995). State and local taxing authorities are not bound by this section which requires creditor s seeking funds from a joint bank account to obtain a summons notifying nondelinquent owners of the account of an order of garnishment, attachment or other levy addressed to that account. First Va. Bank v. O'Leary, 251 Va. 308, 467 S.E.2d 775, 1996 Va. L EXIS 31 (1996). Burden is on creditor to rebut presumption that each spouse owns one-half.  The statutory language establishes a rebuttable presumption that each spouse owns one-half the joint deposit. It is the burden of the creditor to rebut the presum ption by producing clear and convincing evidence that his debtor owns more than one-half of the deposit. Lewis v. House, 232 Va. 28, 348 S.E.2d 217, 3 Va. Law Rep. 470, 1986 Va. LEXIS 222 (1986). Right to funds.  Under § 6.1-125.3 [now § 6.2-606], a joint account belongs, during the lifetimes of all parties, to the parties in proportion to the net contributions by ea ch to the sums on deposit; thus, where the funds deposited into an account were those of the father, and defendant, as one of three required signatories to the account, had no legal right to any of the funds absent defendants brothers valid endor sement, and where defendant forged the brothers endorsement, the court appropriately utilized the full value of the forged checks in calculating the fraud loss under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual. Elliott v. United States, 332 F.3d 753, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 12037 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 991, 124 S. Ct. 487, 157 L. Ed. 2d 388, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 8149 (2003). $163,600 was the mothers property that defendant had no right to transfer to herself solely by virtue of being a joint account holder because most of the mone y in the account came from insurance and Social Security payments made to the mother and defendant had contributed at most around $100 of the over $200,000 that was once in the account. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 19 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 25, 2022). Treasury bill purchased by joint depositor from joint account funds d oes not pass to surviving joint depositor.  An interest in a United States treasury bill, purchased with funds drawn from a joint savings account, becomes a part of the estate of the joint depositor who con tributed the funds to the account but who dies before the treasury bill matures, and does not pass by survivorship to the surviving joint depositor. Bennet v. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank, 233 Va. 355, 355 S.E.2d 888, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2467, 1987 Va. LEXIS 200 (1987). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Garnishment.  Threshold determination must be made whether, under the particular circumstances, a joint bank account is garnishable by a creditor of one of the joint depositors ; only if it is subject to garnishment do the provisions of § 6.1-125.3 [now § 6.2-606] become relevant. Sulzman v. Barnick, 62 Va. Cir. 139, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 93 (Spotsylvania County June 9, 2003).

Sums remain ing on deposit at the death of a party to a joint account belong to the surviving party as against the estate of the decedent unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intention at the time the account is created. If there are two or m ore surviving parties, their respective ownerships during their lifetime shall be in proportion to their previous ownership interests under § 6.2-606 augmented by an equal share for each survivor of any interest the decedent may have owned in the acco unt immediately before his death; and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties. B. If the acco unt is a P.O.D. account: 1. On th e death of one of two or more original payees, the rights to any sums remaining on deposit are governed by subsection A; 2. On the death of the sole original payee or of the survivor of two or more original payees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the P.O.D. payee or payees if surviving, or to the su rvivor of them if one or more die before the original payee. If two or more P.O.D. payees survive, there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a P.O.D. payee thereafter unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship between them. C. If the acco unt is a trust account: 1. On th e death of one of two or more trustees, the rights to any sums remaining on deposit are governed by subsection A; 2. On the death of the sole trustee or the survivor of two or more trustees, any sums remaining on deposit belong to the persons named as beneficiaries, if surviving, or to the survivor o f them if one or more die before the trustee, unless there is clear evidence of a contrary intent. If two or more beneficiaries survive the death of the sole trustee or the last survivor of two or more trustees, there is no right of survivorship in the e vent of death of any beneficiary thereafter unless the terms of the account or deposit agreement expressly provide for survivorship between them. D. In other ca ses, the death of any party to a multiple-party account has no effect on beneficial ownership of the account other than to transfer the rights of the decedent as part of his estate. If the terms of the account clearly indicate that there is no right of s urvivorship, the estate of a decedent party shall succeed to the rights of decedent in such account. E. A right of survivorship arising from the express terms of the account or under this section, a beneficiary designation in a trust account, or a P.O.D. payee designation, cannot be changed by will.

Some of the annotations below were decided under former § 6.1-125.5. Funds previously held in i ndividual account.  Section 6.1-125.3 [now § 6.2-606], and particularly the presumption it provides, is not applicable where the funds were originally held in an individual accoun t and there is no evidence that the individual accountholder was ever aware that, following the withdrawal of the funds by the accountholder, they were deposited in a joint account. Patterson v. Patterson, 257 Va. 558, 515 S.E.2d 113, 1999 Va. LEXIS 60 ( 1999). Treasury bill not an account.  Where funds on deposit in decedent account were removed by bank, acting as his agent and at his direction, and were used to purchase an obligation of the United S tates, which was due not to the depositor, but to the bank, the treasury bill was not an account within the meaning of § 6.1-125.1 [now § 6.2-604], insofar as joint depositors were concerned, and this section was therefore inapplicable. Ben net v. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank, 233 Va. 355, 355 S.E.2d 888, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2467, 1987 Va. LEXIS 200 (1987). Deposit made in more than one name.  The General Assembly intended to change the common-law presumption that where a person makes a deposit in his name and the name of some other person, the account was opened for convenience only without regard to the type of account cards used by the bank, since if the account cards were crucial, § 6.1-125.16 [now § 6.2-620] would not have applied to accounts opened before the statutes effective date bec ause those accounts could not have used the statutorily required account cards. Higgins v. Bowdoin, 238 Va. 134, 380 S.E.2d 904, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2843, 1989 Va. LEXIS 115 (1989). Where depositor added name of girlfriend to his account card he did not thereby convert his individual account to a joint account by merely adding another authorized signature; the original signature card remained the only contract between the depositor and his bank. Sturgill v. Virginia Citizens Bank, 223 Va. 394, 291 S.E.2d 207, 1982 Va. LEXIS 218 (1982). Funds formerly held in joint accounts.  The presumption of survivorship provided in this section did not apply to funds formerly held in joint bank accounts, but no longer so held at the time of the dea th of one of the parties to those accounts. Craver-Farrell v. Anderson, 251 Va. 369, 467 S.E.2d 770, 1996 Va. LEXIS 32 (1996). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Joint annuity account.  Transferred total of money into a joint annuity account could be marital property rather than separate and individual contributions because funds from a wifes retirement account and a husbands retirement account were deposited into the wifes savings account, a joint account, before being transferred into the annuity account; it was not established by clear and convincing evidence that a wife and a hus band intended a joint annuity account to be divided unequally. Grubb v. Yacoub, 88 Va. Cir. 98, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Mar. 18, 2014). Funds formerly held in joint accounts.  Money transferred out of a joint account to the husbands private accounts constituted marital property belonging to the husband, not separate property, becaus e there was no evidence rebutting the presumption that the original amount remained segregated. Grubb v. Yacoub, 88 Va. Cir. 98, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Mar. 18, 2014). Insufficient evidence of joint acc ount.  Because the only evidence that a bank account was a P.O.D. (payable on death) account was a daughters testimony, which had to be deemed incompetent in light o f the Dead Mans Statute, and the banks statements did not list the account as a P.O.D. account or make mention of the daughter as a beneficiary; it was not a joint account, so any presumption of survivorship under § 6.1-125.5 [now this section ] was inapplicable. In re Estate of Nash, 65 Va. Cir. 341, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 213 (Fairfax County Aug. 10, 2004) (decided under prior law). Social securit y benefits not part of probate estate.  Social security benefits that were directly deposited into a wifes savings account were not subject to probate because it was money that had been deposited in to a joint account; because it was not established that there was a different intention at the time the joint account was created, all money, including social security benefits, that remained in the wifes savings account, a joint account, automatical ly belonged to the husband after her death and were not part of her probate estate.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Disavowal of banks liability.  Commissioner erred in placing a great deal of weight on the action of bank employees in allowing joint account holder to withdraw all remaining funds from a P.O.D . (payment on death) account when the other joint account holder died. Section 6.1-125.13 [now § 6.2-616] explicitly disavows a bank from any liability in regards to the withdrawal of funds from a P.O.D. joint account, so if, as the Commissioner sugge sted, the bank employees were aware of all relevant Virginia banking law, then one must assume that the employees were aware of the liability disavowal in § 6.1-125.13.In re Estate of Nash, 65 Va. Cir. 341, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 213 (Fairfax County Aug. 10, 2004) (decided under former § 6.1-125.13). Question of fact remained as to whether the money recipient was properly named as a P.O.

Law Review. For survey article, Wills, Trusts, and Estates, see 44 U. Rich. L. Rev. 631 (2009). CASE NOTES Confidential relationship existed with respect to transactions involving joint bank account.  In a suit brought by an estate against the decedents son for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, and detinue, the trial court erred in ho lding that a confidential relationship did not exist with respect to self-dealing transactions by the son involving the joint bank account since the son was an agent of the decedent and, because he contributed none of the funds to the joint account, a co nfidential relationship existed establishing a fiduciary duty that created a presumption that the self-dealing transactions were unduly obtained. Flowing from that error, the trial court then erred in application of the evidentiary burdens regarding proo f of undue influence and corroboration necessary under the dead mans statute, § 8.01-397.

Undue influence.  Decedents great grandchildren sufficiently alleged claims of breach of a duty as an agent on a joint bank account because the decedents caretaker, her husband, and the decedents sister were co-owners on accounts with the decedent for which the decedent provided all the funds, and as such, a confidential relationship existed between each of the three and decedent, and the burden fell upon the t hree to rebut the presumption that the challenged transactions were the result of undue influence. Ayers v. Shaffer, 286 Va. 212, 748 S.E.2d 83, 2013 Va. LEXIS 105 (2013). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Undue influence and fraud.  Certificates of deposit that were titled jointly between a decedent and her neighbor, and which were funded solely with the decedents money, did not withstand challenge because the neighbors evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption of fraud and undue influence based on the fiduciary duty created by the confidential relationship. Miller v. Clayton, 86 Va. Cir. 469, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 130 (Hen rico County May 30, 2013). Undue influence found.  Defendant exerted undue influence over the decedent, converted property of the decedent, and was liable to the decedents estate for the amount required to res tore the value of the decedents property because defendant, who did not contribute to the joint accounts, was an agent as to the accounts; as an agent, defendant was a fiduciary of those accounts; he received considerable benefit from his self-dealin g transactions; and he did not rebut the presumption of undue influence in those transactions; further, defendants assertions that all funds he transferred from the decedents accounts to his own account were used only for her benefit and that he paid himself nothing were not credible as the assertions were contradicted by the evidence.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. What community includes.  Community, as used in this section, embraces not just the immediate physical area, but the area whose population would be normally served by a bank if loc ated at a particular site. Citizens Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 372, 200 S.E.2d 535, 1973 Va. LEXIS 316 (1973). While a bank will customarily serve, to the greatest degree, the population in the immediate area which surrounds that bank, the term community is not so restricted or delineated. The word community embraces not just the immediate physical area but the area whose population would be normally served by a bank if located at a particular site. Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, 219 Va. 566, 249 S.E. 2d 163, 1978 Va. LEXIS 214 (1978). A determination of the community or service area by the State Corporation Commission depends upon the facts in each case  population density, topography, the proximity of other towns, the transportation system, trade patterns of the area, community of interest and numerous other factors. Citizens Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 372, 200 S.E.2d 535, 1973 Va. LEXIS 316 (1973); Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, 219 Va. 566, 249 S.E.2d 163, 1978 Va. LEXIS 214 (1978). Public interest and former public need standards compared.  The test which is to be applied in determining whether the public interest will be served by the banking facilities is not substantially different from th e test required under the former provisions of this section prior to the 1976 amendment, which specified that the Commission was required to ascertain that there was a public need for banking facilities or additional banking facilities. When the Commission determines that the public interest will be served by an additional banking facility, it is saying that there is a need for such a facility, and that, all things considered, the operation of a new bank, the increased competition it will genera te, and the additional service and convenience it will provide the public outweigh any adverse effect the new bank might have on existing institutions and on the area involved. Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, 219 Va. 566, 249 S.E.2d 163, 1978 Va. LEX IS 214 (1978). Public need need n ot be absolute or indispensable.  The public need for an additional banking facility is not, and need not be, an absolute or indispensable public need. Second Nat'l Bank v. New Bank, 215 Va. 132, 210 S.E.2d 136, 1974 Va. LEXIS 247 (1974). Factors to be considered.  Stimulation of the economy of the town, county and area which it intends to serve and stimulation of competition among the existing banks serving that market were proper factors to be considered by the Commission. Second Nat'l Bank v. New Bank, 215 Va. 132, 210 S.E.2d 136, 1974 Va. LEXIS 247 (1974). Presumption of correctness.  Where the State Corporation Commission makes a determination to issue a certificate on the basis of conflicting evidence, this action carries a presumption of cor rectness and the Supreme Court cannot find the determination to be contrary to the evidence or without evidentiary support. Citizens Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 372, 200 S.E.2d 535, 1973 Va. LEXIS 316 (1973). A presumption of correctness attaches to the Commissions action. Grundy Nat'l Bank v. Miner's &amp; Merchant's Bank &amp; Trust Co., 214 Va. 732, 204 S.E.2d 277, 1974 Va. LEXIS 212 (1974). A presumption of correctness attaches to the action of State Corporation Commission, in proceedings for certificate of authority to begin business as state-charte red bank. Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, 219 Va. 566, 249 S.E.2d 163, 1978 Va. LEXIS 214 (1978). Supreme Court not fact-finder.  It is the State Corporation Commission, and not the Supreme Court, that is charged with the responsibility of finding the facts in proceedings for certificate of authority to begin business as state-chartered bank. Covington Nat'l Bank v. State Bank, 219 Va. 566, 249 S.E.2d 163, 1978 Va.

Virtual currency custody services by banks. Text A. As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning: Bank has the same meaning as provided in § 6.2-800. Custody services means the role of a bank in the safekeeping and custody of various cu stomer assets. Self-assessment has the same meaning as provided in § 6.2-947. Virtual currency means an electronic representation of value intended to be used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value. Virtual currency does not exist in a physical form; it is intangible and exists only on the blockchain or distributed ledger associated with a particular virtual currency. The owner of virtu al currency holds cryptographic keys associated with the specific unit of virtual currency in a digital wallet, which allows the rightful owner of the virtual currency to access and utilize it. B. A bank may provide its customers with virtual currency custody services so long as the bank has adequate protocols in place to effectively manage risks and comply with applicable laws. Prior to a bank offering virtual currency custody services, the bank shall caref ully examine the risks involved in offering such services through a methodical self-assessment process. If the bank decides to move forward with offering such services, the bank shall: 1. Imple ment effective risk management systems and controls to measure, monitor, and control relevant risks associated with custody of digital assets such as virtual currency; 2. Confirm that it has adequate insurance coverage for such services; and 3. Maintain a service provider oversight program, to the extent that the bank engages with a service provider to provide virtual currency custody services, to address risks to service pro vider relationships as a result of engaging in virtual currency custody services. C. A bank may provide virtual currency custody services in either a nonfiduciary or fiduciary capacity. In providing such services in a nonfiduciary capacity, the bank shall act as a bailee, taking possession of the customers asset for safekeeping while legal title re mains with the customer, meaning that the customer retains direct control over the keys associated with their virtual currency. In providing such services in a fiduciary capacity, a bank is required to possess trust powers as described in § 6.2-819 and have a trust department pursuant to § 6.2-821. Acting in a fiduciary capacity, the bank shall require customers to transfer their virtual currencies to the control of the bank by creating new private keys to be held by the bank. In its fiduciary capacity, a bank shall have authority to mana ge virtual currency assets as it would any other type of asset held in such capacity. History History. 2022, c. 623. Article 3.

Section 13.1-730 shall not apply to a merger under this section. B. A national bank shall be treated as if it were a foreign corporation and as if the United States were the state where it is organized.

Annotations CASE NOTES Merger of state bank into national b ank.  The mergers of state banking and trust companies with national banks are not consolidations in any true sense. The state bank is absorbed and the national bank co ntinues to function with powers limited and defined by Congress. When the merger is effected the state bank ceases to function. The new national bank is not the old state bank. It is merely a national bank with added powers and there is no continuity of corporate existence. The status of the old bank is exactly what it would be if it had been converted directly into a national bank, and so under § 6.1-35 [now see § 6.2-825] it ceases to function as a bank. Hofheimer v.

A national banking association, organized under the laws of the United States and doing business in the Commonwealth, may be converted into and become a state bank by the following procedure: 1. The d irectors of the national banking association shall cause to be incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth a corporation authorized by its certificate of incorporation to conduct the business of banking as the successor of the national banking associ ation. With regard to such incorporation: a. The certificate of incorporation of the corporation shall conform as nearly as may be legally permissible to that of the national banking association; b. The principal office of the corporation shall be in the county or city wherein the national banking association has its principal office; and c. The amount of the capital stock of the corporation, its division into shares, the par value of shares, their classification and preferences, if any, shall conform to those of the national banking association, and the minimum capital of the state bank shall comply with that required for a bank under § 6.2-816. 2. The national banking association shall effect its conversion to a state bank in accordance with the procedure prescribed by Subchapter XV of Chapter 2 of Title 12 of the United States Code (12 U.S.C. § 214 et seq.), as it now exists or as it may hereafter be amended. 3. Upon completion of the procedures required by subdivision 2, the president of the national banking association and the official having custody of its records shall execute, under the s eal of the association, a certificate showing in detail the procedures followed, the number of shares of each class of stock of the national banking association issued and outstanding, and the vote of each class of stockholders in favor of the plan of co nversion. The national banking association shall then file the certificate with the Commission. B. The Commiss ion shall examine the certificate filed pursuant to subdivision A 3. If from such examination it appears that the procedure required by subdivision A 2 has been followed and that the conversion has been approved by the stockholders of the national bankin g association in the manner and by the percentage vote required by federal law, the Commission may issue to the newly incorporated state bank a certificate of authority to do business as a bank, in accordance with the provisions of § 6.2-816. Upon the issue of such certificate, the conversion of the national banking association into a state bank shall become effective and be automatically completed. History History.

The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Public interest standard.  The crucial standard in the statutory formula for determining whether a branch bank should be authorized is public interest, and the public interest is considered served if advantages outweigh possible adverse effects such as diminished or unfair competition. Front Royal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. First Va. Bank-Shenandoah Valley, 222 Va. 194, 278 S.E.2d 853, 1981 Va. LEXIS 290 (1981). Soundness of savings and loan associations must be considered.  The public interest formula for determining whether a branch bank should be authorized requires the State Corporation Commission to consider whether authorization may jeopardize the financial soundness of existing savings and loan associations as well as that of existing banks, because the public has a substantial interest in protecting all certificated financial institutions against ruinous competition. Front Ro yal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. First Va. Bank-Shenandoah Valley, 222 Va. 194, 278 S.E.2d 853, 1981 Va. LEXIS 290 (1981). Finding concerning jeopardy to existing institutions not required.  The validity of an order granting the application for a banking office is not dependent on a specific finding concerning jeopardy to existing institutions. Servic es Nat'l Bank v. Burke &amp; Herbert Bank &amp; Trust Co., 219 Va. 1031, 254 S.E.2d 77, 1979 Va. LEXIS 208 (1979). Standards for smal l loan office less restrictive.  Because the involvement of the public is not as great, the standard which applies in considering an application for a small loan office is less restrictive than t he standard which applies when considering an application for the establishment of a bank or a savings and loan office. Peoples Fin. Serv. of Waynesboro, Inc. v. Beneficial Fin. Corp., 220 Va. 808, 263 S.E.2d 59, 1980 Va. LEXIS 171 (1980). Establishment of branch bank not precluded by existence of adequate banking facilities.  While the adequacy of existing bank facilities may be considered in determining whether public convenience and necessity [now public interest] will be served, thi s does not preclude the Commission from authorizing a proposed branch when there has been a showing of a public need and such authorization will not jeopardize the financial soundness of already existing banks and other financial institutions in a downto wn area. Security Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Schoolfield Bank &amp; Trust Co., 208 Va. 458, 158 S.E.2d 743, 1968 Va. LEXIS 133 (1968). What constitutes national bank branch is question controlled by federal law.  While branch banking by national banks is subject to the restrictions of state law, what constitutes a branch is a threshold question controlled by federa l law. Virginia ex rel. SCC v. F &amp; M Nat'l Bank, 380 F. Supp. 568, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7236 (W.D. Va. 1974), aff'd, 515 F.2d 154, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 14820 (4th Cir. 1975). Order of Commission authorizing establishment of branch bank must be regarded as prima facie just, reasonable and correct. Security Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

As used in this section, loan secured by real estate means an obligation executed or assumed by the borrower that is secured by mortgage, deed of trust, or similar instrument, encumbering real estate that is owned by the borrower and upon which the bank rel ies as the principal security for the loan. B. No bank sha ll make any loan secured by real estate when such loan, together with all prior liens or encumbrances on such real estate, exceeds 90 percent of the appraised value of the real estate securing such loan. C. The apprais als necessitated by this section shall be required if the loan shall equal or exceed an amount established from time to time by the Commissioner. In establishing such amount, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the requirements imposed on bank s under applicable federal regulations. Such appraisals shall be in writing, signed by the appraisers, and shall be retained in the files of the bank, subject to examination of bank examiners. The appraisers so appointed shall be experienced persons comp etent to appraise real estate in the locality where the real estate is located. D. Any bank ma y make loans secured by real estate that do not comply with the limitations and restrictions in this section if the total unpaid amount of such loans, exclusive of the loans that subsequently comply with such limitations and restrictions, does not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of loans secured by real estate. E. The provisi ons of this section relating to ratio of loan to appraised value and appraisal shall not apply if: 1. The r eal estate security is taken solely as an abundance of caution on terms which are not more favorable than they would be in absence of such a lien on real estate; 2. A real estate security conveyance is taken by or ancillary to the assignment of lease obligations upon which the bank is relying primarily and prudently; 3. A subsequent transaction results from an existing extension of credit providing (i) that the borrower has performed satisfactorily, (ii) there is no advance of new money, except as for merly agreed, (iii) the credit standing of the borrower is not deteriorating, and (iv) there is no obvious and noticeable deterioration of marketing conditions or the physical assets which provide collateral security to the bank; or 4. A lien upon real estate is taken to secure a prior advance which was not secured by such real estate. F. In cases wh ere an appraisal by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser is not required, under this section or other sections of this chapter in a real estate-related financial transaction, the bank as a matter of prudence may take and preserve a reasonable ap praisal, valuation, or analysis of real estate or real property in connection with such transaction. G. The Commiss ion may by order or regulation eliminate loans or specific categories of loans from the requirements of this section. H. The provisi ons of this section shall not be construed to prohibit any bank from accepting, as security for a loan that it had made in good faith without security or upon security since found to be inadequate, an obligation or obligations secured by mortgage, deed o f trust, or other such instrument upon real estate.

Purpose and intent.  The meaning and intent of this section are clear. The section carries into effect a very definite public policy. It was highly desirable, of vital public interest and for the protection of the public that it be required of the officers of a bank, as a condition precedent to the negotiation of loans and the pledging of assets, that the board of directors first authorize the transaction by a resolution spread upon the minute books. The evil sought to be remedied was the borrowing and pledging of assets by the officers of a bank without the knowledge and assent of the directors. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, 164 Va. 112, 178 S.E. 791, 1935 Va. LEXIS 183 (1935). This section is reasonable. It protects banks against the unauthorized acts of its offic ers. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, 164 Va. 112, 178 S.E. 791, 1935 Va. LEXIS 183 (1935). However, its terms are general. It neither carries a penalty for its violation nor any p rovision for its enforcement. It does not provide that the name of the lending bank be designated in the resolution of the board of directors; nor is it required that any definite amount to be borrowed be specified; nor is the amount of collateral to be pledged as security for the loan required to be specified. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, 164 Va. 112, 178 S.E. 791, 1935 Va. LEXIS 183 (1935). It is not a grant of power to the banks to borrow. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, 164 Va. 112, 178 S.E. 791, 1935 Va. LEXIS 183 (1935). Rather, it is a limitation upon that power. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, 164 Va. 112, 17 8 S.E. 791, 1935 Va. LEXIS 183 (1935). Resolution in general terms is sufficient.  A resolution of the board of directors, in general terms, authorizing the officers of the bank to borrow money and pledge bank assets as security therefor, previo usly adopted and spread on the minute book, is all that is required by this section. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, 164 Va. 112, 178 S.E. 791, 1935 Va. LEXIS 183 (1935). And bank from wh ich money borrowed need not be named.  This section does not require the naming of the bank from which the money is to be borrowed to be set out in the resolution, but the fact that a bank has been nam ed therein will not invalidate an otherwise valid resolution. The name of the bank may be treated as surplusage. First Nat'l Bank v. Clements, 164 Va. 112, 178 S.E. 791, 1935 Va.

As used in this section and §§ 6.2-886, 6.2-887, and 6.2-888:Control has the meaning assigned to it in § 2 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. § 1841 et seq.).Controlled subsidiary corporation means a corporation that is controlled by a bank organized under the laws of the Commonwealth, or by more than one bank, at least one of which is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth. B. A bank may acquire, own, and hold the stock, securities, or obligations of one or more controlled subsidiary corporations. Such investment in stock, securities, or obligations, together with any investment of the bank in stock, securities, or obligations of a bank service corporation, shall not exceed in the aggregate 50 percent of the banks capital stock and permanent surplus, without the permission of the Commission, which limit on investment shall not include, but shall be in addition to, investment in (i) a real estate subsidiary as provided in § 6.2-873, (ii) the stock, securities, or obligations of a building corporation under § 6.2-870, and (iii) controlled subsidiary corporations that are wholly owned by the bank. C. A controlle d subsidiary corporation shall not be authorized to (i) receive deposits except as hereafter provided; (ii) engage in the trust business; or (iii) conduct any business that is required under § 13.1-620 to be specifically stated in the articles of inco rporation, except a controlled subsidiary corporation may engage in the business of credit card operations, leasing, safe deposit, factoring, credit bureaus, mortgage brokerage or servicing, data processing, international banking and finance, and any oth er function or business activity in which a bank might engage, except the receipt of deposits, or the trust business. Subject to the foregoing limitations on the businesses that a controlled subsidiary corporation is authorized to conduct, and with the p rior approval of the Commission and subject to such conditions as the Commission may impose, a controlled subsidiary corporation may also engage in any business that is authorized by statute, regulation, or official interpretation for a subsidiary of a n ational bank or an out-of-state state bank as defined in § 6.2-836 to the extent such activity is financial in nature, or incidental or complimentary to a financial activity, and is not otherwise prohibited by state law. A controlled subsidiary corpor ation transacting business as a real estate brokerage firm shall be governed by § 6.2-888 and be subject to the provisions of this section. A controlled subsidiary corporation may charge and collect such finance charges and fees or interest rates as a re authorized to banks by the laws of the Commonwealth or as otherwise authorized by Chapter 3 (§ 6.2-300 et seq.). D. A controlle d subsidiary corporation engaged solely in the business of international banking and finance, and subject to the regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, shall not be prohibited from receiving deposits or from t aking any other action that any such regulated international banking and finance institution is permitted to take. E. The provisi ons of § 6.2-874 relating to investment of funds in shares of stock of another corporation shall be applicable to controlled subsidiary corporations, except that a controlled subsidiary corporation may acquire, own, and hold stock in a subsidiary corp oration if a bank would be permitted to directly acquire, own, or hold the stock hereunder. The provisions of § 6.2-876 relating to loans to officers, directors, or employees of the bank shall be applicable both to loans by the subsidiary to officers, directors, or employees of the bank and to loans by the bank to officers, directors, or employees of the subsidiary, with the approval of the board of directors of the bank only being required for purposes of § 6.2-876.

The provisi ons of § 6.2-875 relating to limitations upon obligations of any one borrower shall apply to the total obligations of any borrower in the aggregate to the subsidiary corporation and to any bank or bank holding company owning stock securities or obliga tions of such subsidiary corporation. The loan limit of the subsidiary shall be computed by attributing to the subsidiary a pro rata share of the lending limit of each bank stockholder prorated in accordance with the percentage of stock owned by such ban k. However, in the case of a subsidiary, any of the stock, securities, or other obligations of which are owned by a bank holding company, the loan limits of the subsidiary shall be computed by attributing to the subsidiary a pro rata share of the lending limits of all bank subsidiaries of such holding company, which share shall be prorated based on the percentage of stock owned by the holding company and all subsidiary banks thereof. In computing whether a bank or a subsidiary that is not wholly owned i s complying with its lending limit, the loans of the bank and the subsidiary to any common borrower shall be aggregated on a basis pro rata to the percentage of stock of the subsidiary owned by the bank. Such controlled subsidiary corporation shall not o therwise be subject to the provisions of this chapter except where it is expressly so provided. Notwithstanding any provisions of this subsection to the contrary, the restrictions set out in §§ 6.2-874 through 6.2-881 shall not be imposed upon any controlled subsidiary that has no state banks as shareholders.

When shares of a national banking association or of a banking corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or another state are held by a trust institution that is serving as a personal representative of a decedent, trustee, guardian of any infant, agen t or in any other fiduciary capacity, the trust institution may not (i) vote or participate in the voting of any voting securities of such bank if the securities held in such fiduciary capacity, together with all the other voting securities of such bank held in a fiduciary capacity, exceed 25 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such bank or (ii) vote such voting securities, if the voting securities of such bank held as a personal representative of the decedent, together with all other voting securities of such bank held in a fiduciary capacity, exceed five percent, unless there has been a determination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System that the right to vote five percent or more of the voting securities but less than 2 5 percent thereof does not constitute control of that bank. C. If there is any personal representative, trustee, guardian of any infant, or other fiduciary in addition to the trust institution in such fiduciary capacity, the other fiduciary, if not a director, officer, or employee of the trust institution, may vote such shares . If the trust institution is the sole fiduciary, or if the trust institution is serving along with a director, officer, or employee of the trust institution, it may petition the court, as provided in subsection D, for the appointment of a cofiduciary fo r the sole purpose of voting such bank shares. D. When a trus t institution has qualified or is serving under the laws of the Commonwealth as personal representative of a decedent, trustee, guardian of any infant, or in any other fiduciary capacity, and in such estate or trust, there are shares of stock of a nation al banking association or a banking corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or another state, and the trust institution is disqualified under subsection B from voting such shares, the trust institution or any interested party may petitio n the court in which the institution qualified or is capable to qualify to appoint a cofiduciary for the sole purpose of voting the shares of the banking association or banking corporation held by the estate or trust, which the trust institution is disqu alified from voting. The appointment and qualification may be ex parte, and no prior notice to the beneficiary shall be required. The court at the time of such qualification may relieve the cofiduciary of any obligation for the giving of surety on his bo nd, and if the appointment of the cofiduciary is limited to voting of the bank stock, such order may provide that the cofiduciary shall not be liable or accountable as a fiduciary in the administration of such estate or trust except for the breach of any fiduciary duty in voting or failing to vote such bank stock. No director, officer, or employee of a trust institution shall be eligible to be named cofiduciary under the provisions of this subsection.

Text A. Shares of s tock issued by a stock institution shall be paid for in full in cash at not less than their par value upon issuance or, in the case of a stock institution then actively conducting operations, in property or services valued, with the approval of the Commi ssion, at an amount not less than the aggregate value of the shares issued in exchange therefor. A stock institution may not purchase, redeem or otherwise reacquire shares of stock that it has issued and may not accept its shares of stock as security. A stock institution shall have the power to redeem or otherwise reacquire shares of its common or preferred stock to the same extent as commercial banks incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth are permitted to do under this title. B. Subscriptio ns to the capital stock of a stock institution shall be paid in money at not less than par. No stock institution shall begin business until the amount specified in its certificate of authority to commence business has been received by it. C.

The directors of the stock institution, individually, jointly and severally, shall be liable for any failure of the savings institution to refund such funds to the subscribers or sharehold ers. This liability may be enforced by a suit in equity instituted by one or more of the subscribers or stockholders on behalf of all against the stock institution and one or more of its directors. D. The require ment that capital stock be paid in money shall not be construed to prohibit the establishment, as otherwise authorized by law, of stock option plans and stock purchase plans, and the issuance of stock pursuant to such plans. Such plans shall be establish ed only after the stock institution has opened for business. Any such plan with respect to a stock association shall be established as follows: 1. The b oard of directors shall by resolution propose the stock option or stock purchase plan. The plan shall describe any effect the adoption of the plan is expected to have on the value of issued and outstanding shares of the association; 2. Notice of a meeting of stockholders, stating that the purpose or one of the purposes of the meeting is to consider the plan so proposed by the board of directors, shall be given to eac h stockholder of record entitled to vote thereon within the time and in the manner provided in Chapter 9 (§ 13.1-601 et seq.) of Title 13.1 for giving of notice of meetings of stockholders. A copy of the plan shall be included with such notice; and 3. At such meeting, the plan shall be adopted if approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of more than two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote thereon.Any such plan with respect to a savings bank shall be adopted if approved by a majority vote of the institutions shareholders. In no event shall such a plan established by a stock savings bank provide that a stock option be granted at a price which is less than 100 percent of the book value per share of the stock as shown by the stock institutions last published statement prior to the granting of the option.

Every savings institution (i) shall set up and maintain the reserves required by this chapter and (ii) may set up and maintain such additional reserves as are permitted by this chapter. B. On or befor e the closing date of each accounting period, after payment of or provision for all expenses, every savings institution shall transfer to a separate reserve account that shall be set up and maintained for the sole purpose of absorbing losses, referred to in this section as the general reserve, an amount equal to at least five percent of its net income. A savings institution that at the close of such accounting period has assets in excess of $20 million or that has done business as a savings inst itution in the Commonwealth for more than 20 years shall transfer to such separate reserve account the greater of five percent of its net income or an amount obtained by subtracting an amount equal to its general reserve at the beginning of the period fr om an amount equal to four percent of its assets, excluding liquid assets, at the end of the period, until the general reserve is equal to at least five percent of the total amount of its deposit accounts at the beginning of such accounting period. Upon advanced written application of a savings institution, the Commissioner may approve the transfer to the general reserve of a lesser amount for such accounting period.

Annotations CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under prior law. The Commissions discretion in authorizing branches is not an absolute discretion. Mu tual Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 557, 186 S.E.2d 13, 1972 Va. LEXIS 207 (1972). The Commission, like all triers of fact, must act within the bounds of reason. Mutual Sav . &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 557, 186 S.E.2d 13, 1972 Va. LEXIS 207 (1972). Factors to be considered.  While the adequacy of existing bank facilities may be considered in determining whether public convenience and necessity [now public interest] will be served, thi s does not preclude the Commission from authorizing a proposed branch when there has been a showing of a public need and such authorization will not jeopardize the financial soundness of already existing banks and other financial institutions in the area . If such were not the case, the statute would tend to deter competition and promote monopoly. Mutual Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 557, 186 S.E.2d 13, 1972 Va. LEXIS 207 (1972). Adequacy of existing banking facilities is only one of the criteria to be considered by the Commission in determining public convenience and necessity [now public interest]. Farmers &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 401, 192 S.E.2d 744, 1972 Va. LEXIS 374 (1972). Notwithstanding the adequacy of banking facilities generally, the Commission may still authorize the establishment of a branch banking unit if it finds that there is a need for a particular kind of service or for service in a particular location and that the financial soundness of existing institutions would not be jeopardized thereby. Farmers &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 401, 192 S.E.2d 744, 1 972 Va. LEXIS 374 (1972). Presumption of correctness.  The ruling of the State Corporation Commission in proceedings on an application for authority to open a branch of state-chartered bank comes to the Supreme Court with the presumption that it is correct. Old Dominion Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Colony Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 219 Va. 586, 249 S.E.2d 167, 1978 Va. LEXIS 216 (1978). The Commissions finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is contrary to the e vidence or without evidence to support it. Mutual Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 557, 186 S.E.2d 13, 1972 Va. LEXIS 207 (1972); First Va. Bank v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 349, 193 S.E.2d 4, 1972 Va. LEXIS 364 (1972); Farmers &amp; Merchants Nat'l Ba nk v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 401, 192 S.E.2d 744, 1972 Va. LEXIS 374 (1972); Old Dominion Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Colony Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 219 Va. 586, 249 S.E.2d 167, 1978 Va. LEXIS 216 (1978). But decision b ased on mistake of law must be reversed.  Where a decision of the Commission is based upon a mistake of law it must be reversed. First Va. Bank v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 349, 193 S.E.2d 4, 1972 Va. LEXIS 3 64 (1972). Even where the Commission has reached the right result for the wrong reason, its decisio n, unlike that of a trial court, will not be permitted to stand. First Va. Bank v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 349, 193 S.E.2d 4, 1972 Va.

In that event, the institution shall be required to file an application and obtain the approval of the Commission in accordance with subsection A. The institution shall also notify the Commissioner in writing that the office relocation has been completed within 10 days after the opening of the office at its new location. C.

A state savings institution may establish a remote service unit without prior approval of the Commission, provided that notice is given to the Commissioner in accordance with the provis ions of subsection A of § 6.2-1133. No remote service unit may be used to open a savings account or a demand account or to establish a loan account. C. Before perm itting an account holder to use a remote service unit, the savings institution shall provide a personal security identifier to the account holder and require its use when accessing a remote service unit. An institution may not employ RSU access technique s that require the account holder to disclose a PSI to another person. D. A state sav ings institution shall not share an RSU with any financial institution or other entity the accounts of which are not insured by an agency of the federal government or by some other insuring agency approved by the Commissioner.

Notwithstan ding any other provision of law, with the approval of the Commission, and in accordance with the provisions of this section and any regulations adopted pursuant to this section, any mutual association may reorganize to become a mutual holding company by: 1. Causi ng a stock association to be formed by incorporating a stock corporation and obtaining a certificate of authority to begin business as a savings institution pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 9 (§ 13.1-601 et seq.) of Title 13.1 and Article 2 (§ 6.2-1114 et seq.) of this chapter; 2. Transferring the substantial part of its assets and liabilities, including all of its deposit liabilities, to the stock association created, in exchange for receipt of no less than 51 percent of the capital stock of the stock association; and 3. Adopting an amended charter changing its name and conforming its organization, governance, and powers to those prescribed hereunder for a mutual holding company. B. In connecti on with the transfer of assets and liabilities, the resulting mutual holding company may retain assets to the extent such assets are not required to be transferred to the stock association created in order to satisfy any capital or reserve requirements i mposed by applicable state or federal law. C. Upon such t ransfer, all persons who prior thereto held depository rights with respect to or other rights as creditors of the reorganized mutual association shall have such rights solely with respect to the stock association created, and the corresponding liability or obligation of the reorganized mutual association to such persons shall be assumed by the stock association. Persons who prior thereto had any ownership, liquidation, or voting rights with respect to the reorganized mutual association, in their capacit ies as savings depositors, and pursuant to provision of law, or pursuant to the articles of incorporation and bylaws of that association, shall continue to have such rights but solely with respect to the mutual association in its reorganized form as a mu tual holding company. The ownership or liquidation interest of any savings depositor of the subsidiary stock association in the net earnings and net worth of the resulting mutual holding company, and the voting rights of any such depositor in the mutual holding company, shall terminate, or otherwise be limited, in the same manner and on the happening of the same events as was the case prior thereto with the interest held by that depositor in the mutual association. D. The reorgan ization of a mutual association into a mutual holding company shall be conducted in a manner that is equitable to all parties. The board of directors of the mutual association shall first adopt by a two-thirds vote a plan of reorganization, the provision s of which shall comply with requirements set forth in regulations adopted by the Commission. Such plan shall provide that holders of savings deposits in the reorganized mutual association shall be afforded an opportunity to preserve their interests by s ubscribing to the minority stock of the subsidiary stock association. The Commission shall approve any such plan of reorganization if the Commission ascertains that the reorganization shall not have an adverse effect on the stability of the association a nd that the reorganized mutual association has complied with all laws and regulations of the Commission relating to the reorganization of a mutual association into a mutual holding company. The Commission shall adopt regulations governing the procedures to be followed in completing the reorganization after the Commission has approved a plan of reorganization. Such regulations shall ensure that the subsidiary association resulting from such reorganization shall continue to have its accounts insured by th e Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other federal insurance agency. E. Upon reorga nization, the resulting mutual holding company (i) shall continue to possess and may exercise all the rights, powers, and privileges, except deposit-taking powers, of a mutual association under the laws of the Commonwealth and (ii) shall be subject to th e limitations and restrictions imposed on savings institution holding companies by §§ 6.2-1147 and 6.2-1192, as well as all limitations and restrictions applicable to mutual savings institutions. F. Upon reorga nization, the association chartered as a stock corporation shall have the power to issue to persons other than the mutual holding company of which it is a subsidiary, an amount of common stock which in the aggregate does not exceed 49 percent of the issu ed and outstanding common stock of the association. For purposes of this percentage limitation, any issued and outstanding securities that are convertible into common stock shall be considered as issued and outstanding common stock. If at any time, the m utual holding company resulting from reorganization sells or otherwise disposes of outstanding shares in its stock association subsidiary, and as a result such mutual holding company no longer owns more than 51 percent of the outstanding shares of such a ssociation, or if the subsidiary stock association sells substantially all of its assets in a transaction in which substantially all deposit liabilities of such association are assumed and become liabilities of the purchaser of those assets, the Commissi on, on application of the Commissioner, may, after reasonable notice to the mutual holding company and its subsidiary stock association, appoint a receiver to wind up the affairs of the mutual holding company.

Proceedings for the appointment of a receiver of a savings institution shall not be entertained by any court except on the applic ation of the Commission. C. In any case where the Commission finds that an insured savings institution is insolvent or about to become insolvent, the Commission may seek the appointment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver for the savings institution. The court may appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver for the savings institution if it finds that to do so would be in the public interest. Upon its being appointed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall not be required to post bond, and it s hall have as receiver all those powers afforded under federal law. D.

If neces sary to conserve the assets of the credit union or protect the interests of the members of the credit union, the Commission may, after reasonable notice to the credit union and an opportunity for it to be heard, do any one or more of the following: 1. Close the credit union for a period not exceeding 60 days, which period may be extended for additional like periods as the Commission may deem necessary; 2. Require the officers and directors of the credit union to liquidate outstanding loans; 3. Require that all lawful orders of the Commission be complied with; 4.

The Commission shall approve the establishment of the proposed service facility if it appears that the interest of the members of the applicant will be served thereby and that such establishment will not impair the financial condition of the applicant or any other credit union.

A participating credit union may also invest in the credit union service organization.

The members hip of a credit union shall consist of the incorporators, employees of such credit union, and other persons within the field of membership set forth in the bylaws as have: (i) been fully admitted into membership, (ii) paid any required entrance fee or an nual membership fee, or both, (iii) subscribed for one or more shares, (iv) paid the initial installment thereon, and (v) complied with such other requirements as the articles of incorporation or bylaws specify. B. Credit unio n membership shall be limited to persons within a specified field of membership, individuals within the immediate family or household of such persons, associations of such persons, other credit unions, and employees of the credit union. The field of memb ership specified shall be composed of one of the following: 1. A sin gle group having a common bond of occupation or association; 2. More than one group, each of which has a common bond of occupation or association, and each of which does not exceed 3,000 members at the time it is proposed to be included in a multip le common-bond credit union. The 3,000-member limitation shall not apply if the Commission determines that an exception on the grounds provided in subsection (d) (2) or (d) (3) of § 101 of the Credit Union Membership Access Act (12 U.S.C. § 1759) i s appropriate. In making any determination under this provision, the Commission shall give consideration to the National Credit Union Administration guidelines; or 3. Those persons or organizations within a well-defined local community, neighborhood or rural district.The Commission shall in its discretion determine whether a proposed field of member ship constitutes a well-defined local community, neighborhood or rural district. In making such determination, the Commission shall give consideration to the definition of the term that has been adopted by the National Credit Union Administration and has become legally effective. C. Except as t he board of directors may provide to the contrary in the bylaws with respect to termination of membership, once a person or entity becomes a member of a credit union in accordance with this chapter, that person or entity may remain a member of that credi t union until the person or entity chooses to withdraw from the credit union. D. The board o f directors may expel from the credit union any member who: (i) has not carried out his obligations to the credit union; (ii) has been convicted of a criminal offense; (iii) neglects or refuses to comply with the provisions of this chapter or of the byla ws; (iv) neglects to pay his debts, or otherwise causes financial loss to the credit union; or (v) has deceived the credit union with regard to the use of borrowed money. No member shall be so expelled until he has been informed in writing of the charges against him, and an opportunity has been given to him, after reasonable notice, to be heard. E. Members of the credit union shall not be personally liable for payment of the debts of the credit union. F. The survivi ng spouse of a deceased credit union member shall be eligible to become a member of the credit union to which the deceased member belonged. In no other instance shall an individual be eligible for membership in a credit union on the basis of the individu als relationship to another person who is eligible for membership in the credit union, unless the individual is a member of the immediate family or household of such person. The board of directors of a credit union may provide in the bylaws for a les s inclusive policy governing membership by virtue of relationship to another person, and such policy shall be effective. G. Societies, associations, organizations, partnerships, and corporations composed of persons who are eligible for membership may be admitted to membership in the same manner and under the same conditions as such persons. H. Any individ ual or entity that was a member of a credit union as of July 1, 1999, may remain a member of the credit union after that date, and any group that was included in the field of membership of a credit union on that date may remain within the field of member ship of that credit union after that date. The successor of an entity that was a member or was eligible for membership in a credit union or for inclusion in a field of membership on July 1, 1999, retains the status of its predecessor.

Such notice also shall be (i) published concurrently in a newspaper of general circulation in the credit unions service area; (ii) posted on the credit unions website; and (iii) posted in a conspicuous place in the lobby of each of th e credit unions offices.

The credit union shall post information related to a potential conversion on the credit unions principal Internet web site at least 60 days prior to a vote by the board of director s to adopt a proposal of conversion. The posted information shall, at a minimum, discuss: a. The business purposes that might be accomplished by a conversion; b.

The methods by which a member may request a copy of the posted information; e. The method and timeline for members to submit written comments on the potential conversion; and f. The process that will be followed if the board formally adopts a conversion proposal. 3. The board shall provide members a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments relating to a potential conversion. The board may hold a special meeting to receive member input reg arding the potential conversion. It is within the boards discretion to determine the type, number, duration, and location of any special meeting. Before taking a final vote on a conversion proposal, the board shall review and consider all written com ments and any other member input received at any special meeting. The conversion resolution shall state that the board has reviewed and considered all such comments and input and has determined affirmatively that the conversion is in the best interests o f the members. 4. Subsequent to the written comment period, the credit union shall adopt, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the members of its board of directors, a conversion proposal c onsistent with this section. The credit union shall notify the Commissioner of the boards approval of the proposal, and shall file an application in accordance with § 6.2-1118 and pay the accompanying fee in accordance with § 6.2-1202. In addit ion, the credit union shall send to the Commissioner as soon as reasonably practical (i) a budget of the anticipated conversion expenses including legal, postage and mailing, advertising, printing, consulting fees, examination and operating fees, and any overtime or other employee compensation to be paid exclusively as a result of the conversion and (ii) any other information reasonably requested by the Commissioner. 5. At least 30 days prior to a vote by the members to formally adopt the conversion proposal, the credit union shall mail to each member a notice of a meeting of the members to consider t he conversion proposal, advising the members of the boards adoption of the conversion proposal. The notice must include a prominent statement that the conversion will be decided by a vote of members eligible to vote on the proposal under the credit u nions bylaws and that the affirmative votes of two-thirds of those eligible members voting are required for approval unless the articles of incorporation require a greater or lesser vote in which case the notice shall specify that percentage. However , in no case shall the percentage vote be less than a majority of the members voting notwithstanding what is specified in the articles of incorporation. The notice shall clearly inform the members that they may vote at the members meeting on the prop osal or submit the written ballot included with the notice. Each eligible member is entitled to one vote.

Each member shall be entitled to receive a share or deposit account or accounts in the converted institution equal in amount to the value of accounts held in the former credit union subject to any lien or right of offset held by the credit union. 8. The Commission shall approve the conversion if all of the conditions required by this section and § 6.2-1118 have been met, unless the Commission determines that, because of a conce rn over the safety and soundness of the credit union, the conversion is not in the best interest of the credit union or its members. 9. The eligible and voting members of the credit union must approve the conversion proposal by a two-thirds affirmative vote of those voting, or such greater or lesser vote provided for u nder the articles of incorporation, but in no event less than a majority of the members voting notwithstanding what the articles of incorporation may specify. Such vote shall be by secret ballot and shall be conducted by an independent entity, which may be such credit unions legal or accounting firm. 10. Following approval of the conversion by the members, the conversion shall become effective when (i) the Commission shall have approved it and (ii) any amendment of the articles of i ncorporation of the credit union necessary to effect the conversion shall have become effective. C. If any requ irements for notice, meetings, voting or other requirements in this section are inconsistent with the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act (§ 13.1-801 et seq.), the provisions of this section shall control.

History History. 2010, c. 794. Annotations CASE NOTES Editors note. The annotations below were decided under former Title 6.1 or prior law. The State Corporation Commission is charged with the duty to supervise and regulate activities of savings and loan corporations for the protection of investors, depositors and others. MacKethan v. Virginia, 370 F. Supp. 1, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12773 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 508 F.2d 838, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 5520 (4th Cir. 1974). Its regulation of savings and loan activities is for the general welfare of its citizenry; this is a function patently not dominated by private persons or corporations, but one in which only a governmental agency is especially equipped to perform. MacKethan v. Virginia, 370 F. Supp. 1, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12773 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 508 F.2d 838, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 5520 (4th Cir. 1974). State participation in the area of securities regulation is not sufficient in and of itself to waive sovereign immunity. MacKethan v. Virginia, 370 F. Supp. 1, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12773 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 508 F.2d 838, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 5520 (4th Cir. 1974). The contention is invalid that the State by means of the State Corporation Commission has become involved in securities regulations, an area legitimately subject to congressional supervision, and is therefore subject to suit on a theory of an implied waiver of immunity in a federal court on the same terms as any individual creating an injury in that area for which Congress intended to provide recovery. MacKethan v. Virginia, 370 F. Supp. 1, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12773 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 508 F.2d 838, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 5520 (4th Cir. 1974). States activity limited to regulatory system paralleling federal scheme.  While savings and loan enterprises undoubtedly peripherally and in some instances perhaps directly affect interstate commerce, the relationship is not one in whic h the immediate federal interests are exclusive, or where a federal act had preempted state interests. At the most, the states activity is limited to a regulatory system paralleling and complementing the federal regulatory scheme. MacKethan v. Virgin ia, 370 F. Supp. 1, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12773 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 508 F.2d 838, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 5520 (4th Cir. 1974). Industrial loan association is bank under federal revenue law.  An industrial loan association is a bank within the meaning of the federal revenue act, notwithstanding the distinctions imposed by this and other section s.

Some of the annotations below were decided under prior law. Constitutionality.  In dealing with the constitutionality of a small loan act, regard must be had to the consideration that any act designed to accomplish its purpose must be suffici ently definite and comprehensive in its selection of means and methods to frustrate the energy and ingenuity of the class at whom it is aimed, who so often regard the privilege of exploiting the necessities of borrowers as a vested property right. Sweat v. Commonwealth, 152 Va. 1041, 148 S.E. 774, 1929 Va. LEXIS 232 (1929). Liberal construction.  The Consumer Finance Act is remedial in nature. Consequently, it must be liberally construed to avoid the mischief at which it is directed and to advance the reme dy for which it was promulgated. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, 230 Va. 422, 337 S.E.2d 291, 1985 Va. LEXIS 296 (1985). Loan describ ed as mortgage loan held subject to act.  Where the principal amount of a loan falls below the ceiling contained in the Consumer Finance Act, then, even if the lender is not licensed under the act, and ev en if the loan is described as a mortgage loan, that loan is nevertheless subject to the act. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, 230 Va. 422, 337 S.E.2d 291, 1985 Va. LEXIS 296 (1985). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction.  Subsection D of § 59.1-199 enumerates for exemption only businesses that are already licensed or regulated elsewhere in the code; independent of the prerequisi te of licensure to gain benefit of the safe harbor from suit pursuant to the blanket requirement in § 6.2-1500, subsection D of § 59.1-199 itself further accentuates the exception for small loan companies applies only if they are already regulated and supervised by the State Corporation Commission or a comparable federal regulating body.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 6.1. Applicability.  Since plaintiff borrower alleged that defendant lender charged an interest rate well over 12 percent without the proper licensing, she was entitled to a recovery of $693.50 under the Virginia Consumer Finance Act. Tweedy v. RCAM Title Loans, LLC, 611 F. Supp. 2d 603, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38265 (W.D. Va. 2009). In an action by borrowers against persons behind tribal lending entities that allegedly charged usurious interest rates, plaintiffs were entitled to enjoin defend ants from violating Virginias Consumer Finance Act only to the extent that the violations affect loans issued to them and the putative class because the statute provided for prospective relief only to the extent necessary to prevent the collection an d receipt of any principal, interest and charges on a plaintiffs unlawful loan, and thus Ex parte Young-style relief was available only to the same extent, meaning the Court could not use Ex parte Young to enjoin future usurious lending by defendants . Hengle v. Asner, 433 F. Supp. 3d 825, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3925 (E.D. Va. 2020), aff'd, 19 F.4th 324, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 33964 (4th Cir. 2021). Loan describ ed as mortgage loan held subject to act.  Where the principal amount of a loan falls below the ceiling contained in the Consumer Finance Act [now Chapter 15 of Title 6.2], then, even if the lender is not licensed under the act, and even if the loan is described as a mortgage loan, that loan is nevertheless subject to the act. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, 230 Va. 422, 337 S.E.2d 291, 1985 Va. LEXIS 296 (1985). Mo rtgage loan subject to act if less than small loan ceiling.  Where a loan falls below the small loan ceiling and is made by a person in the business of making loans below that ceiling, then even though the loan is in the fo rm of a mortgage loan, it will be treated as a small loan and thus will be subject to the Consumer Finance Act [now Chapter 15 of Title 6.2]. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, 230 Va. 422, 337 S.E.2d 291, 1985 Va. LEXIS 296 (1985). Making of mortgage loans held evasive conduct.  Where the making of mortgage loans was simply a device designed to transform a small loan into something other than a small loan and at the same time, it caused t he borrowers to pay more for their loans than the Consumer Finance Act [now Chapter 15 of Title 6.2] would have allowed, this conduct was sufficient to establish an evasion as defined in this section. Valley Acceptance Corp. v. Glasby, 230 Va. 422, 337 S .E.2d 291, 1985 Va. LEXIS 296 (1985). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Licensure requirement.  Requirement of licensure for non-commercial lenders doing business in Virginia is not a discriminatory restraint on trade, but rather a prudent exercise of the co nstitutional police power to regulate fraudulent activity; this general obligation to obtain a license to engage in the business of making personal noncommercial loans and thus be subject to the supervisory eye of the State Corporation Commission, is har monized in subsection D of § 59.1-199. Commonwealth v. NC Fin. Solutions of Utah, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 232, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 602 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2018). Defendants actions in making a loan without utilizing a licensed business location in Virginia violated the Consumer Finance Act rendered the loan agreement v oid as the loan was initiated by an unlicensed location of defendant in Georgia sending a check offering a loan directly to plaintiff at her home address in Virginia; and defendants initial unsolicited mailing of an offer for a loan with an interest rate in excess of 30% that included instructions on how to complete the loan (without the involvement of a licensed business location in Virginia) constituted the business of making a loan as contemplated by the Act, but any involvement by a properly lic ensed location in Virginia was for servicing the loan  not making the loan. Lendmark Fin. Servs. v. St. Clair, 102 Va. Cir. 502, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1788 (Page County Dec. 4, 2018). Out-of-state lenders.  No distinction is made between domestic or foreign-based lending entities, and no exception is provided for the loans made under choice-of-law provisions purporti ng to apply the substantive laws of another state to adjudicate disputes among contracting parties; if the General Assembly intended to exempt out-of-state noncommercial lenders from licensing, it would have so stated. Commonwealth v. NC Fin. Solutions o f Utah, LLC, 100 Va. Cir. 232, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 602 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2018). Pleadings.  Complaint sufficiently pleaded that a lender violated the Virginia Consumer Finance Act, § 6.2-1500 et seq., either as an unlicensed consumer finance lender or as an open-end credit plan lender, because the lender allegedly imposed annual interest rates on consumer loans in excess of 12 percent without meeting any of the statutory exceptions. Specifically, the lender charged more than 12 percent interest witho ut having a license, as required by statute, and without abiding by the statutory requirements of open-end credit lenders.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases cited under this section were decided under former § 6.1-256. Standard for small loan office not as restrictive.  Because the involvement of the public is not as great, the standard which applies in considering an application for a small loan office is less restrictive than t he standard which applies when considering an application for the establishment of a bank or a savings and loan office. Peoples Fin. Serv. of Waynesboro, Inc. v. Beneficial Fin. Corp., 220 Va. 808, 263 S.E.2d 59, 1980 Va. LEXIS 171 (1980). The purpose of restricting entry into the small loan business is solely to prevent detri mental effects on the publics interest. Peoples Fin. Serv. of Waynesboro, Inc. v. Beneficial Fin. Corp., 220 Va. 808, 263 S.E.2d 59, 1980 Va. LEXIS 171 (1980). Evidence of ruinous competition to existing licensees is a consideration which bears upo n the convenience and advantage to the community and is a proper factor to be considered by the State Corporation Commission in determining whether to grant a license to establish a new small loan office. The competitive effect upon existing carriers or existing licensees could possibly be so disabling as to disserve the public interest. Peoples Fin. Serv. of Waynesboro, Inc. v. Beneficial Fin. Corp., 220 Va. 808, 263 S.E.2d 59, 1980 Va. LEXIS 171 (1980). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Virginia address required for licens e.  Defendants actions in making a loan without utilizing a licensed business location in Virginia violated the Consumer Finance Act rendered the loan agreement v oid as the loan was initiated by an unlicensed location of defendant in Georgia sending a check offering a loan directly to plaintiff at her home address in Virginia; and defendants initial unsolicited mailing of an offer for a loan with an interest rate in excess of 30% that included instructions on how to complete the loan (without the involvement of a licensed business location in Virginia) constituted the business of making a loan as contemplated by the Act, but any involvement by a properly lic ensed location in Virginia was for servicing the loan  not making the loan.

A licensee may make installment loans of between $300 and $35,000, which loans shall have a term of no fewer than six months and no more than 120 months and shall be repayable in at least six substantially equal consecutive payments. A licensee may charge and colle ct interest on a loan made under this chapter at a single annual rate not to exceed 36 percent. Interest shall not be charged on an add-on basis and shall not be compounded but shall be computed and paid only as a percentage of the unpaid principal balan ce. Interest shall be computed on the basis of the number of days elapsed; however, if part or all of the consideration for a loan contract is the unpaid principal balance of a prior loan, then the principal amount payable under the loan contract may inc lude any unpaid interest on the prior loan that has accrued within 90 days before the making of the new loan contract. For the purpose of computing interest, a day may equal 1/360th or 1/365th of a year. B. A licensee may charge a late payment fee of $20 for any payment or portion of a payment not received and applied within 10 days of the contractual due date. For purposes of this section, a late payment fee for any individual scheduled contractual payment due may be assessed only once. The late payment fee shall be specified in the contract between the lender and the borrower. C. A licensee may charge a loan processing fee not to exceed the greater of $50 or six percent of the principal amount of the loan, provided that the loan processing fee shall in no event exceed $150. The loan processing fee shall be stated in the loan contract. The l oan processing fee shall not be deemed to constitute interest charged on the principal amount of the loan for purposes of determining whether the interest charged exceeds the 36 percent annual contract interest rate limitation imposed by subsection A. Up on payment of the full amount of principal due plus accrued interest and any other applicable fees within the first 30 days, whether through outside funds or a refinancing under a new loan advance, the borrower shall be entitled to a full rebate of the l oan processing fee less an amount not to exceed $50 or the actual loan processing fee, whichever is less. If a loan is refinanced or renewed, a licensee may assess an additional loan processing fee on the loan no more than once during any 12-month period . D. A licensee may collect from the borrower the amount of any actual fees necessary to file, record, or release its security interest with any public official or agency of a locality or the Commonwealth as may be required by law.

The Commiss ion shall certify and contract with one or more third parties to develop, implement, and maintain a real-time, Internet-accessible database that contains such short-term loan information as the Commission may require from time to time by administrative r ule or policy statement. B. The followi ng provisions shall apply to the database: 1. Befor e making a short-term loan, a licensee shall query the database through a Commission-certified database provider and shall retain evidence of the query for the Commissions supervisory review. The database shall allow a licensee to make a short-term l oan only if making the loan is permissible under the provisions of this chapter. During any period that the database is unavailable due to technical problems beyond the licensees control, a licensee may rely on the loan applicants written represe ntations, rather than the databases information, to verify that making the loan applied for is permissible under the provisions of this chapter. Because a licensee may rely on the accuracy of the applicants representations and the databases i nformation, a licensee is not subject to any administrative penalty or civil liability if that information is later determined to be inaccurate. 2. The database provider shall maintain the database, take all actions it deems necessary to protect the confidentiality and security of the information contained in the database, be resp onsible for the confidentiality and security of such information, and own the information contained in the database. The Commission shall have access to and utilize the database as a supervision and enforcement tool to ensure licensees compliance wit h the provisions of this chapter. 3. Upon a licensees query, the database shall advise the licensee whether the applicant is eligible for a new short-term loan and, if the applicant is ineligible, the reason for such ineligibility. If the database advises the licensee that the applicant is ineligible for a short-term loan, then the applicant shall direct any inquiry regarding the specific reason for such ineligibility to the database provider rather than to the licen see. The information contained in the database is confidential and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.). 4. If a licensee and borrower consummate a loan, then the licensee shall pay a fee to defray the costs of submitting the database inquiry. The amount of the database inquiry fee shall be calculated in accordance with a schedule set by the Commission. The schedule shall bear a reasonable relationship to actual cost of the operation of the database. If a licensee submits a database inquiry but does not consummate a loan with the applicant, then the licensee shall not pay the database inquiry fee. Each licensee shall remit all database inquiry fees directly to the database provider on a weekly basis. 5. If a borrower enters into a short-term loan or pays or otherwise satisfies a short-term loan in full, then the licensee making the loan shall report such event or other information to the database not later than the close of business on the date of such event.

A licensee shall not obtain any agreement from the borrower (i) giving the licensee or any third person power of attorney or authority to confess judgment for the borrower; (ii) author izing the licensee or any third party to bring suit against the borrower in a court outside the Commonwealth; or (iii) waiving the borrowers right to legal recourse or any other right the borrower has under any otherwise applicable provision of state or federal law. 4. A licensee shall not make a loan to a person if that person is obligated upon any loan to a person licensed under Chapter 22 (§ 6.2-2200 et seq.). Prior to making a loan, a licensee shall make a reasonable attempt to verify the borrowers eligibility under this subsection that includes reviewing the files of any affiliate that is licensed under Chapter 22.

CASE NOTES Sentencing.  Where defendant violated 18 U.S.C.S. § 1960 by operating a money transmission business without a license under § 6.1-371 [now § 6.2-1901], an active term of 12 months and 1 day was imposed, followed by 2 years of supervised release due to the fact that the base level was enhanced by the value of the transmitted funds, and a downward departure was taken for acceptance of responsibility; however, defendant was not entitled to a downward departure based on incorrect legal advice, and the money was used for illegal operations. Under 18 U.S.C.S. § 3553, the court considered defendants culpability, the deterrent factor, and the disparity between federa l and state law. United States v.

Evalu ate a qualified education loan borrower for eligibility for an income-driven repayment program prior to placing the borrower in forbearance or default, if an income-driven repayment program is available to the borrower; 2. Respond to a written inquiry from a qualified education loan borrower or the representative of a qualified education loan borrower within 10 business days after receipt of the request and, within 30 business days after receipt of the request, provide information relating to the request and, if applicable, to the action the qualified education loan servicer will take to correct the account or an explanation for the qualified education loan servicers position that the borrowers account is correct. Such 30-day period may be extended for not more than 15 days if, before the end of the 30-day period, the qualified education loan servicer notifies the borrower, or the borrowers representative, as applicable, of the extension and the reasons for the delay in responding; 3. Not furnish to a consumer reporting agency, during 60 days following receipt of a written request related to a dispute on a borrowers payment on a qualified education loan, informa tion regarding a payment that is the subject of the written request; 4.

A borrowers direction on how to apply an overpayment to a qualified education loan shall remain in effect for any future overpayments during the term of a qualified education loan or until the borrower provides different directions. As used in this subdivision,  overpayment means a payment on a qualified education loan that exceeds the monthly amount due from a borrower on the qualified education loan, which payment may be referred to as a prepayment; 5. Apply partial payments in a manner that minimizes late fees and negative credit reporting. If loans on a borrowers qualified education loan account have an equal level of delinquen cy, a qualified education loan servicer shall apply partial payments to satisfy as many individual loan payments as possible on a borrowers account. As used in this subdivision, partial payment means a payment on a qualified education loan ac count that contains multiple individual loans in an amount less than the amount necessary to satisfy the outstanding payment due on all loans in the qualified education loan account, which payment may be referred to as an underpayment; 6. Require, as a condition of a sale, an assignment, or any other transfer of the servicing of a qualified education loan, that the new loan servicer honor all benefits originally represe nted as available to a qualified education loan borrower during the repayment of the qualified education loan and preserve the availability of the benefits, including any benefits for which the qualified education loan borrower has not yet qualified. If a qualified education loan servicer is not also the loan holder or is not acting on behalf of the loan holder, the loan servicer satisfies the requirement of this subsection by providing the new loan servicer with information necessary for the new loan s ervicer to honor all benefits originally represented as available to a qualified education loan borrower during the repayment of the qualified education loan and preserve the availability of the benefits, including any benefits for which the loan borrowe r has not yet qualified; and 7. In the event of a sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a qualified education loan that results in a change in the identity of the person to whom a qualified educatio n loan borrower is required to send payments or direct any communication concerning the qualified education loan: a. Transfer to the new loan servicer all records regarding the qualified education loan borrower, the account of the loan borrower, and the qualified education loan of the loan borrower. Such records include the repayment status of the qualified education l oan borrower and any benefits associated with the qualified education loan of the loan borrower. The transfer of records shall be completed within 45 days after the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a qualified education loan; b. Notify affected qualified education loan borrowers of the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a qualified education loan at least seven days before the next pa yment on the loan is due. The notice shall include (i) the identity of the new qualified education loan servicer; (ii) the effective date of the transfer of the borrowers qualified education loan to the new loan servicer; (iii) the date on which the existing loan servicer will no longer accept payments; and (iv) the contact information for the new loan servicer; and c.
