It is hereb y found and declared that: 1. Bligh ted areas exist in the Commonwealth, and these areas endanger the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth; 2. The elimination of blight and redevelopment of blighted areas through the designation of redevelopment areas and the adoption and implementation of redevelopment plans for such areas; the prevention of further deterioration and blight through the designation of conservation areas and the adoption and implementation of conservation plans for such areas; and the designation of individual properties as blighted under the spot blight  provisions of this chapter are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired by purchase or through the exercise of the power of eminent domain as authorized by this chapter, and are governmental function s of grave concern to the Commonwealth; 3.

It is a public purpose to promote the availability of affordable housing for all citizens of the Commonwealth and in particular to provide safe, decent, and sanitary housing for those citizens with low or moderate incomes. To that end, (i) the clearance, replanning, and reconstruction of the areas in which unsanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low or moderate income and (ii) the sale or lease of land and the acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, and operation of residential housing units for persons of low and moderate incomes are necessary for the public welfare and are public uses and public purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired by purchase or through the exercise of the power of eminent domain as authorized in this chapter and are governmental functions of grave concern to the Commonwealth.

CASE NOTES In its reference to governmental functions, the General Assembly intended to dec lare that the activities of housing authorities are proper functions of government, thereby emphasizing the public purposes of such authorities and reinforcing the justification for the expenditure of public funds for those purposes. VEPCO v. Hampton Red evelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 217 Va. 30, 225 S.E.2d 364, 1976 Va. LEXIS 237 (1976). Declaration is not conclusive.  While this section declares that its purposes are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired, and former § 58 of the Virginia Constitution (see now Va. Const., Art. I, § 11) provides that the term public uses is to be defined by the General Assembly, the power to define is not the power to declare, and the declaration is not conclusive.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Powers of housing authorities.  Housing authoritys right to repurchase a home it had sold under a moderate income direct sales program could be enforced as a covenant running with the land, because the resale of the home to carry out the authoritys goal of providing decent housing for citizens with low or moderate incomes touched and concerned the property. Fairfax County Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Riekse, 78 Va. Cir. 108, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 15 (Fairfax County Jan. 15, 2009), aff'd, 281 Va. 441, 707 S.E.2d 826, 2011 Va. LEXIS 58 (2011). Housing authority sold a home to low or moderate income residents at a below-market price, subject to the authoritys option to repurchase it at a specified pr ice within 30 years of the date of sale. The fact that, after repurchasing the home, the housing authority intended to use it for low income housing, did not establish the type of factual scenario necessary for equating the authoritys right to repurc hase with an equitable servitude.

A municipal housing authority is an entity purely local in nature and not a state agency performing a function of state government. VEPCO v. Hampton Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 217 Va. 30, 225 S.E.2d 364, 1976 Va. LEXIS 237 (1976). Delegation to the local governing body of the power to determine when the housing authority shall act is a valid delegation of legislative authority. Mumpower v. Housing Auth., 176 Va. 426, 11 S.E.2d 732, 1940 Va. LEXIS 265 (1940). Subsequent change of name.  Any doubt as to the sufficiency of a resolution creating the Norfolk Housing Authority because the name was subsequently changed to Norfolk Redevelopm ent and Housing Authority was removed by the validating provisions of §§ 36-10 and 36-49. Hunter v. Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Housing Auth., 195 Va. 326, 78 S.E.2d 893, 1953 Va. LEXIS 203 (1953).

History History. 1938, p. 457; Michie Code 1942, § 3145(21). Annotations CASE NOTES Re development plan may contain anticompetitive measures.  The state legislature expressly stated that the problems of urban blight required governmental action. Thus, the state concluded that private enterprise alone cou ld not solve the problem. Accordingly, the state gave housing and redevelopment authorities and cities vast powers to acquire land, clear it, determine appropriate land use for different parcels, impose conditions and limitations under which property may be redeveloped by public or private enterprise, and generally plan the redevelopment of an entire area. Clearly the legislature contemplated that the redevelopment plan would contain anticompetitive measures similar to the challenged blackout ag reement. The legislature must have contemplated that the city would try to encourage private developers to invest heavily in redevelopment and that as part of that encouragement the city would agree not to aid in building competing structures. Reasor v. City of Norfolk, 606 F. Supp. 788, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14878 (E.D. Va. 1984). In order to induce the private investor to construct a much larger building than is presently required, the city would reasonably be expected to promise some limi ted form of protection from competition in the first few years after construction of the building. Thus, the challenged blackout agreement and the citys alleged refusal to cooperate with the plaintiffs is a form of limited protection from com petition that the legislature must have contemplated when it authorized the city to become involved in redevelopment projects.

CASE NOTES This section and § 36-51 read toget her.  The question of when within the meaning of this section does the public announcement of the project take place is answered by referring to § 36 -51, and reading that section together with this section. Pearsall v. Richmond Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 218 Va. 892, 242 S.E.2d 228, 1978 Va. LEXIS 244 (1978). This section is constitutional. Mumpower v. Housing Auth., 176 Va. 426, 11 S.E.2d 732, 19 40 Va. LEXIS 265 (1940). Eradication of slums is public use.  In an attack upon the organization of the housing authority of the City of Bristol, complainant contended that the purpose of the authority was not a public purpo se and the taking of property by it was for a private use. It was held that, in view of the purpose of the housing authority with reference to the eradication of slums and the providing of decent homes, the use of the property was a public one, and the f act that the project might primarily benefit only a class did not take away the character of a public use. Mumpower v. Housing Auth., 176 Va. 426, 11 S.E.2d 732, 1940 Va. LEXIS 265 (1940). When pub lic announcement by condemnor takes place.  Reading this section and § 36-51 together, there may be no unreasonable delay resulting from a contemplated urban renewal procedure until there has been a  public announcement; there can be no public announcement until there is a project; and there can be no project until the local governing body approves a redevelopment plan, a document which cannot be formulated without time-consuming, extensive, detailed study. Thus, in the chronology of the urban renewal process, the General Assembly has implicitly selected the time when the governing body approves the concept as the date before which the authority may not be charged with a delay which will invoke the principle of condemnation blight; this is when public announcement by the condemnor is deemed to have taken place.

Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Housing Auth., 1 95 Va. 326, 78 S.E.2d 893, 1953 Va. LEXIS 203 (1953) (see also Runnels v. Staunton Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 207 Va. 407, 149 S.E.2d 882 (1966)). Judicial review.  The legislative declaration that the taking of property for stated redevelopment purposes constitutes a public use is not conclusive and is subject to judicial re view. But such declaration is presumed to be right. Hunter v. Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Housing Auth., 195 Va. 326, 78 S.E.2d 893, 1953 Va. LEXIS 203 (1953) (see Bristol Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Denton, 198 Va. 171, 93 S.E.2d 288 (1956)). Burden on property owners to show finding was arbitrary and unwarranted.  It is incumbent upon property owners to show by competent evidence that a redevelopment authoritys finding of blight was arbitrary and unwarranted. The proper ty owners burden cannot be sustained by the ordinary preponderance of the evidence. Runnels v. Staunton Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 207 Va. 407, 149 S.E.2d 882, 1966 Va. LEXIS 236 (1966). Re development plan may contain anticompetitive measures.  The state legislature expressly stated that the problems of urban blight required governmental action. Thus, the state concluded that private enterprise alone cou ld not solve the problem. Accordingly, the state gave housing and redevelopment authorities and cities vast powers to acquire land, clear it, determine appropriate land use for different parcels, impose conditions and limitations under which property may be redeveloped by public or private enterprise, and generally plan the redevelopment of an entire area. Clearly the legislature contemplated that the redevelopment plan would contain anticompetitive measures similar to the challenged blackout ag reement. The legislature must have contemplated that the city would try to encourage private developers to invest heavily in redevelopment and that as part of that encouragement the city would agree not to aid in building competing structures.

Thus, the challenged blackout agreement and the citys alleged refusal to cooperate with the plaintiffs is a form of limited protection from com petition that the legislature must have contemplated when it authorized the city to become involved in redevelopment projects.

Acquire real property where the condition of the title, the diverse ownership of the real property to be assembled, the street or lot layouts, or other conditions prevent a proper deve lopment of the property and where the acquisition of the area by the authority is necessary to carry out a redevelopment plan; 4. Permit the preservation, repair, or restoration of buildings of historic interest; and to clear any areas acquired and install, construct, or reconstruct streets, utilities, and site i mprovements essential to the preparation of sites for uses in accordance with the redevelopment plan; 5. Provide for the conservation of portions of the project area and the rehabilitation to project standards as stated in the redevelopment plan of buildings within the project area, where such rehabilitation is deemed by the authority to be feasible and consistent with project objectives; 6. Make land so acquired available to nongovernmental persons or entities or public agencies (including sale, leasing, or retention by the authority itself) in accordance with the redevel opment plan; 7.

In order for an area to qualify as blighted or deteriorated, not only must the b uildings and improvements therein be in the specified physical condition, but, by reason of such condition, the area must be detrimental to the safety, health, morals or welfare of the community. Bristol Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Den ton, 198 Va. 171, 93 S.E.2d 288, 1956 Va. LEXIS 188 (1956). Inclusion of pro perty which is not itself blighted.  An authority may, for the stated purpose, incidentally include in the project property which is not itself necessarily blighted or deteriorated. But this does not alter the requirement that when such incidental part is included the area as a whole must be blighted or deteriorated. Bristol Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Denton, 198 Va. 171, 93 S.E.2d 288, 1956 Va. LEXIS 188 (1956). Property within a slum area may be condemned though not itself slum property. The statut e is designed to eradicate slum or blighted areas. Consequently, if an area as a whole is subject to rehabilitation the condition of a single structure is immaterial. Hunter v. Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Housing Auth., 195 Va. 326, 78 S.E.2d 893, 19 53 Va. LEXIS 203 (1953). Change of name of authority.  Any doubt as to the sufficiency of a resolution creating the Norfolk Housing Authority because the name was subsequently changed to Norfolk Redevelopm ent and Housing Authority was removed by the validating provisions of this section. Hunter v. Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Housing Auth., 195 Va. 326, 78 S.E.2d 893, 1953 Va. LEXIS 203 (1953). An environmental impact statement is not required by Va. Const., Art.

Area held blighted or deteriorated.  Where there was evidence that a majority of all the buildings, residential and nonresidential, within the project area sought by Housing Authority in condemnation proceeding were dilapidated, and in addition, there was evidence that most of the remaining buildings, the streets, and a large section of the undeveloped areas were adversely affected by periodic flooding and other blighting factors, this evidence supp orts the determination by the Authority and the finding of the trial court that the project area was blighted or deteriorated within the meaning of this section.

Explicit a uthority to act as landlord of shopping mall.  The housing authority had in fact been granted the explicit power to act as a landlord in connection with a commercial retail establishment such as the mall shopp ing center. This section on its face grants housing and redevelopment authorities the specific powers to make land acquired available to private enterprise or public agencies in accordance with the redevelopment plan.

Dists. v. HUD, 932 F. Supp. 730, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8308 (E.D. Va. 1996). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS City has power to require approval of blighted propertys color scheme.  Power of a city over property of historical interest in blighted areas under §§ 36-49 and 36-49.1:1 and under Alexandria, Va., City Charter § 2.04.2(b) i ncluded the authority to modify the spot blight abatement plan for an owners house included in a spot blight abatement program and located in a historical district to require approval by the city department of planning and zoning of the historical ap propriateness of the houses color scheme. Hoy v. City of Alexandria, 70 Va. Cir. 79, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 306 (Alexandria Nov. 2, 2005). Area held blighted or deteriorated.  As the party challenging the findings of fact of a housing authority, the limited liability company carried the burden of proving its claims by clear and convinci ng evidence and it did not carry that burden; the law put the decision of whether an area qualified for redevelopment in the hands of the redevelopment and housing authority, not the City and given its ultimate financial stake in supporting any redevelop ment project, the City had a proper role in discussions and meetings about the project as the evaluation process was underway, accordingly its participation in the process alone did not taint the plan. Evidence existed that, if believed, justified a find ing that the majority of the properties that were ultimately included in the plan area actually suffered from blight and this condition drove and shaped the parameters of the plan; there was not clear and convincing proof that the facts found by the auth ority were invalid or that the plans adoption was arbitrary or capricious.

CASE NOTES Acquirin g property through condemnation proceedings.  Section 36-49.2 merely expanded the means by which a redevelopment authority could acquire property, so it did not specifically prohibit the use of condemnation p roceedings to acquire property that would be used in an industrial site because the phrase without the exercise of the power of eminent domain, taken in context, was consistent with a grant of power to acquire property by lease or purchase for ce rtain uses, while restricting the use of eminent domain to those circumstances in which a property satisfied one of the criteria in § 36-50.1.Norfolk Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. C &amp; C Real Estate, Inc., 272 Va. 2, 630 S.E.2d 505, 2006 Va. LEXIS 59 (2006). Power of redevelopment authority.  When a redevelopment authoritys conservation plan allowed it to acquire, without prior notice to correct a propertys blighted condition, properties that appear infeasible of rehabilitation or their land use is inconsistent with the purposes and objectives of the conservation plan, this impermissibly gave the authority broader power than that conferred by clause (iv) of § 36-50.1, which allowed such acquisition without notice if properties are infeasible of rehabilitation  so as to inhibit or prevent accomplishment of the purposes of the plan, so this part of the plan could not be used as a basis for initiating condemnation proceed ings regarding property whose owner did not receive notice to correct its propertys deficiency.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Authority to take property by eminent domain.  By using language broader than that allowed in § 36-50.1, the Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA) went beyond the scope of its statutory authori ty with the Mid-Town Industrial Conservation Plan as it applied to taking of certain property by eminent domain; the code allowed the NRHA to condemn properties which are infeasible of rehabilitation, not properties which appear infeasible of rehabilitation as stated in the Conservation Plan.

An authorit y shall not implement any redevelopment plan under this law until the governing body of the locality has approved the redevelopment plan, which provides an outline for the development or redevelopment of the redevelopment area and is sufficiently complet e to indicate (i) its relationship to definite local objectives as to appropriate land uses and improved traffic, public transportation, public utilities, recreational and community facilities and other public improvements; (ii) proposed land uses and bu ilding requirements in the redevelopment area; (iii) the land in the redevelopment area that the authority does not intend to acquire; (iv) the land in the redevelopment area that will be made available after acquisition to nongovernmental persons or ent ities for redevelopment and that land which will be made available after acquisition to public enterprise for redevelopment; (v) anticipated funding sources that may be sufficient to acquire all property designated for acquisition within five years of th e localitys approval; and (vi) the method for the temporary relocation of persons living in the redevelopment areas; and also the method for providing (unless already available) decent, safe and sanitary dwellings in the locality substantially equal in number to the number of substandard dwellings to be cleared from the redevelopment area, at rents within the financial reach of the income groups displaced from such substandard dwellings. Any locality is hereby authorized to approve redevelopment pla ns through their governing body or agency designated for that purpose. B. No sooner t han thirty months or later than thirty-six months following the date of the localitys approval of the redevelopment plan (hereinafter called the approval date), the locality shall review and determine by resolution whether to reaffirm the red evelopment plan. Where the locality fails to reaffirm the redevelopment plan, any real property within the redevelopment area that has not been acquired by the authority, or for which a petition in condemnation has not been filed by the authority, prior to the date of adoption of such resolution by the locality (hereinafter called the termination date) shall no longer be eligible for acquisition by the authority unless the authority and the property owner mutually agree to the acquisition, in wh ich case the authority shall be specifically empowered to acquire the property. For purposes of this section, a mediation request submitted by either the authority or the property owner, in accordance with § 36-27, prior to the termination date shall preserve the authoritys right to file a petition in condemnation relating to such real property for a period of six months after the termination date. C. Where the l ocality reaffirms the redevelopment plan, the authority shall continue to be authorized to acquire real property within the redevelopment area by purchase, or through the institution of eminent domain proceedings in accordance with § 36-27, until the fifth anniversary of the approval date. Any real property within the redevelopment area that has not been acquired by the authority, or for which a petition in condemnation has not been filed by the authority, prior to the fifth anniversary of the approv al date, shall no longer be eligible for acquisition by the authority unless the authority and the property owner mutually agree to the acquisition, in which case the authority shall be specifically empowered to acquire the property. For purposes of this section, a mediation request submitted by either the authority or the property owner, in accordance with § 36-27, prior to the fifth anniversary of the approval date, shall preserve the authoritys right to file a petition in condemnation relating to the real property for a period of six months after the fifth anniversary of the approval date. D. Notwithstan ding the provisions of this section, a locality shall not be precluded from adopting a new redevelopment plan, in accordance with this section, which designates a redevelopment area that includes real property that was previously included within a redeve lopment area under a previously adopted redevelopment plan. E. If the auth ority decides against acquiring real property designated for acquisition under an approved redevelopment plan after having made a written purchase offer to the owner of the property, it shall, upon the written request of the property owner given no later than one year after the date of written notice from the authority to the property owner of its decision not to acquire his property, reimburse the owner of the property his reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition of his property. Reasonable expenses shall include, but are not limited to, reasonable fees of attorneys and appraisers or other experts necessary to establish the value of the property to be appraised.

CASE NOTES This section and § 36-27 read toget her.  The question of when within the meaning of § 36-27 does the public announcement of the project take place is answered by referring to this sect ion, and reading this section together with § 36-27. Pearsall v. Richmond Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 218 Va. 892, 242 S.E.2d 228, 1978 Va. LEXIS 244 (1978). When public announcement by condemnor under § 36-27 takes place.  Reading § 36-27 and this section together, there may be no unreasonable delay resulting from a contemplated urban renewal procedure until there has been a  public announcement; there can be no public announcement until there is a project; and there can be no project until the local governing body approves a redevelopment plan, a document which cannot be formulated without time-consuming, extensive, detailed study. Thus, in the chronology of the urban renewal process, the General Assembly has implicitly selected the time when the governing body approves the concept as the date before which the authority may not be charged with a delay which will invoke the principle of condemnation blight; this is when public announcement by the condemnor is deemed to have taken place. Pearsall v. Richmond Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth., 218 Va. 892, 242 S.E.2d 228, 1978 Va. LEXIS 2 44 (1978). Relationship of plan to co mmunity interests.  Clause (i) of subsection A of this section does not require that a redevelopment plan relate to all the community interests listed in that clause. It requires tha t a plan indicate any relationship it may have to the enumerated community interests. By failing to refer to recreational facilities and certain other community interests enumerated in clause (i), the plan indicates that it has no relationship to such co mmunity interests. Runnels v.

Text Whenever the governing body of any city of more than 300,000 population has approved an area for survey and planning preliminary to the adoption of a redevelopment or c onservation plan, and the area includes property within such county, city or town duly designated by said governing body for educational, medical center or municipal uses, an authority may acquire such property by deed or by eminent domain. History History. 1968, c. 710. § 36-52.3. Adoption and designation of rehabilitation area. Text A. Whenever it appears to the governing body of any locality that a portion of such locality adjacent to an area embraced in a conservation plan, approved by such body pursuant to § 36-49.1, is in the early stages of deterioration and determines that if not rehabilitated such area is likely to continue to deteriorate and become eligible for designation as a conservation area, such governing body may create a rehabilitation area. B. No rehabili tation area shall be effective until notice has been sent to the property owner or owners of record in such area in accordance with subsection B of § 36-27 and an ordinance approving such rehabilitation area has been adopted by the local governing bod y. The ordinance shall outline specific boundaries for the rehabilitation area, establish that the rehabilitation area is adjacent to a conservation area and include such properties as are in need of rehabilitation in such area. C. An authorit y is specifically empowered to encourage and assist property owners or occupants within the rehabilitation area so designated to improve their respective holdings, by suggesting improved standards for design, construction, maintenance, renovation and use of such properties and offering encouragement or assistance in other ways including the power to lend money and make grants to said owners or occupants, directed toward prevention and elimination of deteriorating conditions within such area. D. In executin g the powers provided in subsection C, an authority shall have all of the rights, powers and immunities granted in connection with conservation or redevelopment plans pursuant to this chapter except the power to acquire property through the exercise of t he power of eminent domain.

To assure that land acquired in a conservation or redevelopment area is used in accordance with the conservation or redevelopment plan, an authority, upon the sale or l ease of such land, shall obligate purchasers or lessees: (1) to use the land for the purpose designated in the conservation or redevelopment plan; (2) to begin the building of their improvements within a period of time which the authority fixes as reason able; and (3) to comply with such other conditions as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  The provision of this section empowering an authority to make land in a redevelopment project available for use by private enterprise does not render this article unconstitutional; such power of the authority does not defeat the public use which occasions the taking of the property, because making such property available to private enterprise is merely incidental to the main purpose of the authori ty and is reasonably designed to prevent recurrence of the conditions producing slums.

For survey on construction law in Virginia for 1989, see 23 U. Rich. L. Rev. 541 (1989). § 36-55.25. Finding and declaration of necessity. Text It is hereby declared: (i) that there exists within the Commonwealth a serious shortage of sanitary and safe residential housing at prices or rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford; that this shortage has contributed to and will contribute to the creation and persistence of substandard living conditions and is inimical to the health, welfare and prosperity of the residents of the Commo nwealth; (ii) that it is imperative that the supply of residential housing for such persons and families and for persons and families displaced by public actions or natural disaster be increased; (iii) that private enterprise and investment have been una ble, without assistance, to produce the needed construction or rehabilitation of sanitary and safe residential housing at prices or rentals which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford and to provide sufficient long-term mortgage fina ncing for residential housing for occupancy by such persons and families; (iv) that a concentration of persons and families of low and moderate income even in standard structures does not eliminate undesirable social conditions; (v) that the governing bo dy of a city or county may in its discretion determine that it is necessary to the preservation of the financial viability of such city or county and the health, welfare and prosperity of its residents that the population of such city or county be mainta ined as economically mixed by providing housing for persons and families of other than low and moderate income in order to broaden the tax bases of such areas; (vi) that in providing sanitary and safe residential housing at prices or rentals which person s and families of low and moderate income can afford it may at times be necessary or desirable to provide housing for persons and families of other than low and moderate income; (vii) that it is critical to the success, prosperity and viability of areas being revitalized that financing be made available for nonhousing buildings that are incidental to residential housing for low and moderate income persons and families and other persons and families in order to provide products and services to those livi ng in residential housing or that are necessary or appropriate for the revitalization of such areas or for the industrial, commercial or other economic development of such areas; (viii) that the financing of residential housing for low and moderate incom e persons and families and other persons and families may be appropriate to promote the industrial, commercial or other economic development of certain areas in a city or the county by inducing manufacturing, industrial, commercial, governmental, educati onal, entertainment, community development, healthcare or nonprofit enterprises or undertakings to locate or remain in such area; and (ix) that private enterprise and investment be encouraged both to sponsor land development and build and rehabilitate re sidential housing for such persons and families of low and moderate income and to build housing which will prevent the recurrence of slum conditions by housing persons of varied economic means in the same projects or area, and that private financing be s upplemented by financing as provided in this chapter in order to help prevent the creation and recurrence of substandard living conditions and to assist in their permanent elimination throughout Virginia. It is further declared that in order to provide a fully adequate supply of sanitary and safe dwelling accommodations at rents, prices, or other costs which such persons or families can afford and to stabilize or recover an appropriate economic mix in certain areas of the Commonwealth the legislature finds that it is necessary to create and establish a state housing development authority for the purpose of encouraging t he investment of private capital and stimulating the construction and rehabilitation of residential housing to meet the needs of such persons and families or to stabilize such areas through the use of public financing, to provide construction and mortgag e loans and to make provision for the purchase of mortgage loans and otherwise.

It is the p olicy of the Commonwealth of Virginia to provide for fair housing throughout the Commonwealth, to all its citizens, regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, elderliness, familial status, source of funds, sexual orientation, gender ident ity, military status, or disability, and to that end to prohibit discriminatory practices with respect to residential housing by any person or group of persons, in order that the peace, health, safety, prosperity, and general welfare of all the inhabitan ts of the Commonwealth may be protected and ensured. This law shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the Commonwealth of Virginia for the protection of the people of the Commonwealth.

CASE NOTES Former Chapter 5 (§ 36-86 et seq.) and the Mobile Home Lot Rental Act, § 55-248.41 et seq., complement each other and are in no way conflicting. Hudler v. Cole, 236 Va. 389, 374 S.E.2d 39, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1002, 1988 Va. LEXIS 160 (1988) (decided under former § 36-86). Former Chapter 5 (§ 36-86 et seq.) forbids a wide variety of discriminatory practices which impede the sale or rental of dwellings to initial prospecti ve purchasers or tenants, while the anti-discrimination provisions contained in the Mobile Home Lot Rental Act, § 55-248.41 et seq., address the situation of an existing tenant in a mobile home park who wishes to sell to a third person the mobile home he owns and occupies. Hudler v. Cole, 236 Va. 389, 374 S.E.2d 39, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1002, 1988 Va. LEXIS 160 (1988) (decided under former § 36-86). Applicability to mobile home park.  The Virginia Fair Housing Law applies to the rental of space in a mobile home park. Hudler v. Cole, 236 Va. 389, 374 S.E.2d 39, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1002, 1988 Va. LEXI S 160 (1988) (decided under former § 36-86). Ordinance was valid under Dillons Rule since the court found implied power for count y to create a private cause of action; the countys provision for a private cause of action to redress discrimination was in accordance with the policies set forth in former subsection (a) (now subsection B), was in accordance with the provisions of t he Virginia Fair Housing Law, and was also an exercise of police power. Bradley v. Carydale Enters., 730 F. Supp. 709, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16688 (E.D. Va. 1989) (decided under former § 36-87). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Tenant not required to plead facts sufficient to defeat exemption.  Tenant was not required to plead facts sufficient to defeat the exemptions to the Virginia Fair Housing Act and the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act, subsectio n A of § 36-96.2 and 42 U.S.C.S. § 3603(b)(1) because many victims of discrimination likely would not know or have any readily available way of determining whether a private individual landlord owned more than three single-family homes, but an indi vidual defendant would immediately know whether he or she fell within the exemption to the state and federal acts and could easily assert such a defense at a comparatively small cost; it strains logic and reason that exemptions to a statute had to be aff irmatively negated in a complaint. Hughes v. Bransfield, 84 Va. Cir. 214, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 11 (Fairfax County Jan. 11, 2012). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Discrimination.  Although it is not settled whether sex categorically includes gender identity or sexual orientation in Virginias anti-discrimination s tatutes, in many circumstances discriminatory conduct against LGBT Virginians is already prohibited by those statutes bans on sex-based discrimination. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas A. Garrett Jr., Member, Senate of Virginia ; The Honorable Kenneth R. Plum, Member, House of Delegates; and The Honorable Dave A.

See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable William J. Howell, Speaker, House of Delegates, 07-009, 2007 Va. AG LEXIS 14 (6/7/07). Regulations enforceable.  Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code regulations, which incorporate copyrighted model codes by reference, represent enforceable law. See opinion of Attorney G eneral to The Honorable William G. Petty, Commonwealths Attorney for the City of Lynchburg, 03-125, 2004 Va. AG LEXIS 12 (2/23/04). Retrofitti ng of existing buildings not necessitated.  When a locality, acting pursuant to § 15.2-922, adopts an ordinance to require installation of smoke detectors in any building containing one or more dwell ing units, that enactment does not necessitate the retrofitting with smoke detectors of existing buildings containing dwelling units. At such time as smoke detectors may be installed in any building containing dwelling units, the installation must co mply with the then-current provisions of the Uniform Statewide Building Code. To remain in compliance with the ordinance, once the smoke detectors are initially installed, the terms of the Uniform Statewide Building Code govern the maintenance or replace ment of the smoke detectors.

The Buildin g Code shall prescribe building regulations to be complied with in the construction and rehabilitation of buildings and structures, and the equipment therein as defined in § 36-97, and shall prescribe regulations to ensure that such buildings and stru ctures are properly maintained, and shall also prescribe procedures for the administration and enforcement of such regulations, including procedures to be used by the local building department in the evaluation and granting of modifications for any provi sion of the Building Code, provided the spirit and functional intent of the Building Code are observed and public health, welfare and safety are assured. The provisions of the Building Code and modifications thereof shall be such as to protect the health , safety and welfare of the residents of the Commonwealth, provided that buildings and structures should be permitted to be constructed, rehabilitated and maintained at the least possible cost consistent with recognized standards of health, safety, energ y conservation and water conservation, including provisions necessary to prevent overcrowding, rodent or insect infestation, and garbage accumulation; and barrier-free provisions for the physically handicapped and aged. Such regulations shall be reasonab le and appropriate to the objectives of this chapter. B. In formulat ing the Code provisions, the Board shall have due regard for generally accepted standards as recommended by nationally recognized organizations, including, but not limited to, the standards of the International Code Council and the National Fire Protecti on Association. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, farm buildings and structures shall be exempt from the provisions of the Building Code, except for a building or a portion of a building located on a farm that is operated as a restaurant as defined in § 35.1-1 and licensed as such by the Board of Health pursuant to Chapter 2 (§ 35.1-11 et seq.) of Title 35.1. However, farm buildings and structures lying within a flood plain or in a mudslide-prone area shall be subject to flood-proofi ng regulations or mudslide regulations, as applicable. C. Where pract ical, the Code provisions shall be stated in terms of required level of performance, so as to facilitate the prompt acceptance of new building materials and methods. When generally recognized standards of performance are not available, such provisions sh all provide for acceptance of materials and methods whose performance has been found by the local building department, on the basis of reliable test and evaluation data, presented by the proponent, to be substantially equal in safety to those specified. D. The Board, upon a finding that sufficient allegations exist regarding failures noted in several localities of performance standards by either building materials, methods, or design, may conduct hearings on such allegations if it determines that such alleged failure s, if proven, would have an adverse impact on the health, safety, or welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth. After at least 21 days written notice, the Board shall convene a hearing to consider such allegations. Such notice shall be given to the known manufacturers of the subject building material and as many other interested parties, industry representatives, and trade groups as can reasonably be identified. Following the hearing, the Board, upon finding that (i) the current technical or admin istrative Code provisions allow use of or result in defective or deficient building materials, methods, or designs, and (ii) immediate action is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the Commonwealth, may issue amended r egulations establishing interim performance standards and Code provisions for the installation, application, and use of such building materials, methods or designs in the Commonwealth. Such amended regulations shall become effective upon their publicatio n in the Virginia Register of Regulations. Any amendments to regulations adopted pursuant to this subsection shall become effective upon their publication in the Virginia Register of Regulations and shall be effective for a period of 24 months or until a dopted, modified, or repealed by the Board.

That upon each publication by the International Code Council of a new version of the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), the Board of Housi ng and Community Development (the Board) shall consider adopting amendments to the Uniform Statewide Building Code (Building Code) to address changes in the IECC relating to energy efficiency and conservation. In doing so, the Board shall consider adopti ng Building Code standards that are at least as stringent as those contained in the new version of the IECC. For the purposes of this act, a standard shall be deemed to be as stringent as one contained in the IECC if such standard would perform the same function as that contained in the IECC without using more energy than would be used under the IECC standard. In conducting its review, the Board shall assess the public health, safety, and welfare benefits of adopting standards that are at least as strin gent as those contained in the IECC, including potential energy savings and air quality benefits over time compared to the cost of initial construction. The 1998 amendment, in subsection B, added the second and third sentences.

CASE NOTES Purposes of Building Code.  One of the important purposes of the Building Code is to provide for the safety of ultimate construction. Another important purpose is to enhance the safety of th ose working on the project and, indeed, the safety of the project itself. The dominant purpose, therefore, is to provide comprehensive protection of the public health and safety. VEPCO v. Savoy Constr. Co., 224 Va. 36, 294 S.E.2d 811, 1982 Va. LEXIS 269 (1982). Building Code broadly construed.  Although a penal statute must be strictly construed and violation of the Building Code may result in criminal sanctions, the Building Code must be construed broad ly enough to give substantial effect to the manifest legislative purpose of enhancing the safety of project and those working on it, without disregarding its penal effects. VEPCO v. Savoy Constr. Co., 224 Va. 36, 294 S.E.2d 811, 1982 Va. LEXIS 269 (1982) . Compliance w ith Building Code while work in progress.  There must be compliance with the Building Code not only when work is performed but also when work required by the Building Code should be done to safeguard perso ns and property. Compliance only upon completion of the entire project in many instances may be sufficient, but earlier compliance is necessary where danger may arise from delay in the performance of required work.

Interpretation of Virgin ia Maintenance Code.  Circuit court did not err in affirming the State Building Code Technical Review Boards interpretation of the Virginia Maintenance Code (VMC) because Review Bo ard could fairly conclude the VMC required rental property owners to maintain an operable heating facility since without the ability to provide adequate heat to the buildings residents, the property met the definition of unfit for human occupancy and that the VMC required electrical equipment be maintained in working condition.

However, the Board may adopt and promulgate as part of the Building Code, build ing regulations that facilitate the maintenance, rehabilitation, development and reuse of existing buildings at the least possible cost to ensure the protection of the public health, safety and welfare. Subsequent reconstruction, renovation, repair or de molition of such buildings or structures shall be subject to the pertinent construction and rehabilitation provisions of the Building Code. The provisions of this section shall be applicable to equipment. However, building owners may elect to install par tial or full fire alarms or other safety equipment that was not required by the Building Code in effect at the time a building was constructed without meeting current Building Code requirements, provided the installation does not create a hazardous condi tion. Permits for installation shall be obtained in accordance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code. History History. 1972, c. 829; 1976, c. 638; 1982, c. 267; 1986, c. 32; 2002, c. 5 55; 2003, c. 650.

Enforcement generally. Enforcement of the provisions of the Building Code for construction and rehabilitation shall be the responsibility of the local building department. There shall be established within each local building department a local board of Building Co de appeals whose composition, duties and responsibilities shall be prescribed in the Building Code. Any person aggrieved by the local building departments application of the Building Code or refusal to grant a modification to the provisions of the Bu ilding Code may appeal to the local board of Building Code appeals. No appeal to the State Building Code Technical Review Board shall lie prior to a final determination by the local board of Building Code appeals. Whenever a county or a municipality does not have such a building department or board of Building Code appeals, the local governing body shall enter into an agreement with the local governing body of another county or municipality or with some other agency, or a state agency approved by the De partment for such enforcement and appeals resulting therefrom.For the purposes of this section, towns with a population of less than 3,500 may elect to administer and enforce the Building Code; however, where the town does not elect to administer and enf orce the Building Code, the county in which the town is situated shall administer and enforce the Building Code for the town. In the event that such town is situated in two or more counties, those counties shall administer and enforce the Building Code f or that portion of the town situated within their respective boundaries. Additionally, the local governing body of a county or municipality may enter into an agreement with the governing body of another county or municipality for the provision to such co unty or municipalitys local building department of technical assistance with administration and enforcement of the Building Code. B. New constru ction. Any building or structure may be inspected at any time before completion, and shall not be deemed in compliance until approved by the inspecting authority. Where the construction cost is less than $2,500, however, the inspection may, in the discre tion of the inspecting authority, be waived. A building official may issue an annual permit for any construction regulated by the Building Code. The building official shall coordinate all reports of inspections for compliance with the Building Code, with inspections of fire and health officials delegated such authority, prior to issuance of an occupancy permit. Fees may be levied by the local governing body in order to defray the cost of such enforcement and appeals. With the exception of the levy impos ed pursuant to § 36-137, any fees levied pursuant to this subsection shall be used only to support the functions of the local building department. C. Existing bu ildings and structures. 1. Inspe ctions and enforcement of the Building Code. The local governing body may also inspect and enforce the provisions of the Building Code for existing buildings and structures, whether occupied or not. Such inspection and enforcement shall be carried out by an agency or department designated by the local governing body. 2. Complaints by tenants. However, upon a finding by the local building department, following a complaint by a tenant of a residential dwelling unit that is the subject of such complaint, that there may be a violation of the unsafe structures provisions of the Building Code, the local building department shall enforce such provisions. 3. Inspection warrants. If the local building department receives a complaint that a violation of the Building Code exists that is an immediate and imminent threat to the health or safety of the owner, tenant, or occupants of any building or structure, or the owner, occupant, or tenant of any nearby building or structure, and the owner, occupant, or tenant of the building or structure that is the subject of the complaint has refused to a llow the local building official or his agent to have access to the subject building or structure, the local building official or his agent may make an affidavit under oath before a magistrate or a court of competent jurisdiction and request that the mag istrate or court grant the local building official or his agent an inspection warrant to enable the building official or his agent to enter the subject building or structure for the purpose of determining whether violations of the Building Code exist. Af ter issuing a warrant under this section, the magistrate or judge shall file the affidavit in the manner prescribed by § 19.2-54. After executing the warrant, the local building official or his agents shall return the warrant to the clerk of the circu it court of the city or county wherein the inspection was made. The local building official or his agent shall make a reasonable effort to obtain consent from the owner, occupant, or tenant of the subject building or structure prior to seeking the issuan ce of an inspection warrant under this section. 4. Transfer of ownership. If the local building department has initiated an enforcement action against the owner of a building or structure and such owner subsequently transfers the owner ship of the building or structure to an entity in which the owner holds an ownership interest greater than 50 percent, the pending enforcement action shall continue to be enforced against the owner. 5. Elevator, escalator, or related conveyance inspections. The local governing body shall, however, inspect and enforce the Building Code for elevators, escalators, or related conveyances , except for elevators in single- and two-family homes and townhouses. Such inspection shall be carried out by an agency or department designated by the local governing body. 6. A locality may require by ordinance that any landmark, building or structure that contributes to a district delineated pursuant to § 15.2-2306 shall not be razed, demolished or move d until the razing, demolition or moving thereof is approved by the review board, or, on appeal, by the governing body after consultation with the review board unless the local maintenance code official consistent with the Uniform Statewide Building Code , Part III Maintenance, determines that it constitutes such a hazard that it shall be razed, demolished or moved.For the purpose of this subdivision, a contributing landmark, building or structure is one that adds to or is consistent with the historic or architectural qualities, historic associations, or values for which the district was established pursuant to § 15.2-2306, because it (i) was present during the period of significance, (ii) relates to the documented significance of the district, and ( iii) possesses historic integrity or is capable of yielding important information about the period. 7. Fees may be levied by the local governing body in order to defray the cost of such enforcement and appeals. For purposes of this section, defray the cost may include the fair a nd reasonable costs incurred for such enforcement during normal business hours, but shall not include overtime costs unless conducted outside of the normal working hours established by the locality. A schedule of such costs shall be adopted by the local governing body in a local ordinance. A locality shall not charge an overtime rate for inspections conducted during the normal business hours established by the locality. With the exception of the levy imposed pursuant to § 36-137, any fees levied purs uant to this subdivision shall be used only to support the functions of the local building department. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit a private entity from conducting such inspections, provided the private entity has been approved to perfo rm such inspections in accordance with the written policy of the maintenance code official for the locality. D. Issuance of permits. 1. Fees may be levied by the local governing body to be paid by the applicant for the issuance of a building permit as otherwise provided under this chapter; however, notwithstanding any provision of law, general or special, if the applicant for a building permi t is a tenant or the owner of an easement on the owners property, such applicant shall not be denied a permit under the Building Code solely upon the basis that the property owner has financial obligations to the locality that constitute a lien on su ch property in favor of the locality. If such applicant is the property owner, in addition to payment of the fees for issuance of a building permit, the locality may require full payment of any and all financial obligations of the property owner to the l ocality to satisfy such lien prior to issuance of such permit. For purposes of this subdivision, property owner means the owner of such property as reflected in the land records of the circuit court clerk where the property is located, the owner s agent, or any entity in which the owner holds an ownership interest greater than 50 percent. 2. In the event that a local building department denies an application for the issuance of a building permit, the local building department shall provide to the applicant a written explan ation detailing the reasons for which the application was denied. The applicant may submit a revised application addressing the reasons for which the application was previously denied, and if the applicant does so, the local building department shall be encouraged, but not required, to limit its review of the revised application to only those portions of the application that were previously deemed inadequate and that the applicant has revised.

Provided, however, that the provision for confinement in jail shall not be applicable to any person, firm, or corporation, when such violation involves a multiple-family dwelling unit. Any person convicted of a second offense committed within a period of five to 10 years of a first offense under this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $2,500. Any person convicted of a third or subsequent offe nse involving the same property, committed within 10 years of an offense under this chapter after having been at least twice previously convicted, shall be punished by confinement in jail for not more than 10 days and a fine of not less than $2,500 nor m ore than $5,000, either or both. No portion of the fine imposed for such third or subsequent offense committed within 10 years of an offense under this chapter shall be suspended. C. Any localit y may adopt an ordinance which establishes a uniform schedule of civil penalties for violations of specified provisions of the Code which are not abated, or otherwise remedied through hazard control, promptly after receipt of notice of violation from the local enforcement officer.This schedule of civil penalties shall be uniform for each type of specified violation, and the penalty for any one violation shall be a civil penalty of not more than $100 for the initial summons and not more than $350 for eac h additional summons. Each day during which the violation is found to have existed shall constitute a separate offense. However, specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not be charged more frequently than once in any 10-da y period, and a series of specified violations arising from the same operative set of facts shall not result in civil penalties which exceed a total of $4,000. Designation of a particular Code violation for a civil penalty pursuant to this section shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions, and except for any violation resulting in injury to persons, such designation shall preclude the prosecution of a violation as a misdemeanor.Any person summoned or issued a ticket for a scheduled violation may make an ap pearance in person or in writing by mail to the department of finance or the treasurer of the locality prior to the date fixed for trial in court. Any person so appearing may enter a waiver of trial, admit liability, and pay the civil penalty established for the offense charged. Such persons shall be informed of their right to stand trial and that a signature to an admission of liability will have the same force and effect as a judgment of court. As a condition of waiver of trial, admission of liability , and payment of a civil penalty, the violator and a representative of the locality shall agree in writing to terms of abatement or remediation of the violation within six months after the date of payment of the civil penalty.If a person charged with a s cheduled violation does not elect to enter a waiver of trial and admit liability, the violation shall be tried in the general district court in the same manner and with the same right of appeal as provided for by law. In any trial for a scheduled violati on authorized by this section, it shall be the burden of the locality to show the liability of the violator by a preponderance of the evidence. An admission of liability or finding of liability shall not be a criminal conviction for any purpose.If the vi olation concerns a residential unit, and if the violation remains uncorrected at the time of assessment of the civil penalty, the court shall order the violator to abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation in order to comply with t he Code. Except as otherwise provided by the court for good cause shown, any such violator shall abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation within six months of the date of the assessment of the civil penalty.If the violation concer ns a nonresidential building or structure, and if the violation remains uncorrected at the time of assessment of the civil penalty, the court may order the violator to abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation in order to comply wi th the Code. Any such violator so ordered shall abate, or otherwise remedy through hazard control, the violation within the time specified by the court. D. Any owner o r any other person, firm or corporation violating any Code provisions relating to lead hazard controls that poses a hazard to the health of pregnant women and children under the age of six years who occupy the premises shall, upon conviction, be guilty o f a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine of not more than $2,500. If the court convicts pursuant to this subsection and sets a time by which such hazard must be controlled, each day the hazard remains uncontrolled after the time set for the lead ha zard control has expired shall constitute a separate violation of the Uniform Statewide Building Code.The landlord shall maintain the painted surfaces of the dwelling unit in compliance with the International Property Maintenance Code of the Uniform Stat ewide Building Code. The landlords failure to do so shall be enforceable in accordance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code and shall entitle the tenant to terminate the rental agreement.Termination of the rental agreement or any other action in retaliation against the tenant after written notification of (i) a lead hazard in the dwelling unit or (ii) that a child of the tenant, who is an authorized occupant in the dwelling unit, has an elevated blood lead level, shall constitute retaliatory con duct in violation of § 55.1-1258. E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a local enforcement officer from issuing a summons or a ticket for violation of any Code provision to the lessor or sublessor of a residential dwelling unit, provided a copy of the notice is served on the owner . F. Any prosecu tion under this section shall be commenced within the period provided for in § 19.2-8.
