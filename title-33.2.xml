Evidence held not sufficient to make out a prima facie case under this section. Stanley v . Mullins, 187 Va. 193, 45 S.E.2d 881, 1948 Va. LEXIS 211 (1948). Evidence held sufficient under this section. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Faris, 156 Va. 205, 157 S.E. 819, 1931 Va. LEXIS 188 (1931). Evidence as to wid th of easement for road purposes.  The evidence, aided by the presumption of this section as to width, was held to show that the extent of the easement claimed by the Commonwealth was limited to 30 feet. City of Danville v. Anderson, 189 Va. 662, 53 S.E.2d 793, 1949 Va. LEXIS 209 (1949). Form al acceptance required for dedication of public road.  Although acceptance may be implied in urban areas, a formal acceptance or express assertion of dominion over the road by public authority is required before dedic ation of a rural road is complete. Burks Bros. v. Jones, 232 Va. 238, 349 S.E.2d 134, 3 Va. Law Rep. 969, 1986 Va. LEXIS 251 (1986). Finding that the purchaser did not have a legal right to access property that he owned was appropriate, in part because a public body did not accept an offer to d edicate the roadway and the purchaser failed to prove the requisite formal acceptance or express assertion of dominion over the road by public authority. Therefore, the supreme court did not need to address whether there was an offer to dedicate the road way. Mulford v. Walnut Hill Farm Group, LLC, 282 Va. 98, 712 S.E.2d 468, 2011 Va. LEXIS 134 (2011). Where both Civilian Conservation Corps and Virginia Forest Service had improved and maintained a trail in the past, but these public agencies were not road officials within the meaning of the statute, and their work was not done to open the trail for public travel, their purpose, according to the evidence, being to improve it for their own use as a fire trail, and there was no evidence in the record of formal acceptance by public authority, both requisite elements of a valid dedication were lacking. Therefore, there were no public rights in the CCC trail by dedication. Burks Bro s. v. Jones, 232 Va. 238, 349 S.E.2d 134, 3 Va. Law Rep. 969, 1986 Va. LEXIS 251 (1986).

Any person owning land over which another or others have a private road or right-of-way may, except when it is otherwise provided by contract, erect and maintain gates across such roads or right-of-way at all points at which fences extend to such roads on each side thereof. A court of competent jurisdiction may, upon petition, require the landowner to make such changes as may be necessary and reasonable in the use of such roads for both the landowner and the petitioner. Nothing herein shall prohibit the replacemen t of a gate with a cattle guard as authorized in § 55.1-2809. B. If any pers on without permission of the owners of such gate or of the land on which the gate is located leaves the gate open, he is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. C. The owners of forest and timberlands may substantially obstruct or close private and seldom used roads leading to or into such forest or timberlands from the public highways of the Commonwealth at points at or near which the private roads enter their property or fo restlands; and, in all cases where any such private road is subject to an easement for travel for the benefit of other lands not regularly and continuously inhabited, the owner of such forest or timberlands may obstruct the road with a gate, chain, cable , or other removable obstruction, lock the obstruction, and after furnishing a key to the lock to the owner or owners of the land or lands to which the forestlands are servient, require those entitled to the easement to unlock and relock such obstruction upon making use of the road.There shall be no penalty upon the owner of such forest or timberlands for failure to erect such obstructions, but if such obstruction is erected, any person without the permission of the owner who destroys, removes, or leave s the obstruction open or unlocked, in cases where the obstruction is locked by the owner and the keys are furnished as provided in this subsection, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $25 nor more than $500, provided that in all cases of forest fires upon the owners lands or those adjacent or near thereto, the expressed permission of the owner shall be deemed given to all persons aiding in extinguishing or preventing the spreading of the fire to remove the obstructions, including the breaking of locks.

Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Necess ary to own land on each side.  This section contemplates that the person claiming the right to erect the gates shall own land on both sides of the road or right-of-way, and have fences which extend to such roads on each side thereof, and the burden is on the claimant to show that he is within the provisions of the statute. Where he fails to make such showing he has no right to erect such gates. Meadows v. Meadows, 143 Va. 98, 129 S.E . 354, 1925 Va. LEXIS 250 (1925). Necessary to have fences extend to each side of right of way.  Since owners of land burdened by easement did not have fences that extended to each side of the right of way, they did not establish a right under the statute to erect a gate. Ridgwell v. Brasco Bay Corp., 254 Va. 458, 493 S.E.2d 123, 1997 Va. LEXIS 112 (1997). Application not prevented by narrowness of land on one side of way.  Two gates were erected across a private right-of-way appurtenant to complainants land, over the adjoining land of defendants. One gate was in a fence erected entirely on land of the defendants who owned land on both sides of the right-of-way. Complainant contended that this section did not apply because defendants only owned a strip of land 18´ wide between complainants line and the way, and same was o f little value. It was held that the gate came squarely within the provisions of the statute. Good v. Petticrew, 165 Va. 526, 183 S.E. 217, 1936 Va. LEXIS 239 (1936). Landowner may erect gates if road is not open way.  Where there was no evidence to show that a road was, by agreement or by usage, an open way, and to the contrary the evidence showed that it had frequently been ob structed by bars or gates, both under the common law and under this section the landowner had the right to erect gates to permit him to use his land beneficially for grazing. Hartsock v. Powell, 199 Va. 320, 99 S.E.2d 581, 1957 Va. LEXIS 193 (1957). This section gives the owner of the servient tract the right to erect and maintain a gate across the entrance to the right-of-way, irrespective of the length of time the road has been in existence or the manner in which it has been used, where there is no instrument or contract providing otherwise. Craig v. Kennedy, 202 Va. 654, 119 S.E.2d 320, 1961 Va. LEXIS 160 (1961). A grantee, as owner of the fee, has a right to maintain gates across a private way which the grantor has reserved. Terry v. Tinsley, 140 Va. 240, 124 S.E. 290, 1924 Va. LEXIS 167 (1924). No right to maintain locked gate.  The owners of land burdened by easement did not have a right to maintain a locked gate once they could demonstrate they had complied with the terms of the statute . Nothing in this section provides such a right. Ridgwell v. Brasco Bay Corp., 254 Va. 458, 493 S.E.2d 123, 1997 Va. LEXIS 112 (1997). Owner of easement permitted to replace gate with cattle guard.  Although the owner of the servient tract had the right, under this section, to erect and maintain a gate across the entrance to the right-of-way, the owner of the right-of-way would be permitted to replace the gate with a substantial cattle guard, or cattle guard and gate, under § 55-305, where it could be considered from the evidence that a cattle guard would serve the servient owners purpose of keeping h is cattle in, and that the additional reason assigned by him for erecting the gate, to keep trespassers off his property, was of no moment. Craig v. Kennedy, 202 Va. 654, 119 S.E.2d 320, 1961 Va. LEXIS 160 (1961). Plat showing unobstructed right of way.  Trial court incorrectly held that landowners were required to remove gate across right of way because plat showed an unobstructed right of way. The landowners wer e barred as a matter of law from placing a gate across the right of way only if they were subject to a contractual provision prohibiting the installation of a gate. The plat appended to the deed showed the route of the easement and did not indicate any r estrictions that would prohibit the placement of a gate across the easement. In addition, there was no evidence that the landowners executed any agreement limiting their right to place a gate over the easement. Ridgwell v. Brasco Bay Corp., 254 Va. 458, 493 S.E.2d 123, 1997 Va. LEXIS 112 (1997). II.Excep tions Otherwise Provided by Contract. What constitutes exception otherwise provided by contract.  The words without let or hindrance, contained in a grant of a right-of-way, constitute an exception otherwise provided by contract. Waskey v. Lewis, 224 V a. 206, 294 S.E.2d 879, 1982 Va. LEXIS 283 (1982). Without let or hindrance construed.  The expression without let or hindrance, while including the concept of a permanent obstruction, is also broad enough to include something far less. Waske y v. Lewis, 224 Va. 206, 294 S.E.2d 879, 1982 Va. LEXIS 283 (1982). The term without let or hindrance, contained in the language granting a right-of-way appurtenant to lands conveyed, precludes the erection of manually-ope rated gates. Waskey v. Lewis, 224 Va. 206, 294 S.E.2d 879, 1982 Va. LEXIS 283 (1982). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Erection of gates allowed.  Easement holders were not entitled to summary judgment on property owners alleged interference with the easement holders use of an easement by the erectio n of gates because the original deed that was involved specifically granted the owners predecessors in title the right to erect two gates across the easement, an agreement that a later deed ineffectually attempted to revoke.

CASE NOTES The clause no change shall be made does not prohibit the construction, relocatio n and inclusion in the highway system of a new road. That restriction against relocation of an existing highway refers only to those state highways running to and from points named in Chapter 10, Acts 1918, that had been located and established prior to the effective date of Chapter 31, Acts 1919. And even if established then, the correct construction of the clause would not preclude the location, establishment, construction and inclusion of another section of highway in the system which may shorten the distance between existing points, where no intention or purpose is disclosed to abandon any part of the old route.

Such regulations shall allow localities to regulate the operation of such mobile food vending businesses located on the state highway rights-of-way within the locality in a manner consistent with local ordinances and the Commonwealth Transportation Boards regulations and policies. CASE NOTES Aim in adopting traffic devices manu al.  Nothing inherent in the authority invoked by the Board when it adopted the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as a standard suggests that railroads would be relieved of their responsibility to discover especially hazardous crossings and to erect lights and other appropriate protective devices at such crossings. Rather, the adoption of MUTCD seems to have been aimed principally at setting standards to make highway safety measures implemented by local agencies consistent with those implemented by state agencies.

E arle-Lansdell Co., 142 Va. 435, 129 S.E. 263, 1925 Va. LEXIS 350 (1925). The purpose of this section is to insure competitive bidding in order that the Commonwea lth may have the work done at the lowest available price. Ragland v. Commonwealth, 172 Va. 186, 200 S.E. 601, 1939 Va. LEXIS 229 (1939). Provision for statement of place where plans may be examined is mandatory.  The requirement of this section that advertisements for bids for constructing highways shall state the place where bidders may examine the plans and specification s is mandatory and cannot be waived. Trinkle v. Commonwealth, 170 Va. 429, 196 S.E. 652, 1938 Va. LEXIS 200 (1938); Ragland v. Commonwealth, 172 Va. 186, 200 S.E. 601, 1939 Va. LEXIS 229 (1939). Before submitting a bid the contractor should examine the plans and specifications at th e place indicated, and this section clearly places upon him the burden of doing so. Ragland v. Commonwealth, 172 Va. 186, 200 S.E. 601, 1939 Va. LEXIS 229 (1939). To insure that all bids are based on the same specifications, this section contemplates that the authentic and binding specifications are those referred to in the advertisement as being available for inspection by the prospective bidders. Ragland v. Commonwealth, 172 Va. 186, 200 S.E. 601, 1939 Va. LEXIS 229 (1939). Specifications stated to be on file constitute only authentic and binding specifications.  If the advertisement for bids for constructing a highway stated that the plans and specifications were on file in the Department of Highways (now Department of Tr ansportation) for examination by the prospective bidders, then those plans and specifications were the authentic and binding specifications and were superior to any other plans and specifications consulted by any bidder. Trinkle v. Commonwealth, 170 Va. 429, 196 S.E. 652, 1938 Va. LEXIS 200 (1938). No change or waiver of specifications by subordinates.  When the specifications have been promulgated and advertised, as required by this section, they cannot be changed or waived by the subordinate employees of the De partment of Highways (now Department of Transportation).

The goals of the comprehensive highway access management standards are: 1. To re duce traffic congestion and impacts to the level of service of highways, leading to reduced fuel consumption and air pollution; 2. To enhance public safety by decreasing traffic crash rates; 3. To support economic development in the Commonwealth by promoting the efficient movement of people and goods; 4. To reduce the need for new highways and road widening by improving the performance of the existing systems of state highways; and 5. To preserve public investment in new highways by maximizing their performance. C.

The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Credit clause.  Grant of funds to the railroad for the development of the intermodal facility did not violate the credit clause because it was a grant and not an extension of the Commonwealths credit to the railroad.

Authorizing funding.  Funding for the facility under the Agreement between the parties regarding railroad development was authorized pursuant to legislation intended to be directly rel ated to the construction, maintenance and operation of Virginias highways. The statutes application did not violate the internal improvements clause under Va. Const., Art. X, § 10, because it came within the public roads exception. Montgomery County v. Va.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any bonds issued to pay for the initial funding of capital projects s hall be limited to financing capital expenditures and projects submitted for approval by the Transportation Board as set forth in § 33.2-298. B. The Authori ty may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds then outstanding that shall have been issued under the provisions of this article, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the da te fixed for redemption of such bonds. The issuance of such bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the Authority in respect of the same shall be governed by the provi sions of this article insofar as the same may be applicable. C. The bonds o f each issue shall be dated such date as may be determined by the Authority; shall bear interest at such rate or rates as shall be fixed by the Authority, or as may be determined in such manner as the Authority may provide, including the determination by agents designated by the Authority under guidelines established by the Authority; shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the Authority; and may be made redeemable before maturity, at t he option of the Authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. D. The Authori ty shall determine the form of the bonds and manner of execution of the bonds and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or o utside the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the chairman or vice-chairman of the Authority or, if so authorized by the Authority, shall bear his facsimile signature and the official seal of the Authority, or, if so authorized by the Authority, a facsimile thereof shall be impressed or imprinted thereon and attested by the secretary or any assistant secretary of the Authority, or, if so authorized by the Authority, with the facsimile signature of such secretary or assistant secretary. Any coupo ns attached to bonds issued by the Authority shall bear the signature of the chairman or vice-chairman of the Authority or a facsimile thereof. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons sha ll cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery, and any bonds may bear the facsimile sign ature of, or may be signed by, such persons as at the actual time of the execution of such bonds shall be the proper officers to sign such bonds although at the date of such bonds such persons may not have been such officers. E. The bonds m ay be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon b onds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. Bonds issued in registered form may be issued under a system of book-entry for recording the ownership and transfer of ownership of ri ghts to receive payment of principal of, and premium on, if any, and interest on such bonds. The Authority may contract for the services of one or more banks, trust companies, financial institutions, or other entities or persons, within or outside the Co mmonwealth, for the authentication, registration, transfer, exchange, and payment of the bonds or may provide such services itself. The Authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this article. F. The proceed s of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the purposes, and in furtherance of the powers, of the Authority as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing th e same. G. In addition to the above powers, the Authority shall have the authority to issue interim receipts or temporary bonds as provided in § 15.2-2616 and to execute and deliver new bonds in place of bonds mutilated, lost, or destroyed as provided in § 15.2-2621.

I. At the disc retion of the Authority, any bonds issued under the provisions of this article may be secured by a trust indenture or agreement by and between the Authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust comp any within or outside the Commonwealth. Such trust indenture or agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received and provide for the mortgage of any rail facilities or property or any p art thereof. Such trust indenture or agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants providing for the repossession and sale by the Authority or any trustees under any trust indenture or agreement of any rail facilities, or part thereof, upon any default under the lease or sale of such rail facilities, settin g forth the duties of the Authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the planning, development, acquisition, construction, rehabilitation, establishment, improvement, extension, enlargement, maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of the rail facilities in connection with which such bonds shall have been authorized; the amounts of rates, rents, fees, and other charges to be charged; the collection of such rates, rents, fees, and other charges; the custody, safeguarding, and applicati on of all moneys; and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It is lawful for any national bank with its main office in the Commonwealth or any other state or any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of t he Commonwealth or another state that may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the Authority. Any such trust indenture or agreement or resolution m ay set forth the rights of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust indenture or agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the Authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders, inc luding, without limitation, provisions for the assignment to a corporate trustee or escrow agent of any rights of the Authority in any project owned by, or leases or sales of any rail facilities made by, the Authority. All expenses incurred in carrying o ut the provisions of such trust indenture or agreement or resolution or other agreements relating to any rail facilities, including those to which the Authority may not be a party, may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the rail facilit ies. J. No obligati on of the Authority shall be deemed to constitute a debt, or pledge of the faith and credit, of the Commonwealth or of any other political subdivision thereof but shall be payable solely from the revenues and other funds of the Authority pledged thereto, excluding revenues provided from the Commonwealth Rail Fund pursuant to § 33.2-1526.4. All such obligations shall contain on the face thereof a statement to the effect that the Commonwealth, any political subdivision thereof, and the Authority shall not be obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except from revenues and other funds of the Authority pledged thereto, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof is pled ged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such obligations.

The Commiss ioner of Highways may acquire by gift, purchase, exchange, condemnation, or otherwise such lands or interest therein necessary or proper for the purpose and may construct and improve thereon such bypasses or extensions and connections of the primary stat e highway system through or around cities and towns as the Board deems necessary for the uses of the primary state highway system, provided that the respective cities and towns with populations of 3,500 or more by action of their governing bodies agree t o participate in all costs of such construction and improvement, including the cost of rights-of-way, on that portion of any such bypass or extension that is located within any such city or town. The maintenance of that portion of a bypass or extension l ocated within a city or town shall be borne by the city or town. However, the Board shall contribute to such maintenance in accordance with the provisions of law governing its contribution to the maintenance of highways, bridges, and streets in such citi es and towns. The location, form, and character of informational, regulatory, and warning signs, curb and pavement, or other markings and traffic signals installed or placed by any public authority shall be subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Highways.

The Commiss ioner of Highways, subject to the approval of the Board, shall make payments for maintenance, construction, or reconstruction of highways to all cities and towns eligible for funds under this section. Such payments, however, shall only be made if those h ighways functionally classified as principal and minor arterial roads are maintained to a standard satisfactory to the Department. Whenever any city or town qualifies under this section for allocation of funds, such qualification shall continue to apply to such city or town regardless of any subsequent change in population and shall cease to apply only when so specifically provided by an act of the General Assembly.Funds are allocated to urban highways in (i) all towns that have a population of more tha n 3,500 according to the last preceding United States census; (ii) all towns that, according to evidence satisfactory to the Board, have attained a population of more than 3,500 since the last preceding United States census; (iii) Chase City, Elkton, Gro ttoes, Narrows, Pearisburg, and Saltville, which, on June 30, 1985, maintained certain streets under former § 33.1-80 as then in effect; (iv) all cities regardless of their populations; and (v) the Towns of Altavista, Dublin, Lebanon, and Wise. B. No payments shall be made to any such city or town unless the portion of the highway for which such payment is made either (i) has (a) an unrestricted right-of-way at least 50 feet wide and (b) a hard-surface width of at least 30 feet; (ii) has (a) an unrestricted right-of-way at least 80 feet wide, (b) a hard-surface width of at least 24 feet, and (c) approved engineering plans for the ultimate construction of an additional hard-surface width of at least 24 feet within the same right-of-way; (iii)(a) is a cul-de- sac, (b) has an unrestricted right-of-way at least 40 feet wide, and (c) has a turnaround that meets applicable standards set by the Department; (iv) either (a) has been paved and has constituted part of the primary or secondary state highway system prio r to annexation or incorporation or (b) has constituted part of the secondary state highway system prior to annexation or incorporation and is paved to a minimum width of 16 feet subsequent to such annexation or incorporation and with the further excepti on of streets or portions thereof that have previously been maintained under the provisions of § 33.2-339 or 33.2-340; (v) was eligible for and receiving such payments under the laws of the Commonwealth in effect on June 30, 1985; (vi) is a street est ablished prior to July 1, 1950, that has an unrestricted right-of-way width of not less than 30 feet and a hard-surface width of not less than 16 feet; (vii) is a street functionally classified as a local street that was constructed on or after January 1 , 1996, and that at the time of approval by the city or town met the criteria for pavement width and right-of-way of the then-current design standards for subdivision streets as set forth in regulations adopted by the Board; (viii) is a street previously eligible to receive street payments that is located in the City of Norfolk or the City of Richmond and is closed to public travel, pursuant to legislation enacted by the governing body of the locality in which it is located, for public safety reasons, w ithin the boundaries of a publicly funded housing development owned and operated by the local housing authority; or (ix) is a local street, otherwise eligible, containing one or more physical protuberances placed within the right-of-way for the purpose o f controlling the speed of traffic.However, the Commissioner of Highways may waive the requirements as to hard-surface pavement or right-of-way width for highways where the width modification is at the request of the governing body of the locality and is to protect the quality of the affected localitys drinking water supply or, for highways constructed on or after July 1, 1994, to accommodate some other special circumstance where such action would not compromise the health, safety, or welfare of the public. The modification is subject to such conditions as the Commissioner of Highways may prescribe. C. For the pur pose of calculating allocations and making payments under this section, the Department shall divide affected highways into two categories, which shall be distinct from but based on functional classifications established by the Federal Highway Administrat ion: (i) principal and minor arterial roads and (ii) collector roads and local streets. Payments made to affected localities shall be based on the number of moving-lane-miles of highways or portions thereof available to peak-hour traffic in that locality . D. Any city co nverting an existing moving-lane that qualifies for payments under this section to a transit-only lane after July 1, 2014, shall remain eligible for such payments but shall not receive additional funds as a result of such conversion. Any city or town con verting an existing moving-lane that qualifies for payments under this section to a bicycle-only lane after July 1, 2014, shall remain eligible for such payments, provided that (i) the number of moving-lane-miles converted is not more than 50 moving-lane -miles or three percent of the citys or towns total number of moving-lane-miles on July 1, 2014, whichever is less, and (ii) prior to any such conversion, the city or town certifies that the conversion design has been assessed by a professional e ngineer licensed in the Commonwealth pursuant to Chapter 4 (§ 54.1-400 et seq.) of Title 54.1 and that the assessment has demonstrated that (a) the level of service of the street to be converted will not be reduced or if it will be reduced that the as sociated roadway network will retain adequate capacity to meet current and future mobility needs of all users and (b) the conversion has been designed in accordance with the National Association of City Transportation Officials Urban Bikeway Design G uide. Any such city or town shall not receive additional funds as a result of such conversion to a bicycle-only lane and shall annually expend funds on road and street maintenance and operations that are at least equal to funds spent on road and street m aintenance and operations in the year prior to such conversion. For purposes of this subsection, level of service has the meaning provided in the Transportation Research Boards Highway Capacity Manual. E. The Departm ent shall recommend to the Board an annual rate per category to be computed using the base rate of growth planned for the Departments Highway Maintenance and Operations program. The Board shall establish the annual rates of such payments as part of i ts allocation for such purpose, and the Department shall use those rates to calculate and put into effect annual changes in each qualifying citys or towns payment under this section.The payments by the Department shall be paid in equal sums in ea ch quarter of the fiscal year, and payments shall not exceed the allocation of the Board. F. The chief a dministrative officer of the city or town receiving these funds shall make annual categorical reports of expenditures to the Department, in such form as the Board shall prescribe, accounting for all expenditures, certifying that none of the money receive d has been expended for other than maintenance, construction, or reconstruction of the streets, and reporting on their performance as specified in subsection B of § 33.2-352. Such reports shall be included in the scope of the annual audit of each muni cipality conducted by independent certified public accountants.

The governing body of each county in the secondary state highway system may, jointly with the representatives of the Department as designated by the Commissioner of Hig hways, prepare a six-year plan for the improvements to the secondary state highway system in that county. Each such six-year plan shall be based upon the best estimate of funds to be available to the county for expenditure in the six-year period on the s econdary state highway system. Each such plan shall list the proposed improvements, together with an estimated cost of each project so listed. Following the preparation of the plan in any year in which a proposed new funding allocation is greater than $1 00,000, the board of supervisors or other local governing body shall conduct a public hearing after publishing notice in a newspaper published in or having general circulation in the county once a week for two successive weeks and posting notice of the p roposed hearing at the front door of the courthouse of such county 10 days before the meeting. At the public hearings, which shall be conducted jointly by the board of supervisors and the representative of the Department, the entire six-year plan shall b e discussed with the citizens of the county and their views considered. Following the discussion, the local governing body, together with the representative of the Department, shall finalize and officially adopt the six-year plan, which shall then be con sidered the official plan of the county. At least once in each calendar year in which a proposed new funding allocation is greater than $100,000, representatives of the Department in charge of the secondary st ate highway system in each county, or some representative of the Department designated by the Commissioner of Highways, shall meet with the governing body of each county in a regular or special meeting of the local governing body for the purpose of prepa ring a budget for the expenditure of improvement funds for the next fiscal year. The representative of the Department shall furnish the local governing body with an updated estimate of funds, and the board and the representative of the Department shall j ointly prepare the list of projects to be carried out in that fiscal year taken from the six-year plan by order of priority and following generally the policies of the Board in regard to the statewide improvements to the secondary state highway system. I n any year in which a proposed new funding allocation is greater than $100,000, such list of priorities shall then be presented at a public hearing duly advertised in accordance with the procedure outlined in this section, and comments of citizens shall be obtained and considered. Following this public hearing, the board, with the concurrence of the representative of the Department, shall adopt, as official, a priority program for the ensuing year, and the Department shall include such listed projects i n its secondary highways budget for the county for that year. At least once every two years following the adoption of the original six-year plan, the governing body of each county, together with the representative of the Departmen t, may update the six-year plan of the county by adding to it and extending it as necessary so as to maintain it as a plan encompassing six years. Whenever additional funds for secondary highway purposes become available, the local governing body may req uest a revision in its six-year plan in order that such plan be amended to provide for the expenditure of the additional funds. Such additions and extensions to each six-year plan shall be prepared in the same manner and following the same procedures as outlined herein for its initial preparation. Where the local governing body and the representative of the Department fail to agree upon a priority program, the local governing body may appeal to the Commissioner of Highways. The Commissioner of Highways shall consider all proposed priorities and render a decision establishing a priority program based upon a consideration by the Commissioner of Highways of the welfare and safety of county citizens. Such decision shall be binding. Nothing in this section shall preclude a local governing body, with the concurrence of the representative of the Department, from combining the public hearing that may be required pursuant to this section for revision of a six-year plan with the public hearing that may be required pursuant to this section for review of the list of priorities, provided that notice of such combined hearing is published in accordance with procedures provided in this section. All such six-year plans shall consider all existing highways in the secondary state highway system, including those in the towns located in the county that are maintain ed as a part of the secondary state highway system, and shall be made a public document. If any county cancels any highway construction or improvement project included in its six-year plan after the location and design for the project has been approved, suc h county shall reimburse the Department the net amount of all funds expended by the Department for planning, engineering, right-of-way acquisition, demolition, relocation, and construction between the date on which project development was initiated and t he date of cancellation. To the extent that funds from secondary highway allocations have been expended to pay for a highway construction or improvement project, all revenues generated from a reimbursement by the county shall be deposited into that same countys secondary highway allocation. The Commissioner of Highways may waive all or any portion of such reimbursement at his discretion. The provisions of this section shall not apply in instances where less than 100 percent of the right-of-way is available for donation for unpaved highway improvements. History History.

For the pur poses of this section:County means a county in which the secondary state highway system is constr ucted and maintained by the Department and that has adopted a local ordinance for control of the development of subdivision streets to the necessary standards for acceptance into the secondary state highway system. Qualifying rural addition cost means that portion of the estimated engineering and construction cost to improve the street to the minim um standards for acceptance remaining after reducing the total estimated cost by any prorated amount deemed the responsibility of others based on speculative interests.Rural ad dition funds means those funds reserved from the countys annual allocation of secondary state highway system construction funds, as defined in § 33.2-324, for the purpo se of this section. If such funds are not used by such county for such purpose during the fiscal year they are so allocated, the funds may be held for such purpose for the four succeeding fiscal years. A maximum of five percent of the annual secondary st ate system highway construction allocation may be reserved by the local governing body for rural additions.Speculative interest means that the original developer or a successor developer retains ownership in any lot abutting such street for development or speculative purposes. In instances where it is determined that speculative interest is ret ained by the original developer, developers, or successor developers and the governing body of the county deems that extenuating circumstances exist, the governing body of the county shall require a pro rata participation by such original developer, deve lopers, or successor developers as prescribed in subsection D as a condition of the countys recommendation pursuant to this section.Street means a street or highway shown on a plat that has been recorded or otherwise opened to public use and used by motor vehicles for at least 20 years and that, for any reason, has not been taken into the secondary state highway system and serves at least three families per mile. B. Whenever th e governing body of a county recommends in writing to the Department that any street in the county be taken into and become a part of the secondary state highway system in such county, the Department thereupon, within the limit of available funds and the mileage available in such county for the inclusion of highways and streets in the secondary state highway system, shall take such street into the secondary state highway system for maintenance, improvement, construction, and reconstruction if such stree t, at the time of such recommendation, (i) has a minimum dedicated width of 40 feet or (ii) in the event of extenuating circumstances as determined by the Commissioner of Highways, has a minimum dedicated width of 30 feet. In either case, such streets mu st have easements appurtenant thereto that conform to the policy of the Board with respect to drainage. After the streets are taken into the secondary state highway system, the Department shall maintain the same in the manner provided by law. However, no such street shall be taken into and become a part of the secondary state highway system unless and until any and all required permits have been obtained and any outstanding fees, charges, or other financial obligations of whatever nature have been satis fied or provision has been made, whether by the posting of a bond or otherwise, for their satisfaction. C. Such street shall only be taken into the secondary state highway system if the governing body of the county has identified and made available the funds required to improve the street to the required minimum standards. The county may consider the following options t o fund the required improvements for streets accepted under this section: 1. The g overning body of the county may use a portion of the countys annual secondary state highway system construction allocation designated as rural addition funds to fund the qualifying rural addition costs for qualifying streets if the county agrees to c ontribute from county revenue or the special assessment of the landowners on the street in question one-half of the qualifying rural addition cost to bring the streets up to the necessary minimum standards for acceptance. No such special assessment of la ndowners on such streets shall be made unless the governing body of the county receives written declarations from the owners of 75 percent or more of the platted parcels of land abutting upon such streets stating their acquiescence in such assessments. T he basis for such special assessments, at the option of the local governing body, shall be either (i) the proportion the value of each abutting parcel bears to the total value of all abutting parcels on such street as determined by the current evaluation of the property for real estate tax purposes, (ii) the proportion the abutting road front footage of each parcel abutting the street bears to the total abutting road front footage of all parcels abutting on the street, or (iii) an equal amount for each parcel abutting on such street. No such special assessment on any parcel shall exceed one-third of the current valuation of such property for real estate tax purposes. Special assessments under this section shall be conducted in the manner provided in Ar ticle 2 (§ 15.2-2404 et seq.) of Chapter 24 of Title 15.2, mutatis mutandis, for assessments for local improvements. 2. The governing body of any county may use a portion of its annual secondary state highway system construction allocation designated as rural addition funds to fund the qualifying rural addition cost for qualifying streets within the limitation of funds and the mileage limitation of the Boards policy on rural additions. 3. The governing body of any county may use revenues derived from the sale of bonds to finance the construction of rural additions to the secondary state highway system of such county. In addition, from the funds allocated by the Commonwealth for the construction of secondary state highway improvements, such local governing body may use funds allocated within the Board policy for the construction of rural additions to pay principal and i nterest on bonds associated with rural additions in such county, provided the revenue derived from the sale of such bonds is not used as the county matching contribution under § 33.2-357. The provisions of this section shall not constitute a debt or o bligation of the Board or the Commonwealth. 4. The governing body of the county may expend general county revenue for the purposes of this section. 5. The governing body of the county may permit one or more of the landowners on the street in question to pay to the county a sum equal to one-half of the qualifying rural addition cost t o bring the street up to the necessary minimum standards for acceptance into the secondary state highway system, which funds the county shall then utilize for such purpose. Thereafter, upon collection of the special assessment of landowners on such stree t, the county shall use such special assessment funds to reimburse, without interest, the one or more landowners for those funds that they previously advanced to the county to bring the street up to the necessary minimum standards for acceptance. 6. The governing body of the county may utilize the allocations made to the county in accordance with § 33.2-357. D. In instance s where it is determined that speculative interest exists, the basis for the pro rata percentage required of such developer, developers, or successor developers shall be the proportion that the value of the abutting parcels owned or partly owned by the d eveloper, developers, or successor developers bears to the total value of all abutting property as determined by the current valuation of the property for real estate purposes. The pro rata percentage shall be applied to the Departments total estimat ed cost to construct such street to the necessary minimum standards for acceptance to determine the amount of costs to be borne by the developer, developers, or successor developers. Property so valuated shall not be assessed in the special assessment fo r the determination of the individual pro rata share attributable to other properties. Further, when such pro rata participation is accepted by the governing body of the county from such original developer, developers, or successor developers, such amoun t shall be deducted from the Departments total estimated cost, and the remainder of such estimated cost, the qualifying rural addition cost, shall then be the basis of determining the assessment under the special assessment provision or determining t he amount to be provided by the county when funded from general county revenue under the definition of speculative interest in subsection A or determining the amount to be funded as a rural addition under the definition of qualifying rural addition cost in subsection A. E.

The county shall reimburse the Department for all costs incurred by the Department in carrying ou t the aforesaid activities from general revenues or revenues derived from the sale of bonds. D. Notwithstan ding any contrary provision of law, any county may undertake activities toward the design, land acquisition, or construction of primary or secondary state highway projects that have been included in the six-year plan pursuant to § 33.2-331, or in the case of a primary state highway, an approved project included in the six-year improvement program of the Board.

This section contemplated the extinguishment of easements of abutting landowners upon th e conversion of a conventional highway into a limited access highway. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Linsly, 223 Va. 437, 290 S.E.2d 834, 1982 Va. LEXIS 222 (1982). Reduction or limitation of direct access to an abutting landowners property generally is not compensable. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Linsly, 223 Va. 437, 290 S.E.2d 834, 1982 Va. LEXIS 222 (1982). Test f or determination of damages in converting highway.  In condemnation proceedings for acquisition of land and easements in the conversion of a conventional highway into a limited access highway, the same test for the determination of damages must be applied as in other cases where the commissioner exercises the right of eminent domain. The damage figure is the difference between the value of the residue immediately before and immediately after the taking. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Linsly, 223 Va. 437, 290 S.E.2d 834, 1982 Va. LEXIS 222 (1982). Difference in fair market value.  The damage, if any, to the residue, over and above any enhancement, is the difference in fair market value immediately before and immediately after the taking. St ate Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Linsly, 223 Va. 437, 290 S.E.2d 834, 1982 Va. LEXIS 222 (1982). It was proper to permit the commissioners, in ascertaining damages, to consider the effect on market value of the substitution of indirect access for the easement s that formerly afforded direct access to highway. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Linsly, 223 Va. 437, 290 S.E.2d 834, 1982 Va. LEXIS 222 (1982). Contract to keep crossover open.  In the absence of authority from the General Assembly, neither the right-of-way engineer who dealt with an adjoining property owner, nor Commission (now Board) it self had power to create a servitude on the property of the Commonwealth for the benefit of a property owner by contracting that a crossover in a limited access highway should always remain open.

CASE NOTES Replacement of access roads taken for highway construction.  The Commission (now Board) is authorized by this section to construct service roads to replace the access roads taken for the construction of limited access highw ays. Such a road is for a public purpose and the Commissioner may condemn land for its construction. Stewart v. Fugate, 212 Va. 689, 187 S.E.2d 156, 1972 Va. LEXIS 241 (1972) (decided under prior law). The necessity or expediency of a service road is a legislative question, which has been delegated to the Commission (now Board). The public official or body charged with the duty of determining the location of a public road ordinarily may exercise a large discretion, and a hearing on determining the location of the road is not essential to due process under the federal and state Constitutions.

In order to facilitate the rapid and orderly movement of traffic to and from urban areas during peak traffic periods, the Board may designate one or more lanes of any highway in the Interstate System, primary state highway system, or secondary state highway system as HOV lanes. When lanes have been so designated and have been appropriately marked with signs or other markers as the Board may prescribe, they shall be reserved during periods designated by the Board for the exclusive use of buses and high-occupancy ve hicles. Any local governing body may also, with respect to highways under its exclusive jurisdiction, designate HOV lanes and impose and enforce restrictions on the use of such lanes. Any highway for which the locality receives highway maintenance funds pursuant to § 33.2-319 shall be deemed to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the local governing body for the purposes of this section. HOV lanes shall be reserved for high-occupancy vehicles of a specified number of occupants as determined by th e Board or, for HOV lanes designated by a local governing body, by that local governing body. However, no designation of any lane or lanes of any highway as HOV lanes shall apply to the use of any such lanes by: 1. Emerg ency vehicles such as firefighting vehicles and emergency medical services vehicles; 2. Law-enforcement vehicles; 3. Motorcycles; 4. a. Tra nsit and commuter buses designed to transport 16 or more passengers, including the driver; b. Any vehicle operating under a certificate issued under § 46.2-2075, 46.2-2080, 46.2-2096, 46.2-2099.4, or 46.2-2099.44; 5. Vehicles of public utility companies operating in response to an emergency call; 6. Vehicles bearing clean special fuel vehicle license plates issued pursuant to § 46.2-749.3, provided such use is in compliance with federal law; 7. Taxicabs having two or more occupants, including the driver; or 8. (Contingent effective date) Any active duty military member in uniform who is utilizing Interstate 264 and I nterstate 64 for the purposes of traveling to or from a military facility in the Hampton Roads Planning District.In the Hampton Roads Planning District, HOV restrictions may be temporarily lifted and HOV lanes opened to use by all vehicles when restricti ng use of HOV lanes becomes impossible or undesirable and the temporary lifting of HOV limitations is indicated by signs along or above the affected portion of highway.The Commissioner of Highways shall implement a program of the HOV facilities in the Ha mpton Roads Planning District beginning not later than May 1, 2000. This program shall include the temporary lifting of HOV restrictions and the opening of HOV lanes to all traffic when an incident resulting from nonrecurring causes within the general la nes occurs such that a lane of traffic is blocked or is expected to be blocked for 10 minutes or longer. The HOV restrictions for the facility shall be reinstated when the general lane is no longer blocked and is available for use.The Commissioner of Hig hways shall maintain necessary records to evaluate the effects of such openings on the operation of the general lanes and the HOV lanes. This program will terminate if the Federal Highway Administration requires repayment of any federal highway construct ion funds because of the programs impact on the HOV facilities in Hampton Roads. B. In designat ing any lane or lanes of any highway as HOV lanes, the Board or local governing body shall specify the hour or hours of each day of the week during which the lanes shall be so reserved, and the hour or hours shall be plainly posted at whatever intervals along the lanes the Board or local governing body deems appropriate. Any person driving a motor vehicle in a designated HOV lane in violation of this section is guilty of a traffic infraction, which shall not be a moving violation, and on conviction shal l be fined $100. However, violations committed within the boundaries of Planning District 8 shall be punishable as follows: 1. For a first offense, by a fine of $125; 2. For a second offense within a period of five years from a first offense, by a fine of $250; 3. For a third offense within a period of five years from a first offense, by a fine of $500; and 4. For a fourth or subsequent offense within a period of five years from a first offense, by a fine of $1,000.Upon a conviction under this section, the court shall furnish to the Commissi oner of the Department of Motor Vehicles in accordance with § 46.2-383 an abstract of the record of such conviction, which shall become a part of the persons driving record. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 46.2-492, no driver demerit points shall be assessed for any violation of this section, except that persons convicted of second, third, fourth, or subsequent violations within five years of a first offense committed in Planning District 8 shall be assessed three demerit points for each s uch violation. C. In the pros ecution of an offense, committed in the presence of a law-enforcement officer, of failure to obey a road sign restricting a highway, or portion thereof, to the use of high-occupancy vehicles, proof that the vehicle described in the HOV violation summons was operated in violation of this section, together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such violation the registered owner of the vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a rebuttable presumption that such registered owner of the vehicle was t he person who committed the violation. Such presumption shall be rebutted if the registered owner of the vehicle testifies in open court under oath that he was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation. A summons for a violation of thi s section may be executed in accordance with § 19.2-76.2. Such rebuttable presumption shall not arise when the registered owner of the vehicle is a rental or leasing company. D. Notwithstan ding the provisions of § 19.2-76, whenever a summons for a violation of this section is served in any locality, it may be executed by mailing by first-class mail a copy thereof to the address of the owner of the vehicle as shown on the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles. If the summoned person fails to appear on the date of return set out in the summons mailed pursuant to this section, the summons shall be executed in the manner set out in § 19.2-76.3.No proceedings for contempt or arrest of a person summoned by mailing shall be instituted for his failure to appear on the return date of the summons. E. Notwithstan ding § 33.2-613, high-occupancy vehicles having three or more occupants (HOV-3) may be permitted to use the Omer L. Hirst-Adelard L. Brault Expressway (Dulles Toll Road) without paying a toll. F. Notwithstan ding the contrary provisions of this section, the following conditions shall be met before the HOV-2 designation of Interstate 66 can be changed to HOV-3 or any more restrictive designation: 1. The D epartment of Transportation shall publish a notice of its intent to change the existing designation and also immediately provide similar notice of its intent to all members of the General Assembly representing districts that touch or are directly impacte d by traffic on Interstate 66. 2. The Department of Transportation shall hold public hearings in the corridor to receive comments from the public. 3. The Department of Transportation shall make a finding of the need for a change in such designation, based on public hearings and its internal data, and present this finding to the Boar d for approval. 4. The Board shall make written findings and a decision based upon the following criteria: a. Is changing the HOV-2 designation to HOV-3 in the public interest? b. Is there quantitative and qualitative evidence that supports the argument that HOV-3 will facilitate the flow of traffic on Interstate 66? c. Is changing the HOV-2 designation beneficial to comply with the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990? d. Has the change in designation been screened and evaluated by the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority according to the process established pursuant to subdivision 2 of § 33.2-2500?

On a form prescribed by the Supreme Court, a summons for a violation of this section may be executed by a law-enforcement officer, when such violation is observed by such officer. The form shall contain the option for the operator of the vehicle to prepay the unpaid toll and all penalties, administrative fees, and costs. 2. a. A H OT lanes operator shall install and operate, or cause to be installed or operated, a photo-enforcement system at locations where tolls are collected for the use of such HOT lanes. b. A summons for a violation of this section may be executed when such violation is evidenced by information obtained from a photo-enforcement system as defined in this chapter. A ce rtificate, sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed or authorized by the HOT lanes operator, or a facsimile of such a certificate, based on inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotapes, or other recorded images produced by a photo-enforce ment system, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation under this subdivision 2. Any vehicle rental or vehicle leasing company, if named in a summons, shall be released as a party to the action if it provides to the HOT lanes operator a copy of the vehicle rental agreement or lease or an a ffidavit identifying the renter or lessee prior to the date of hearing set forth in the summons. Upon receipt of such rental agreement, lease, or affidavit, a summons shall be issued for the renter or lessee identified therein. Release of this informatio n shall not be deemed a violation of any provision of the Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act (§ 2.2-3800 et seq.) or the Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Act (§ 38.2-600 et seq.). c. On a form prescribed by the Supreme Court, a summons issued under this subdivision 2 may be executed as provided in § 19.2-76.2. Such form shall contain the option for the owne r or operator to prepay the unpaid toll and all penalties, administrative fees, and costs. A summons for a violation of this section may set forth multiple violations occurring within one jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 19.2-76, a su mmons for a violation of this section may be executed by mailing by first-class mail a copy thereof to the address of the owner or, if the owner has named and provided a valid address for the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation in an aff idavit executed pursuant to subdivision e, such named operator of the vehicle. Such summons shall be signed either originally or by electronic signature. If the summoned person fails to appear on the date of return set out in the summons mailed pursuant to this section, the summons shall be executed in the manner set out in § 19.2-76.3. d. No summons may be issued by a HOT lanes operator for a violation of this section unless the HOT lanes operator can demonstrate that (i) there was an attempt to collect the unpaid tolls and applicable administrative fees through debt collection not less than 30 days prior to issuance of the summons and (ii) 120 days have elapsed since the unpaid toll or, in a summons for multiple violations, 120 days have elapsed since the most re cent unpaid toll noticed on the summons. For purposes of this subdivision, debt collection means the collection of unpaid tolls and applicable administrative fees by (a) retention of a third-party debt collector or (b) collection practices undert aken by employees of a HOT lanes operator that are materially similar to a third-party debt collector. e. The owner of such vehicle shall be given reasonable notice by way of a summons as provided in this subdivision 2 that his vehicle had been used in violation of this section, and s uch owner shall be given notice of the time and place of the hearing and notice of the civil penalty and costs for such offense.It shall be prima facie evidence that the vehicle described in the summons issued pursuant to subdivision 2 was operated in vi olation of this section. Records obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to § 33.2-504 and certified in accordance with § 46.2-215 or from the equivalent agency in another state and certified as true and correct copies by the head o f such agency or his designee identifying the owner of such vehicle shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the vehicle is the person named in the summons.Upon the filing of an affidavit with the court at least 14 days prior to the hearing date by the owner of the vehicle stating that he was not the operator of the vehicle on the date of the violation and providing the legal name and address of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, a summons will also be issued to the alleged operator of the vehicle at the time of the offense. The affidavit shall constitute prima facie evidence that the person named in the affidavit was driving the vehicle at all the relevant times relating to the matter named in the affidavit. If the owner of the vehicle produces a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged offense and remained stolen at the time of the alleged offense, then the court sh all dismiss the summons issued to the owner of the vehicle. 3. a. The HOT lanes operator may impose and collect an administrative fee in addition to the unpaid toll so as to recover the expenses of collecting the unpaid toll, which administrative fee shall be reasonably related to the actual cost of collecting the unpaid toll and not exceed $100 per violation. The operator of the vehicle shall pay the unpaid tolls and any administrative fee detailed in a notice or invoice issued by a HOT lanes operator. If paid within 60 days of notification, the administrative fee shall not exceed $25. The HOT lanes operator shall notify the owner of the vehicle of any unpaid tolls and administrative fees by mailing an invoice pursuant to § 46.2-819.6. b. Upon a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that the operator of the vehicle observed by a law-enforcement officer under subdivision 1 or the vehicle described in the summ ons for a violation issued pursuant to evidence obtained by a photo-enforcement system under subdivision 2 was in violation of this section, the court shall impose a civil penalty upon the operator of such vehicle issued a summons under subdivision 1, or upon the operator or owner of such vehicle issued a summons under subdivision 2, payable to the HOT lanes operator as follows: for a first offense, $50; for a second offense, $100; for a third offense within a period of two years of the second offense, $250; and for a fourth and subsequent offense within a period of three years of the second offense, $500, together with, in each case, the unpaid toll, all accrued administrative fees imposed by the HOT lanes operator as authorized by this section, and a pplicable court costs. The court shall remand penalties, the unpaid toll, and administrative fees assessed for violation of this section to the treasurer or director of finance of the county or city in which the violation occurred for payment to the HOT lanes operator for expenses associated with operation of the HOT lanes and payments against any bonds or other liens issued as a result of the construction of the HOT lanes. No person shall be subject to prosecution under both subdivisions 1 and 2 for ac tions arising out of the same transaction or occurrence. c. Notwithstanding subdivisions a and b, for a first conviction of an operator or owner of a vehicle under this section, the total amount for the first conviction shall not exceed $2 ,200, including civil penalties and administrative fees regardless of the total number of offenses the operator or owner of a vehicle is convicted of on that date. d.

The HOT lan es operator may enter into an agreement with the Department of Motor Vehicles, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision B 21 of § 46.2-208, to obtain vehicle owner information regarding the owners of vehicles that use HOT lanes and with the De partment of Transportation to obtain any information that is necessary to conduct electronic toll collection and otherwise operate HOT lanes. Such agreement may include any information that may be obtained by the Department of Motor Vehicles in accordanc e with any agreement entered into pursuant to § 46.2-819.9. No HOT lanes operator shall disclose or release any personal information received from the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Department of Transportation to any third party, except in the i ssuance of a summons and institution of court proceedings in accordance with § 33.2-503. Information in the possession of a HOT lanes operator under this section shall be exempt from disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3 700 et seq.). B. Information collected by a photo-enforcement system shall be limited exclusively to that information that is necessary for the collection of unpaid tolls. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs, microphotographs, electronic images, or other dat a collected by a photo-enforcement system shall be used exclusively for the collection of unpaid tolls and shall not be (i) open to the public; (ii) sold or used for sales, solicitation, or marketing purposes; (iii) disclosed to any other entity except a s may be necessary for the collection of unpaid tolls or to a vehicle owner or operator as part of a challenge to the imposition of a toll; or (iv) used in a court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a violation o f § 33.2-503 or upon order from a court of competent jurisdiction. Information collected under this section shall be purged and not retained later than 30 days after the collection and reconciliation of any unpaid tolls, administrative fees, or civil penalties. Any entity operating a photo-enforcement system shall annually certify compliance with this section and make all records pertaining to such system available for inspection and audit by the Commissioner of Highways or the Commissioner of the De partment of Motor Vehicles or their designee.

When any such board or commission appointed by the governing body of a county to view a proposed highway or to alter or change the location of an existing highway shall award damages for the right-of-way for the same, in either case to be paid in money, it may be paid by the governing body of the county out of the general county levy funds.

There are two methods by which the boards of supervisors may acquire lands for public highways. They may at their election either proceed in the circuit court under the general statute providing the ordinary method for the exercise of the right of eminent domain, former § 25-46.1 et seq. (see now § 25.1-100 et seq.), or under th e general road law, §§ 33.1-230 through 33.1-246, vesting jurisdiction in the boards for establishment of highways, subject to appeal to the circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court of Appeals. Board of Supvrs. v. Proffit, 129 Va. 9, 105 S .E. 666, 1921 Va. LEXIS 72 (1921); Ewing v. Board of Supvrs., 131 Va. 471, 109 S.E. 474, 1921 Va. LEXIS 38 (1921). County must follow s ection to accept dedication.  Express acceptance of a dedication could only have been accomplished by the county following the requirements of this section. City of Norfolk v. Meredith, 204 Va . 485, 132 S.E.2d 431, 1963 Va. LEXIS 176 (1963). A road is not a public road unless the board of supervisors expressly or impliedly accept the offer of dedication made in a deed. And the board does not expressly accept a dedication where it does not follow the statutory requirements relating to the establishment of a public road, for example, the requirement of this section that the board appoint five freeholders or the county road engineer to examine the propo sed public road and report to the board upon the expediency of establishing it as a public road. Body v. Skeen, 208 Va. 749, 160 S.E.2d 751, 1968 Va. LEXIS 177 (1968). Condemnation for private road not authorized.  This article does not give a board of supervisors the authority to condemn land for the purpose of establishing a private road. Foster v. Board of Supvrs., 205 Va . 686, 139 S.E.2d 65, 1964 Va. LEXIS 236 (1964). Test in distinguishi ng public from private road.  Whether a road sought to be established is a public highway or one merely for the benefit of private individuals is not tested by the fact that such individuals r eceive a greater benefit than the public generally. The test is not simply how many actually use the road, but how many have a free and unrestricted right in common to use it. If it is free and common to all the citizens, it is a public road. Foster v. B oard of Supvrs., 205 Va. 686, 139 S.E.2d 65, 1964 Va. LEXIS 236 (1964). Width of road as independently fixed by board held not erroneous.  Proceedings by a board of supervisors under the general road law were not erroneous because the viewers appointed under the provisions of this section were direct ed to report upon the question as to how wide the road should be, and did so report, where it appeared that the width of the road, as finally fixed, represented the independent judgment and action of the board of supervisors. Ewing v. Board of Supvrs., 1 31 Va. 471, 109 S.E. 474, 1921 Va. LEXIS 38 (1921). Maintenance by public authorities of old county road as having a width of 30 feet cannot be enlarged into an acceptance of a dedication of an extension beyond 30 feet in violation of this section. The circumstances tended to establish that no part of the right-of-way in excess of a width of 30 feet was accepted by the public, and that the p ublic authorities long ago relinquished and abandoned any claim to the area. May v. Whitlow, 201 Va. 533, 111 S.E.2d 804, 1960 Va. LEXIS 126 (1960). This section has never been construed as warranting the establishment of a way of inferior dignity to a road. There is an implied limitation that the character of the way as a road shall be maintained. Hence under authority of this section a bridleway for horseback travel cannot be established. Terry v. McClung, 10 4 Va. 599, 52 S.E. 355, 1905 Va.

Any county may assume the payment of and pay any outstanding indebtedness of any magisterial district or districts thereof incurred for the purpose of constructing public highways that were subsequently taken over by the Commonwealth, provided the assumption thereo f is approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the county voting on the question at an election to be held as provided in this section. B. The governing body of the county may, by a resolution entered of record in its minute book, require the judges of election to open a poll at the next reg ular election and take the sense of the qualified voters of the county upon the question whether or not the county shall assume the highway indebtedness of district, or districts. The local governing body shall cause notice of such election to be given b y the posting of written notice thereof at the front door of the county courthouse at least 30 days prior to the date the same is to be held and by publication thereof once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published or having general circul ation in the county, which notice shall set forth the date of such election and the question to be voted on.

CASE NOTES Probable cause to arrest.  Police officer had probable cause to arrest defendant from the moment he observed defendant drop his coat in the street as he was running away from the officer. B ynum v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 408 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2012) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Reasonable suspicion.  Police officers possessed a reasonable suspicion to believe defendant littered as an officer observed defendant attempt to discard a can of beer immediately prior to a traffic stop as defendant was operating a riding mower on a highway. Commonwealth v. Taylor, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 201 (Greene County May 29, 2019). Officer possessed a reasonable suspicion to stop the riding lawn mower because defendant operated it on a curve in the roadway of the subdivision, which roadways were highways for law enforcement purposes, while holding a beer in violation of statute, the riding mower lacked required flagging on the back, defendant failed to drive to the right side of the highway as required, and reasonable suspicion existed to b elieve that he littered by discarding beer cans on private property. Commonwealth v. Taylor, 102 Va. Cir. 190, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1198 (Greene County May 29, 2019). Traffic stop was reasonably justified for littering and impermissible window tinting because combined, it would not be unreasonable to stop defendant for those vi olations and also give a warning for speeding; therefore, the the investigators stopping defendant for the purported traffic violations and littering was lawful. Commonwealth v. Ramey, 108 Va. Cir. 494, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 212 (Augusta County Oct. 5, 20 21). Duration of Stop.  Assuming the underlying justification for a stop was a littering infraction, drug task force officers failed to diligently pursue the underlying purpose o f the stop and, as such, unreasonably prolonged the stop beyond the time necessary to address its justification; therefore, defendants motion to suppress was granted.

E. When the Co mmissioner of Highways determines that the topography of the land adjoining a National Highway System highway will not permit adequate screening of such junkyards or the screening of such junkyards would not be economically feasible, the Commissioner of Highways shall have the authority to acquire by gift, purchase, or the power of eminent domain such interests in lands as may be necessary to secure the relocation, removal, or disposal of the junkyards and to pay for the costs of their relocation, remov al, or disposal.

The Commissioner of Highways may collect the cost of such removal, obliteration, or abatement from the person owning or operating the junkyard. G. The Board i s authorized to enter into agreements with the United States as provided in 23 U.S.C. § 136 with respect to control of junkyards. H.

D. The results of the traffic engineering study shall be made public in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 33.2-902. The Commissioner of Highways shall present his findings and recommendations to the Board, and the Board shall decide what actions to take regarding the railroad crossing at issue.

If the Board fails to enter an order pursuan t to § 33.2-902, such person or persons named in this section may appeal to the appropriate circuit court within 30 days from such failure. Such appeal shall be filed by petition in the clerks office of such court, setting out the order appealed f rom or the cause appealed from where no order was entered and the grounds of such appeal. Upon the filing of such petition, the clerk of the circuit court shall docket the appeal, giving it a preferred status.

Whenever a highway or a section of a highway has been abandoned in accordance with the provisions of § 33.2-902 or 33.2-906 and is deemed by the Commissioner of Highways no longer necessary for the uses of the primary state highway system, the Commissioner of Hi ghways shall so certify in writing and may execute in the name of the Commonwealth a deed or deeds conveying such section or sections of highway, either for consideration or in exchange for other lands that may be necessary for the uses of the primary st ate highway system. Before any such deed either for the sale or exchange of land is executed conveying any section of a highway along which any person resides, the Commissioner of Highways shall give notice to the governing bodies of the county and town and to the owner of the land upon which such person resides of the intention to convey the section of highway. If after a reasonable notice of such intention any such landowner or local governing body so requests, a hearing shall be ordered by the Commis sioner of Highways as provided in this article. If upon such hearing it is determined that such section of highway should be left open for the reasonable convenience of such landowner or the public, then such section of highway shall not be conveyed.

For the pur poses of this article, landing means a place on a river or other navigable body of water for loading or unloading goods or for the reception and delivery of travelers, the terminus of a highway on a river or other navigable body of water for load ing or unloading goods or for the reception and delivery of travelers, or a place for loading or unloading watercraft, but not a harbor for watercraft. B. Upon petiti on of the governing body of any county in which a highway, landing, or railroad crossing is located or upon petition of the governing body of a town with a population of 3,500 or less, or on its own motion, the Board may discontinue any highway, landing, or railroad crossing in the secondary state highway system as a part thereof in any case in which the Board deems such highway, landing, or railroad crossing not required for public convenience. If the Board on its own motion desires to discontinue any such highway, landing, or railroad crossing, the Board shall give notice to the affected governing body at least 30 days prior to such discontinuance. In addition, in cases where only a highway or landing or the maintenance thereof is to be discontinued, the Board shall give notice of such intention to the public at least 30 days prior to such action by publishing such notice in at least one issue in a newspaper having general circulation in the county in which the affected highway or landing is situate d and, where practicable, by a registered letter to each landowner whose property abuts the section of highway or landing to be discontinued. For the purposes of this section, the Board may, where practicable, rely upon the tax records of the county to d etermine the names and addresses of such owners. These additional notice provisions shall not be required in cases where the section of highway to be discontinued has been replaced by a new highway serving the same users. If the governing body of any cou nty or town requests a hearing, or upon petition of any landowner whose property abuts a highway or landing that is to be discontinued, the Board shall hold a hearing in the county in which the highway, landing, or railroad crossing is located in order t o ascertain whether or not such highway, landing, or railroad crossing should be discontinued. From the finding of the Board, an appeal shall lie to the circuit court of the county in which such highway, landing, or railroad crossing is located and the p rocedure thereon shall conform to the procedure prescribed in § 33.2-905. The jurisdiction and procedure for abandonment of highways and landings discontinued as parts of the secondary state highway system in accordance with this article shall remain in the local governing bodies. C. In cases wh ere the Chief Engineer of the Department recommends that it is appropriate in connection with the completion of a construction or maintenance project to discontinue any highway, landing, or railroad crossing in the secondary state highway system, the Com missioner of Highways may discontinue such highway, landing, or railroad crossing as he deems proper. The entry by the Commissioner of Highways upon the records of the Department of the discontinuance shall be sufficient to constitute such discontinuance . History History.

Meaning and effect of discontinuance.  Discontinuance of a secondary road means merely that it is removed from the state secondary road system. Discontinuance of a road is a determination only that it no longer serves public convenience warranting its maintenance at public expense. The effect of discontinuance upon a road is not to eliminate it as a public road or to render it unavailable for public use. Ord v. Fugate, 207 Va. 752, 152 S.E.2d 54, 1967 Va. LEXIS 132 (1967). When hearing required.  There can be no doubt that the legislature meant that a hearing, to ascertain whether a secondary road should be discontinued, is required only if such a hearing is requested by the local governing body.

The governi ng body of any county on its own motion or upon petition of any interested landowner may cause any section of the secondary state highway system, or any crossing by the highway of the lines of a railroad company or crossing by the lines of a railroad com pany of the highway, deemed by it to be no longer necessary for the uses of the secondary state highway system to be abandoned altogether as a public highway, a public landing, or a public railroad crossing by complying substantially with the procedure p rovided in this section. B. The governi ng body of the county shall give notice of its intention to abandon any such highway, landing, or railroad crossing (i) by posting a notice of such intention at least three days before the first day of a regular term of the circuit court at the front doo r of the courthouse of the county in which the section of the highway, landing, or railroad crossing sought to be abandoned as a public highway, public landing, or public railroad crossing is located or (ii) by posting notice in at least three places on and along the highway, landing, or railroad crossing sought to be abandoned for at least 30 days and in either case by publishing notice of its intention in two or more issues of a newspaper having general circulation in the county. In addition, the gove rning body of the county shall give notice of its intention to abandon such highway, landing, or railroad crossing to the Board or the Commissioner of Highways. In any case in which the highway, landing, or railroad crossing proposed to be abandoned lies in two or more counties, the governing bodies of such counties shall not abandon such highway, landing, or railroad crossing unless and until all affected governing bodies agree. The procedure in such cases shall conform mutatis mutandis to the procedur e prescribed for the abandonment of a highway, landing, or railroad crossing located entirely within a county.When the governing body of a county gives notice of intention to abandon a public landing, the governing body shall also give such notice to the Department of Wildlife Resources. C. If one or m ore landowners in the county whose property abuts the highway, landing, or railroad crossing proposed to be abandoned, or if only a section of a highway, landing, or railroad crossing is proposed to be abandoned, whose property abuts such section, or the Board or the Department of Wildlife Resources, in the case of a public landing, files a petition with the governing body of the county within 30 days after notice is posted and published as provided in this section, the governing body of the county shal l hold a public hearing on the proposed abandonment and shall give notice of the time and place of the hearing by publishing such information in at least two issues in a newspaper having general circulation in the county and shall also give notice to the Board or, if a public landing is sought to be abandoned, to the Department of Wildlife Resources. D. If a petiti on for a public hearing is not filed as provided in this section, or if after a public hearing is held the governing body of the county is satisfied that no public necessity exists for the continuance of the section of the secondary highway as a public h ighway or the railroad crossing as a public railroad crossing or the landing as a public landing or that the safety and welfare of the public would be served best by abandoning the section of highway, the landing, or the railroad crossing as a public hig hway, public landing, or public railroad crossing, the governing body of the county shall (i) within four months of the 30-day period during which notice was posted where no petition for a public hearing was filed or (ii) within four months after the pub lic hearing adopt an ordinance or resolution abandoning the section of highway as a public highway, or the landing as a public landing, or the railroad crossing as a public railroad crossing, and with that ordinance or resolution the section of highway s hall cease to be a public highway, a public landing, or a public railroad crossing. If the governing body is not so satisfied, it shall dismiss the application within the applicable four months provided in this subsection. E. A finding b y the governing body of a county that a section of the secondary state highway system is no longer necessary for the uses of the secondary state highway system may be made if the following conditions exist: 1. The h ighway is located within a residence district as defined in § 46.2-100; 2. The residence district is located within a county having a density of population exceeding 1,000 per square mile; 3. Continued operation of the section of highway in question constitutes a threat to the public safety and welfare; and 4. Alternate routes for use after abandonment of the highway are readily available. F. In consider ing the abandonment of any section of highway under the provisions of this section, due consideration shall be given to the historic value, if any, of such highway. G. Any ordinan ce or resolution of abandonment issued in compliance with this section shall give rise in subsequent proceedings, if any, to a presumption of adequate justification for the abandonment. H. No public l anding shall be abandoned unless the Board of Wildlife Resources shall by resolution concur in such abandonment. History History.

Procedure under this section and under § 33.1-155 distinguished.  The General Assembly intended by this section and § 33.1-155 to specify two procedures available to the governing bodies in abandoning roads in the secondary h ighway system. The underlying purpose of the two sections appears to rest in the construction of a new road under the alternative procedure provided in § 33.1-155, whereas the more complicated procedure provided by this section makes no provision for the construction of a new road in lieu of the abandoned road. Hudson v. AMOCO, 152 F. Supp. 757, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3462 (D. Va. 1957), aff'd, 253 F.2d 27, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3818 (4th Cir. 1958). When abandonment proceedings are undertaken under § 33.1-155, the construction of a new road in lieu of the old which serves the same citizens as the old road is contemplated. The more complex procedure provided for in this section is not predicated upon, nor does it require, construction of a new road in lieu of the abandoned road. When a new road is constructed, the county board is not required to adopt the procedure provided for in this section but may act under § 33.1-155. AMOCO v. Leaman, 199 Va. 637, 101 S.E.2d 540, 1958 Va. LEXIS 109 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L. Rev. 628 (1958)). The construction, maintenance and abandonment of highways is a matter of universal concern to all residents of a county, not necessarily those individuals who reside on the road involved. Board of Supvrs. v. VEPCO, 213 Va. 407, 192 S.E.2d 768, 1972 Va. LEXIS 375 (1972). Section adequately protects constitutional rights of all interested parties.  This section and § 33.1-152 adequately protect the constitutional rights of all interested parties involved in the abandonment of a public road. Board of Supvr s. v. VEPCO, 213 Va. 407, 192 S.E.2d 768, 1972 Va. LEXIS 375 (1972). Basis for abandonment.  The statutes nowhere state that only highway purposes shall be the basis for abandonment and there is nothing in the statutes to justify this narrow const ruction. Smith v. Board of Supvrs., 201 Va. 87, 109 S.E.2d 501, 1959 Va. LEXIS 197 (1959). This section is in the disjunctive and a road may be abandoned if either requirement is met. Smith v. Board of Supvrs., 201 Va. 87, 109 S.E.2d 501, 1959 Va. LEXIS 197 (1959). Conditional abandonment facilitates use of discontinuing power.  The reasonable and convenient exercise of the discontinuing power in many cases would be seriously hindered or wholly prevented if conditional abandonment were no t permitted. Smith v. Board of Supvrs., 201 Va. 87, 109 S.E.2d 501, 1959 Va. LEXIS 197 (1959). Conditional abandonment of three sections of road held proper under the facts and circum stances. Smith v. Board of Supvrs., 201 Va. 87, 109 S.E.2d 501, 1959 Va. LEXIS 197 (1959). Discontinuance and abandonment are not the same thing. Ord v. Fugate, 207 Va. 752, 152 S. E.2d 54, 1967 Va. LEXIS 132 (1967). When abandonment procedure to be invoked.  The General Assembly contemplated that the abandonment procedure of this section and § 33.1-152 would be invoked in situations where abandonment could adversel y affect, not the travelling public at large, but an individual party or a few parties. Board of Supvrs. v. Horne, 215 Va. 238, 208 S.E.2d 56, 1974 Va. LEXIS 265 (1974). The power of abandonment is predicated upon public disuse, not upon excessive public use . Board of Supvrs. v. Horne, 215 Va. 238, 208 S.E.2d 56, 1974 Va. LEXIS 265 (1974). Secondary road not to be abandoned because of excessive public use.  This section and § 33.1-152 were not intended by the General Assembly to authorize a local board to abandon a secondary public road because its utilization by the public becomes too great. Board of Supvrs. v. Horne, 215 Va. 238, 208 S.E.2d 56, 1974 Va. LEXIS 265 (1974). Reason for restricting local boards power to abandon secondary roads.  When a heavily travelled road is abandoned and no new road is constructed to replace it, the capacity for public use is diminished, the traffic burden is shifted to other roads, and public use is encumbered. That was an important reason why the General Assembly saw fit in enacting this section to r...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_33.2-910"><akn:num>§ 33.2-910</akn:num><akn:heading>Appeal to circuit court</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Any one or more of the landowners whose property abuts the highway, landing, or railroad crossing proposed to be abandoned, or if only a section of a highway, landing, or railroad crossing is proposed to be abandoned, whose property abuts such section of the highway, landing, or railroad crossing, and who petitioned for a public hearing under § 33.2-909 or the Commissioner of Highways, or if a public landing is prop osed to be abandoned, the Director of the Department of Wildlife Resources, may within 30 days from the adoption of an ordinance or resolution by the governing body of the county appeal from the ordinance or resolution to the circuit court of the county in which the section of highway, the public landing, or the railroad crossing sought to be abandoned under § 33.2-909 is located.

One class consists of interested land owners of a county who become petitioners by filing with its governing body a petition for the abandonment of a road. The other class of petitioners in this section consists of landowners of the county affected by such proposed abandonment of a r oad who become petitioners by the filing of a request or petition with the governing body for a public hearing on the proposed abandonment.

Landowner who petitions for abandonment may appeal adverse decision.  The right of an interested landowner who initiates by petition a proceeding for the abandonment of a road to appeal an adverse decision by the governing body is c ontemplated and preserved. Board of Supvrs. v. VEPCO, 213 Va. 407, 192 S.E.2d 768, 1972 Va. LEXIS 375 (1972). When abandonment procedure to be invoked.  The General Assembly contemplated that the abandonment procedure of this section and § 33.1-151 would be invoked in situations where abandonment could adversel y affect, not the travelling public at large, but an individual party or a few parties. Board of Supvrs. v. Horne, 215 Va. 238, 208 S.E.2d 56, 1974 Va. LEXIS 265 (1974). Secondary road not to be abandoned because of excessive public use.  This section and § 33.1-151 were not intended by the General Assembly to authorize a local board to abandon a secondary public road because its utilization by the public becomes too great. Board of Supvrs. v. Horne, 215 Va. 238, 208 S.E.2d 56, 1974 Va. LEXIS 265 (1974). Necessary.  The term necessary has a distinct meaning in the context of statutes and judicial decisions concerning the use of public roads. When applied to a public r oad, necessary is used in the statutes and judicial decisions, not in the sense of being absolutely indispensable to communications between two points, but with relation to the purposes for which public highways are established, namely, the reasonable ac commodation of the traveling public. Kirby v. Town of Claremont, 243 Va. 484, 416 S.E.2d 695, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2826, 1992 Va. LEXIS 38 (1992). Scenic value can be sufficient of itself, as a matter of law, to support a finding of pu blic necessity. Kirby v. Town of Claremont, 243 Va. 484, 416 S.E.2d 695, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2826, 1992 Va. LEXIS 38 (1992). Public necessity established.  Where uncontroverted evidence was that the road leads to a place of scenic beauty, 17 town residents provided extensive evidence that they and other residents of the town regularly use the road for sightseeing purposes, evidence showed that town residents use the road to view a variety of wildlife including cranes, beavers, bald eagles, deer and blue herons, and town residents testified that they enjoyed bringing guests to see the beautiful view and that they considered this view to be an asset of the community, testimony was sufficient to support the finding of the trial court that there was a public necessity, that is, a reasonable accommodation of the public, which would be served by allowing the road to continue in use. Kirby v. Town of Claremont, 243 Va. 484, 416 S.E.2d 695, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2826, 1992 Va. LEXIS 38 (1992). Court to hear matter de novo.  The language of this section is mandatory. It provides that, on appeal from the action of the board, the circuit court shall hear the matter de novo. This means that the court must hear or try the case on its merits from beginning to end as if no trial or hearing had been held by the board and without any presumption in favor of the boards decision. Hiner v. Wenger, 197 Va. 869, 91 S.E.2d 637, 1956 Va . LEXIS 166 (1956). Duty of trial court when defendants contention supported by substantial evidence.  Defendants contended that if the section of the road were abandoned and closed they would not at all times have a reasonable access to their lands. When this issu e was presented and supported by substantial evidence it was the duty of the trial court to make the board of supervisors a party to the proceedings and to enter such order or orders as may have been necessary to afford defendants a reasonable and conven ient means of ingress and egress from a public highway to their land, as directed by the statute. Hiner v. Wenger, 197 Va. 869, 91 S.E.2d 637, 1956 Va. LEXIS 166 (1956). The phrase public welfare is broader than necessity. Smith v. Board of Su pvrs., 201 Va. 87, 109 S.E.2d 501, 1959 Va. LEXIS 197 (1959). Sufficient evidence supporting nonabandonment on public welfare grounds.  Evidence indicating that over its 38-year existence, there had never been a motor vehicle accident on the road combined with the evidence of the town residents  use of the road for access to view scenic beauty, supported the trial courts conclusion that the public welfare would not be served best by abandonment of the road.

The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Procedure under this section and under § 33.1-151 distinguished.  The General Assembly intended by this section and § 33.1-151 to specify two procedures available to the governing bodies in abandoning roads in the secondary h ighway system. The underlying purpose of the two sections appears to rest in the construction of a new road under the alternative procedure provided in this section, whereas the more complicated procedure provided by § 33.1-151 makes no provision for the construction of a new road in lieu of the abandoned road. Hudson v. AMOCO, 152 F. Supp. 757, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3462 (D. Va. 1957), aff'd, 253 F.2d 27, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3818 (4th Cir. 1958). When abandonment proceedings are undertaken under this section, the construction of a new road in lieu of the old which serves the same citizens as the old road i s contemplated. The more complex procedure provided for in § 33.1-151 is not predicated upon, nor does it require, construction of a new road in lieu of the abandoned road. When a new road is constructed, the county board is not required to adopt the procedure provided for in § 33.1-151 but may act under this section. AMOCO v. Leaman, 199 Va. 637, 101 S.E.2d 540, 1958 Va. LEXIS 109 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L. Rev. 628 (1958)). Discontinuance and abandonment are not the same thing. Ord v. Fugate, 207 Va. 752, 152 S. E.2d 54, 1967 Va. LEXIS 132 (1967). The phrase a new road which serves the same citizens as the old road is to be liberally construed and a wide discretion must be accorded the board in its determination to abandon or alter a road, otherwise the purpose of this section, enacted for the benefit of the public, would be impaired or defeated. AMOCO v. Leaman, 199 Va. 637 , 101 S.E.2d 540, 1958 Va. LEXIS 109 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L. Rev. 628 (1958)). The wording of this section providing for a new road which serves the same citizens as the old road must be liberally construed to permit discretionary ac tion by the board. Hudson v. AMOCO, 152 F. Supp. 757, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3462 (D. Va. 1957), aff'd, 253 F.2d 27, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3818 (4th Cir. 1958). Essential findings.  This section makes no provision for a finding that some public utility or public interest must be served by any abandonment or vacation. The essen tial findings are: (1) that the road be altered; (2) that a new road be constructed in lieu thereof; (3) that the new road serve the same citizens as the old road; and (4) that approval of the State Highway Commissioner (now Commonwealth Transportation C ommissioner) be obtained. Hudson v. AMOCO, 152 F. Supp. 757, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3462 (D. Va. 1957), aff'd, 253 F.2d 27, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3818 (4th Cir. 1958). Review of action of county board.  The General Assembly made no provision for an appeal to a court from the county boards findings and action under this section. In the absence of such a provis ion the Supreme Court of Appeals may not review the boards action in the absence of fraud or manifest abuse of discretion. AMOCO v. Leaman, 199 Va. 637, 101 S.E.2d 540, 1958 Va. LEXIS 109 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L. Rev. 628 (1958)). As the General Assembly made no provision for an appeal to any court, from the resolution of the county board of supervisors making such a finding that a new road will serve the same citizens as the old road, it must be assumed that courts were not intended to review such findings in the absence of fraud or manifest abuse of discretion. Hudson v. AMOCO, 152 F. Supp. 757, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3462 (D. Va. 1957), aff'd, 253 F.2d 27, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3818 (4th Cir. 1958). Weight of boards finding that new road will serve same citizens as old.  When the road to be altered or abandoned is not a way of necessity and does not abut the property of an objector but is reached by traveling over or across anothe r public road that abuts the objectors property, a finding by the board that the new road serves the same citizens as the old road may not be successfully challenged in the absence of fraud or flagrant hardship evidencing abuse of discretion by the b oard. AMOCO v. Leaman, 199 Va. 637, 101 S.E.2d 540, 1958 Va. LEXIS 109 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L. Rev. 628 (1958)). Ultimate exclusive use of abandoned highway may be for private interest.  A highway may be lawfully abandoned when another and more adequate highway serving the same citizens as the old road is constructed, although the ultimate exclusi ve use of the abandoned highway may be for a private interest. Hudson v. AMOCO, 152 F. Supp. 757, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3462 (D. Va. 1957), aff'd, 253 F.2d 27, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3818 (4th Cir. 1958). Complainants were not in the class of citizens who were being served by an aband oned secondary road where they had access to it only by way of a private road easement, not a way of necessity, and also had access to another secondary road. Hudson v. AMOCO, 152 F. Supp. 757, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3462 (D. Va. 1957), aff'd, 253 F.2d 27 , 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3818 (4th Cir. 1958). A secondary route was legally abandoned and a primary route altered, improved and reloca ted as permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of this section. AMOCO v. Leaman, 199 Va. 637, 101 S.E.2d 540, 1958 Va. LEXIS 109 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L.

C. Upon petiti on of a local governing body, the Board may transfer real estate acquired incidental to the construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of the secondary state highway system that constitutes a section of public highway to the local g overning body, and upon such transfer, such section of highway shall cease being a part of the secondary state highway system.Any such conveyance shall be subject to approval of the Board by resolution and recorded in the minutes of the Board.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Abandonment of bridge.  The county may abandon a bridge that is neither in the State Highway System nor the secondary highway system if the bridge is no longer necessary or if abandonmen t would serve the public interest. Upon such abandonment, the bridges ownership normally will revert to the owner of the underlying fee, if any such owner exists. If the county owns the fee, it lawfully may convey the bridge property to a private par ty in exchange for consideration by either a public or private sale, and, such consideration may include the countys making of a monetary payment to the purchaser.

Such appeal shall be filed by petition in the clerks office of such court, setting out the action or inaction appealed from and the grounds for appeal. Upon the filing of such petition, the clerk of the circuit court shall docket the appeal, giving it a preferred status, and if the appeal is by any of the landowners who filed a petition with the governing body for a public hearing, notice of such appeal shall be served upon the attorney for the Commonwealth and the g overning body.

The Commiss ioner of Highways is vested with the power to acquire by purchase, gift, or power of eminent domain such lands, structures, rights-of-way, franchises, easements, and other interest in lands, including lands under water and riparian rights, of any person, association, partnership, corporation, or municipality or political subdivision, deemed necessary for the construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance, and repair of the public highways of the Commonwealth and for these purposes and all other p urposes incidental thereto may condemn property in fee simple and rights-of-way of such width and on such routes and grades and locations as the Commissioner of Highways may deem requisite and suitable, including locations for permanent, temporary, conti nuous, periodical, or future use and rights or easements incidental thereto and lands, quarries, and locations, with rights of ingress and egress, containing gravel, clay, sand, stone, rock, timber, and any other road materials deemed useful or necessary in carrying out the purposes of this subsection. B. The Commiss ioner of Highways is authorized to exercise the power provided under subsection A within municipalities on projects that are constructed with state or federal participation if requested by the municipality concerned. Whenever the Commissioner of Highways has acquired property pursuant to a request of the municipality, he shall convey the title so acquired to the municipality, except that rights-of-way or easements acquired for the relocation of a railroad, public utility company, or public service corpo ration or company, another political subdivision, or a cable television company in connection with such projects shall be conveyed to that entity in accordance with § 33.2-1014. The authority for such conveyance shall apply to acquisitions made by the Commissioner of Highways pursuant to previous requests as well as any subsequent request. C. Any offer b y the Commissioner of Highways to a property owner with respect to payment of compensation for the prospective taking of property and damage to property not taken incident to the purposes of this section shall separately state (i) the property to be take n and the amount of compensation offered therefor and (ii) the nature of the prospective damage or damages and the amount of compensation offered for each such prospective damage. The amount of the offer shall not be less than the amount of the approved appraisal of the fair market value of such property, in accordance with the provisions of § 25.1-417, or the current assessed value of such property for real estate tax purposes, unless the property has physically changed in a material and substantial way since the current assessment date such that the real estate tax assessment no longer represents a fair valuation of the property, when the entire parcel for which the assessment is made is to be acquired, whichever is greater. Any such appraisal use d by the Commissioner of Highways as the basis for an offer shall be prepared by a real estate appraiser licensed in accordance with Chapter 20.1 (§ 54.1-2009 et seq.) of Title 54.1. D. The Commiss ioner of Highways shall also provide to a property owner a copy of any report of status of title prepared in connection with such acquisition if prepared pursuant to subsection D of § 25.1-204. E. In negotiat ing with a property owner with respect to payment for prospective damage to property not taken incident to the purposes of this section, the Commissioner of Highways shall ensure that such property owner or his authorized representative is properly infor med as to the type and amount of foreseeable damage or enhancement. Adequate briefing includes (i) the giving of plats and profiles of the project, showing cuts and fills, together with elevations and grades and (ii) explanation, in lay terms, of all pro posed changes in profile, elevation, and grade of the highway and entrances, including the elevations of proposed pavement and shoulders, both center and edges, with relation to the present pavement and approximate grade of entrances to the property. F. Any option or deed executed by the property owner shall contain a statement that the plans as they affect his property have been fully explained. However, the requirements of this section with respect to information and briefing and the acknowledgment thereof in op tions and deeds shall in no way be construed to affect the validity of any conveyance, to create any right to compensation, or to limit the authority of the Commissioner of Highways to reasonably control the use of public highways so as to promote the pu blic health, safety, and welfare. G. Nothing in this section shall make evidence of tax assessments admissible as proof of value in an eminent domain proceeding. History History.

Fugate, 212 Va. 689, 187 S.E.2d 156, 1972 Va. LEXIS 241 (1972). But necessity or expediency of road is legislative question.  Where the public purpose is established, the necessity or expediency of a road is a legislative question which has been delegated to the Commission (now Board). S tewart v. Fugate, 212 Va. 689, 187 S.E.2d 156, 1972 Va. LEXIS 241 (1972). A determination by the State Highway and Transportation Commission (now Commonwealth Transportation Board) as to the location of, and the necessity for, a road is the exercise of a legislative power, which has been delegated to the Commission (now Board). Its discretion in exercising this power is reviewable by the courts only if it is arbitrarily or capriciously exercised or where there is manifest fraud. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Herndon, 225 Va. 380, 302 S.E.2d 55, 1983 Va. LEXIS 233 (1983). Official determining location of road may exercise large discretion.  The public official or body charged with the duty of determining the location of a public road ordinarily may exercise a large discretion.

Fugate, 212 Va. 689, 187 S.E.2d 156, 1972 Va. LEXIS 241 (1972). Road is public i f it is free in common to all citizens.  Whether a road sought to be constructed is a public road or one merely for the benefit of a private individual is not tested by the fact that such an individual w ill receive a greater benefit than the public generally. The test is not the length of the road, or how many actually use it, but how many have the free and unrestricted right in common to use it. It is a public road if it is free in common to all citize ns. Stewart v. Fugate, 212 Va. 689, 187 S.E.2d 156, 1972 Va. LEXIS 241 (1972).

When the Co mmissioner of Highways determines that any real property will be required in connection with the construction of a transportation project, or project as defined in § 33.2-1700, within a period not exceeding 12 years for the Interstate System or 10 yea rs for any other highway system or transportation project from the time of such determination, and that it would be advantageous to the Commonwealth to acquire such real property, he may proceed to do so. The Commissioner of Highways may lease any real p roperty so acquired to the owner from whom such real property is acquired, if requested by him, and, if not so requested, to another person upon such terms and conditions as in the judgment of the Commissioner of Highways may be in the public interest. I f the transportation project contemplated, or project as defined in § 33.2-1700, has not been let to contract or construction has not commenced within a period of 20 years from the date of the acquisition of such property, and a need for the use of su ch property has not been determined for any alternative transportation project, then upon written demand of the owner, or his heirs or assigns, that is received (i) within 90 days from the expiration of such 20-year period or such extension as provided f or in this section or (ii) within 30 days from publication of a notice of the intent of the Commissioner of Highways to dispose of such property in a newspaper of general circulation in the political subdivision in which the property is located and the C ommissioner of Highways shall notify to the extent practical, the last known owner of said property by certified mail, that such property shall be reconveyed by the Commonwealth to such owner, or his heirs or assigns, upon repayment of the original purch ase price, without interest. If the reconveyance is not concluded within six months from receipt by the Commissioner of Highways of a written demand, the reconveyance opportunity shall lapse. However, the 20-year limit established by this section within which the Department must let to contract or begin construction in order to avoid reconveyance shall be extended by the number of days of delay caused by litigation involving the project or by the failure of the Commonwealth to receive anticipated federa l funds for such project. The 20-year limit may also be extended in those instances in which a project is included in the Six-Year Improvement Program of the Board or the Six-Year Improvement Program for secondary highways prepared by the county boards o f supervisors and in which steps have been taken to move forward. No such reconveyance shall be required for rights-of-way acquired for future transportation improvements at the request of local governing bodies or for rights-of-way acquired for state co nstruction designed to provide future additional lanes or other enhancements to existing transportation facilities. B. If any real property acquired under this article for use in connection with a transportation project is subsequently offered for sale by the Department and such property is suitable for independent development, the Department shall offer the property for sale at fa ir market value to the owner from whom it was acquired before such property is offered for sale to any other person. The Commissioner of Highways shall notify, to the extent practicable, the last known owner of such property by certified mail, and the ow ner shall have 30 days from the date of such notice to advise the Commissioner of Highways of his interest in purchasing the property.

Annotations CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Grantor of property acquires a possibility of reverter.  Under a former version of § 33.1-90, the Virginia General Assembly intended to grant to a property owner a contingent right to reconveyance of property acquire d by the Commonwealth of Virginia in anticipation of its need for a public highway project if the property so acquired was not ultimately used for that purpose; accordingly, a corporation that made such a conveyance to the Commonwealth in 1973 was grante d an interest in that property in the form of a possibility of reverter. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Windsor Indus., 272 Va. 64, 630 S.E.2d 514, 2006 Va. LEXIS 69 (2006). Reconveyance of property to grantors successor was required.  Virginia Commissioner of Transportation was properly ordered to reconvey to a successor corporation at its original purchase price property that was acquired by t he Commonwealth of Virginia by advance acquisition from the successors predecessor in 1973 but that was no longer needed for a transportation purpose; amendments made in § 33.1-90 after the original transfer applied to the predecessors possibi lity of reverter, the right to demand reconveyance ripened when the Commonwealth offered the property for public sale in 2004, the successors president was the proper entity to demand reconveyance, and his demand was timely under § 33.1-90. Common wealth Transp. Comm'r v. Windsor Indus., 272 Va. 64, 630 S.E.2d 514, 2006 Va. LEXIS 69 (2006). Statutory amendments apply to grantors possibility of reverter.  Until a possibility of reverter retained by a corporation that conveyed property to the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1973 under a former version of this section ve sted into an enforceable right, the contingencies upon which it depended and the procedures for exercising the right accrued remained subject to modification by future amendment, including extending the period of time before the right could accrue and es tablishing periods of limitation on enforcing the right, so long as such amendments did not fully extinguish the corporations possibility of reverter; amendments made to former § 33.1-90 in 1983 and 1997, before the corporations possibility of reverter became an enforceable right, therefore, amended the corporations possibility of reverter. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Windsor Indus., 272 Va. 64, 630 S.E.2d 514, 2006 Va. LEXIS 69 (2006). Procedures for demanding reconveyance remain subject to amendment.  When there has been a breach of a condition subsequent on which a possibility of reverter created by an advance acquisition depends, the fee vested in the Commonw ealth of Virginia by the original transfer does not automatically revest in the grantor, who must make a written demand under § 33.1-90 to exercise the right to reconveyance; therefore, until 1999 or later when a successor corporation first demanded r econveyance of such property transferred by a predecessor under the version of 33.1-90 in effect in 1973, the Commonwealth remained vested with title to the property, and the contingencies and procedures for making the demand for reconveyance remained su bject to change by amendment of § 33.1-90. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Windsor Indus., 272 Va. 64, 630 S.E.2d 514, 2006 Va. LEXIS 69 (2006). Notice pro vision not dependent on prior timely demand.  Requirement in § 33.1-90 that the Virginia Commissioner of Transportation must give notice of an intended sale of property acquired by advance acquisition that is no longer needed for a transportation project and must make a bona fide effort to locate the transferors heirs and assigns, and a corresponding requirement that a demand for reconveyance must be made within 30 days thereafter are stated in the di sjunctive and, thus, are not dependent upon a prior timely demand having been made by the former owner within 90 days from the expiration of the 20-year designated timeframe. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Windsor Indus., 272 Va. 64, 630 S.E.2d 514, 2006 Va. LEXIS 69 (2006). Other statutes of limitati on are superseded.  In determining whether a successor corporations claim for reconveyance of land conveyed to the Commonwealth of Virginia by a predecessor was timely, a trial c ourt improperly relied upon §§ 8.01-248 and 8.01-246(4), and § 8.01-255.1, applicable to actions for re-entry upon land for breach of conditions subsequent, was also inapplicable; these provisions were superseded by the more specific time limita tions of § 33.1-90, which has a comprehensive and broad scope that in effect contains its own statute of limitations. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Windsor Indus., 272 Va. 64, 630 S.E.2d 514, 2006 Va. LEXIS 69 (2006). Complaint for declaratory judgment was timely demand for reconveyance.  1999 inquiry by a successor corporations president about reconveyance of property conveyed to the Commonwealth of Virginia by a predecessor corporation under a former version of this section was not timely under the 90-day requirement as it was then in effect, and the Virginia Transportation Commissioner was statutorily entitled to refuse it, but when the Commis...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_33.2-1006"><akn:num>§ 33.2-1006</akn:num><akn:heading>Reconveyance where property deemed suitable for mass transit purposes</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If any real property that, under the provisions of § 33.2-1005, is or may become eligible for reconveyance is deemed suitable for the mass transit purposes of a publ ic agency, authority, instrumentality, or public service corporation or company, and such entity has submitted tentative plans to the Commissioner of Highways for a mass transit facility utilizing such real property, or portions thereof, and, prior to th e eligibility of that real property for reconveyance under this article, the Commissioner of Highways has approved the use of such real property for mass transit purposes, such real estate shall not be eligible for reconveyance under those sections. Upon the formulation of final plans for the facility, the Commissioner of Highways is authorized to enter into an agreement with any such entity for the conveyance of the property to such entity. Any property or portions thereof not necessary for the mass tr ansit facility shall become eligible for reconveyance under the provisions of § 33.2-1005 upon a determination of the final plans for the facility. Such agreement shall provide for the payment to the Commonwealth of an amount equal to that expended by the Commonwealth in the acquisition of such real property, including proportionate administrative costs and costs under the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended. Upon payment of the agreed consideration, the Commissioner of Highways shall convey the specified property to the facility. However, if construction of such planned facilities is not commenced within 10 years from the date of the agreement between the transit agency and the Commis sioner of Highways, the persons who would otherwise have been authorized to petition for reconveyance under § 33.2-1005 or their heirs or assigns may seek reconveyance under the same procedures and on the same basis as established in § 33.2-1005. This section shall not compel the Commissioner of Highways to convey any such property to such entities in contravention of any federal law or regulation affecting the disposition of real property acquired for highway purposes when such property is no longer needed for such purposes when such property has been acquired with federal funding participation.

Proceedings for condemnation.  Defendant insurer was entitled to receive moneys from eminent domain proceedings brought pursuant to subsection A of § 33.1-89 and § 33.1-98, and deposited with the Fairfax County Circuit Court, and to apply them to its attorney fees, because the parties deed of trust explicitly stated that plaintiff insured assigned such proceeds in full and insurer could apply them as it saw fit. Breton, LLC v. Lincol n Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 805 F. Supp. 2d 251, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93448 (E.D. Va. 2011). Failure to move for transfer.  Although eminent domain proceedings should be brought on the law side of the court, under the circumstances no prejudice was shown where appellants failed to move for transfer to the law side under former § 8.01-270 and where the matter was first raised on appeal. Brown v. May, 202 Va. 300, 117 S.E.2d 101, 1960 Va. LEXIS 222 (1960). Whether cases tried separate ly or together.  It was within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether or not petitions to condemn lands of several persons for the same project shall be trie d separately or together.

LEXIS 222 (1960) (decided under this section as it stood before the 1960 amendment). The discovery deposition authorized by former Rule of Court 3:23 was not available in em inent domain proceedings because such proceedings are not governed by the Rules of Court. Hornback v. State Hwy. Comm'r, 205 Va. 50, 135 S.E.2d 136, 1964 Va. LEXIS 144 (1964). Mandamus to compel conde mnation proceedings.  Where condemnation proceedings should have been instituted under this section to the end that a landowners damages, if any, might be ascertained and paid to h im, a peremptory writ of mandamus was issued by the Supreme Court to compel the institution of such proceedings. Hicks v. Anderson, 182 Va. 195, 28 S.E.2d 629, 1944 Va. LEXIS 168 (1944). The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court could not be invoked to issue a writ of mandamus to require the Commissioner to condemn land which he believed alre ady to be property of the State. Gilliam v. Harris, 203 Va. 316, 124 S.E.2d 188, 1962 Va. LEXIS 145 (1962). Mandamus will never issue in doubtful cases, and therefore was denied where petitioner failed to prove his allegation that highway construction damaged his buildi ng. Legum v. Harris, 205 Va. 99, 135 S.E.2d 125, 1964 Va. LEXIS 150 (1964). Declaratory judgment as to ownership.  The Commissioner is not put under a duty to condemn land which he believes to be the property of the State. Under such circumstances, a declaratory judgment proce eding is an appropriate means by which affected landowners may obtain a determination of the ownership of the land. Gilliam v.

The amount to be paid into the court as provided in subdivision A 1 or represented by a certificate of deposit as provided in subdivision A 2 shall be the amount that the Commissioner of Highways estimates to be the fair value of the land taken, or interest therein sought, and damage done, which estimate shall be based on a bona fide appraisal if required by § 25.1-417; however, such estimate shall not be less than the current assessed value of the land for real estate tax purposes, unless the property has phys ically changed in a material and substantial way since the current assessment date such that the real estate tax assessment no longer represents a fair valuation of the property, when the entire parcel for which the assessment has been made is to be acqu ired. C. If the Comm issioner of Highways makes a payment into court as provided in subdivision A 1, the court shall also record a certificate of take pursuant to § 33.2-1021.

The Commiss ioner of Highways shall not be permitted to force relocation on improved owner-occupied property until the owner is permitted to withdraw the funds represented by the certificate filed with the court. However, if the owner refuses to withdraw the funds r epresented by the certificate filed with the court or if the Commissioner of Highways reasonably believes that the owner does not possess clear title to the property being taken, that ownership of the property is disputed, or that certain owners cannot b e located, the Commissioner of Highways may petition the court to establish that the owner does not possess clear title, that the ownership of the property is in dispute, that certain owners cannot be located, or that the owner has refused to withdraw th e funds represented by the certificate filed with the court, and request that the Commissioner of Highways be given authority to force relocation. F. Nothing in this section shall make evidence of tax assessments admissible as proof of value in an eminent domain proceeding. History History.

CASE NOTES Methods of acquiring land.  This article provides two methods for acquiring land for the construction of public highways. Under one method the Highway Commissioner (now Commonwealth Transpor tation Commissioner) filed a petition pursuant to former § 33.1-101, and title vested in the Commonwealth only after it had paid to the landowner the compensation and damages fixed by the court in its order confirming, altering or modifying the commis sioners report. Under the other method the Highway Commissioner (now Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner) files a certificate calling for the payment of the sum (or pays into court the sum) that he estimates as being the fair value of the proper ty taken. Title to the property vests in the Commonwealth upon the filing of such certificate. If the Highway Commissioner (now Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner) has not instituted condemnation proceedings before filing the certificate, he must ( unless the parties have agreed upon just compensation and damages) file a condemnation petition asking for the appointment of commissioners to determine just compensation and damages.

R. 3:9A [see now Rule 3:12], authorizes a tax payer availing himself of this section to petition the court to join the lienholder as a party and petition the court either to order the check made payable to the lienholder or make specific provisions for the lienholders liability for refund of any excess withdrawal. Thus, where the taxpayer did not so petition the court, but simply requested that the court impose liability upon the person to whom the excess was paid, he was, within the meaning of this section, paid and therefore was liabl e for refunding the amount of excess withdrawn that exceeded the actual condemnation award.

Adjustment expenses are relevant factors in determining the diminution in the fair marke t value of the residue while replacement expenses are not. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Parr, 217 Va. 522, 230 S.E.2d 253, 1976 Va. LEXIS 315 (1976). The inconvenience resulting from the take and certain expenses necessary to adjust the residue to the new conditions created by the take are relevant consideratio ns. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Parr, 217 Va. 522, 230 S.E.2d 253, 1976 Va. LEXIS 315 (1976). But such cost is not the measure of damages and cannot be recovered specifically; it is merely a factor of evaluation. Nor is the sum of all adjustment expenses the proper measure of damages. The true test of damages to the residue of the land not taken is the difference in value before and immediately after the taking, less any enhancement resulting from the take. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Parr, 217 Va. 522, 230 S.E.2d 253, 1976 Va. LEXIS 315 (1976). Party liable for property damages.  To compensate a plaintiff out of a states coffers for the tortious and negligent acts of its agents would violate basic notions of sovereign immunity, ultimat ely making the government liable for the unauthorized acts of those agents. Thus, a property owners claims that a contractor and subcontractor who were hired to work on a highway construction project for the Commonwealth of Virginia exceeded the scop e of their authority under § 33.1-94 and caused damage to her land were properly brought in a tort suit rather than in a condemnation proceeding.

If the amou nt of an award in a condemnation proceeding is greater than that deposited with the court or represented by a certificate of deposit, the excess amount, together with interest accrued on such excess amount, shall be paid into court for the person entitle d thereto.

Section does not prescribe date when payment may be made into court.  This section, though authorizing the payment of interest computed from the date of the filing of the certificate to the date of payment of the excess into court, does not prescribe the date when payment may be made into court. Whitworth v. State Hwy. Comm'r, 209 Va. 95, 161 S.E.2d 698, 1968 Va. LEXIS 201 (1968). The date when payment may be made into court was prescribed in former § 33.1-113. No other Code section relating to condemnation for highway purposes prescribes the time when the Highway Commissioner (now Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner) may pay funds into court to satisfy an award. And former § 33.1-113 authorized payment in to court only after the Commissioners report has been confirmed, altered or modified by the court. Whitworth v. State Hwy. Comm'r, 209 Va. 95, 161 S.E.2d 698, 1968 Va. LEXIS 201 (1968). Construction with other law.  This section, along with former § 25-46.28 (see now §§ 25.1-240, 25.1-241), § 33.1-124, and Va. Sup. Ct. R. Rule 3:9A [see now Rule 3:12], authorizes a taxpayer availing himself of § 33.1-124 to petition the court to join the lienholder as a party and petition the court either to order the check made payable to the lienholder or make specific provisions for the lienholders liability for refund of any excess withdrawal. Thus, where the taxpayer did not so petition the court, but simply requested that the court impose liability upon the person to whom the excess was paid, he was, within the meaning of this section, paid and therefore was liable for refunding the amount of excess withdrawn that exceeded the actual condemnation award. Lynch v. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r, 255 Va. 227, 495 S.E.2d 247, 1998 Va. LEXIS 15 (1998). Interest on excess of award.  The court should allow interest on the excess (if any) of the award, as finally approved by the court, over the certificated amount computed from the filing of th e certificate under § 33.1-121 to the date of the order confirming, altering or modifying the Commissioners award or, if later, to the date of payment into court. Whitworth v. State Hwy. Comm'r, 209 Va. 95, 161 S.E.2d 698, 1968 Va. LEXIS 201 (1968 ). Calc ulation of interest from date of wrongful entry error.  Since interest cannot be awarded against the state without its consent, as manifested by an act of the legislature, and since this section, in plain terms, fixes the date of the deposit as the time from which interest is to run on a condemnation award, the trial courts ruling that interest on an award, which was in excess of the amount deposited by the condemnor, should run from the date of wrongful entry by the condemnor was error. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r v. Trustees of Parsonage, 220 Va. 402, 258 S.E.2d 503, 1979 Va. LEXIS 272 (1979). Post-award interest co ntrolled by this section.  In a condemnation proceeding, owner was not entitled to post-award interest at the judgment rate, pursuant to former § 6.1-330.10, from the date of the order o verruling exceptions to the commissioners report until the completion of the case on appeal. Post-award interest on condemnation awards is controlled by this section, which describes the situations in which interest is to be awarded and provides that in no other instance shall interest be allowed on any award.

Upon the co mpletion of any contract for the construction of any state highway project awarded by the Board or by the Commissioner of Highways to any contractor, if the contractor fails to receive such settlement as he claims to be entitled to under the contract for himself or for his subcontractors or for persons furnishing materials for the contract for costs and expenses caused by the acts or omissions of the Department, he may, within 60 days after the final estimate date, deliver to the Department, through pro per administrative channels as determined by the Department, a written claim for such amount to which he deems himself, his subcontractors, or his material persons entitled under the contract. The final estimate date shall be set forth in a letter from t he Department to the contractor sent by certified mail. The claim shall set forth the facts upon which the claim is based, provided that written notice of the contractors intention to file such claim shall have been given to the Department at the tim e of the occurrence or beginning of the work upon which the claim and subsequent action is based. Within 90 days from receipt of such claim, the Department shall make an investigation and notify the claimant in writing by certified mail of its decision. The claimant and the Department may, however, mutually extend such 90-day period for another 30 days. B. If dissatis fied with the decision, the claimant shall, within 30 days from receipt of the Departments decision, notify the Commissioner of Highways, in writing, that he desires to appear before him, either in person or through counsel, and present any additiona l facts and arguments in support of his claim as previously filed. C. The Commiss ioner of Highways shall schedule such appearance to be held within 30 days of receiving the claimants written request. The claimant and the Commissioner of Highways may, however, mutually agree to schedule such appearance to be held after 30 days but before 60 days from the receipt of the claimants written request.

Department is administrative agency even when deciding contract claim under this section.  The Virginia Department of Transportation is an administrative agency occupying an agency status even when deciding construction contract claims under this sectio n. Commonwealth, Dep't of Hwys. &amp; Transp. v. E.W. Yeatts, Inc., 233 Va. 17, 353 S.E.2d 717, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1851, 1987 Va. LEXIS 145 (1987). General contractor p roper party to assert claim.  Where general contractor, who entered into a contract with State to construct portions of an interstate highway, asserted a claim that its subcontractor incurred additional work not anticipated by general contractor in its contract with State, the circuit judge erred in finding that general contractor was not the proper party to assert the claim; general contractor had filed suit in its own behalf and specificall y alleged that it was damaged as a result of States conduct. Tyger Constr. Co. v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Hwys. &amp; Transp., 17 Va. App. 166, 435 S.E.2d 659, 10 Va. Law Rep. 347, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 454 (1993). Must have direct contractual relationship with Commonwealth.  While contract suits against the Commonwealth were permitted to a limited extent, a direct contractual relationship was contemplated; thus, the trial court did no t err in denying the suretys motions for judgment against the state transportation department, which the surety filed in an attempt to collect on work it performed after it took over work for the original contracting party after that party defaulted on the underlying construction projects, as the surety did not have a direct contractual relationship with the state transportation department and the surety could not show any Virginia law which waived the Commonwealths sovereign immunity regarding the suretys equitable subrogation claim. XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 424, 624 S.E.2d 658, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (2006). Written notice required.  Subsection A of § 33.1-386 barred a contractors claims regarding drilled shaft work, acceleration efforts before April 2004, acceleration efforts after Apr il 2004 unrelated to the alleged inadequacies of work order 39, drilled shaft concrete specification, concrete formwork for foundation caps, piers, and columns, pier 17 foundation cap repair, and work orders 4, 6, 7, and 16 as the contractor did not prov ide the required written notice; neither subsection A of § 33.1-386 nor the contract notice provisions barred the claim for the first winter period as the required written notice was given. Commonwealth v. AMEC Civil, LLC, 54 Va. App. 240, 677 S.E.2d 633, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 278 (2009), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 280 Va. 396, 699 S.E.2d 499, 2010 Va. LEXIS 230 (2010). In an action on a public contract, actual notice could not satisfy the written notice requirement under subsection A of § 33.1-386. However, the construction c ompany provided the Virginia Department of Transportation with timely written notice of its intention to file a claim for damages resulting from a plan error regarding the construction of concrete shafts on a pier on a bridge. Commonwealth v. AMEC Civil LLC, 280 Va. 396, 699 S.E.2d 499, 2010 Va. LEXIS 230 (2010). Prejudgment interest.  Contractor was not entitled to prejudgment interest as: (1) § 33.1-387 authorized the contractors civil action only on the portion of the administrative cl aim denied by the Virginia Department of Transportation; (2) subsection A of § 33.1-386 authorized an administrative claim, but limited it to a recovery of costs and expenses under the contract, and did not address prejudgment interest on contractuall y recoverable costs and expenses; (3) § 8.01-382, did not expressly or by necessary implication apply to the Commonwealth; and (4) the statutory predecessors to § 8.01-382 existed when it was held no court had authorized prejudgment interest claims against the state itself. Commonwealth v. AMEC Civil, LLC, 54 Va. App. 240, 677 S.E.2d 633, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 278 (2009), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 280 Va. 396, 699 S.E.2d 499, 2010 Va. LEXIS 230 (2010). Appellate jurisdiction.  Because § 33.1-192.1 required compliance with § 33.1-386, a suretys right to file a civil action against the Virginia Department of Transportation was d ependent on its compliance with the administrative procedures prescribed by this section; thus, its civil action was an appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, and its appeal from the judgment of the circuit court was within the jurisdictio n of the Court of Appeals. XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. DOT, 269 Va. 362, 611 S.E.2d 356, 2005 Va. LEXIS 38 (2005). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to compl y with written notice requirement.  Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) was not prejudiced by a contractors failure to file a written claim telling VDOT exactly what it already knew. It would violate every principle of fair dealing for VDOT to receive actual notice of the contractors intent to file a claim against it, commence an adversarial course of dealing with the contractor anticipating litigation, and then turn around and say that the contractors claim failed due to a fatal technical omission in its notice. AMEC Civil, L.L.C. v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. Cir. 492, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 64 (Norfolk Feb. 12, 2008). Legal form yields to legal function for purposes of notice provisions.  Court was not confined to the language of § 33.1-386 when interpreting the statute, but could look to other sections of the Code of Virginia for guidance where similar language was employed. The court adhered to the sound logic Virginia courts adopted when interpreting the notice requirements in statutes concerning contract and tort suits against governmental entities, the Medical Malpractice Act, the Workers  Compensation Act, and the zoning statute; in so doing, the court deferred to the broad, deep-seated principle underpinning those statutes that legal form had to yield to the interests of legal function. AMEC Civil, L.L.C. v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. Cir . 492, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 64 (Norfolk Feb. 12, 2008). Public policy function of written notice was achieved through actual notice.  Contractor did not provide VDOT with written notice of its claims as required by § 33.1-386; however, the contractors actual notice served as an official i ndication to VDOT of the contractors opposing contract interpretations and alerted VDOT of the contractors claims, thus giving VDOT the opportunity to take appropriate remedia...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_33.2-1102"><akn:num>§ 33.2-1102</akn:num><akn:heading>Limitation of suits on contracts</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text No suit or action shall be brought against the Department by a contractor or any persons claiming under him or on behalf of a subcontractor of the contractor or a perso n furnishing materials for the contract to the contractor on any contract executed pursuant to this article or by others on any claim arising from the performance of the contract by the contractor, subcontractor, or person furnishing materials to the con tractor, unless the claimant has exhausted the review process provided by § 33.2-1101. Further, no such suit or action shall be brought unless such suit or action is brought within 12 months from receipt of the decision of the Commissioner of Highways . In no event shall any delay therein on the part of the contractor, subcontractor, or person furnishing materials be construed as a reason for extending the time within which such suit or action must be brought. In any case brought against the Departmen t on behalf of a subcontractor or person furnishing materials to the contractor, lack of privity between the parties shall be no defense; however, any such case brought on behalf of a subcontractor or person furnishing materials to the contractor shall o nly be brought for costs and expenses caused by the acts or omissions of the Department and shall not be brought for costs and expenses caused by the contractor.

Privity of contract.  This section was not enacted to eliminate the requirement of privity of contract. APAC-Virginia, Inc. v. Virginia Dep't of Hwy. &amp; Transp., 9 Va. App. 450, 388 S.E .2d 841, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1345, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 26 (1990). Direct contractual relations hip not found.  While contract suits against the Commonwealth were permitted to a limited extent, a direct contractual relationship was contemplated; thus, the trial court did no t err in denying the suretys motions for judgment against the state transportation department, which the surety filed in an attempt to collect on work it performed after it took over work for the original contracting party after that party defaulted on the underlying construction projects, as the surety did not have a direct contractual relationship with the state transportation department and the surety could not show any Virginia law which waived the Commonwealths sovereign immunity regarding the suretys equitable subrogation claim.

As to the Comptroller being a defendant in a contract disputes action, see § 2.2-4364. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Jurisdiction of trial court.  The trial court had jurisdiction as to such portion of claim as was denied by the commissioner, and contrary to the assertion made by the contractor, the trial co urt had the authority to determine not only the amount of any award, but also whether the contractor was entitled to an award. Commonwealth v. Asphalt Roads &amp; Materials, Inc., 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 134 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 3, 1998). Jurisdiction on appeal.  An action under this section is, in legislative intendment, an appeal under subdivision 1 of § 17-116.05 [now § 17.1-405], and on appeal therefrom the court of appeals has jurisdiction. Commonwealth, Dep't of Hwys. &amp; Transp. v. E.W. Yeatts, Inc., 233 Va. 17, 353 S.E.2d 717, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1851, 1987 Va. LEXIS 145 (1987). Because § 33.1-192.1 required compliance with § 33.1-386, a suretys right to file a civil action against the Virginia Department of Transportation was d ependent on its compliance with the administrative procedures prescribed by that section; thus, its civil action was an appeal from the decision of an administrative agency, and its appeal from the judgment of the circuit court was within the jurisdictio n of the Court of Appeals. XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. DOT, 269 Va. 362, 611 S.E.2d 356, 2005 Va. LEXIS 38 (2005). Sovereign immunity.  While contract suits against the Commonwealth were permitted to a limited extent, a direct contractual relationship was contemplated; thus, the trial court did no t err in denying the suretys motions for judgment against the state transportation department, which the surety filed in an attempt to collect on work it performed after it took over work for the original contracting party after that party defaulted on the underlying construction projects, as the surety did not have a direct contractual relationship with the state transportation department and the surety could not show any Virginia law which waived the Commonwealths sovereign immunity regarding the suretys equitable subrogation claim. XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 424, 624 S.E.2d 658, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (2006). Site condition.  In an action on a public construction contract, sustained elevated lake water levels constituted a differing site condition because they were an unknown physical condition of an unusual nature, which differed materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the work provided for in the contract. Commonwealth v. AMEC Civil LLC, 280 Va. 396, 699 S.E.2d 499, 2010 Va. LEXIS 230 (20 10). Prejudgment interest.  Contractor was not entitled to prejudgment interest as: (1) § 33.1-387 authorized the contractors civil action only on the portion of the administrative cl aim denied by the Virginia Department of Transportation; (2) subsection A of § 33.1-386 authorized an administrative claim, but limited it to a recovery of costs and expenses under the contract, and did not address prejudgment interest on contractuall y recoverable costs and expenses; (3) § 8.01-382, did not expressly or by necessary implication apply to the Commonwealth; and (4) the statutory predecessors to § 8.01-382 existed when it was held no court had authorized prejudgment interest claims against the State itself.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Damages and postjudgment interest.  On remand in an action for cost overruns on a government contract, the court calculated and, based on an average daily rate, awarded damages to which the contract or was entitled; but it found no authority creating liability on the Commonwealths part for payment of postjudgment interest. AMEC Civil, LLC v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 83 (Mecklenburg County Aug. 11, 2011), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, No. 2134-11-2, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (Va. Ct. App. May 22, 2012). Sovereign immunity.  Commonwealth of Virginia was entitled to dismissal of the insurance companys claims for alleged overpayments made to the defaulted contractor because the Comm onwealth had not waived sovereign immunity for claims that were based upon an implied contract. Xl Specialty Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. Cir. 606, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 89 (Richmond Feb. 20, 2004). Section 33.1-387 required a direct and express contractual relationship between a contractor and the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) for the contract or to have standing to bring suit against VDOT; in the instant case, the only direct and express contract was between the LLCs predecessor and VDOT and there were no allegations that any direct and express contract ever existed between the LLC and VD OT. Moreover, the contractor, apparently still existed and would be the proper party to the instant action; therefore, any implied-in-fact contract between the LLC and VDOT would be insufficient to create a cause of action under § 33.1-387.

This need can be alleviated in part throug h the creation of a transportation infrastructure bank. The purpose of such bank is to encourage the investment of both public and private funds and to make loans and other financial assistance available to localities, private entities, and other eligibl e borrowers to finance eligible transportation projects. The General Assembly determines that the creation of a transportation infrastructure bank for this purpose is in the public interest, serves a public purpose, and will promote the health, safety, w elfare, convenience, or prosperity of the people of the Commonwealth.

Within any economic development site or airport, the total volume of traffic to be generated shall be taken into consideration i n regard to the overall cost thereof. No such access road shall be constructed or improved on a privately owned economic development site. D.

Text A. The General Assembly finds and declares that there is an increasing demand by the public for more public recreational areas throughout the Commonwealth, therefore creating a need for more access to these areas. There are also many sites of historical significance t o which access is needed.The General Assembly hereby declares it to be in the public interest that access roads and bikeways to public recreational areas and historical sites be provided by using funds obtained from motor fuel tax collections on motor fu el used for propelling boats and ships and funds contained in the highway portion of the Transportation Trust Fund. B. Prior to ma king allocations pursuant to subsection B of § 33.2-358, the Board shall set aside the sum of $3 million initially. This fund shall be expended by the Board for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or improvement of access roads and bikeways within localities. At the close of each succeeding fiscal year, the Board shall replenish this fund to the extent it deems necessary to carry out the purpose intended, provided the balance in the fund plus the replenishment does not exceed $3 million. C. Upon the se tting aside of the funds as provided in this section, the Board shall construct, reconstruct, maintain, or improve access roads and bikeways to public recreational areas and historical sites upon the following conditions: 1. When the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation has designated a public recreational area as such or when the Director of the Department of Historic Resources has determined a site or area to be historic and recommends to the Board that an access road or bikeway be provided or maintained to that area; 2. When the Board pursuant to the recommendation from the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation declares by resolution that the access road or bikeway be provided or m aintained; 3. When the governing body of the locality in which the access road or bikeway is to be provided or maintained passes a resolution requesting the road; and 4. When the governing body of the locality in which the bikeway is to be provided or maintained adopts an ordinance pursuant to Article 7 (§ 15.2-2280 et seq.) of Chapter 22 of Title 1 5.2.No access road or bikeway shall be constructed, reconstructed, maintained, or improved on privately owned property. D. Any access road constructed, reconstructed, maintained, or improved pursuant to the provisions of this section shall become part of the primary state highway system, the secondary state highway system, or the road system of the locality in which it is located in th e manner provided by law and shall thereafter be constructed, reconstructed, maintained, and improved as other roads or highways in such systems. Any bikeway path constructed, reconstructed, maintained, or improved pursuant to the provisions of this sect ion that is not situated within the right-of-way limits of an access road that has become, or which is to become, part of the primary state highway system, the secondary state highway system, or the road system of the locality shall, upon completion, bec ome part of and be regulated and maintained by the authority or agency maintaining the public recreational area or historical site. It shall be the responsibility of the authority, agency, or locality requesting that a bikeway be provided for a public re creational or historical site to provide the right-of-way needed for the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or improvement of the bikeway if such is to be situated outside the right-of-way limits of an access road.To maximize the impact of the Fu nd, not more than $400,000 of recreational access funds may be allocated for each individual access road project to or within any public recreational area or historical site operated by a state agency and not more than $250,000 of recreational access fun ds may be allocated for each individual access road project to or within a public recreational area or historical site operated by a locality or an authority with an additional $100,000 if supplemented on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the locality or auth ority from other than highway sources. Not more than $75,000 of recreational access funds may be allocated for each individual bikeway project to a public recreational area or historical site operated by a state agency and not more than $60,000 of recrea tional access funds may be allocated for each individual bikeway project to a public recreational area or historical site operated by a locality or an authority with an additional $15,000 if supplemented on a dollar-for-dollar basis by a locality or auth ority from other than highway sources.The Board, with the concurrence of the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation, is hereby authorized to establish guidelines to carry out the provisions of this section.

The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Operation of bus facilities.  The provision of this section authorizing the Commission (now Board) to acquire and operate bus facilities to transport passengers across the Hampton Roads bridge -tunnel project is not violative of the prohibition in Va. Const., Art. X, § 10, against the Commonwealth engaging in works of internal improvement. Almond v. Day, 199 Va. 1, 97 S.E.2d 824, 1957 Va. LEXIS 155 (1957); Richmond-Greyhound Lines v. Davis, 200 Va. 147, 104 S.E.2d 813, 1958 Va. LEXIS 170 (1958). The Commonwealth has the power to operate a bus facility across the Hampton Roads bridge-tunnel project and the fact that a certificate to transport passengers ac ross the project had been issued by the Corporation Commission to a common carrier could affect only the wisdom of the states action in so doing, not its authority. Almond v. Day, 199 Va. 1, 97 S.E.2d 824, 1957 Va. LEXIS 155 (1957). Commission (now Board) may acquire facilities by purchase, by lease or by contracting with private enterprise.  The word acquire as used in the provision of this section authorizing the Commission (now Board) to acquire and operate bus facilities does not denote own ership alone. This word not only has the meaning to obtain as ones own, but also has the meaning of procure. The Commission has the right to acquire such bus facilities by purchase, by lease, or by contracting with private enterprise to provide the desired services as its agent. Richmond-Greyhound Lines v. Davis, 200 Va. 147, 104 S.E.2d 813, 1958 Va. LEXIS 170 (1958). Duty to provide facilities is discretionary.  The duty to acquire and operate bus facilities is a discretionary duty to be performed and not a clearly defined ministerial one imposed upon the Highway Commissi on (now Commonwealth Transportation Board). Richmond-Greyhound Lines v. Davis, 200 Va. 147, 104 S.E.2d 813, 1958 Va. LEXIS 170 (1958). The Commission (now Board) also has the right not to provide any bus facilities. Richmond-Greyhound Lines v. Davis, 200 Va. 147, 104 S.E.2d 813, 1958 Va. LEXIS 17 0 (1958). And such discretion cannot be controlled or reviewed by mandamus.  Since, where an officer or board is vested with discretion, such discretion cannot be controlled or reviewed by mandamus, mandamus would not lie at the instance o f the holder of the only certificate issued by the Corporation Commission to operate bus facilities over the Hampton Roads tunnel project, to compel the State Highway Commission (now Commonwealth Transportation Board) to terminate a contract awarded by i t to another bus company to furnish exclusive service across the project, and to allow petitioner to supply such service under its certificate.

The respons ible public entity may request proposals from private entities for the development and/or operation of transportation facilities subject to the following: 1. For t ransportation facilities where the Department of Transportation, the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority, or the Department of Rail and Public Transportation is the responsible public entity, the Transportation Public-Private Partnership Steering Committee established pursuant to § 33.2-1803.2 has determined that moving forward with the development and/or operation of the facility pursuant to this article serves the best interest of the public. 2. A finding of public interest pursuant to § 33.2-1803.1 has been issued by the responsible public entity. 3. The responsible public entity shall not charge a fee to cover the costs of processing, reviewing, and evaluating proposals received in response to such requests. C. The respons ible public entity may grant approval of the development and/or operation of the transportation facility or facilities as a qualifying transportation facility if the responsible public entity determines that it is in the best interest of the public. The responsible public entity may determine that the development and/or operation of the transportation facility or facilities as a qualifying transportation facility serves the best interest of the public if: 1. The p rivate entity can develop and/or operate the transportation facility or facilities with a public contribution amount that is less than the maximum public contribution determined pursuant to subsection A of § 33.2-1803.1:1 for transportation facilities where the Department of Transportation, the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority, or the Department of Rail and Public Transportation is the responsible public entity; 2. There is a public need for the transportation facility or facilities the private entity proposes to develop and/or operate as a qualifying transportation facility and for transportatio n facilities where the Department of Transportation or the Department of Rail and Public Transportation is the responsible public entity, such facility or facilities meet a need included in the plan developed pursuant to § 33.2-353; 3. The plan for the development and/or operation of the transportation facility or facilities is anticipated to have significant benefits as determined pursuant to subdivision B 1 of § 33.2-1803.1; 4. The private entitys plans will result in the timely development and/or operation of the transportation facility or facilities or their more efficient operation; and 5. The risks, liabilities, and responsibilities transferred, assigned, or assumed by the private entity provide sufficient benefits to the public to not proceed with the development and/o r operation of the transportation facility through other means of procurement available to the responsible public entity.In evaluating any request, the responsible public entity may rely upon internal staff reports prepared by personnel familiar with the operation of similar facilities or the advice of outside advisors or consultants having relevant experience. D. The respons ible public entity shall not enter into a comprehensive agreement unless the chief executive officer of the responsible public entity certifies in writing to the Governor and the General Assembly that: 1. The f inding of public interest issued pursuant to § 33.2-1803.1 is still valid; 2. The transfer, assignment, and assumption of risks, liabilities, and permitting responsibilities and the mitigation of revenue risk by the private sector have not materially changed sin ce the finding of public interest was issued pursuant to § 33.2-1803.1; and 3. The public contribution requested by the private entity does not exceed the maximum public contribution determined pursuant to subsection A of § 33.2-1803.1:1.Changes to the project scope that do not impact the assignment of risks or liabilities or the mitigation of revenue risk shall not be considered material changes to the finding of public interest, provided that such changes were presented in a public meeting to the Commonweal th Transportation Board, other state board, or the governing body of a locality, as appropriate. E. The respons ible public entity may charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs of processing, reviewing, and evaluating the request submitted by a private entity pursuant to subsection A, including reasonable attorney fees and fees for financial and other necessary a dvisors or consultants. The responsible public entity shall also develop guidelines that establish the process for the acceptance and review of a proposal from a private entity pursuant to subsections A, B, C, and D. Such guidelines shall establish a spe cific schedule for review of the proposal by the responsible public entity, a process for alteration of that schedule by the responsible public entity if it deems that changes are necessary because of the scope or complexity of proposals it receives, the process for receipt and review of competing proposals, and the type and amount of information that is necessary for adequate review of proposals in each stage of review. For qualifying transportation facilities that have approved or pending state and fe deral environmental clearances, have secured significant right-of-way, have previously allocated significant state or federal funding, or exhibit other circumstances that could reasonably reduce the amount of time to develop and/or operate the qualifying transportation facility in accordance with the purpose of this chapter, the guidelines shall provide for a prioritized documentation, review, and selection process. F. The approva l of the responsible public entity shall be subject to the private entitys entering into an interim agreement or a comprehensive agreement with the responsible public entity. For any project with an estimated construction cost of over $50 million, th e responsible public entity also shall require the private entity to pay the costs for an independent audit of any and all traffic and cost estimates associated with the private entitys proposal, as well as a review of all public costs and potential liabilities to which taxpayers could be exposed (including improvements to other transportation facilities that may be needed as a result of the proposal, failure by the private entity to reimburse the responsible public entity for services provided, and potential risk and liability in the event the private entity defaults on the comprehensive agreement or on bonds issued for the project). This independent audit shall be conducted by an independent consultant selected by the responsible public entity, a nd all such information from such review shall be fully disclosed. G. In connecti on with its approval of the development and/or operation of the transportation facility or facilities as a qualifying transportation facility, the responsible public entity shall establish a date for the acquisition of or the beginning of construction of or improvements to the qualifying transportation facility. The responsible public entity may extend such date. H.

AG LEXIS 37 (10/3/2012). Under the Public-Private Transportation Act of 1995, specifically §§ 56-560 and 56-573.1, the Virginia Port Authority, as the responsible public entity, has the authority to (i) approve entering into a comprehensive agreement, and (ii) subject to final approval by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to subdivision 2 of § 56-573.1, execute a comprehensive agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth for t he concession to operate Port facilities. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Frank W. Wagner, Member, Senate of Virginia; The Honorable Barry D. Knight, Member, House of Delegates; The Honorable Jeffrey L.

AG LEXIS 37 (10/3/2012). Role of Secretary of Transportation.  The selection of the preferred proposer remains in the discretion of the Virginia Port Authority as the responsible public entity, but the Virginia Port Authority may not sign a comprehensive agreement without first receiving the approval of the Secretary of Transportation as required by subdivision 2 of § 56-573.1.

The provision of the necessary facilities and services cannot be achieved by the unilateral action of the counties and cities, and the attainment thereof requires planning and action on a regional basis, conducted cooperatively and on a continuing basis, between representatives of the affected political subdivisions and the Commonwealth Transportatio n Board. In those urban areas of the Commonwealth that together form a single metropolitan area, solutions must be jointly sought with the affected political subdivisions and highway departments. Such joint action should be conducted in a manner that pre serves, to the extent the necessity for joint action permits, local autonomy over patterns of growth and development of each participating political subdivision or locality. The requisite joint action may best be achieved through the device of a transpor tation district, having the powers, functions, and duties set forth in this chapter. In the provision of improved or expanded transit facilities, it is the policy of the Commonwealth to make use of private enterprise to the extent reasonably practicable.

Const., Art. VII, § 10(b) relating to debt.  The use of the word district in the name of the Transportation District Commission is insufficient to extend application of Va. Const., Art. VII, § 10( b) to it. Furthermore, the Constitution speaks in terms of a district thereof. The Commission was authorized and created by statute, and is comprised of the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, and Falls Church, and the counties of Arlington and Loudou n, in addition to Fairfax. See former § 15.1-1342 et seq. (see now § 15.2-4500 et seq.); Acts 1964, c. 630. It remained in a dormant state until brought into action by the local governing body. The Commission clearly was not created by Fair fax County, and is not a district thereof. Dykes v. Northern Va. Transp. Dist. Comm'n, 242 Va. 357, 411 S.E.2d 1, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1286, 1991 Va.

A transportation district may issue bonds or other interest-bearing obligations, as provided in this chapter, for any of its purposes and pay the principal and interest thereon from any of its funds, including any moneys paid to or otherwise received by the district pursuant to any law enacted or any contract or agreement or any grant, loan, or contribution authorized by this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, bonds include bonds, notes, and other interest-bearing obligations, including notes issued in anticipation of the sale and issuance of bonds. 2. Neither the members of a transportation district nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other oblig ations of a district (and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof, and only the district shall be liable thereon. The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any debt limitation or restriction except as provided under this section. B. 1. Bonds of a transportation district shall be authorized by resolution, may be issued in one or more series, shall be dated, shall mature at such times not exceeding 40 years from their dates, shall bear interest at rates determined by the commission, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the commission at such pric e or prices and under such terms as the commission fixes prior to issuing the bonds. The commission shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denominat ions of the bonds and the places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or outside the Commonwealth. If any officer whose signature or facsimile signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such o fficer before delivery of such bond, such signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article or any recital s in any bonds issued under the provisions of this article, all such bonds shall be negotiable instruments under the laws of the Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form or both, as the commission may determine, and provision ma y be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The transportation district may sel l such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of the district. A transportation district is authorized to enter into indentures or agreements with respect to all such ma tters, and such indentures or agreements may contain such other provisions as the commission may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. The resolution may provide that the bonds shall be payable from and secured by all or any par t of the revenues, moneys, or funds of the district as specified therein. Such pledge shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made, and such revenues, moneys, and funds so pledged and thereafter received by the district shall immediately b e subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the district, irres pective of whether such parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust indenture by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the district. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such indentures or agreements may be treated as a purpose of the transportation district. A transportation district may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of redeeming or retiring any bonds before or at maturity, including the payment of any premium, accr ued interest, and costs or expenses thereof. 2. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds a transportation district may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable fo r definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. A transportation district may also provide for the replacement of any bonds that have been mutilated, destroyed, or lost. 3. Bonds may be issued pursuant to this article without obtaining the consent of any commission, board, bureau, or agency of the Commonwealth or of any governmental subdivision, and witho ut any referendum, other proceedings, or the happening of other conditions except for those proceedings or conditions that are specifically required by this article. C. Any holder of bonds, notes, certificates, or other evidence of borrowing issued under this article or of any of the coupons appertaining thereto, and the trustee under any trust indenture or agreement, except to the extent of the rights given in this article may be restricted by such trust indenture or agreement, may, either at law or in equity, by suit, action, injunction, mandamus, or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under the laws of the Commonwealth or granted by this article or under such trust indenture or agreement or the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, notes, or certificates, and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this article or by such trust indenture or agreement or resolution to be performed by the transportation district or by any officer or agent thereof. D. The exercis e of the powers granted by this article shall be in all respects for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Commonwealth, for the promotion of their safety, health, welfare, convenience, and prosperity, and any facility or service that a transportation di strict is authorized to provide will constitute the performance of an essential governmental function. The bonds of a district are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and their transfer and the income therefrom, includi ng any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free and exempt from taxation by the Commonwealth and by any governmental subdivision thereof. E. Bonds issue d by a transportation district under this article are securities in which all public officers and public bodies of the Commonwealth and its governmental subdivisions and all insurance companies, trust companies, banks, banking associations, investment co mpanies, executors, administrators, trustees, and other fiduciaries may properly and legally invest funds, including capital in their control or belonging to them. Such bonds are securities that may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any state or local officer or any agency or governmental subdivision of the Commonwealth for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.

CASE NOTES Debt which Commission would incur was not subject to Va. Const., Art. VII, § 10(b).  The Transportation District Commission is an independent political subdivision in the same manner as are housing authorities, water and sewer authorities, and ind ustrial development authorities. The enabling legislation, like that of these other authorities vested with the power to incur bonded indebtedness, affirms that debt so incurred is that of the entity, not of the Commonwealth or of any other political sub division. This statement was repeated in bonds themselves, as well as in other documents constituting financing proposal. The debt incurred by legislatively created, independent political subdivisions, whatever their title, is not the debt of the Commonw ealth or of any other governmental unit. Therefore, the debt which would be incurred by the Commission in issuing the bonds was not subject to the provisions of Va. Const., Art. VII, § 10(b). Dykes v. Northern Va. Transp. Dist.

Any obligations arising from such contracts are deemed to be for a public purpose a nd may be paid for, in the discretion of each county or city, in whole or in part, by appropriations from general revenues or from the proceeds of a bond issue or issues; however, any such contract must specify the annual maximum obligation of any county or city for payments to meet the expenses and obligations of the transportation district or such agency or provide a formula to determine the payment of any such county or city for such expenses and obligations. Each county or city desiring to contract with a transportation district or an agency is authorized to do so, provided it complies with the appropriate provisions of law, and thereafter is authorized to do everything necessary or proper to carry out and perform every such contract and to provide for the payment or discharge of any obligation thereunder by the same means and in the same manner as any other of its obligations.

If, upon reconsideration, the commission agrees wi th the objection, then the commission shall make appropriate changes to the proposed plan, alteration, revision, or amendment and may adopt them without further hearing. If, upon reconsideration, the commission disagrees with the objection, the commissio n may adopt the plan, alteration, revision, or amendment. No facilities shall be located in and no service rendered, however, within any county or city that does not execute an appropriate agreement with the commission or with an interstate agency as pro vided in § 33.2-1922; but in such case, the commission shall determine whether the absence of such an agreement so materially and adversely affects the feasibility of the transportation plan as to require its modification or abandonment.

Any proposed district within a c ounty or counties may include any land within a town or towns within the boundaries of such county or counties. B. The petitio n to the local governing body or bodies shall: 1. Set f orth the name and describe the boundaries of the proposed district; 2.

A district may be created in a county by a resolution of the governing body. Any such resolution shall be considered only upon the petition, to the governing body, of the owners of at least 51 percent of either the land area or the assessed value of real property t hat (i) is within the boundaries of the proposed district, (ii) has been zoned for commercial or industrial use or is used for such purposes, and (iii) would be subject to the annual special improvement tax authorized by § 33.2-2105 if the proposed di strict is created. Any proposed district within a county may include any real property within a town or towns within the boundaries of such county. B. The petitio n to the governing body shall: 1. Set f orth the name and describe the boundaries of the proposed district; 2. Describe the transportation improvements proposed within the district; 3. Propose a plan for providing such transportation improvements within the district and describe specific terms and conditions with respect to all commercial and industrial zoning classi fications and uses, densities, and criteria related thereto that the petitioners request for the proposed district; 4. Describe the benefits that can be expected from the provision of such transportation improvements within the district; and 5. Request the governing body to establish the proposed district for the purposes set forth in the petition. C. Upon the fi ling of such a petition, the governing body shall fix a day for a hearing on the question of whether the proposed district shall be created. The hearing shall consider whether the residents and owners of real property within the proposed district would b enefit from the establishment of the proposed district. All interested persons who either reside in or own taxable real property within the proposed district shall have the right to appear and show cause why any property or properties should not be inclu ded in the proposed district. If real property within a town is included in the proposed district, a copy of the petition and notice of the public hearing shall be delivered to the town council at least 30 days prior to the public hearing, and the town c ouncil may by resolution determine if the town council wishes any property located within the town to be included within the proposed district and any such resolution shall be delivered to the governing body prior to the public hearing required by this s ection. Such resolution shall be binding upon the governing body with respect to the inclusion or exclusion of such properties within the proposed district. If that resolution permits any commercial or industrial property located within a town to be incl uded in the proposed district, then if requested to do so by the petition the town council of any town that has adopted a zoning ordinance also shall pass a resolution, to be effective upon creation of the proposed district, that is consistent with the r equirements of subsection E with respect to commercial and industrial zoning classifications that shall be in force in that portion of the town included in the district. The petition shall comply with the provisions of this section with respect to minimu m acreage or assessed valuation. Notice of the hearing shall be given by publication once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the locality. At least 10 days shall intervene between the third publication and the date set for the hearing. Such public hearing may be adjourned from time to time. D. If the gove rning body finds the creation of the proposed district would be in furtherance of the countys comprehensive plan for the development of the area, in the best interests of the residents and owners of real property within the proposed district, and in furtherance of the public health, safety, and welfare, the governing body may pass a resolution that is reasonably consistent with the petition, that creates the district upon final adoption, and that provides for the appointment of an advisory board in accordance with this chapter upon final adoption. Any such resolution shall be conclusively presumed to be reasonably consistent with the petition if, following the public hearing, as provided in the following provisions of this section, the petition con tinues to comply with the provisions of this section with respect to the criteria relating to minimum acreage or assessed valuation. E. The resolut ion shall provide a description with specific terms and conditions of all commercial and industrial zoning classifications that apply within the district, but not within any town within the district that has adopted a zoning ordinance, that shall be in f orce in the district upon its creation, together with any related criteria and a term of years, not to exceed 20 years, as to which each such zoning classification and each related criterion set forth therein shall remain in force within the district wit hout elimination, reduction, or restriction, except (i) upon the written request or approval of the owner of any property affected by a change, (ii) as required to comply with the provisions of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (§ 62.1-44.15:67 et s eq.) or the regulations adopted pursuant thereto, (iii) as required to comply with the provisions of the federal Clean Water Act regarding municipal and industrial stormwater discharges (33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)) and regulations promulgated thereunder by t he federal Environmental Protection Agency, or (iv) as specifically required to comply with any other state or federal law. F. A resolutio n creating a district shall also provide (i) that the district shall expire 50 years from the date upon which the resolution is passed or (ii) that the district shall expire when the district is abolished in accordance with § 33.2-2115. After the publ ic hearing, the governing body may adopt a proposed resolution creating the district. No later than two business days following the adoption of the proposed resolution, copies of the proposed resolution shall be available in the office of the clerk of th e governing body for inspection and copying by the petitioning landowners and their representatives, by members of the public, and by representatives of the news media. No later than seven business days following the adoption of the proposed resolution, any petitioning landowner may notify the clerk of the governing body in writing that the petitioning landowner is withdrawing his signature from the petition. Within the same seven-day period, the owner of any property in the proposed district that will be subject to the annual special improvements tax authorized by § 33.2-2105, if the proposed district is created, or the attorney-in-fact of any such owner may notify the clerk of the governing body in writing that he is adding his signature to the pe tition. The governing body may then proceed to final adoption of the proposed resolution following that seven-day period. If any petitioner has withdrawn his signature from the petition during that seven-day period, then the governing body may readopt th e proposed resolution only if the petition, including any landowners who have added their signatures after adoption of the proposed resolution, continues to meet the provisions of this section. After the governing body has readopted the resolution creati ng the district, the district shall be established and the name of the district shall be The _______________ Transportation Improvement District. History History. 2001, c. 611, § 33.1-431; 2004, c. 792; 2014, c. 805.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_33.2-2102"><akn:num>§ 33.2-2102</akn:num><akn:heading>Commission to exercise powers of the district</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The powers of a district created pursuant to this chapter shall be exercised by a commission.

For the purposes of this chapter, real property that is zoned to permit multiunit resid ential use but not yet used for that purpose and multiunit residential real property that is primarily leased or rented to residential tenants or other occupants by an owner who is engaged in such a business shall be deemed to be property in commercial u se and therefore subject to the special improvements tax authorized by this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 4 (§ 58.1-3229 et seq.) of Chapter 32 of Title 58.1, the tax shall be levied on the assessed fair market value of the taxabl e real property. The rate of the special improvements tax shall not be more than 40 cents ($0.40) per $100 of the assessed fair market value of any taxable real estate or the assessable value of taxable leasehold property as specified by § 58.1-3203; however, if all the owners in any district so request in writing, this limitation on rate shall not apply. Such special improvements taxes shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as the countys taxes are collected, and the proceeds shall be kept in a separate account.

All revenues received by the county pursuant to such taxes shall be paid to or at the direction of the district commission for its use pursuant to this chapter. All revenues generated from the annual special improvements taxes levied by the governing body pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be contributions of that governing body in any transportation cost-sharing formula.

Annotations CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  In consolidated cases, the taxing provisions of §§ 33.1-435 and 58.1-3221.3 were upheld as constitutional, and not in violation of the uniformity requiremen t of Va. Const., Art. X, § 1 where the challenging taxpayer failed to meet its burden of proving that no reasonable basis for the tax classifications could have been conceived. The fact that untaxed others would have benefited to some extent from the improvements funded by the taxes did not prove that there was no rational basis for the tax classifications approved by the General Assembly.

Const., Art. X, § 1 by authorizing the assessment of additional taxes on only commercial or industrial property and not residential property because nothing in the record supported the taxpayers argument that residential propert y owners would be benefited by the proceeds of transportation taxes as much if not more than commercial and industrial property owners when in the petition of affected property owners asking the county to establish the district, the owners alleged that l andowners of industrially and commercially zoned property and of taxable leasehold interests along the proposed rail extension corridor would benefit specially from the extension of rail service; the county posited several conceivable rational bases for the classifications, and the taxpayer failed to meet its burden of proving that no reasonable basis for the classifications could be conceived.

In addition to any other power conferred by this chapter, the district may contract with the Commonwealth Transportation Board for the Commonwealth Transportation Board to perform any of the purposes of the district.The district may agree by contract to pay all or a portion of the special improvements tax to the Commonwealth Transportation Board.Prior to executing any such contract, the district shall seek the agreement of the governing body that the countys officer charged with the responsibility for preparin g the countys annual budget shall submit in the budget for each fiscal year in which any Commonwealth of Virginia Transportation Contract Revenue Bonds issued for such district are outstanding all amounts to be paid to the Commonwealth Transportation Board under such contract during such fiscal year.If the amount required to be paid to the Commonwealth Transportation Board under the contract is not so paid for a period of 60 days after such amount is due, the Commonwealth Transportation Board shall, until such amount has been paid, withhold sufficient funds from funds appropriated and allocated, pursuant to Article 5 (§ 33.2-351 et seq.) of Chapter 3, to the highway construction district in which the transportation improvements covered by such c ontract are located or to such locality or localities in which such transportation improvements are located and to use such funds to satisfy the contractual requirements. B. While nothi ng in this chapter shall limit the authority of any county or participating town to change the classification of property zoned for commercial or industrial use or used for such purpose upon the written request or approval of the owner of any property af fected by such change after the effective date of any such contract, should a change in zoning classification so requested result in a shortfall in the total annual revenues from the imposition of the special improvements tax and the payments required to be made to the Commonwealth Transportation Board pursuant to the contract, the district shall request the governing body to increase the rate of such tax by such amount up to the maximum authorized rate as may be necessary to prevent such shortfall. If, however, a deficit remains after any rezoning and adjustment of the tax rate or the rate is at the maximum authorized rate and cannot be increased, then the amount of funds otherwise appropriated and allocated, pursuant to the highway allocation formula as provided by law, to the highway construction district in which the project covered by such contract is located or to the county shall be reduced by the amount of such deficit and used to satisfy the deficit.

For any rea l property within the district for which a county or participating town changes its zoning classification from one that is subject to the special improvements tax authorized by § 33.2-2106 to a classification that is not subject to that tax, the count y or participating town shall require the simultaneous payment from the property owner of a sum representing the present value of the future special improvements taxes estimated by the county to be lost as a result of such change in classification. On a case-by-case basis, however, the governing body or town council of a participating town may, in its sole discretion, defer, for no more than 60 days, the effective date of such change in zoning classification. Upon deferral, the lump sum provided for in this subsection shall be paid to the county in immediately available funds acceptable to the county before the deferred effective date. If the landowner fails to make this lump sum payment as and when required, the change in zoning classification shall n ot become effective and the ordinance shall be void. Special improvements taxes previously paid in the year of the zoning change may be credited toward the payment on a prorated basis. The portion of the payment that may be credited shall be that portion of the year following the change in zoning classification. If at the time there is outstanding a contract by which the district has agreed to pay all or a portion of the special improvements tax to the Commonwealth Transportation Board, then the distric t and the Commonwealth Transportation Board shall agree to a method of calculating the present value of the loss of future special improvements taxes resulting from such a change in zoning classification and the procedure for payment of such funds to the Commonwealth Transportation Board. Whenever any county or participating town acts in accordance with such an agreement between the district and the Commonwealth Transportation Board, the change in zoning classification shall not be considered to have re sulted in a shortfall in the total annual revenues from the imposition of the special improvements tax and the payments required to be made to the Commonwealth Transportation Board. B. Any owner o f any real property that is subject to the special improvements tax authorized by § 33.2-2106 because it is zoned to permit multiunit residential use but is not yet used for that purpose or because it consists of multiunit residential real property th at is primarily leased or rented to residential tenants or other occupants by an owner who is engaged in such a business who wishes to change the use of the real property to one that is not subject to that tax shall be required, prior to any such change in use, to pay to the county a sum representing the present value of the future special improvements taxes estimated by the county to be lost as a result of such change in use.

All localities and political subdivisions and all public agencies and commissions of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, are hereby authori zed and empowered to lease, lend, grant, or convey to the District at the Commissions request upon such terms and conditions as the proper authorities of such localities, political subdivisions, agencies, or commissions of the Commonwealth may deem r easonable and fair and without the necessity for any advertisement, order of court, or other action or formality, other than the regular and formal action of the authorities concerned, any real property that may be necessary or convenient to the effectua tion of the authorized purposes of the Commission, including public highways and other real property already devoted to public use.

The Commission may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for t he best interest of the District, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six percent per year computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in acco rdance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computations the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity. The proceeds of such bonds shall be disbursed for the purposes for which such bonds shall have been issued under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds or the trust indenture provided for in this chapter. If the bonds of a particular issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, are less than such cost, a dditional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture securing the same, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds are issued, the surplus shall be paid into the funds hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the Commission may, under like restrictions, issue temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The Commission may also provide for the replacement of any bond that becomes mutilated or that has been destroyed or lost. Such revenue bonds may be issu ed without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than the proceedings, conditions, and things that are specified and required by this chapter.

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the third paragraph was added, because it had been inadvertently dropped in the drafting stage during the 2020 s ession. Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 8 provides: That the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority and the counties and cities embraced by the Authority shall work coope ratively with towns with a population greater than 3,500 located within such counties for purposes of implementing the provisions of this act and to ensure that such towns receive their respective share of the revenues pursuant to subdivision B 1 of Sec tion 15.2-4838.1. Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 9 provides: That the Texas Transportation Institutes annual report on highway congestion ranks the Northern Virginia/Washington, D .C. area as the worst area for traffic congestion in the nation, and the Hampton Roads region as the twentieth most congested area of the 101 areas studies. Such congestion has an average commuter cost of nearly $1,400 in Northern Virginia and $877 per c ommuter in Hampton Roads. Such congestion negatively impacts Virginias economic prosperity, strategic military connectivity, emergency preparedness, and environmental quality. Regions with populations in excess of 1.5 million citizens and 1.2 million registered vehicles are prone to greater levels of congestion and growing transit needs. Therefore, the General Assembly finds that transportation construction and maintenance in the Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads regions are high priorities, and t hat as other regions of the Commonwealth continue to grow, the same priority shall be given. Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 10 provides: That each county or city located in Planning District 8 or Planning District 23 as of January 1, 2013, shall expend or di sburse for transportation purposes each year an amount that is at least equal to the average annual amount expended or disbursed for transportation purposes by the county or city, excluding bond proceeds or debt service payments and federal or state gran ts, between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2013. Each county or city located in any other Planning District that becomes subject to the state taxes or fees imposed solely in Planning Districts pursuant to this act shall expend or disburse for transportation purposes each year an amount that is at least equal to the average annual amount expended or disbursed for transportation purposes by the county or city, excluding bond proceeds or debt service payments and federal or state grants, during the 36-month pe riod immediately prior to the effective date of the imposition of such state taxes or fees in the Planning District. In the event that any such county or city does not expend or disburse such an amount, that county or city shall not be the direct benefic iary of any of the revenues generated by the state taxes or fees imposed solely in Planning Districts pursuant to this act in the immediately succeeding year. Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 11 provides: That no tolls shall be imposed or collected on Interstate 95 south of Fredericksburg pursuant to the Interstate System Re construction and Rehabilitation Pilot Program without the prior approval of the General Assembly. Acts 2018, cc. 854 and 856, cl. 6 provides: That the provisions of this act, except for §§ 33.2-214.4, 33.2-286, and 33.2-1526.1 of the Code of Vir ginia, as created by this act, and § 58.1-638 of the Code of Virginia, as amended by this act, shall not become effective until 30 days after the District of Columbia and the State of Maryland each enact legislation or take actions to provide dedicat ed funding for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).

Of the revenues distributed pursuant to this subsection, as determined solely by the applicable locality, such revenues shall be used for additional urban or secondary highway construction, for other capital improvements that reduce congestion, for other transportation capital improvements that have been approved by the most recent long-range transportation plan adopted by the Authority, or for public transportation purposes. None of the revenue distributed by this subsection may be used to repay debt issued before July 1, 2013.

The amount of any such reduction in revenue shall be redistributed according to subsection C. The provisions of this subdivision shall be ongoing and apply over annual periods as determined by the Authority. C. 1. The remaining 70 percent of the revenues received by the Authority under subsection A, plus the amount of any revenue to be redistributed pursuant to subsection B, shall be used by the Authority solely to fund transportation projects selected by the Authority that are contained in the regional transportation plan in accordance with subd ivision 1 of § 33.2-2500 and that have been rated in accordance with subdivision 2 of § 33.2-2500. For only those regional funds received in fiscal year 2014, the requirement for rating in accordance with subdivision 2 of § 33.2-2500 shall not a pply. The Authority shall give priority to selecting projects that are expected to provide the greatest congestion reduction relative to the cost of the project and shall document this information for each project selected. Such projects selected by the Authority for funding shall be located (i) only in localities embraced by the Authority or (ii) in adjacent localities but only to the extent that such extension is an insubstantial part of the project and is essential to the viability of the project wit hin the localities embraced by the Authority. 2. Not less than 15 days prior to any decision by the Authority for the expenditure of funds pursuant to subdivision 1 for any project to create or improve any transportation facility, th e Authority shall make the following publicly available: (i) the project evaluation pursuant to subdivision 2 of § 33.2-2500, (ii) the total amount of funds from the Authority to be used for the project, (iii) the total amount of funds from sources ot her than the Authority to be used for the project, and (iv) any other rating or scoring of other factors to be taken into account by the Authority related to each such transportation facility. 3. All transportation projects undertaken by the Authority shall be completed by private contractors accompanied by performance measurement standards, and all contracts shall contain a pr ovision granting the Authority the option to terminate the contract if contractors do not meet such standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any locality may provide engineering services or right-of-way acquisition for any project with its own forces. T he Authority shall avail itself of the strategies permitted under the Public-Private Transportation Act (§ 33.2-1800 et seq.) whenever feasible and advantageous. The Authority is independent of any state or local entity, including the Department and t he Commonwealth Transportation Board, but the Authority, the Department, and the Commonwealth Transportation Board shall consult with one another to avoid duplication of efforts and, at the option of the Authority, may combine efforts to complete specifi c projects. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of the Authority, the Department may provide the Authority with engineering services or right-of-way acquisition for the project with its own forces. 4. With regard to the revenues distributed under subdivision 1, each localitys total long-term benefit shall be approximately equal to the proportion of the total of the fees and taxe s received by the Authority that are generated by or attributable to the locality divided by the total of such fees and taxes received by the Authority. D. For road co nstruction and improvements pursuant to subsection B, the Department may, on a reimbursement basis, provide the locality with planning, engineering, right-of-way, and construction services for projects funded in whole by the revenues provided to the loca lity by the Authority.

Such congestion has an average commuter cost of nearly $1,400 in Northern Virginia and $877 per c ommuter in Hampton Roads. Such congestion negatively impacts Virginias economic prosperity, strategic military connectivity, emergency preparedness, and environmental quality. Regions with populations in excess of 1.5 million citizens and 1.2 million registered vehicles are prone to greater levels of congestion and growing transit needs. Therefore, the General Assembly finds that transportation construction and maintenance in the Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads regions are high priorities, and t hat as other regions of the Commonwealth continue to grow, the same priority shall be given. Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 10 provides: That each county or city located in Planning District 8 or Planning District 23 as of January 1, 2013, shall expend or di sburse for transportation purposes each year an amount that is at least equal to the average annual amount expended or disbursed for transportation purposes by the county or city, excluding bond proceeds or debt service payments and federal or state gran ts, between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2013.

A district may be created in the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle by resolutions of such localities governing bodies. Such resolutions shall be considered upon the petition to each governing body of a locality in which the proposed district b y the owners of at least 51 percent of either the land area or the assessed value of land, in each locality that (i) is within the boundaries of the proposed district and (ii) has been zoned for commercial or industrial use or is used for such purposes. B. The petitio n to the local governing bodies shall: 1. Set f orth the name and describe the boundaries of the proposed district; 2.

Describe the benefits that can be expected from the provision of such transportation improvements within the district; and 5. Request the local governing bodies to establish the proposed district for the purposes set forth in the petition. C.

If both loc al governing bodies find the creation of the proposed district would be in furtherance of their comprehensive plans for the development of the area, in the best interests of the residents and owners of real property within the proposed district, and in f urtherance of the public health, safety, and welfare, both local governing bodies may pass resolutions that are reasonably consistent with the petition, creating the district and providing for the appointment of an advisory board in accordance with this chapter. The resolutions shall provide a description with specific terms and conditions of all commercial and industrial zoning classifications that shall be in force in the district upon its creation, together with all related criteria and a term of yea rs, not to exceed 20 years, as to which each such zoning classification and each related criterion set forth therein shall remain in force within the district without elimination, reduction, or restriction, except (i) upon the written request or approval of the owner of any property affected by a change or (ii) as specifically required to comply with federal or state law.Each resolution creating the district shall also provide (a) that the district shall expire 35 years from the date upon which the reso lution is passed or (b) that the district shall expire when the district is abolished in accordance with § 33.2-2714.
