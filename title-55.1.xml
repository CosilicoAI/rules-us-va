Seal.  Neither § 55-57 nor § 55-48 contain seal requirements that § 55-51 operates to suspend, and neither of these statutes imposes a seal requirement on deeds , which the common law and the Statute of Conveyances, have already accomplished; these provisions only offer recommended language, purely permissive, not mandatory, for deeds already required to be under seal, and the presence or absence of either statu te has no effect on the seal requirement. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, 295 Va. 396, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018). By its plain terms, the saving statute only saves deeds that fail to take effect by virtue of this chapter, and this saving statute appears in Chapter 4 of Title 55, but nowhere in that chapter is there a statutory requirement that deeds be under seal; that requirement comes from the common law and is incorporated into the definition of deed in the Statute of Conveyances, neither of which can be found in Chapter 4 of Title 55.

LE XIS 24 (1890). In general.  Under this section no estate of inheritance or freehold or for a term of more than five years in lands shall be conveyed unless by deed or will. Smith v. Plaster, 151 Va. 252, 144 S.E. 417, 1928 Va. LEXIS 229 (1928). Seal.  One of the essential requisites of a deed is that it have a seal affixed thereto. Smith v. Plaster, 151 Va. 252, 144 S.E. 417, 1928 Va. LEXIS 229 (1928). Fifteen-year lease did not include a seal of any kind, and thus, it failed to satisfy the common-law seal requirement embedded in the definition of deed u nder the Statute of Conveyances, nor did the lease include any specific seal substitutes recognized in § 11-3; because rent was received on a monthly basis, the occupation of the premises and the monthly payment of rent implied a month-to-month tenanc y, which was paid for through the last month of occupancy. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, 295 Va. 396, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018). Neither § 55-57 nor § 55-48 contain seal requirements that § 55-51 operates to suspend, and neither of these statutes imposes a seal requirement on deeds , which the common law and the Statute of Conveyances, have already accomplished; these provisions only offer recommended language, purely permissive, not mandatory, for deeds already required to be under seal, and the presence or absence of either statu te has no effect on the seal requirement. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, 295 Va. 396, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018). Common-law seal requirement antedated the General Assemblys existence, and the legislative antecedent to the Statute of Conveyances made its first appearance in the Code of Virginia in 1705; so, even if Chapter 4 of Title 55 never existed, the seal requirement would nevertheless govern deeds of lease with a term exceeding five years. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, 295 Va. 396, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2 018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018). By its plain terms, the saving statute only saves deeds that fail to take effect by virtue of this chapter, and this saving statute appears in Chapter 4 of Title 55, but nowhere in that chapter is there a statutory requirement that deeds be under seal; that requirement comes from the common law and is incorporated into the definition of deed in the Statute of Conveyances, neither of which can be found in Chapter 4 of Title 55. Game Place, L.L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, 295 Va. 396, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018). General Assembly has engaged the common-law seal requirement but has never abolished it altogether for deeds governed by the Statute of Conveyances. Game Place, L .L.C. v. Fredericksburg 35, LLC, 295 Va. 396, 813 S.E.2d 312, 2018 Va. LEXIS 54 (2018). Virginia law requires deed to transfer legal title to real property. However, this rule does not change the fact that petitioners possessed neither a legal nor an equitable interest in the property once the auctioneers hammer fell and the memorandum of sale was signed. At this point, and before settlement, the trustee retains legal titl e to the property, while the purchaser possesses the right to enforce the sale in equity. Abdelhaq v. Pflug, 82 Bankr. 807, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1586 (E.D. Va. 1988). Legal title to property can be conveyed only by deed or will, and in this case the deed of trust did not convey the title to the property. FDIC v. Hish, 76 F.3d 6 20, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 4073 (4th Cir. 1996). Not applicable t o easements.  Although § 55-2 was inapplicable to the conveyance of easements because an easement was not an estate, the circuit courts judgment was reversed; the deeds at issue, along with a plat incorporated therein for descriptive purposes, did not contain operative words manifesting an intention to grant an easement. Considering the particular circumstances of the two deeds and the plat at issue, and resolving any d oubt against the establishment of an easement, there was no conveyance of an express easement across the property owners two parcels for the benefit of the limited liability companys parcel. Burdette v. Brush Mt. Estates, LLC, 278 Va. 286, 682 S. E.2d 549, 2009 Va. LEXIS 91 (2009). Under this section leases for more than five years must be by deed, but there is no stat utory provision in this State which in terms declares that other actual leases must be in writing. If the situation is covered at all, it must fall under either the sixth or seventh clause of the statute of frauds. Smith v. Payne, 153 Va. 746, 151 S.E. 2 95, 1930 Va. LEXIS 267 (1930). But section does not apply to lease for five years with option to renew.  A lease for a period of five years, with an option to the lessee to continue for another period of five years, is not a lease for a term of more than five years w ithin the meaning of this section. James v. Kibler's Adm'r, 94 Va. 165, 26 S.E. 417, 1896 Va. LEXIS 155 (1896). Since an easement is not an estate, the provisions of § 55-2 do not control the conveyance of an easement. Burdette v. Brush Mt. Estates, LLC, 278 Va. 286, 682 S.E.2d 549, 2009 Va. LEXIS 91 (2009). And it has no application to the creation by parol of trusts in personalty or in the proceeds of real estate. Riggan's Adm'r v. Riggan, 93 Va. 78, 24 S.E. 920, 1896 Va. LEXIS 54 (1896). This section does not bar the establishment of an oral trust in land or in a leasehold f or more than five years, nor does it bar the oral transfer of a beneficiarys interest in a trust. Burns v. Equitable Assocs., 220 Va. 1020, 265 S.E.2d 737, 1980 Va. LEXIS 197 (1980). No erasure or alteration in a conveyance, nor even the cancellation thereof by mutual consent of the parties, can divest an estate already vested by operation of the deed; for that would be in conflict with this section, which declares that no estate of inheritance or freehold, or for a term of more than five years in lands, shall be conveyed unless by deed or will. Brooks v. Clintsman, 124 Va. 736, 98 S.E. 742, 1919 Va. LEXIS 163 (1919). Nor is the grantees title divested by the return of the deed to be canceled. Graysons v. Richards, 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 57, 1839 Va. LEXIS 18 (1839); Jones v. Neale, 2 Patton &amp; H. 339 (1856). Husbands expression of desire that wife own prope rty together did not convey legal title subsequent to writing.  Since writing, where husband expressed his desire that he and his wife own property together, was neither a deed nor a will, it did not convey legal title or join t ownership of any kind to the real estate. Westbrook v. Westbrook, 5 Va. App. 446, 364 S.E.2d 523, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1770, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (1988). B.Parol Gift o r Promise of Gift. Effect of statute.  Prior to May 1, 1888, the date upon which the Code of 1887 took effect, a parol gift or a promise of a gift of land, to be consummated by deed, if followed by pos session and improvements of the land, was enforceable under the doctrine of such cases as Halsey v. Peters Exr, 79 Va. 60 (1884); and a contract for a gift to be perfected by will, under similar circumstances, was enforceable under the doctrine a nnounced in Burdine v. Burdines Exr, 98 Va. 515, 36 S.E. 992, 81 Am. St. R. 741 (1900).

History of statute.  For history of the various acts on this subject, from 1757, referring only to slaves, to the present, see the cases of Thomas Admr v. Lewis, 89 Va. 1, 15 S.E. 389 (1892); First Nat'l Bank v. Holland, 99 Va. 495, 39 S.E. 126, 1901 Va. LEXIS 70 (1901). This section and § 55-96 are so closely related as to subject matter of gifts that th ey may be said to be in pari materia, and should be construed together. Both relate to goods and chattels, this section wholly, and § 55-96 in part. First Nat'l Bank v. Holland, 99 Va. 495, 39 S.E. 126, 1901 Va. LEXIS 70 (1901). This section has no application to the creation by parol of trusts in personalty or in t he proceeds of real estate. Riggan's Adm'r v. Riggan, 93 Va. 78, 24 S.E. 920, 1896 Va. LEXIS 54 (1896). Nor does it apply to gifts causa mortis.  The words no gift do not refer to gifts causa mortis, nor does the section embrace them. Thomas' Adm'r v. Lewis, 89 Va. 1, 15 S.E. 389, 1892 Va. LEXIS 73 (1892). The words goods or chattels do not apply to choses in action.  The words goods or chattels used in this section, relating to gifts, do not apply to choses in action, but only to visible and tangible property. A chose in action is the money, damages or thing owing; the bond or note, etc., is but the evidence of it. Bank stock is a chose in action. First Nat'l Bank v. Holland, 99 Va. 495, 39 S.E. 126, 1901 Va. LEXIS 70 (1901) (see Gardner v. Moores Admr, 122 Va . 10, 94 S.E. 162 (1917)). This section, § 55-87, former §§ 55-88 through 55-90 and former § 55-94 relate to gifts, loans, sales, or partition of the same kind of property, desc ribed by the same terms namely, goods or chattels or goods and chattels. They are closely connected in subject matter and in the language employed, and it can hardly be doubted that whatever was meant by the words goods or chattels  or goods and chattels in either one of these sections must have been intended of the same words in each of the other sections. First Nat'l Bank v. Holland, 99 Va. 495, 39 S.E. 126, 1901 Va. LEXIS 70 (1901). Where an alleged gift by a mother to her daughter, with whom she resided, was not of money, but was a part of a judgment which the donor had recovered against her son, a mere chose in action, the provision of this section, relating to the residence together of the donor and donee at their place of residence, has no application thereto. Gardner v. Moore's Adm'r, 122 Va. 10, 94 S.E. 162, 1917 Va. LEXIS 78 (1917). Paraphernalia  defined.  For purposes of this section, the Supreme Court would adopt the following definition of paraphernalia found in the Oxford English Dictionary (1971): p ersonal belongings, esp., articles of adornment or attire, trappings; also the articles that compose an apparatus, outfit or equipment; . . . appointments or appurtenances in general. Teed v. Powell, 236 Va. 36, 372 S.E.2d 131, 5 Va. Law Rep. 474, 19 88 Va. LEXIS 113 (1988). Requirements for gift are intention and actual or constructive delivery.  In order for a gift inter vivos to be effective there must be an intention in praesenti on the part of the donor to make the gift and there must be such actual or constructive delivery as divests the donor of all dominion and control over the property and invests it in donee. Taylor v. Smith, 199 Va. 871, 102 S.E.2d 160, 1958 Va. LEXIS 135 (1958). In Virginia, in order for there to be a valid gift of personal property, it must be shown that there existed a present intention on the part of the donor to make a gift, coupled with a delivery, either actual or constructive, such as to divest the donor of all dominion and control over the property and place it in the donee. In addition to the common-law requirements of a valid gift, this section requires a deed or will, unless actual possession comes to and remains with the donee or some person claiming under him. Sadler v. Garrett, 45 Bankr. 190, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4429 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984). What constitutes delivery.  The delivery of possession may be actual, constructive or symbolical, depending upon the nature of the thing given. Yancey v. Field, 85 Va. 756, 8 S.E. 721, 1889 Va. LEXIS 88 (1889); Thomas' Adm'r v. Lewis, 89 Va. 1, 15 S.E. 389, 1892 Va. LEXIS 73 (1892). To render a gift effectual, the thing given, or the means of obtaining it, must be delivered by the donor to the donee, or to his agent, and accepted by him. Yanc ey v. Field, 85 Va. 756, 8 S.E. 721, 1889 Va. LEXIS 88 (1889). Delivery vesting equitable title is all that is necessary.  A delivery which vests an equitable title only in the donee is all that is necessary to constitute a valid gift. First Nat'l Bank v.

No t necessary that deed be recorded.  Under this statute, a deed is valid between the parties even without being recorded. Henry v. Graves, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 244, 1861 Va. LEXIS 5 (1861). Dono r and donee residing together.  If the donor and donee reside together, possession or delivery at their common place of residence will not be sufficient to constitute a valid gift. Thomas' Adm'r v. Lewis, 89 Va. 1, 15 S.E. 389, 1892 Va. LEXIS 73 (1892); First Nat'l Bank v. Holland, 99 Va. 495, 39 S.E. 126, 1901 Va. LEXIS 70 (1901). This section applies to a husband and wife residing together regardless of whether there were any creditors of the donor at the time the alleged gifts were made. Kendrick v. Watkins, 121 F.2d 287, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 3202 (4th Cir. 1941). This section was held applicable where husband bought furniture and other household articles several years before he went bankrupt and gave them to his wife witho ut executing a deed or other writing. Kendrick v. Watkins, 121 F.2d 287, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 3202 (4th Cir. 1941). Sale t o wife and resale to husband.  A husband, a merchant, conveyed to his wife a stock of goods which she immediately resold to him. There was no valuable consideration for either transfer. After t hese transfers the husband became indebted to complainant for purchases of merchandise in the ordinary course of business. These purchases from complainant by the husband were made in his own name and solely on his own credit. The husband at the time of the sale to his wife and resale, and thereafter, continued in actual possession of the stock of goods. It was held that neither this section nor former § 55-83 in any way affected the title which the husband took under the contract of resale, and that the sale and resale between husband and wife did not make the wife a debtor as to purchases from complainant made by her husband. Canada v. C.H. Beasley &amp; Bros., 132 Va. 166, 111 S.E. 251 (1922), overruled in part by Lofton Ridge, LLC v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 268 Va. 377, 601 S.E.2d 648 (2004), to the extent that it suggests judicial estoppel applies in cases where the parties are not the same and do not have a derivative liability relationship . Jewelry as mar ital property.  Where husband testified that he gave his wife jewelry valued at $5,000 during the course of the marriage, the commissioner omitted the jewelry completely from the property that was valued for purposes of making an equitable distribution award, and the wife argued that the jewelry should have been excluded because it was personal paraphernalia and, thus, was exempt as a gift under this section, the court r ejected the wifes argument and classified the jewelry as marital property. Rein v. Rein, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 699 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 29, 1994). Burden of proof.  The one claiming the validity of the gift has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence all the facts and circumstances which would show that the gif t was, in fact, a valid one. Sadler v. Garrett, 45 Bankr. 190, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4429 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984). When a donee claims title to personal property in a gift inter vivos, the burden of proof rests upon him to establish by clear and convincing evidence every fact and circumstance necessary to show that validity of the gift. The intention of the donor to part with title and delivery of possession are essential requirements. Nelson v. Liggan , 189 Va. 637, 53 S.E.2d 798, 1949 Va. LEXIS 207 (1949). The law does not presume a gift and where a donee claims title to personal property by virtue of a gift inter vivos, the burden of proof rests upon him to show ev ery fact and circumstance necessary to constitute a valid gift by clear and convincing evidence. Taylor v. Smith, 199 Va. 871, 102 S.E.2d 160, 1958 Va. LEXIS 135 (1958). Evidence was insufficient to establish a gift of money found, after the alleged donor s death, in a safety deposit box which had been rented by the alleged donor in the name of the alleged donee. Taylor v. Smith, 199 Va. 871, 102 S.E.2d 160, 1958 Va. LEXIS 135 (1958). Three shotguns and a rifle given by decedent to her son did not qualify as gifts inter vivos where the son lived all his life with the decedent and therefore no actual possession existed. Teed v.

Consent or participation in an immoral or unlawful act by plaintiff precludes recovery f or injuries sustained as a result of that act. Wackwitz v. Roy, 244 Va. 60, 418 S.E.2d 861, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3230, 1992 Va. LEXIS 58 (1992). Although punishment for suicide rescinded, suicide remains common-law crime.  That the legislature affirmatively rescinded the punishment for suicide without decriminalizing the act confirmed to the district court that, although the State c annot punish a suicide in the respects indicated, it in fact remains a common-law crime. Hill v. Nicodemus, 755 F. Supp. 692, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1479 (W.D. Va. 1991), aff'd, 979 F.2d 987, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 30063 (4th Cir. 1992). Although the General Assembly has rescinded the punishment for suicide, it has not decriminalized the act. Suicide, therefore, remains a common-law crime in Virgi nia as it does in a number of other common-law states. Wackwitz v. Roy, 244 Va. 60, 418 S.E.2d 861, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3230, 1992 Va. LEXIS 58 (1992). Suicide remains a common-law crime in Virginia. Hill v. Nicodemus, 979 F.2d 987, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 30063 (4th Cir. 1992). To constitute suicide at common law the person must be of years, of discretion and of so und mind; this common-law rule comports with a contemporary definition of suicide. Wackwitz v. Roy, 244 Va. 60, 418 S.E.2d 861, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3230, 1992 Va. LEXIS 58 (1992). Where the plaintiff alleged that her decedent was of unsound mind when he killed himself, if this were so, then he was not guilty of the common-law crime of suici de, and his act would not be a bar per se to the administrators action. Wackwitz v. Roy, 244 Va. 60, 418 S.E.2d 861, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3230, 1992 Va. LEXIS 58 (1992). Convict may take, hold and dispose of his property.  There is no statute in Virginia that deprives a convict of the power to make contracts or conveyances of his real estate, and corruption of blood and forfeiture o f estate on conviction of felony as at common law has been expressly abolished by this section. So, in Virginia, the right of a person to take, hold, and dispose of his property, real and personal, is not affected by his attainder of felony. Therefore, a convict is capable of executing a valid power of attorney. Haynes v. Peterson, 125 Va. 730, 100 S.E. 471, 1919 Va. LEXIS 62 (1919). Slayer statute did not implicate prohibition against corruption of blood.  Version of the Virginia Slayer Statute, § 55-401 et seq., which was in effect on the date of the decedents murder in 2005 neither implicated nor violated V irginias prohibition against corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.

In general.  Under this statute every conceivable interest in or claim to real estate, whether present or future, vested or contingent, and however acquired may be disposed of by deed or will. Young v. Young, 89 Va. 675, 17 S.E. 470, 1893 Va. LEXIS 86 (1893) (see Carrington v. Goddin, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 587 (1857); Wilson v. Langhorne, 102 Va. 631, 47 S.E. 871 (1904); Heuser v. Belvin, 118 Va. 346, 87 S.E. 594 (1916)). Although § 55-2 was inapplicable to the conveyance of easements because an easement was not an estate, the circuit courts judgment was reversed; the deeds at issue, along with a plat incorporated therein for descriptive purposes, did not contain operative words manifesting an intention to grant an easement. Considering the particular circumstances of the two deeds and the plat at issue, and resolving any d oubt against the establishment of an easement, there was no conveyance of an express easement across the property owners two parcels for the benefit of the limited liability companys parcel. Burdette v. Brush Mt. Estates, LLC, 278 Va. 286, 682 S. E.2d 549, 2009 Va. LEXIS 91 (2009). Construction w ith other law.  Virginia Conservation Easement Act [§§ 10.1-1009 through 10.1-1016] did not create a new right to burden land by a negative easement in gross for the purpos e of land conservation and historic preservation, but facilitated the continued creation of such easements by providing a clear statutory framework under which tax exemptions are made available to charitable organizations devoted to those purposes and ta x benefits and incentives are provided to the grantors of such easements, contrary to the common law; moreover, the easement at issue was not of a novel character and is consistent with the statutory recognition of negative easements in gross for conserv ation and historic purposes. United States v. Blackman, 270 Va. 68, 613 S.E.2d 442, 2005 Va. LEXIS 69 (2005). Section changed common-law rule.  Under this section, the common-law rule was changed and every conceivable interest in or claim to real estate, whether present or future, vested or contingent, an d however acquired, may be disposed of by deed or will. Weddle v. Nunley, 43 Bankr. 415, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4775 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1984). The statute changed the common-law rule by declaring that any interest in or claim to real estate may be disposed of by deed or will. Carrington v. Goddin , 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 587, 1857 Va.

Belvin, 118 Va . 346, 87 S.E. 594 (1916)). Under this section contingent remainders and executory devises may be disposed of by deed or will. Copenhaver v. Pendleton, 155 Va. 463, 155 S.E. 802, 1930 Va. LE XIS 178 (1930); In re Camden, 217 F. Supp. 634, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10194 (W.D. Va. 1963). Under this section the right of contingent remaindermen to convey their interests in property cannot be questioned. Larkin v. Wright, 185 Va. 447, 39 S.E.2d 355, 1946 Va. LEXIS 216 (1946); In re Camden, 217 F. Supp. 634, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10194 (W.D. Va. 1963). At common law, a contingent remainder passed only by estoppel, but under this section any interest in, or claim to, real estate may be transferred by deed or will . Hence, the deed of the debtor, conveying all of his property of every description includes his interest in a contingent remainder. Wilson v. Langhorne, 102 Va. 631, 47 S.E. 871, 1904 Va. LEXIS 110 (1904). Under the provisions of this section and §§ 55-49, 55-75, the effect of a joint devise to testators three sons, with a conditional limitation over that if one or more of them shall die, leaving no issue, his or their share, as the case may be, shall go to his surviving brothers or brother, is to invest the devisees under such a will with the authority to convey and relinquish all their right, title and interest in the land devised, and the grantee of them takes a fee simple estate. Smith v. Smith, 112 Va. 617, 72 S.E. 119, 1911 Va. LEXIS 127 (1911). Vested remainder subject to divestment.  Whether interest acquired was a vested remainder subject to divestment or a contingent remainder, it was nevertheless transferable under this section and so passe d to trustee in bankruptcy. In re Camden, 217 F. Supp. 634, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10194 (W.D. Va. 1963). Executory interests.  An executory devise stands upon precisely the same footing as contingent remainders insofar as transmissibility of the subject thereof is concerned, and an intere st in such subject may be conveyed (certainly by virtue of such a statute as this section) prior to the happening of the contingency upon which the interest is appointed by the will to vest in right of possession, provided the grantor has at the time of conveyance a possibility of taking coupled with an interest. This he has, according to the authorities, if he, at such time, is an ascertained person to take under the devise. And he is such an ascertained person if he is designated by name or by class, all of which class are to take, and one of which he is. Medley v. Medley, 81 Va. 265, 1886 Va. LEXIS 95 (1886); Prince v. Barham, 127 Va. 462, 103 S.E. 626, 1920 Va. LEXIS 64 (1920). Where a possible taker under an executory devise is designated by class, and he should die before the testator, if the will speaks as of that time in designating the person to take, the survivors of the class will take; but if he survives such time, his interest, under an executory devise, equally as if it were a contingent remainder, is descendible, and assignable in equity, and also at law, certainly by virtue of this statute in Virginia. Many of the authorities hold that the same is true at common law since the statute of uses and of wills dispenses with livery of seisin. Prince v. Barham, 127 Va. 462, 103 S.E. 626, 1920 Va. LEXIS 64 (1920). Possibility of rever ter.  Though possibilities of reverter were inalienable at common law by deed or will, they are alienable by both deed and will under the provisions of this section and § 64.1-46. Copenhaver v. Pendleton, 155 Va. 463, 155 S.E. 802, 1930 Va. LEXIS 178 (1930) (see County School Bd. v. Dowell, 190 Va. 676, 58 S.E.2d 38 (1950); Sanford v. Sims, 192 Va. 644, 66 S.E.2d 495 (1951)). Under these sections a possibility of reverter, whether it depends upon a base or qualified fee or upon a fee simple limited upon a condition subsequent, is alien able by either deed or will, at any time, either before or after the happening of the contingency or the breach of the condition subsequent upon which the possibility of reverter depends. Copenhaver v. Pendleton, 155 Va. 463, 155 S.E. 802, 1930 Va. LEXIS 178 (1930). Right to construct s ewer.  A deed conveying part of a tract of land (consisting of 47.5 acres) provided that the grantee should have a right to construct a sewer through the property of the grantor. The deed contemplated the use of the easement not only for the drainage of the 47.5 acres conveyed, but also as essential to the drainage of an incorporated town, and other lands not included in that particular tract. It was held that the easem ent was not appurtenant to the 47.5 acres conveyed by the deed. It was either an easement in gross, or else extends the area of the land to which it is appurtenant, so as, at least, to include land naturally drained by the channel. If it is to be regarde d as an easement in gross, it is still an interest in land, and, therefore, may be disposed of by deed or will under this section. City of Richmond v. Richmond Sand &amp; Gravel Co., 123 Va. 1, 96 S.E. 204, 1918 Va. LEXIS 1 (1918). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. Contingent remainders.  Because there was no reason that would prevent a beneficiary from alienating a part of the beneficiarys interest in a trust, pursuant to §§ 55-6 and 55- 52, a commissioners determination that a beneficiarys expectancy went directly to the beneficiarys surviving children was affirmed.

The effect of this section is to validate remainders in such property as remains undispo sed of by the life tenant where a fee simple estate arises when the first taker is given a life estate coupled with the power of absolute disposition. Rawlings v. Briscoe, 214 Va. 44, 197 S.E.2d 211, 1973 Va. LEXIS 252 (1973).

Joynes , 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 692 (1871), is limited by this section to the property that remains after a life estate with power in the life tenant to dispose of such property if he desires. Rule v. First Nat'l Bank, 182 Va. 22 7, 28 S.E.2d 709, 1944 Va. LEXIS 172 (1944). Under this section that which was void for repugnancy and uncertainty under the doctrine of May v. Joynes, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 692 (1871), is made valid. Now the gift over is validated where the first taker is given an express estate for life, coupled with the power of absolute disposition. Borum v. National Valley Bank, 195 Va. 899, 80 S.E.2d 594, 1954 Va. LEXIS 168 (1954). The rule of May v. Joynes, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 692 (1871) held that a life estate coupled with the absolute power of disposition created a fee simple estate invalidating the remainder; this rule obviously could defeat a testators intent, and, therefore, a statut e was enacted to validate the remainder to the extent that the life tenant had not disposed of it. First Va. Bank v. United States, 490 F.2d 532, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10638 (4th Cir. 1974). But does not save property lawfully disposed of by life tenant during lifetime.  This section does not save property from the operation of the rule in May v. Joynes, 61 Va.

LEXIS 252 (1973). The following requirements must be met in order to apply this section: (1) The first tak er must be given an express estate for life. (2) There must be conferred expressly or by implication a power upon the life tenant in his lifetime or by will to dispose absolutely of said property. (3) There must be a limitation in rem ainder over. (4) There must be a corpus on which the limitation in remainder over can operate.

The amendment of 1908 applied to any estate, whether for life or in fee, and permitted a valid remainder, even after a fee, if power of disposition, where granted, was not exercised and there remained anything after the death of the devisee. Southworth v. Sullivan, 162 Va. 325, 173 S.E. 524, 1934 Va. LEXIS 248 (1934). This was so unsatisfactory to the Code revisors of 1919 that they changed the amendment and limited the remainder over to cases where there was only an express es tate for life. Therefore, subsequent to the revision of 1919, except where there is an express estate for life, the remainder is void just as it was prior to the amendment of 1908. Moore v.

This section is expressly limited to devises and bequests for life with absolute power of disposition. In such circumstances the doctrine of May v. Joynes, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 692 (1871), which holds that whenever in any devise or conveyance a life estate is given a nd there is afterwards given to the life tenant or first taker power to dispose of or consume the corpus of the estate, the first taker is vested with a fee simple estate, has been abolished, and the estate of the remaindermen preserved. The section is r emedial and should be liberally construed. Christian v. Wilson's Ex'rs, 153 Va. 614, 151 S.E. 300, 1930 Va. LEXIS 257, cert. denied, 282 U.S. 840, 51 S. Ct. 21, 75 L.

Thus, this section has no application where there is a li mitation over after conveyance of a fee simple.  Notwithstanding this section, where a testator has given his wife a fee simple estate, an attempted limitation over by him of any portion remaining at her death i s void. This section has no application because the gift to the first taker was not of a life estate but of a fee simple. Skinner v. Skinner's Adm'r, 158 Va. 326, 163 S.E. 90, 1932 Va.

The act of 1776 operated upon all estates tail in possession, and those in reversion or remainder, after the determination of an estate for life, or lives, or of any lesser estate; but a greater estate than for life or lives, was not within the operation of the act. An estate tail in remainder, after the determination of a preceding estate tail, e.g., was not affected by the act. Roy v. Garnett, 2 Va. (2 Wash.) 9 (1794). Hence, the statute of 1785, abolishing all entails, was reenacted from the statute of 1776, which had failed to accomplish its avowed purpose. Bells v. Gillespie, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 273, 1827 Va. LEXIS 57 (1827). It was held that by the act of 1776, for docking entails, all remainders, contingent as well as vested, were utterly barred, whether the entail was created before or after passage of the act. Hence, a devise of lands to A. and if the said A. should die not having any lawful heir of his body, then the land to go to B., created an estate tail in A., which by the statute was converted into a fee simple, and the limi tation over was void.

Hood v. Haden, 82 Va. 588 (1886). This is not true under the present statute, which is coordinate with the rule itself . The parties of the first part in a deed granted property to the party of the second part: To have and to hold unto the party of the second part for her lifeti me and then to her heirs forever. It was held that under this section the language used gave to the grantee an estate for life and to her children a remainder in fee. Puckett v. Campbell, 151 Va. 213, 144 S.E. 434, 1928 Va. LEXIS 225 (1928). Rule of property; not of construction.  The rule in Shelleys Case, where the requisites concur, controls the intention of the testator, or grantor, and overrides his purpose, often very clearly expr essed, to limit the ancestor to an estate of freehold. The rule is not a means to discover the intent of the grantor, or testator, but, supposing the intent ascertained, the rule controls it. Taylor v. Cleary, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 330, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 4 48, 1877 Va. LEXIS 25 (1877); Turner v. Monteiro, 127 Va. 537, 103 S.E. 572, 1920 Va. LEXIS 68 (1920) (see Walker v. Lewis, 90 Va. 578, 19 S.E. 258 (1894)). Words must be used to import class of persons to take indefinitely in succession.  It is a part of the rule in Shelleys Case and essential to its operation, that the words used to indicate the persons to whom the estate is limited, by way of remainder, must import a class of persons to take indefinitely in succession. If they do import such a class, then the rule is of inflexible application; but if the words are used to designate particular individuals, the words so used are words of purch ase and not of limitation, e.g., grant to A. for life, remainder to the heirs of A. now living, or remain der to the sons of A. and their heirs, or remainder to the children of A. In all of these instances, particular individuals are indicated by the words used; hence, the rule does not apply. Turner v. Monteiro, 127 Va. 537, 103 S.E. 572, 1920 Va. LEXIS 68 (1920). Descendants and heirs of the body are of equivalent meaning.  The rule in Shelleys Case applies when the limitation in remainder is to the heirs of the body of the tenant of the freehold. The words descendant s and heirs of the body are of equivalent meaning. Turner v. Monteiro, 127 Va. 537, 103 S.E. 572, 1920 Va. LEXIS 68 (1920). Who are descendants.   While the word descendants is not a technical word to the extent that the law has not impressed it with a different meaning from that accorded in common a cceptation and general understanding, it is a word much used in law and of very clear and definite meaning. A descendant is an individual proceeding from an ancestor in any degree. It is synonymous with issue. It is offspring, near or remote. The word child is not synonymous with the word descendant, though a child is a descendant and a descendant may be a child; but a descendant may also proceed from an ancestor in the remotest as well as the nearest degree. Obviously, this is not tru e as to a child. Turner v. Monteiro, 127 Va. 537, 103 S.E. 572, 1920 Va. LEXIS 68 (1920). Application of rule.  Under a will which took effect before the abolition of the rule in Shelleys Case, a testator gave land to two of his sons during their lifetime to hold jointl y and after the death of the last of the two to their descendants, if they have any; if not, to a third party or his descendants. Held, that by force of this rule in Shelleys Case the two sons took an estate tail, which, by operation of the statute, then as now in force, was converted into a joint fee. Turner v. Monteiro, 127 Va. 537, 103 S.E. 572, 1920 Va. LEXIS 68 (1920). The court held that where a testator gave his estate to his wife during her life, and at her death to be equally divided amongst all of his children and the share s of his two daughters to be held by them during their natural lives and no longer, and then equally to be divided between their heirs lawfully begotten, the words heirs lawfully to be begotten (or similar words) were words of limitation and the daughters took the whole interest in their shares of the estate. Moore v. Brooks, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 135, 1855 Va. LEXIS 11 (1855) (see Tinsley v. Jones, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 289 (1856); Halls Exr v. Smith, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 70 (1874); Walker v. L ewis, 90 Va. 578, 19 S.E. 258 (1894)). Rule not applicable.  The court held that a grant by D. to his grandson R., his executors, administrators and assigns, from and after the grantors death, for and during his life on ly; and after his death the said piece of land to go to such person or persons as shall at that time answer the description of heir or heirs at law of the said R., and such person or persons shall take the said land under that description as purchasers u nder and by virtue of this deed, and not by inheritance as heirs of the said R., created in R. but a life estate in the land; and the persons who at the time of R.s death answered the description of his heirs at law took as purchasers under the deed. Taylor v. Cleary, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 330, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 448, 1877 Va. LEXIS 25 (1877). The statute does not apply to a trust deed for the benefit of the grantors wife  for life and the remainder to the heirs of her body begotten by the grantor in the trust deed. Halsey v. Fulton, 119 Va. 571, 89 S.E. 912, 1916 Va. LEXIS 130 (1916). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. Application of rule.  Because a life estate granted to the testatrix was neither expressed nor implied, and the devise was not saved from the operation of May v. Joynes and § 55-7, a motion for summary judgment filed by the testatrixs daughter seeking a declaration that the parcel conveyed did not pass under her will because she, in effect, had only a life estate in the property with a remainder over to her heirs, was denied.

In any case under this section where there is a recorded deed of conveyance to a trustee, the interest of the beneficiaries thereunder shall be deemed to be personal pr operty. Judgments against a beneficiary and consensual liens against real property of a beneficiary do not attach to real property that is the subject of such a deed of conveyance unless the judgment is docketed or the lien recorded in the county or city where the property is located (i) before recordation of the deed creating the land trust and (ii) while the beneficiary has record title to the real property.

Trustee in a land trust receives both legal and equitable title.  Unlike a creditor trust where legal title resides in the trustee while the beneficiary retains equitable title, the trustee in a land trust receives both legal an d equitable title to the property.

Beneficiary was proper but not necessary party in mechanics lien action.  A beneficiary may be a proper party to an action to enforce a mechanics lien, which would provide notice and the opportunity to preserve its interests in the proceeds from a potential judicial sale; nevertheless, the beneficiary is not a necessary party to the enforcement suit.

Status of land trust.  Where the facts in the record were insufficient to support a finding that an entity other than a land trust was actually created, and the trust agreement specific ally provided that it would not be deemed to create or evidence the existence of a corporation, association, joint venture, or partnership, a land trust created under this section was not some type of business organization.

Remedy provided is cumulative.  The instant case was a suit against vendees who had assumed the payment of a mortgage. Defendants demurred on the ground that the complainant had a complete and a dequate remedy at law under this section. Upon the question of whether under this section the complainant might sue the defendants at law on their assumption of the mortgage debt due complainant, the Supreme Court expressed no opinion. However, the statu tory remedy by an action at law under this section is cumulative only in such cases, and does not oust courts of chancery from the jurisdiction they have long exercised to grant relief to a mortgage creditor against the grantee of mortgaged property who has assumed the mortgage debt, under the doctrine of subrogation.

Sherritt, 95 F.2d 823, 1938 U.S. App. LEXIS 4794 (4th Cir. 1938). Limited liability of purchaser of property subject to existing lien.  When one purchases property subject to an existing lien the purchaser is not personally liable for any deficiency. In such a case the defaulter can only lose the underlying property. Unlike taking property subject to an existing lien, when a purchaser takes property and assumes the underlying lien the purchaser is personally liable for the indebtedness including any deficiency that may result from foreclosure. Ba nkers Mtg. Corp. v. Jacobs, 613 F. Supp. 1579, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17099 (E.D. Va. 1985). Mortgagee has no direct action at law against second mortgagor.  The mortgagees right to hold a subsequent purchaser liable is not grounded in contract between the mortgagee and the subsequent purchaser, as generally no suc h contract exists, but on the theory that the covenant of the subsequent purchaser is a collateral security obtained by the mortgagor, which by equitable subrogation inures to the benefit of the mortgagee. Thus, as between the original mortgagor and the subsequent purchaser, the latter is the principal debtor and the mortgagor is his surety. The promise of a subsequent purchaser to assume the mortgage debt upon the property is a contract only between the two of them absent an independent undertaking by the purchaser and the mortgagee. Admittedly, the contract benefits the mortgagee but the primary beneficiary of this collateral undertaking is the mortgagor. Therefore, absent some statutory authority, no direct action at law (as distinguished from equit y) by the mortgagee against the second mortgagor will lie. If upon foreclosure the property does not bring enough to satisfy the entire debt, the mortgage creditor may proceed in an equity court against the subsequent purchaser for any deficiency. Banker s Mtg. Corp. v. Jacobs, 613 F. Supp. 1579, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17099 (E.D. Va. 1985). Mortgagee need not first foreclose prior to obtaining a judgment against a subsequent purchaser who assumes in writing the obligation secured by the property, as there need be no privity of contract under the present third-party beneficiary statute of Virginia. Bankers Mtg. Corp. v. Jacobs, 613 F. Supp. 1579, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 170 99 (E.D. Va. 1985). Restrictive covenant enforceable by beneficiary.  Where a covenant is for the benefit of third persons they have the right to enforce it in their own names, under this section. Cheatham v. Taylor, 148 Va. 26, 138 S.E. 545, 1927 Va. LEXIS 207 (1927). A restrictive covenant for the benefit of a third party may be enforced in his own name under this section. Meagher v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 195 Va. 138, 7 7 S.E.2d 461, 1953 Va. LEXIS 184 (1953). Section not applicable.  Where premises are subleased to an assignee of the lessees who does not assume the obligation of maintaining fire insurance on the premises, which obligation was a covenant in the lease between lessor and lessees, this section has no application, since it does not purport to create a contract where no contract exists. Burton v. Chesapeake Box &amp; Lumber Corp., 190 Va. 755, 57 S.E.2d 904, 1950 Va. LEXIS 166 (1950). Section held inapplicable. Benoit v. Baxter, 196 Va. 360, 83 S.E.2d 442, 1954 Va. LEXIS 228 (1954). Contract found not to be made for the benefit of third party. Graybar Elec. Co. v. Doley, 273 F.2d 284, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 4644 (4th Cir. 1959). Because the benefit to the third-party referred to in the first phrase of the statute derives from an instrument, this section must refer to a benefit from a writ ten document. Thorsen v. Richmond SPCA, 292 Va. 257, 786 S.E.2d 453, 2016 Va. LEXIS 68 (2016) (but see § 64.2-520.1 and notes thereunder). This section did not apply to an oral contract between an attorney and a testator where although the statute clearly applied to a written instrument, it did not a brogate the common law, which allowed third-party beneficiaries to sue upon oral contracts. Thorsen v. Richmond SPCA, 292 Va. 257, 786 S.E.2d 453, 2016 Va. LEXIS 68 (2016) (but see § 64.2-520.1 and notes thereunder). Implied guarantee no t within section.  Where defendants, for whom a building was being erected, agreed with plaintiff to retain sufficient funds and pay plaintiff for materials furnished, an action on the agreement was to recover upon an implied guarantee made by defendants to plaintiff and was not a suit upon a contract made by defendants for plaintiffs benefit, such as is dealt with in this section.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. This section made a decided change in the law in regard to suits to quiet title. Kennedy Coal Corp. v. Buckhorn Coal Corp., 140 Va. 37, 124 S.E. 482, 1924 Va. LEXIS 155 (1924). It extends equity jurisdiction in case of removal of a cloud from title to conditions wh ere the plaintiff is both out of possession and has only an equitable title. United States v. McIntosh, 2 F. Supp. 244, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1618 (D. Va. 1932). Prior to Acts 1912, p. 76, from which this section was derived, only those who had a com plete legal and equitable title to land, accompanied by possession, could invoke the jurisdiction of a court of equity to remove a cloud upon their title. Buchanan Co. v. Heirs of Smyth, 115 Va. 704, 80 S.E. 794, 1914 Va. LEXIS 123 (1914). Possession is not necessary.  Under the provisions of this section it is immaterial whether the complainant in a suit to quiet title is in or out of possession of the land. Kennedy Coal Corp. v. Buckhorn Coal Corp., 140 Va. 37, 124 S.E. 482, 1924 Va. LEXIS 155 (1924) (see Buchanan Co. v. Heirs of Smyth, 115 Va. 704, 80 S.E. 794 (1914); Payne v. Buena Vista Extract Co., 124 Va. 296, 98 S.E. 34 (1919); Buchanan Coal Co. v. Street, 175 Va. 531, 9 S.E.2d 339 (1940)). It is doubtful whether this statute can be legally effective to expand federal equity jurisdiction to remove a cloud from title to all cases where the plaintiff is both out of possession and has only an equitable title. It could hardly be properly extended to cases where the plaintiff out of possession but with legal title has adequate r emedy in an ejectment suit. United States v. McIntosh, 2 F. Supp. 244, 1932 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1618 (D. Va. 1932). A void commissioners deed conveying property to a divorced wife constituted a cloud on the husbands title which a court of equity, under this section, had jurisdiction and power to remove by cancelling and setting aside said deed. Watson v. Mose, 165 Va. 661, 183 S.E. 428, 1936 Va. LEXIS 251 (1936). As to quieting title involving grants of public lands, see Chapman v. Kite, 130 Va. 70, 107 S.E. 702, 1921 Va. LEXIS 142 (1921). Settlement of disputes as to title and boundaries.  Except when the relief which is authorized by this section is sought, and in the absence of some peculiar equity, courts of equity are without jurisdiction to set tle disputes regarding the title and boundaries of land. Duty v. Honaker Lumber Co., 131 Va. 31, 108 S.E. 863, 1921 Va. LEXIS 4 (1921); Bath Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Back Creek Mt. Corp., 140 Va. 280, 125 S.E. 213, 1924 Va. LEXIS 171 (1924). Judgment lien did not constitute good title to property.  Judgment creditors action for quiet title failed because the creditors claim of superior title failed because the creditors judgment lien did not cons titute good title to the property, and the creditor cited absolutely no support for the proposition that its claimed interest in the form of a judgment lien that had attached to the property was itself a title to the estate. PEI P'ship Architects, LLC v. Celebrate Va. South, LLC, No. 3:13-CV-48, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38030 (E.D. Va. Mar. 19, 2013). When there is another remedy.  The fact that complainants owned the fee simple title to a tract of land and the mineral rights in an adjacent tract did not deprive them of the right to have the established boundary lines of the adjacent tract fixed and determined by a court of equity, even though, as owners of the fee in the first-mentioned tract, they might have proceeded under §§ 8.01-179 through 8.01-183, as coterminous owners of the surface with the owners of the surface of the adjacent tract, to have the boundary line between the tracts determined. Buchanan Coal Co. v. Street, 175 Va. 531, 9 S.E.2d 339, 1940 Va. LEXIS 198 (1940). Determination of title as between hostile claims.  A court of equity is without jurisdiction in a suit to remove a cloud upon title to determine the question of title as between several independent, distinct and h ostile claims. Such an independent and hostile claim, involving the whole property and denying in toto and ab initio the title of the complainants, cannot be set up and adjudicated in a suit in equity. To permit this would authorize an adverse claimant t o implead other claimants of the title in such a way as to substitute an equity suit for an action of ejectment. Duty v. Honaker Lumber Co., 131 Va. 31, 108 S.E. 863, 1921 Va. LEXIS 4 (1921). Recovery of possession .  As to jurisdiction under this section of a suit to try title and recover possession from an adverse claimant, see Roller v. Armentrout, 118 Va. 173, 86 S.E. 906, 1915 Va. LEXIS 137 (1915), writ of error dismissed, 245 U.S. 642, 38 S. Ct. 221, 62 L. Ed. 527, 1918 U.S. LEXIS 1654 (1918). Forfeiture for breach of condition not within section.  A suit in equity to annul and rescind a deed for breach of a condition subsequent cannot be treated as a suit to remove a cloud from title where the complainant h as neither legal nor equitable title, and therefore does not fall within the class of persons who may bring a suit to quiet title under this section. Until the consummation of the forfeiture, the grantor in a case like this has nothing but a right of act ion. Pence v. Tidewater Townsite Corp., 127 Va. 447, 103 S.E. 694, 1920 Va. LEXIS 63 (1920). Relief against fraud and enforcement of trusts.  It was never intended, either by this section, or by the cases which have construed it, to deny to a court of equity jurisdiction either to relieve against fraud or to declare and enforce trusts resulting therefrom. Bath Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Back Creek Mt. Corp., 140 Va. 280, 125 S.E. 213, 1924 Va. LEXIS 171 (1924). In a suit to remove clouds upon title and to establish a resulting trust, equity had jurisdiction and it was not harmful to deny a jury trial. Bath Hardwood Lumbe r Co. v. Back Creek Mt. Corp., 140 Va. 280, 125 S.E. 213, 1924 Va. LEXIS 171 (1924). Amendment of bill.  In a suit involving title to a tract of land, the original bill sought to have a grant from the Commonwealth to appellants cancelled but after the court decided t hat appellee had failed to prove that the grant had been procured through fraud, the bill was amended so as to pray to have the deed to appellants removed as a cloud upon appellees title. It was held that the procedure adopted by the trial court conf ormed to the provisions of this section. French v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., 171 Va. 211, 198 S.E. 503, 1938 Va. LEXIS 274 (1938).

Reprinted with permission. Common-Law Rule Against Perpetuities Superseded. As provided in Section 9, this Act supersedes the common-law Rule Against Perpetuities (Common-law Rule) in jurisdictions previously adhering to it (or repeals any statutory version or variation thereof previo usly in effect in the jurisdiction). The Common-law Rule (or the statutory version or variation thereof) is replaced by the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (Statutory Rule) set forth in this section and by the other provisions in this Act. Subsidiary Doctrines Continue in Force Except to the Extent the Provisions of Act Confli ct with Them. The courts in interpreting the Common-law Rule developed several subsidiary doctrines. In accordance with the general principle of statutory construction that statu tes in derogation of the common law are to be construed narrowly, a subsidiary doctrine is superseded by this Act only to the extent the provisions of the Act conflict with it. A listing and discussion of such subsidiary doctrines, such as the constructi onal preference for validity, the all-or-nothing rule for class gifts, and the doctrine of infectious invalidity, appears later, in Part G of this Comment. Application. Unless excluded by Section 4, the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (Statutory Rule) applies to nonvested property interests and to powers of appointment over property or property interests that are nongeneral powers, general testamentary powers, or ge neral powers not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent. The Statutory Rule does not apply to vested property interests (e.g., Xs interest in Example (23) of this Comment) or to presently exercisable general powers of appointment (e.g., Gs power in Example (19) of this Comment; Gs power in Example (1) in the Comment to Section 2; As power in Example (2) in the Comment to Section 2; Xs power in Example (3) in the Comment to Section 2; As noncumul ative power of withdrawal in Example (4) in the Comment to Section 2). The Common-law Rules Validating and Invalidating Sides. The Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is a rule of initial validity or invalidity. At common law, a nonvested property interest is either valid or invalid as of its creation. Like most rules of property law, the Common-law Rule has both a validating and an invalidating side. Both sides are derived from John Chipman Grays formulation of the Common-law Rule: Validating Side of the Common-law Rule. A nonvested property interest is valid when it is created (initially valid) if it is then certain to vest or terminate (fail to vest)  one or the other  no later than 21 years after the death of an individual then alive. Invalidating Side of the Common-law Rule. A nonvested property interest is invalid when it is created (initially invalid) if there is no such certainty. Notice that the invalidating side focuses on a lack of certainty, which means that invalidity under the Common-law Rule is not dependent on actual post-creation events but only on possible post-creation events. Actual post-creation events are irrelevant, even those that are known at the time of the lawsuit. It is generally recognized that the i nvalidating side of the Common-law Rule is harsh because it can invalidate interests on the ground of possible post-creation events that are extremely unlikely to happen and that in actuality almost never do happen, if ever. The Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities. The essential difference between the Common-law Rule and its statutory replacement is that the Statutory Rule preserves the Common-law Rules overall policy of preventing property from being tied up in unreasonably long o r even perpetual family trusts or other property arrangements, while eliminating the harsh potential of the Common-law Rule. The Statutory Rule achieves this result by codifying (in slightly revised form) the validating side of the Common-law Rule and mo difying the invalidating side by adopting a wait-and-see element. Under the Statutory Rule, interests that would have been initially v...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_55.1-125"><akn:num>§ 55.1-125</akn:num><akn:heading>When nonvested property interest or power of appointment created</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

C. For the pur poses of §§ 55.1-124 through 55.1-129, a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment arising from a transfer of property to a previously funded trust or other existing property arrangement is created when the nonvested property interest o r power of appointment in the original contribution was created.

OFFICIAL COMMENT Subsection (a): General Principles of Property Law; When Nonvested Property Interests an d Powers of Appointment are Created. Under Section 1, the period of time allowed by the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities is marked off from the time of creation of the nonvest ed property interest or power of appointment in question. Section 5, with certain exceptions, provides that the Act applies only to nonvested property interests and powers of appointment created on or after the effective date of the Act. Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), and in the second sentence of Section 5(a) for purposes of that section only, the time of creation of nonvested pro perty interests and powers of appointment is determined under general principles of property law. Since a will becomes effective as a dispositive instrument upon the decedents death, not upon the execution of the will, general principles of property law de termine that the time when a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by will is created is at the decedents death. With respect to a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by inter vivos transfer, the time when the interest or power is created is the dat e the transfer becomes effective for purposes of property law generally, normally the date of delivery of the deed. With respect to a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by the testamentary or inter vivos exercise of a power of appointment, general pri nciples of property law adopt the relation back doctrine. Under that doctrine, the appointed interests or powers are created when the power was created not when it was exercised, if the exercised power was a nongeneral power or a general testamentary power. If the exercised power was a general power presently exercisable, the relation back d octrine is not followed; the time of creation of the appointed property interests or appointed powers is regarded as the time when the power was irrevocably exercised, not when the power was created. Subsection (b): Postponement, for Purposes of this Act, of the Time when a Nonvested Pro perty Interest or a Power of Appointment is Created in Certain Cases. The reason that the significant date for purposes of this Act is the date of creation is that the unilateral control of the interest (or the interest subject to the power) by one person is then relinquished. In certain cases, all beneficial rights in a property interest (including an interest subject to a power of appointment) remain under the unilateral contr ol of one person even after the delivery of the deed or even after the decedents death. In such cases, under this subsection, the interest or power is created, for purposes of this Act, when no person, acting alone, has a power presently exercisable to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the property interest (or the property interest subject to the power of appointment). Example (1)  Revocable Inter-Vivos Trust Case. G conveyed property to a trustee, directing the trustee to pay the net income therefrom to himself (G) for life, then to Gs son A for his life, then to As children for the life of the survivor of A s children who are living at Gs death, and upon the death of such last surviving child, the corpus of the trust is to be distributed among As then-living descendants, per stirpes. G retained the power to revoke the trust. Because of Gs reservation of the power to revoke the trust, the creation for purposes of this Act of the nonvested property interests in this case occurs at G s death, not when the trust was established. This is in accordance with common law, for purposes of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities. Cook v. Horn, 214 Ga. 289, 104 S.E.2d 461 (1958). The rationale that justifies the postponement of the time of creation in such cases is as follows. A person, such as G in the above example, who alone can exercis e a power to become the unqualified beneficial owner of a nonvested property interest is in effect the owner of that property interest. Thus, any nonvested property interest subject to such a power is not created for purposes of this Act until the power terminates (by release, expiration at the death of the donee, or otherwise). Similarly, as noted above, any property interest or power of appointment created in an appointee by the irrevocable exercise of such a power is created at the time of the donee s irrevocable exercise. For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the power need not be a power to revoke, and it need not be held by the settlor or transferor. A presently exercisable power held by any person acting alone to make himself the unqualified beneficial owner of the nonvested property interest or the property interest subject to a power of appointment is sufficient. If such a power exists, the time when the interest or power is created, for purposes of this Act, is postponed until the termination of the power (by irrevocable exercise, release, contract to exercise or not to exercise, expiration at the death of the donee, or otherwise). An example of such a power that might not be held by the settlo r or transferor is a power, held by any person who can act alone, fully to invade the corpus of a trust. An important consequence of the idea that a power need not be held by the settlor for the time of creation to be postponed under this section is that it makes pos tponement possible even in cases of testamentary transfers. Example (2)  Testamentary Trust Case. G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income to A for life, remainder to such persons (including A, his creditors, his estate, and the creditors of his estate) as A shall appoint; in default of ap pointment, the property to remain in trust to pay the income to As children for the life of the survivor, and upon the death of As last surviving child, to pay the corpus to As grandchildren. A survived G. If A exercises his presently exercisable general power, any nonvested property interest or power of appointment created by As appointment is created for purpo ses of this Act when the power is exercised. If A does not exercise the power, the nonvested property interests in Gs gift-in-default clause are created when As power terminates (at As death). In either case, the postponement is justified bec ause the transaction is the equivalent of Gs having devised the full remainder interest (following As income interest) to A and of As having in turn transferred that interest in accordance with his exercise of the power or, in the event the p ower is not exercised, devised that interest at his death in accordance with Gs gift-in-default clause. Note, however, that if G had conferred on A a nongeneral power or a general testamentary power, A s power of appointment, any nonvested property interest or power of appointment created by As appointment, if any, and the nonvested property interests in Gs gift-in-default clause would be created at Gs death. Unqualified Beneficial Owner of the Nonvested Property Interest or the Property Interest Subject to a Power of Appointment. For the date of creation to be postponed under subsection (b), the presently exercisable power must be one that entitles the donee of the powe r to become the unqualified beneficial owner of the nonvested property interest (or the property interest subject to a nongeneral power of appointment, a general testamentary power of appointment, or a general power of appointment not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent). This requirement was met in Example (2), above, because A could by appointing the remainder interest to himself become the unqualified beneficial owner of all the nonvested property interests in Gs gift-in-default clause. In Example (2) it is not revealed whether A, if he exercised the power in his own favor, also had the right as sole beneficiary of the trust to compel the termination of the trust and possess himself as unqualified beneficial owner of the property that was the subject of the trust. Having the power to compel termination of the trust is not necess ary. If, for example, the trust in Example (2) was a spendthrift trust or contained any other feature that under the relevant local law (see Claflin v. Claflin, 149 Mass. 19, 20 N.E. 454 (1889); Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 337 (1959)) would prevent A as sole beneficiary from compelling termination of the trust, As presently exercisable ge neral power over the remainder interest would still postpone the time of creation of the nonvested property interests in Gs gift-in-default clause because the power enables A to become the unqualified beneficial owner of such interests. Furthermore, it is not necessary that the donee of the power have the pow...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_55.1-126"><akn:num>§ 55.1-126</akn:num><akn:heading>Reformation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Upon the petition of an interested person, a circuit court in the county or city in which the affected property or the greater part of such property is located shall re form a disposition in the manner that most closely approximates the transferors manifested plan of distribution and is within the 90 years allowed by subdivision A 2, B 2, or C 2 of § 55.1-124 if: 1.

Interpretation of holographic codi cil.  Although a trust established by a holographic codicil violated the common-law rule against perpetuities and the statutory rule against perpetuities set forth in § 55-12.1, the court was authorized by this section to reform the disposition of a will in a manner that most closely approximated the testatrixs plan of distribution. Eubank v. Eubank, 68 Va. Cir. 33, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 86 (Amherst County Apr. 2 9, 2005). OFFICIAL COMMENT Reformation. This section requires a court, upon the petition of an interested person, to reform a disposition whose validity is governed by the wait-and-see element of Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2) , or 1(c)(2) so that the reformed disposition is within the limits of the 90-year period allowed by those subsections, in the manner deemed by the court most closely to approxima te the transferors manifested plan of distribution, in three circumstances: First, when (after the application of the Statutory Rule) a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment becomes invalid under the Statutory Rule; second, when a cla ss gift has not but still might become invalid under the Statutory Rule and the time has arrived when the share of one or more class members is to take effect in possession or enjoyment; and third, when a nonvested property interest can vest, but cannot do so within the allowable 90-year period under the Statutory Rule. It is anticipated that the circumstances requisite to reformation will seldom arise, and consequently that this section will be applied infrequently. If, however, one of the three circumstances arises, the court in reforming is authorized to alter existing interests or powers and to create new interests or powers by implication or construction based on the transferors manifested plan of distribution as a whol e. In reforming, the court is urged not to invalidate any vested interest retroactively (the doctrine of infectious invalidity having been superseded by this Act, as indicated in the Comment to Section 1). The court is also urged not to reduce an age con tingency in excess of 21 unless it is absolutely necessary, and if it is deemed necessary to reduce such an age contingency, not to reduce it automatically to 21 but rather to reduce it no lower than absolutely necessary. See Example (3), below; Waggoner , Perpetuity Reform, 81 Mich.L.Rev. 1718, 1755-1759 (1983); Langbein &amp; Waggoner, Reformation of Wills on the Ground of Mistake: Change of Direction in American Law?, 130 U.Pa.L.Rev. 521, 546-49 (1982). Judicial Sale of Land Affected by Future Interests. Although this section  except for cases that fall under subsections (2) or (3)  defers the time when a court is directed to reform a disposition until the expiration of the 90-year permissible vesting period, this section is not to be understood as preventing an earlier application of other remedies. In particular, in the case of interests in land not in trust, the principle, codified in many states, is widely recognized that there is judicial authori ty, under specified circumstances, to order a sale of land in which there are future interests. See 1 American Law of Property §§ 4.98-.99 (A. Casner ed. 1952); L. Simes &amp; A. Smith, The Law of Future Interests §§ 1941-1946 (2d ed. 1956); see also Restatement of Property § 179 at pp. 485-95 (1936); L. Simes &amp; C. Taylor, Improvement of Conveyancing by Legislation 235-38 (1960). Nothing in Section 3 of this Act should be taken as precluding this type of remedy, if appropriate, before the exp iration of the 90-year permissible vesting period. Duration of the Indestructibility of Trusts  Termination of Trusts by Beneficiaries. As noted in Part G of the Comment to Section 1, it is generally accepted that a trust cannot remain indestructible beyond the period of the rule against perpetuities. Under this Act, the period of the rule against perpetuities applicable to a trust whose validity is governed by the wait-and-see element of Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2) is 90 years. The result of any reformation under Section 3 is that all nonvested proper ty interests in the trust will vest in interest (or terminate) no later than the 90th anniversary of their creation. In the case of trusts containing a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment whose validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2), 1 (b)(2), or 1(c)(2), courts can therefore be expected to adopt the rule that no purpose of the settlor, expressed in or implied from the governing instrument, can prevent the beneficiaries of a trust other than a charitable trust from compelling its termi nation after 90 years after every nonvested property interest and power of appointment in the trust was created. Subsection (1): Invalid Property Interest or Power of Appointment. Subsection (1) is illustrated by the following examples. Example (1)  Multiple Generation Trust. G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income to A for life, then to As children for the life of the survivor, then to As grandchildren for the life of the survivor, and on the death of As last surviving grandchild, the corpus of the trust is to be divided among As then living descendants per stirpes; if none, to a specified charity. G was survived by his child (A) and by As two minor children (X and Y). After Gs death, another child (Z) was born to A. Subsequently, A died, survived by his children (X, Y, and Z) and by three grandchildren (M, N, and O). There are four interests subject to the Statutory Rule in this example: (1) the income interest in favor of As children, (2) the income interest in favor of A s grandchildren, (3) the remainder interest in the corpus in favor of As descendants who survive the death of As last surviving grandchild, and (4) the alternative remainder interest in the corpus in favor of the specified charity. The first interest is initially valid under Section 1(a)(1); A is the validating life for that interest. There is no validating life for the other three interests, and so their validity is governed by Section 1(a)(2). If, as is likely, A and As children all die before the 90th anniversary of Gs death, the income interest in favor of As grandchildren is valid under S ection 1(a)(2). If, as is also likely, some of As grandchildren are alive on the 90th anniversary of Gs death, the alternative remainder interests in the corpus of the tr ust then become invalid under Section 1(a)(2), giving rise to Section 3(1)s prerequisite to reformation. A court would be justified in reforming Gs disposition by closing the class in favor of As descendants as of the 90th anniversary of G s death (precluding new entrants thereafter), by moving back the condition of survivorship on the class so that the remainder interest is in favor of Gs descendants who survive the 90th anniversary of Gs death (rather than in favor of those w ho survive the death of As last surviving grandchild), and by redefining the class so that its makeup is formed as if As last surviving grandchild died on the 90th anniversary of Gs death. Example (2)  Sub-Class Case. G devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income to A for life, then in equal shares to As children for their respective lives; on the death of each child the proportionate share of corpus of the one so dy ing shall go to the descendants of such child surviving at such childs death, per stirpes. G was survived by A and by As two children (X and Y). After Gs death, another child (Z) was born to A. Subsequently, A died, survived by X, Y, and Z. Under the sub-class doctrine, each remainder interest in favor of the descendants of a child of A is treated separately from the others. Consequently, the remaind er interest in favor of Xs descendants and the remainder interest in favor of Ys descendants are valid under Section 1(a)(1): X is the validating life for the one, and Y is the validating life for the other. The remainder interest in favor of the descendants of Z is not validated by Section 1(a)(1) because Z, who was not alive when the interest was created, could have descendants more than 21 years after the death of the survivor of A, X, and Y. Instead, the validity of the remainder interest in favor of Zs descendants is governed by Section 1(a)(2), under which its validity depends on Zs dying within 90 year s after Gs death. Although unlikely, suppose that Z is still living 90 years after Gs death. The remainder interest in favor of Zs descendants will then become invalid unde r the Statutory Rule, giving rise to subsection (1)s prerequisite to reformation. In such circumstances, a court would be justified in reforming the remainder interest in favor of Zs descendants by making it indefeasibly vested as of the 90th ann iversary of Gs death. To do this, the court would reform the disposition by eliminating the condition of survivorship of Z and closing the class to new entrants aft...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_55.1-127"><akn:num>§ 55.1-127</akn:num><akn:heading>Exclusions from statutory rule against perpetuities</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Acts 2013, c. 323, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act are declarative of existing law. Effective date. This section is effective October 1, 2019. Law Review. For annual survey article, see Wills, Trusts, and Estates, 48 U. Rich. L. Rev. 189 (2013). OFFICIAL COMMENT Section 4 lists seven exclusions from the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (Statutory Rule). Some are declaratory of existing law; others are contrary to exist ing law. Since the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is superseded by this Act (or a statutory version or variation thereof is repealed by this Act), a nonvested property interest, power of appointment, or other arrangement excluded from the Statutory Rule by this section is not subject to any rule against perpetuities, statutory or otherwise. A. SUBSECTION (1): NONDONATIVE TRANSFERS EXCLUDED Rationale. In line with long-standing scholarly commentary , subsection (1) excludes (with certain enumerated exceptions) nonvested property interests and powers of appointment arising out of a nondonative transfer. The rationale for this exclusion is that the Rule Against Perpetuities is a wholly inappropriate instrument of social policy to use as a control over such arrangements. The period of the rule  a life in being plus 21 years  is not suitable for nondonative transfers, and this point applies with equal force to the 90-year allowable waiting per iod under the wait-and-see element of Section 1 because that period represents an approximation of the period of time that would be produced, on average, by using a statutory list identifying actual measuring lives and adding a 21-year period following t he death of the survivor. No general exclusion from the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities is recognized for nondonative transfers, and so subsection (1) is contrary to existing common l aw. (But see Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. Bruken Realty Corp., 67 N.Y.2d 156, 492 N.E.2d 379, 384 (1986), pointing out the inappropriateness of the period of a life in being plus 21 years to cases of commercial and governmental transactions and noting that the Rule Against Perpetuities can invalidate legitimate transactions in such cases.) Subsection (1) is therefore inconsistent with decisions holding the Common-law Rule to be applicable to the following types of property interests or arrangements when created in a nondonative, commercial-type transaction, as they almost always are: options (e.g., Milner v. Bivens, 335 S.E.2d 288 (Ga. 1985)); preemptive rights in the nature of a right of first refusal (e.g., Atchison v. City of Englewood, 170 Colo. 295, 463 P.2d 297 (1969); Robroy Land Co., Inc. v. Prather, 24 Wash. App. 511, 601 P.2d 297 (1969)); leases to commence in the future, at a time certain or on the happening of a future event such as the completion of a building (e.g., Southern Airways Co. v. DeKalb County, 101 Ga. App. 689, 115 S.E.2d 207 (1960)); nonvested easements; top leases and top deeds with respect to interests in minerals (e .g., Peveto v. Starkey, 645 S.W.2d 770 (Tex. 1982)); and so on. Consideration Does Not Necessarily Make the Transfer Nondonative. A transfer can be supported by consideration and still be donative in character and hence not excluded from the Statutory Rule. A transaction that is essentially gratuitous in nature, accompanied by donative intent on the part of at least one party to the transaction, is not to be regarded as nondonative simply because it is for consideration. Thus, for example, the exclusion would not apply if a parent purchases a parcel of land for full and adequa te consideration, and directs the seller to make out the deed in favor of the purchasers daughter for life, remainder to such of the daughters children as reach 25. The nonvested property interest of the daughters children is subject to the S tatutory Rule. Some Transactions Not Excluded Even if Considered Nondonative. Some types of transactions  although in some sense supported by consideration and hence arguably nondonative  arise out of a domestic situation, and should not be excluded from the Statutory Rul e. To avoid uncertainty with respect to such transactions, subsection (1) specifies that nonvested property interests or powers of appointment arising out of any of the following transactions are not excluded by subsection (1)s nondonative-transfers exclusion: a premarital or postmarital agreement; a separation or divorce settlement; a spouses election, such as the widows election in community property states; an arrangement similar to any of the foregoing arising out of a prospectiv e, existing, or previous marital relationship between the parties; a contract to make or not to revoke a will or trust; a contract to exercise or not to exercise a power of appointment; a transfer in full or partial satisfaction of a duty of support; or a reciprocal transfer. The term reciprocal transfer is to be interpreted in accordance with the reciprocal transfer doctrine in the tax law (see United States v. Estate of Grace, 395 U.S. 316 (1969)). Other Means of Controlling Some Nondonative Transfers Desirable. Some commercial transactions respecting land or mineral interests, such as options in gross (including rights of first refusal), leases to commence in the future, nonvested easements, and top leases and top deeds in commercial use in the oil and gas industry, directly or indirectly restrain the alienability of property or provide a disincentive to improve the property. Although controlling the duration of such interests is desirable, they are exclud ed by subsection (1) from the Statutory Rule because, as noted above, the period of a life in being plus 21 years  actual or by the 90-year proxy  is inappropriate for them; that period is appropriate for family-oriented, donative transfers. The Committee was aware that a few states have adopted statutes on perpetuities that include special limits on certain commercial transactions (e.g., Fla. Stat. § 689.22(3)(a); Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 30, § 194(a)), and in fact the Committee itself drafted a comprehensive version of Section 4 that would have imposed a 40-year period-in-gross limitation in specified cases. In the end, however, the Committee did not present that version to the National Conference for approval because it was of the opinion that the control of these interests is better left to other types of statutes, such as marketable title acts (e.g., the Uniform Simplification of Land Transfe rs Act) and the Uniform Dormant Mineral Interests Act, backed up by the potential application of the common-law rules regarding unreasonable restraints on alienation. B. SUBSECTIONS (2)-(7): OTHER EXCLUSIONS Subsection (2)  Administrative Fiduciary Powers. Fiduciary powe rs are subject to the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, unless specifically excluded. Purely administrative fiduciary powers are excluded by subsections (2) and (3), but distributive fiduciary powers are generally speaking not excluded.

This section provides that, except as provided in subsection (b), the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities and the other provisions of this Act apply only to nonvested property interests or powers of appointment created on or after the Acts effective date. With one exception, in determining when a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment is created, the principles of Section 2 are applicable. Thus, for example, a property interest (or a power of appointment) created in a revocable inter vivos trust is created when the power to revoke terminates. See Example (1) in the Comment to Section 2. The second sentence of subsection (a) establishes a special rule for nonvested property interests (and powers of appointment) created by the exercise of a power o f appointment. For purposes of this section only, a nonvested property interest (or a power of appointment) created by the exercise of a power of appointment is created when the power is irrevocably exercised or when a revocable exercise of the power bec omes irrevocable. Consequently, all the provisions of this Act except Section 5(b) apply to a nonvested property interest (or power of appointment) created by a donees exercise of a power of appointment where the donees exercise, whether revocabl e or irrevocable, occurs on or after the effective date of this Act. All the provisions of this Act except Section 5(b) also apply where the donees exercise occurred before the effective date of this Act if: (i) that pre-effective-date exercise was r evocable and (ii) that revocable exercise becomes irrevocable on or after the effective date of this Act . This special rule applies to the exercise of all types of powers of appointment  presently exercisable general powers, general testamentary powers, and nongeneral powers. If the application of this special rule determines that the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) apply, then for all such purposes, the time of creation o f the appointed nonvested property interest (or appointed power of appointment) is determined by reference to Section 2, without regard to the special rule contained in the second sentence of Section 5(a). If the application of this special rule of Section 5(a) determines that the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) do not apply, then Section 5(b) is the on ly potentially applicable provision of this Act. Example (1)  Testamentary Power Created Before but Exercised After the Effective Dat e of this Act. G was the donee of a general testamentary power of appointment created by the will of his mother, M. M died in 1980. Assume that the effective date of this Act in the jurisdiction is January 1, 1987. G died in 1988, leaving a will that exercised his general testamentary power of appointment. Under the special rule in the second sentence of Section 5(a), any nonvested property interest (or power of appointment) created by G in his will in exercising hi s general testamentary power was created (for purposes of Section 5) at Gs death in 1988, which was after the effective date of this Act. Consequently, all the provisions of this Act apply (except Section 5(b)). That point having been settled, the next step is to determine whether the nonvested prop erty interests or powers of appointment created by Gs testamentary appointment are initially valid under Section 1(a)(1), 1(b)(1), or 1(c)(1), or whether the wait-and-see element established in Section 1(a)(2), 1(b)(2), or 1(c)(2) apply. If the wait- and-see element does apply, it must also be determined when the allowable 90-year waiting period starts to run. In making these determinations, the principles of Section 2 control the time of creation of the nonvested property interests (or powers of app ointment); under Section 2, since Gs power was a general testamentary power of appointment, the common-law relation-back doctrine applies and the appointed nonvested property interests (and appointed powers of appointment) are created at Ms death in 1980. If Gs testamentary power of appointment had been a nongeneral power rather than a general power, the same results as described above would apply. Example (2)  Presently Exercisable Nongeneral Power Created Before but Exercised Aft er the Effective Date of this Act. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that Gs power of appointment was a presently exercisable nongeneral power. If G exercised t he power in 1988, after the effective date of this Act (or, if a pre-effective-date revocable exercise of his power became irrevocable in 1988, after the effective date of this Act), the same results as described above in Example (1) would apply. Example (3)  Presently Exercisable General Power Created Before but Exercised After the Effective Date of this Act. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that Gs power of appointment was a presently exercisable general power. If G exercised the pow er in 1988, after the effective date of this Act (or, if a pre-effective-date revocable exercise of his power became irrevocable in 1988, after the effective date of this Act), all the provisions of this Act (except Section 5(b)) apply; for such purposes , Section 2 controls the date of creation of the appointed nonvested property interests (or appointed powers of appointment), without regard to the special rule of the second sentence of Section 5(a). With respect to the exercise of a presently exercisab le general power, it is possible  indeed, probable  that the special rule of the second sentence of Section 5(a) and the rules of Section 2 agree on the same date of creation for their respective purposes, that date being the date the power was i rrevocably exercised (or a revocable exercise thereof became irrevocable). Subsection (b): Reformation of Pre-existing Instruments. Although the Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities and the other provisions of this Act do not apply retroactively, subsection (b) recognizes a courts authority to exercise its equitable power to reform inst ruments that contain a violation of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities (or of a statutory version or variation thereof) and to which the Statutory Rule does not apply because the offending nonvested property interest or power of appointment in ques tion was created before the effective date of this Act. This equitable power to reform is recognized only where the violation of the former rule against perpetuities is determined in a judicial proceeding that is commenced on or after the effective date of this Act. See below. Without legislative authorization or direction, the courts in four states  Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and West Virginia  have held that they have the power to reform instruments that contain a violation of the Common-law Rule Against Perpetuities. In re Estate of Chun Quan Yee Hop, 52 Hawaii 40, 469 P.2d 183 (1970); Carter v. Berry, 243 Miss. 321, 14 0 So.2d 843 (1962); Edgerly v. Barker, 66 N.H. 434, 31 A. 900 (1891); Berry v. Union Natl. Bank, 262 S.E.2d 766 (W.Va. 1980). In four other states  California, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas  the l egislatures have enacted statutes conferring this power on the courts or directing the courts to reform defective instruments. Cal. Civ. Code § 715.5 (West 1982); Mo. Rev. Stat. § 442.555 (1978); Okla. Stat. tit. 60, §§ 75-78 (1981); Tex. Pro perty Code § 5.043 (Vernon 1984). See also Idaho Code § 55-111 (1948). The California statute is silent as to whether or not it applies to nonvested property interests and powers of appointment created prior to the effective date of the Act; the on ly significant California appellate decision to apply the statute, Estate of Ghiglia, 42 Cal.App.3d 433, 116 Cal. Rptr. 827 (1974), involved a will where the testator died after the Acts effective date. The Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas statutes explicitly do not apply retroactively. The Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and West Virginia decisions, h owever, invoked the courts equitable power (sometimes called the cy pres power, and sometimes called the doctrine of equitable approximation or equitable modification) to reform pre-existing instruments that contained a violation of the Common-law Ru le. Subsection (b) constitutes statutory authority for a court to exercise its equitable reformation power. Reformation Experience So Far. The existing judicial opinions and legislative provisions purport to adopt a principle of reformation that is consistent with the theme that the technique of reform should be shaped to grant every appropriate opportunity for the prop erty to go to the intended beneficiaries. The New Hampshire court, for example, said that where there is a general and a particular intent, and the particular one cannot take effect, the words shall be so construed as to give effect to the general in tent. Edgerly v. Barker, 66 N.H. 434, 467, 31 A. 900, 912 (1891) (citation omitted). The Hawaii court held that any interest which would violate the Rule Against Perpetuities shall be reformed within the limits of that rule to approximate most closely the intention of the creator of the interest. In re Estate of Chun Quan Yee Hop, 52 Hawaii 40, 46, 469 P.2d 183, 187 (1970). The Mississippi court described the reformation principle as a sim ple rule of judicial construction, designed to aid the court to ascertain and carry out, as nearly as may be, the intention of the donor...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_55.1-129"><akn:num>§ 55.1-129</akn:num><akn:heading>Uniformity of application and construction</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Sections 55.1-124 through 55.1-129 shall be applied and construed to effectuate their general purpose to make the law uniform with respect to the rule against perpetuit ies among states enacting it.

Purpose of section.  The purpose of this section is to effectuate the intention of the testator by rendering valid a limitation which would have been otherwise invalid as violative of the rule against perpetuities. Since January 1, 1820, words which had previously been construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue are now construed to mean a definite failure of issue, and the limitations founded thereon are no longer void for remo teness. Daniel v. Lipscomb, 110 Va. 563, 66 S.E. 850, 1910 Va. LEXIS 95 (1910) (see Elys v. Wynne, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 224 (1872); Wine v. Markwood, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 43 (1878); Corr v. Porter, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 278 (1880); Thomas v. Thomas, 224 Va. 4, 294 S.E.2d 795 (1982)). This section focuses upon contingent limitations to estates. Mullins v. Simmons, 235 Va. 194, 365 S.E.2d 771, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2141, 1988 Va. LEXIS 33 (1988). Rule incorpo rated in section.  A devise to a person with limitation over to another, in the event of the first takers death without issue, is a limitation which takes effect when the first devisee dies without heir or issue, and vests in the first devisee a defeasible fee. This rule is incorporated in this section. Rinker v. Trout, 171 Va. 327, 198 S.E. 913, 1938 Va. LEXIS 283 (1938). It is manifest from reading this section that it was the legislative intent that every limitation in a deed or will contingent upon the dying of any person withou t heirs, etc., should be construed to be a limitation to take effect when such person shall die not having such heirs, etc. People's Nat'l Bank v. Crickenberger, 159 Va. 264, 165 S.E. 412, 1932 Va. LEXIS 190 (1932). Section based on proposition that invalid limitation not intended.  The statutory rule is based upon the proposition that a testator does not intend to create an invalid limitation, but intends instead to make the limitation effec tive at a time not violative of the rule against perpetuities. Hence, where a will contains a bare provision that a limitation shall take effect upon the death of a person without issue, this section saves the limitation from a claim of remoteness by arb itrarily fixing the date of the persons death as the time for determining whether he dies without issue. Thomas v. Thomas, 224 Va. 4, 294 S.E.2d 795, 1982 Va. LEXIS 265 (1982). But plainly intended limitation given effect even if invalidation results.  Under this section, if a will declares plainly an intention that the limitation shall be effective at some later time, the intention will be given effect even tho ugh the declared time is impermissibly remote and results in the invalidation of the limitation. Thomas v. Thomas, 224 Va. 4, 294 S.E.2d 795, 1982 Va. LEXIS 265 (1982). Purpose served where will fixes time earlier than that fixed by section.  If a will displays the testators intention that a die-without-issue limitation shall take effect earlier than the time fixed in this section, thus avoiding a possible claim of remoteness, the statutory purpose is served and the intent should be given effect. In these circumstances, an express declaration of intent on the face of the will is not necessary; it suffices if the intention to fix an earlier vesting date can be discerned from the application of conventional rules of construction. A contrary holding would permit use of this section to thwart, rather than effectuate, a testators intention. Thomas v. Thomas, 224 Va. 4, 294 S.E.2d 795, 1982 Va. LEX IS 265 (1982). Section does not preempt consideration of all other rules of will construction. Rather, it is designed to complement other rules in the ascertainment of the true intention of the testator. Thomas v. Thomas, 224 Va. 4, 294 S.E.2d 795, 1982 Va. LEXIS 265 (1982). Under the provisions of this section it is immaterial whether the testator meant heirs, or issue, or children; the language employed refers, in any event, to the death of the person not having such heir, issue, or child. The statute is devoid of ambiguity. People's Nat'l Bank v. Crickenberger, 159 Va. 264, 165 S.E. 412, 1932 Va. LEXIS 190 ( 1932). This section does not contemplate a limitation wherein an express and unlimited power to the grantee to dispose of the estate during his lifetime is created. The fact that the grantee is limited in the means of making disposition to a conveyance by deed and not given the power to dispose of it by will does not change the rule. Hall v. Hoa k, 184 Va. 821, 36 S.E.2d 567, 1946 Va. LEXIS 145 (1946) (see § 55-7). The statute does not effect a limitation expressly created upon an indefinite failure of descendants, as was true in Claiborne v. Wilson, 168 Va. 469, 192 S.E. 585 (1937). Illustrations.  In 1833 W. made his will, and died. By clause 6 he gives to his daughter, D., a designated tract of land, to her and the heirs of her body; but should D. die without heir, as above mentioned, my wish is that said land shall return to my other heirs, and be sold, and the moneys arising from the sale to be equally divided among all my heirs. It was held that D. took a fee simple estate in the land defeasibl e upon her dying without a child living at her death. Elys v. Wynne, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 224, 1872 Va. LEXIS 15 (1872). Testatrix devised real property in fee simple to one N.E.P., if living, or to her issue, and if the said N.E.P. shall die without issue then the property shall pa ss to W.H.P., if living at the death of the said N.E.P. Bearing in mind the language of this section, and the holdings of the Supreme Court the limitation to W.H.P. was contingent upon N.E.P. dying without issue, and the language of the will had referenc e to the death of N.E.P. and not to the death of the testatrix.

Reasonable time for development of subdivision lots is less than 21 years.  Settled contract law implies a reasonable time limitation for performance of conditions in contracts for the sale of land where no time for performance is fixed b y the contract itself. This reasoning is applicable in the context of a contract for sale of residential lots to be developed as a subdivision. Where the sellers agreed to develop any lots for which the purchaser exercised the option, the sellers were ob ligated to perform this duty within a reasonable time or be subject to remedies the purchaser might pursue for the sellers breach of the express terms of the contract. A reasonable time for completion of development would be far less than 21 years. R yland Group, Inc. v. Wills, 229 Va. 459, 331 S.E.2d 399, 1985 Va. LEXIS 223 (1985).

LEXIS 87 73 (E.D. Va. 1992). Upon exercise of an option to purchase subdivision lots, the purchaser would acquire an equitable interest in the lots it committed itself to purchase, with the right to compel conveyance of legal title and the agreement would become an executory contract for the sale of land with mutuality of obligation and remedy. Such a contract creates an interest in land enforceable in equity and is therefore subject to the rule against perpetuities. Ryland Group, Inc. v. Wills, 229 Va. 459, 331 S.E.2d 399, 1985 Va.

Validity of right of first refusal.  Pursuant to § 8.01-184, the trial court declared that a right of first refusal in the articles of incorporation of a company was void ab initio, as this limita tion on the transfer of stock was an unreasonable restraint, and also violated the rule against perpetuities.

History and effect of statute.  In Virginia, as between joint tenants, survivorship was abolished as early as July 1st, 1787, but this act was held to have no application to tenants by entiretie s. See Thornton v. Thornton, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 179, 1825 Va. LEXIS 15 (1825); M'Clanachan v. Siter, Price &amp; Co., 42 Va. 280 (1845); Norman's Ex'x v. Cunningham, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 63, 1848 Va. LEXIS 26 (1848); Dooley v. Baynes, 86 Va. 644, 10 S.E. 974, 189 0 Va. LEXIS 25 (1890). It was also held that the statute abolishing survivorship between joint tenants had no application where the estate in joint tenancy had not vested, and, hence, w hen one joint tenant predeceased the testator the whole estate passed to the survivor. Lockhart v. Vandyke, 97 Va. 356, 33 S.E. 613 (1899). This doctrine was changed in 1919 by the enactment of the present statute. Gardner v. Gardner, 152 Va. 677, 148 S. E. 781, 1929 Va. LEXIS 200 (1929). The effect of this section and § 55-21 is to abolish tenancies by the entirety and jo int tenancies unless it is manifest from the wording of the conveyance that the grantor intends to establish a tenancy by the entirety. Wolfe v. Sprouse, 183 Bankr. 739, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9357 (W.D. Va. 1995). This section and § 55-21 fall in line with the development that the ancient common-la w rule favoring joint tenancies has been reversed, and the presumptions are now almost wholly in favor of tenancies in common by requiring that the desire to create a survivorship interest be manifestly apparent from the tenor of the instrument in order to establish a joint tenancy or a tenancy by the entirety. Wolfe v. Sprouse, 183 Bankr. 739, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9357 (W.D. Va. 1995). This section abolishes survivorship as between joint tenants. Wilkinson v. Witherspoon, 2 06 Va. 297, 142 S.E.2d 478, 1965 Va. LEXIS 198 (1965). The doctrine of survivorship between joint tenants has been abolished by this section, and the legislature intended to place joint tenants, insofar as dower and c urtesy are concerned, in the same situation as tenants in common. Turner v. Turner, 185 Va. 505, 39 S.E.2d 299, 1946 Va. LEXIS 223 (1946); Roane v. Roane, 193 Va. 18, 67 S.E.2d 906, 1951 Va. LEXIS 236 (1951). Surviv orship not created.  A deed conveying land to grantees as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common does not create an estate with survivorship. Hoover v. Smith, 248 Va. 6, 444 S.E.2d 546, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1430, 1994 Va. LEXIS 106 (1994). Subject to certain statutory exceptions in the section following. Rady v. Staiars, 160 Va . 373, 168 S.E. 452, 1933 Va. LEXIS 218 (1933); Roane v. Roane, 193 Va. 18, 67 S.E.2d 906, 1951 Va. LEXIS 236 (1951). This section is not applicable where it is manifest from the tenor of the instrument that it is intended that the part of the one dying should belong to the survi vors. Leonard v. Boswell, 197 Va. 713, 90 S.E.2d 872, 1956 Va. LEXIS 143 (1956). Survivorship can be conferred only by the instrument conveying property.  Since the enactment of §§ 55-20 and 55-21, survivorship can be conferred only by the instrument conveying the property. Funches v. Funches, 243 Va. 26, 413 S.E.2d 44, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1707, 1992 Va. LEXIS 148 (1992). Estates by entireties are abolished except where the deed or will manifests an intent th at they shall continue. Allen v. Parkey, 154 Va. 739, 149 S.E. 615, 1929 Va. LEXIS 234 (1929). In Virginia, when real property is conveyed to a husband and wife, the deed must specify that a tenancy by the entirety is intended or a tenancy in common results . In re Manicure, 29 Bankr. 248, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 7098 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1983). And converted into tenancies in common.  The effect of this section when an estate is conveyed to a husband and wife, is to convert a tenancy by entirety into a tenancy in common and of course to destroy survivorship, but § 55-21 provides that this section shall not apply when it was manifest from the instrument creating the estate that it was intended that the part of the one dying should then belong to the other. Allen v. Parkey, 154 Va. 739, 149 S .E. 615, 1929 Va. LEXIS 234 (1929). The deed in question did in fact create a tenancy by the entireties, notwithstanding the lack of language using those specific words, since the intent was conveye d by the language with the full common law right of survivorship. In re Zella, 196 Bankr. 752, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 657 (Bankr. E.D. Va.), aff'd, 202 Bankr. 712, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16968 (E.D. Va. 1996). A conveyance to husband and wife creates only a tenancy in common, unless it manifestly appears from the tenor of the instrument that it was intended on the part of the one dying that the property in question should then belong to the other. In re Zella, 196 Bankr. 752, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 657 (Bankr. E.D. Va.), aff'd, 202 Bankr. 712, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16968 (E.D. Va. 1996). In Virginia, estates by the entireties are abolished except where the deed or will manifests an intent of survivorship. In re Scialdone, 197 Bankr. 225, 1995 Bank r. LEXIS 1976 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995). Manifest means obvious to the understanding, evident to the mind, not obscure or hidden, and is synonymous with open, clear, visible, unmistakable, indubitabl e, indisputable, evident and self-evident. In re Scialdone, 197 Bankr. 225, 1995 Bankr. LEXIS 1976 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995). It will be observed that partition is not compellable by statute between tenants by entirety, but that end is reached through this section, which makes tenants by entirety tenants in common. Allen v. Parkey, 154 Va. 739, 149 S.E. 615, 1929 Va. LEXIS 234 (1929). Survivors interest in personal property unclear.  Although this section had effect of abolishing survivorship between husband and wife with respect to both real and personal property unless an intent to create a survivorship interest was clearly expressed, it does not address the question of whether the resulting survivorship interest is held as joint tenants or as tenants by the entirety. With respect to real property, it is clear that an estate by the entirety is created; but whether the same would be true with respect to personal property is far from clear. In re Massey, 225 Bankr. 887, 1998 Bankr. LEXIS 1338 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1998). The deed which purports to establish a tenancy by the entirety between persons who are not married to each other creates a joint tenancy; the words of survivorship expressly manifest the requisite intent that the joint tenancy is clothed with the common-law right of survivorship, and, this express manifestation of survivorship necessaril y excludes the wifes dower interest. Funches v. Funches, 243 Va. 26, 413 S.E.2d 44, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1707, 1992 Va. LEXIS 148 (1992). The interest of the surviving joint tenant is superior to the dower interest of the wife of the other joint tenant. Funches v. Funches, 243 Va. 26, 413 S.E.2d 44, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1707, 1992 Va. LEXIS 148 (1992). No application to derivatives of property held by entireties.  Neither this section nor § 55-21 was intended to apply to derivatives of property held by the entireties. Moore v. Glotzbach, 188 F. Supp. 267, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641 (E.D. Va. 1960). Right to hold personalty by entireties.  This section and § 55-21, when read together, carry the inference that Virginia recognizes the right to hold personalty as tenants by the entireties. Moore v. Glotzbach, 188 F. Supp. 267, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641 (E.D. Va. 1960). A lease to a tenant does not qualify as a conveyance or devise to a husband and wife as provided by this section, and hence the exception stated in § 55-21 would be inapplicable to the lease and rental flowing therefrom. Moore v. Glotzbach, 188 F. Supp. 267, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641 (E.D. Va. 1960). Reservation by grantor of estate for himself and wife during the period of their natural lives.  Since the enactment of this section, changing the common-law doctrine of tenants by entireties, if a husband by his sole deed conveys land excepting from the gran t an estate for and during the period of the natural lives of himself and wife, each has only a life interest in one moiety of the land.

In arguing that her joint tenancy with her mother was owned unequally and that extrinsic evidence was necessary to determine the portion owned by each joint tenan t, a Chapter 7 debtors reliance on § 58.1-3211.1 was misplaced, as that provision confined its applicability to tax relief and nothing in that provision suggested that it negated § 55-20.1.Scott v.

Garnishment.  Circuit court erred in dismissing the garnishment because there was no disposition of the property as a disposition involved an act of transferring something to a nothers care or possession or the relinquishing of property, and the property in the current case was not transferred to the insurer or to anyone else. Jones v. Phillips, 299 Va. 285, 850 S.E.2d 646, 2020 Va. LEXIS 141 (2020).

Ownership of m otor vehicles.  Section 46.2-622, which is a specific statute prohibiting motor vehicles from being held as tenants by the entirety, limits subsection A of § 55-20.2, which al lows personal property in general to be held as tenants by the entirety. In re Rodriguez, 406 Bankr. 707, 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 2659 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2008). Chapter 7 debtor could not exempt a minivan jointly owned with his non-debtor wife as tenancy by the entireties property because, although § 55-20.2 permitted a husband and wife to own real or personal property as tenants by the entireties, § 46.2-622 precluded holding title to a motor vehicle as tenants by the entirety. In re Cordova, 394 Bankr. 389, 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 2956 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2008). Motor vehicles are not exempt property.  Debtors were not entitled to claim their motor vehicles as exempt tenants by the entirety property under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3)(B) because § 46.2-622 did n ot allow them to be held as tenants by the entirety, and the tenants by the entirety estate in the proceeds from an equity line of credit terminated upon the purchase of the vehicles.

Joint bank account by husband and wife held as tenants by entirety.  Judgment creditor was unable to garnish a judgment debtors bank account, where it was a joint account held with the debtors wife, who was not a debtor to the creditor, as they held the property as tenants by the entirety under § 55-20.2; it was noted that prior to application of § 6.1-125.3 [now see § 6.2-606], the threshold issue of whether the funds were garnishable was to be resolved, which, i n this case was done against the creditor. Sulzman v. Barnick, 62 Va. Cir. 139, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 94 (Spotsylvania County July 8, 2003). Attorneys liens.  In a case in which an attorney, who had represented the ex-husband in his divorce, sought to enforce his attorneys lien against the property in question, whic h had been conveyed to the wife and had been held as tenants by the entirety, the attorney unsuccessfully argued that the property converted to a tenancy in common upon the entry of the final decree of divorce and that the lien attached at that time. Tha t argument failed to take into account that notice of the lien was given when the property was still held in tenancy by the entirety so the lien could not attach by the time the recording of the lien took place, and the property was already solely owned by the ex-wife, never having converted to a tenancy in common, and therefore could not be subject to the satisfaction of the attorneys lien.

Right of legislature to remove disabilities.  It was entirely competent, for the legislature to remove the disability of married women in whole or in part, and to define her powers with reference to property of all kinds, to ascertain the rights of the husband, if any, therein, and the liability of the property to claims against the wife. Hall v. Stewart, 135 Va. 384, 116 S.E. 469, 1923 Va. LEXIS 21 (1923). The effect of this section is to give the wife as full control over her property during the coverture as her husband has over his. She may sue her husband as if he were a stranger. A husband in Virginia may be a trespasser upon his wifes lands whenever she is not occupying them, if he goes there against her will or her commands; she may prosecute him for criminal trespass; she may dispossess him if he is in possession; or may hold him to account in connection with any transaction with reference to her lands as if he were a stranger. His right to curtesy and his marital rights give him no more power or authority over his wifes property than if he were a total stranger. Edmonds v. Edmonds, 139 Va. 652, 124 S.E. 415, 1924 Va. LEXIS 140 (1924) (see Vigilant Ins. Co. v. Bennett, 197 Va. 216, 89 S.E.2d 69 (1955)). This section has wiped aside every vestige of control the husband ever had under the common law, and all his rights as husband except as to curtesy. Edmonds v.

The language nor his marital rights would seem but to emphasize and clarify, to make certain, the first few lines of the act: A married woman shall have the right to acquire, hold, use, control, and dispose of pro perty as if she were unmarried, etc. Commonwealth v. Rutherfoord, 160 Va. 524, 169 S.E. 909, 1933 Va. LEXIS 233 (1933). Section gives substantive right to sue husband for tortious damage to property.  This section gives to the wife full ownership and control of her property, including her choses in action. Her husband is now a stranger to her property and prope rty rights, and she to his. In the ownership and control of their respective properties, their identities are now wholly separate and distinct. Thus the substantive right to sue her husband for tortious damage to her property (as distinguished from a pur ely personal tort) is furnished by this section. Vigilant Ins. Co. v. Bennett, 197 Va. 216, 89 S.E.2d 69, 1955 Va. LEXIS 214 (1955). Section 55-41 does not prohibit married woman from selling her property.  Section 55-41, relating to the effect to be given to certain conveyances made by married women and the covenants therein contained, does not in any way prohibit h er from contracting to sell her statutory separate estate, or inhibit or interfere with a court of equity in the enforcement of such contracts. Dunn v. Stowers, 104 Va. 290, 51 S.E. 366, 1905 Va. LEXIS 98 (1905). This section does not apply to warranty in deed to release dower.  This section was not intended to apply to a warranty in a deed in which the wife united for the purpose only of relinquishing her inchoate right of dower in her h usbands property, nor does it repeal by implication § 55-41, declaring the effect of such a warranty.

Husband who steals from wife subject to criminal law.  The broad provisions of the Married Womans Act, giving the wife absolute control over her tangible personal property, must necessarily bring her within the pr otective shelter of the criminal laws by making any thief, including her husband, who takes and deprives her of possession and use of her property subject to the usual criminal sanctions. Stewart v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 887, 252 S.E.2d 329, 1979 Va. LEX IS 185 (1979). The purpose of the Married Womans Act would be frustrated if a husband could steal with impunity from his wife. Therefore, he may be prosecuted as any other t hief for the larceny of her property. Stewart v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 887, 252 S.E.2d 329, 1979 Va. LEXIS 185 (1979). Although a husband could be convicted of larceny of his wifes separate property under § 55-35, defendant had a good faith belief that he had a claim of rig ht to certain cassette tapes that he took; as a result, the evidence, as found by the trial court, was insufficient to support defendants conviction. Ward v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 211 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 8, 2003). Extent of righ t of husband to use property.  It is difficult to see how a husband under this section can have any right of occupancy of the wifes real estate unless she resides upon it, and he gets the r ight of joint occupancy with her then, not because he has any interest in her land, or control over it, or the right to use it, but because as her husband he has the right to the enjoyment of her society. The husbands rights so far as the wifes p roperty is concerned are determined by this section and his occupancy even as a home or use or control thereof are not only not provided for thereby but they are expressly provided against. Edmonds v. Edmonds, 139 Va. 652, 124 S.E. 415, 1924 Va. LEXIS 14 0 (1924). The husband no longer has exclusive possession or control over any portion of property held as tenants by the entireties. Logic dictates that the same rule should apply to the rents, issues and profits derived from such entirety property. Moore v. Glotzbach, 188 F. Supp. 267, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641 (E.D. Va. 1960). Notwithstanding this section, the presumption prevails that the husband is the owner of all property, real and personal, of which the wife may be in possession during coverture, especially if they are living together as husband and wife; and to overcome this presumption, in a contest between the husbands creditors and the wife, she must show affirmatively that the property is her own, and that it was derived from a source other than her husband and in good faith, if he be insolvent. Otherwise, a wide door would be opened to fraud. First Nat'l Bank v. House, 145 Va. 149, 133 S.E. 664, 1 926 Va. LEXIS 381 (1926) (see Childress v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., 194 Va. 191, 72 S.E.2d 349 (1952)). This section does not change the presumption that the husband is the owner of all property of which the wife may be in possession during coverture, but the source s from which a wife may accumulate a separate estate are enlarged by it. Thus, while at common law the husband was absolutely entitled to the wifes earnings unless she was a sole trader, under this section the wife may accumulate a separate estate th rough her earnings. Harris v. Carver, 139 Va. 676, 124 S.E. 206, 1924 Va. LEXIS 142 (1924). In a suit by creditors of an insolvent husband against the wife, the presumption is that every conveyance or transfer of real or personal estate made to the wife, during the coverture, either by her husband or a third person, is founded upon a consideration furnished by the husband, and the burden is upon the wife to show by clear and satisfactory evidence that the consideration was in good faith paid by her out of her own estate, and not by her husband. This presumption is based upon the relationship of the parties and exists notwithstanding the emancipation of married women as to their property rights. Johnson v. Ables, 119 Va. 593, 89 S.E. 908, 1916 Va. LEXIS 134 (1916) (see Childress v. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co., 194 Va. 191, 72 S.E.2d 349 (1952)). B.Curtesy.

Purpose.  The ultimate purpose running through the Married Womans Act is to place the wife on an equality with her husband. Carey v. Foster, 221 F. Supp. 185, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6685 (E.D. Va. 1963), aff'd, 345 F.2d 772, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 5571 (4th Cir. 1965). Common law.  At common law, no right of consortium was ever vested in the wife. Carey v. Foster, 221 F.

Agreements for separation.  Where husband and wife who have already separated enter a contract adjusting property rights and providing a maintenance for the wife, it is not essential to the validity of the contract that the provision for the wife be made through the intervention of a trustee. Moreland v. Moreland, 108 Va. 93, 60 S.E. 730, 1908 Va. LEXIS 14 (1908). A paper writing under seal executed by husband and wife, which granted to the survivor the right to all real estate and personal property, was a contract under seal, which, under this section the husband and wife might make as if she were unmarried.

This section is in derogation of the common law and is to be strictly construed and read as if the common law remained unchanged unless the purpose to change it appears expressly or by necessary implication. Furey v. Furey, 193 Va. 727, 71 S.E.2d 191, 1952 Va. LEXIS 184 (1952). Husband may not recover for loss of services or consortium. This section has abolished c auses of action brought by a husband in personal injury cases for his wifes medical expenses or the loss of his wifes services or consortium. Bolen v. Bolen, 409 F. Supp. 1374, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17131 (W.D. Va. 1976). Maryland law allowing for loss of consortium claims does not contravene Virginia public policy because both Maryland and Virginia were similarly interested in pre serving equality between spouses when creating their respective laws regarding claims for loss of consortium, and because of these similar ideals, Maryland law is not in contravention of Virginia public policy. Kelley v. United States, 580 F. Supp. 2d 49 0, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84298 (E.D. Va. 2008). A married woman may sue and be sued as if she were unmarried. Moreland v. Moreland, 108 V a. 93, 60 S.E. 730, 1908 Va. LEXIS 14 (1908) (see Young v. Hart, 101 Va. 480, 44 S.E. 703 (1903)). It is no longer necessary for an adult married woman to sue by next friend. Lynchburg Cot ton Mill v. Rives, 112 Va. 137, 70 S.E. 542, 1911 Va. LEXIS 63 (1911). Construction of word u nmarried.  The word unmarried originally and ordinarily means, it is true, never having been married, but the term is a word of flexible meaning and slight circumsta nces will be sufficient to give the word its other meaning of not having a husband or wife at the time in question, and as the term is used in this section it has the meaning of not having a husband at the time of the suit or action. Keister's Ad m'r v. Keister's Ex'rs, 123 Va. 157, 96 S.E. 315, 1918 Va. LEXIS 13 (1918). Right to maintain action for personal injuries is vested exclusively in wife.  Under this section the right to maintain an action for personal injuries inflicted upon a married woman is vested exclusively in the wife and that right includes the right to recover the entire damages sustained, both to herself and those sustained by the husband and formerly recoverable only by him. Alsop v. Eastern Air Lines, 171 F. Supp. 180, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3564 (D. Va. 1959). She may recover entire damages sustained by personal injury to her.  The addition to this section in 1919 of the provision giving married women the right to recover the entire damage sustained, in the event of a personal injury, di d not affect the rule laid down in Edmonds v. Edmonds, 139 Va. 652, 124 S.E. 415 (1924), but was intended to change the law as announced in Richmond Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v. Bowles, 92 Va. 738, 24 S.E. 388 (1896). Including medical bills.  Under this section, a married woman may now recover for a personal injury inflicted on her the entire damage sustained. This would, of course, embrace med ical bills incurred by her, necessary to effect a cure and for which she is liable. United Dentists, Inc. v. Bryan, 158 Va. 880, 164 S.E. 554, 1932 Va. LEXIS 303 (1932). The right of the husband to recover for loss of domestic services of his wife from one who had tortiously injured her was taken from him and given to the wife by § 5134 of the Code of 1919, but this did not deprive him of the right to recover for medical expenses made necessary by the injury and paid by him. Nor was its language broad enough to take from him and vest in the wife his right to recover for loss o f her consortium as distinguished from the loss of her domestic services. However, the amendment of 1932 (Acts 1932, c. 25, p. 21) broadened and enlarged the scope of this section so that it expressly gave to the wife the right to recover every item of d amage incident to her injury, and provided that no action for any element of damage incident to such injury could be maintained by the husband. This prevented the husband from recovering for such medical expenses. Floyd v. Miller, 190 Va. 303, 57 S.E.2d 114, 1950 Va. LEXIS 128 (1950). But recovery is chargeable with husbands claim for reimbursement of expenses.  Under this section, the wifes recovery is chargeable with the husbands claim for reimbursement of expenses, the evident intention of the 1950 amendment be ing to constitute the wife the trustee for the benefit of the husband to that extent. Carey v. Foster, 345 F.2d 772, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 5571 (4th Cir. 1965). Husband may not recover for loss of services or consortium.  In a joint action brought by husband and wife against a third party for the recovery of damages alleged to have been tortiously inflicted upon the wife, the husba nd may not recover for the loss of services or consortium of the wife. Alsop v. Eastern Air Lines, 171 F. Supp. 180, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3564 (D. Va. 1959). This section did not intend to change the common law, other than to deprive the husband of his right of action for loss of consortium. Carey v. Foster, 221 F. Sup p. 185, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6685 (E.D. Va. 1963), aff'd, 345 F.2d 772, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 5571 (4th Cir. 1965). Under this section the husband is prohibited from bringing an action for loss of consortium. Carey v.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Necessaries doctrine unconstitutional.  Predecessors of this section, which is part of the Married Womans Act (Acts 1876-77, c. 329), did not affect the common-law necessaries doctrine, creating an obligation directly between a husband and a third party who provided services to his wife, but the necessaries doctrine is unconstitutional as a gender-based classification not substantially related to governmental interests. Schilling v. Bedford County Mem. Hosp., 225 Va. 539, 303 S.E.2d 905, 1983 Va. LEXIS 253 (1983). By this section the husbands liability for the wifes torts has been completely abolished, and no action by him against her need be also against himself. Vigilant Ins. Co. v. Bennett, 197 Va. 216, 89 S.E.2d 69, 1955 Va. LEXIS 214 (1955). Attachment of lien on principal residence held as tenants by the entirety.  Where a creditor filed two claims for medical care provided to Chapter 13 debtor wife, who had cancer surgery performed on her, and objected to confirmation of de btors plan because it failed to pay creditor as much as it would have received in a Chapter 7 liquidation, the objection was overruled on the basis that the trustee could not have § 55-37 administered for creditors benefit on debtors marit al residence, held by them as tenants by the entireties, had debtors filed for relief under Chapter 7 because § 55-37 expressly exempted the marital residence from process to enforce the debt.

Statute inapplicable.  Statute did not bar childrens lawsuit against their deceased fathers second wife because it was not one seeking to impose personal liability against the s econd wife for her late husbands contractual obligations; the children sought recovery to the extent that the second wife was unjustly enriched as a result of any amounts distributed to her through an insurance policy, and thus, the cause of action s tood separate from the initial breach of contract.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. In Virginia there is no statute fixing an invariable form for deeds of conveyance of lan d. The form given in this section uses the word grant, but that is not an indispensable requisite. To constitute a grant it is not indispensable that technical words be used. Albert v. Holt, 137 Va. 5, 119 S.E. 120, 1923 Va. LEXIS 134 (1923). Use of technical words or strict compliance with the form in this section is not necessary to effect a transfer, if the language used plainly shows on the face of the document a clear intent to convey title. Lim v. Soo Myung Choi, 256 Va. 167, 501 S.E.2d 141, 1998 Va. LEXIS 81 (1998). Valid deed not found.  Where a memorandum was void of any language indicating an intent to transfer property, but rather was replete with contemporaneous statements regarding joint tena nts belief in propertys current status, the memorandum did not constitute a valid deed. Lim v. Soo Myung Choi, 256 Va. 167, 501 S.E.2d 141, 1998 Va. LEXIS 81 (1998). Although § 55-2 was inapplicable to the conveyance of easements because an easement was not an estate, the circuit courts judgment was reversed; the deeds at issue, along with a plat incorporated therein for descriptive purposes, did not contain operative words manifesting an intention to grant an easement. Considering the particular circumstances of the two deeds and the plat at issue, and resolving any d oubt against the establishment of an easement, there was no conveyance of an express easement across the property owners two parcels for the benefit of the limited liability companys parcel. Burdette v. Brush Mt. Estates, LLC, 278 Va. 286, 682 S. E.2d 549, 2009 Va. LEXIS 91 (2009). Seal.  Neither § 55-57 nor § 55-48 contain seal requirements that § 55-51 operates to suspend, and neither of these statutes imposes a seal requirement on deeds , which the common law and the Statute of Conveyances, have already accomplished; these provisions only offer recommended language, purely permissive, not mandatory, for deeds already required to be under seal, and the presence or absence of either statu te has no effect on the seal requirement.

As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:Claim means, in reference to litigation broug ht against an indemnified party, any demand, claim, cause or right of action, judgment, settlement, payment, provision of a consent decree or a consent decree, damages, attorneys fees, costs, expenses, and any other losses of any kind whatsoever associat ed with litigation.Communications provider means a broadband or other communications service prov ider, including a public utility as defined in § 56-265.1, a cable operator as defined in § 15.2-2108.1:1, a local exchange carrier, competitive or incumbent, or a subsidiary or affiliate of any such entity. Easement means an existing or future occupied electric distribution or communications easement with right of apportionment, including a prescriptive easement, except that easement does not include (i) easements that contain electric substations or other installations or facilities of a nonlinear character and (ii) electric transmission easements. Enterprise data center operations has the same meaning as provided in § 58.1-422.2. Evidence of creditworthiness means commercially reasonable assurance, in a form satisfactory to the incumbent utility, that the communi cations provider will be able to meet its obligations to indemnify as required by this section. Demonstrating that the communications provider has met the eligibility requirements for the Virginia Telecommunications Initiative (VATI), without regard to r eceipt of a VATI grant, pursuant to regulations or guidelines adopted by the Department of Housing and Community Development, shall be presumptive evidence of creditworthiness. Incumbent utility means the entity that is the owner of the easement.Indemnified parties means an incumbent utility, or any subsidiary or affiliate of any such entity, and the employees, attorneys, officers, agents, directors, representatives, or contractors of any such entity.Occupancy license agreement means an uncompensated agreement between an incumbent utility and a communications provider, for use when the communications provider wishes to occupy an easement underground, that includes evidence of creditworthiness, nondiscriminatory provisions based on safety, reliability, and generally applicable engineering principles.Prescriptive easement means an easement in favor of an incumbent utility or communica tions provider that is deemed to exist, without any requirement of adverse possession, claim of right, or exclusivity, when physical evidence, records of the incumbent utility, public records, or other evidence indicates that it has existed on the servie nt estate for a continuous period of 20 years or more, without intervening litigation during such period by any party with a title interest seeking the removal of utility facilities or reformation of the easement. The size of such easement shall be deeme d to be the greater of the actual occupancy of the easement in the incumbent utilitys usual course of business or 7.5 feet on each side of the installed facilities center-line. Public utility has the same meaning as provided in § 56-265.1.Sensitive site  means an underlying servient estate that is occupied by a railroad or an owner or tenant having operations related to national defense, national security, or law-enforcement purposes. B. It is the p olicy of the Commonwealth that: 1. Easem ents for the location and use of electric and communications facilities may be used to provide or expand broadband or other communications services; 2. The use of easements, appurtenant or gross, to provide or expand broadband or other communications services is in the public interest; 3. The installation, replacement, or use of public utility conduit, including the costs of installation, replacement, or use of conduit of a sufficient size to accommodate the installatio n of infrastructure to provide or expand broadband or other communications services, is in the public interest. 4. The use of easements, appurtenant or gross, to provide or expand broadband or other communications services (i) does not constitute a change in the physical use of the easement, (ii) d oes not interfere with, impair, or take any vested or other rights of the owner or occupant of the servient estate, (iii) does not place any additional burden on the servient estate other than a de minimis burden, if any; and (iv) has value to the owner or occupant of the servient estate greater than any de minimis impact; 5. The installation and operation of broadband or other communications services within easements, appurtenant or gross, are merely changes in the manner, purpose, or degree of the granted use as appropriate to accommodate a new technology; and 6. The statements in this subsection are intended to provide guidance to courts, agencies, and political subdivisions of the Commonwealth. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to make the use of an easement for broadband or other communications services, whether appurtenant, in gross, common, exclusive, or nonexclusive, a public use for the purposes of § 1-219.1, or other applicable law. C. The install ation and operation of broadband or other communications services by an incumbent utility for that utilitys own internal use, adjunctive to the operation of the electric system, or for the purposes of electric safety, reliability, energy management, and electric grid modernization, are permitted uses within the scope of every easement. D. Absent any express prohibition on the installation and operation of broadband or other communications services in an easement that is contained in a deed or other instrument by which the easement was granted, the installation and operation of broadband or other com munications services within any easement shall be deemed, as a matter of law, to be a permitted use within the scope of every easement for the location and use of electric and communications facilities. E. Subject to compliance with any express prohibitions in a written easement, any incumbent utility or communications provider may use an easement to install, construct, provide, maintain, modify, lease, operate, repair, replace, or remove its communications equipment , system, or facilities, and provide communications services through the same, without such incumbent utility or communications provider paying additional compensation to the owner or occupant of the servient estate or to the incumbent utility, provided that no additional utility poles are installed. F. Nothing in this section shall diminish a landowners right to contest, in a court of competent jurisdiction, the nature or existence of a prescriptive easement that has been continuously occupied for less than 20 years. G. Any incumbe nt utility or communications provider may use a prescriptive easement to install, construct, provide, maintain, modify, lease, operate, repair, replace, or remove its communications equipment, system, or facilities, and provide communications services th rough the same, without such incumbent utility or communications provider paying additional compensation to the owner or occupant of the servient estate or to the incumbent utility, provided that no additional utility poles are installed. H. Any incumbe nt utility may grant or apportion to any communications provider rights to install, construct, provide, maintain, modify, lease, operate, repair, replace, or remove its communications equipment, system, or facilities, and to provide communications servic es through the incumbent utilitys prescriptive easement, including the right to enter upon such easement without approval of the owner or occupant of the servient estate, such grant and use being in the public interest and within the scope of the pro perty interests acquired by the incumbent utility when the prescriptive easement was established. I. Notwithstan ding any other provision of law, in any action for trespass, or any claim sounding in trespass or reasonably related thereto, whatever the theory of recovery, relating to real property that is brought after July 1, 2020, against an incumbent utility or a communications provider, in relation to the existence, installation, construction, maintenance, modification, operation, repair, replacement, or removal of any poles, wires, conduit, or other communications infrastructure, including fiber optic or coaxi al cabling or the existence of any easement, appurtenant or gross, including a prescriptive easement, if proven, damages recoverable by any claimant bringing such claim shall be limited to actual damages only, and no consequential, special, or punitive d amages shall be awarded.

Seal.  Neither § 55-57 nor § 55-48 contain seal requirements that § 55-51 operates to suspend, and neither of these statutes imposes a seal requirement on deeds , which the common law and the Statute of Conveyances, have already accomplished; these provisions only offer recommended language, purely permissive, not mandatory, for deeds already required to be under seal, and the presence or absence of either statu te has no effect on the seal requirement.

Section prevents grantor from denying that title actually passed to grantee.  This section, a codification of the equitable doctrine of estoppel by deed, operates to prevent the grantor from denying that title has actually passed to the gra ntee. Thus, as between the parties, the statute permits the passage of title. It does not prejudice the rights of third parties. Hausman v. Hausman, 233 Va. 1, 353 S.E.2d 710, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1835, 1987 Va. LEXIS 164 (1987). Lien of child support judgment had priority over recorded deed of trust on entirety property.  The lien of a child support judgment docketed after couples divorce had priority over a recorded deed of trust on entirety property executed solely by the hus band prior to the divorce, despite the banks argument that the entry of the divorce decree, in conjunction with the application of this section (the after-acquired property doctrine), transformed the banks interest into a viable lien, as the bank s deed of trust with respect to the property was void as to wife and children. Hausman v. Hausman, 233 Va. 1, 353 S.E.2d 710, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1835, 1987 Va. LEXIS 164 (1987). Recording of deed of trust before Chapter 11 debtor acquired title did not affect lien.  Chapter 11 debtor was not entitled to summary judgment on her claim that she was to be treated as a bona fide purchaser under 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a)(3) where she had signed a deed of trust that was recorded before she actually acquired title to the property, under § 55-52, that fact did not affect the deeds validity, and applicable judicial precedent held that 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(a) barred a debtor-in-po ssession from avoiding a deed of trust that would have been binding on the debtor herself. Wilson v. Moir (In re Wilson), No. 05-13928-SSM, No. 06-1063, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 1001 (Bankr. E.D. Va. May 26, 2006). Applicat ion of estoppel by deed.  Appeals court rejected an argument that the circuit court erred in overruling an LLCs motion in limine that sought to enforce via an estoppel by deed, on grou nds that a widow attempted by her evidence to contradict the clear wording of the 1972 deed from which she derived her ownership interest; moreover, the widow was not estopped from claiming that she owned more than a one-half interest in the property and from asserting that she and her decedent husband were not divorced. 1924 Leonard Rd., L.L.C. v. Van Roekel, 272 Va. 543, 636 S.E.2d 378, 2006 Va. LEXIS 114 (2006). Rights of third partie s.  Case did not deal solely with the rights of the party that first recorded a deed of trust vis-a-vis debtor, but rather with the rights of third parties, including a lender. Consequently, § 55-52 did not insulate the deed of trust from an attack predicated on § 55-105. Wilson v. Moir, 359 Bankr. 123, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 3635 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2006). Circuit court properly ruled that an ex-wifes deed of trust had priority over a banks deed of trust because, while the banks deed of trust was recorde d before the ex-wifes deed of trust, the after-acquired-title statute did not purport to affect the deeds of third parties or influence the relative priority of their interests, the banks deed of trust was void against the ex-wife as a judgment l ien creditor, and the banks deed of trust was not properly recorded in the ex-wifes chain of title.

Contingent remainders.  Because there was no reason that would prevent a beneficiary from alienating a part of the beneficiarys interest in a trust, pursuant to §§ 55-6 and 55- 52, a commissioners determination that a beneficiarys expectancy went directly to the beneficiarys surviving children was affirmed.

Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Vendors implied lien was abolished in 1850.  In 1842, the common-law implied vendors lien was in existence, it not having been abolished until 1850, and could be enforced against a purchaser for value wi th notice, either actual or constructive; but, even as between parties, vendors and vendees, it might be waived by taking other securities, or a security of different form. Hunton v. Wood, 101 Va. 54, 43 S.E. 186, 1903 Va. LEXIS 2 (1903). Object of section was to make lien a matter of record.  The object of this section in requiring the lien to be reserved on the face of the deed was to make it a matter of record, and thus furnish to all persons dealing with the property the necessary information of all liens and incumbrances thereon. Patton v. Hoge, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 443, 1872 Va. LEXIS 35 (1872); Coles v. Withers, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 186, 1880 Va. LEXIS 32 (1880). The uncertainty in the state of the law, and the perplexing litigation growing out of it , led to the passage of this section. Coles v. Withers, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 186, 1880 Va. LEXIS 32 (1880). This section leaves unaffected a lien expressly reserved upon the face of the conveyance , which lien continues to have the same force and effect it always had. The reason for this is obvious. None of the evils growing out of the vendors implied lien result from a lien expressly reserved on the face of the conveyance. The lien being set forth in the first link of the vendees chain of title, purchasers from him have just as much notice of it as they would have of a lien upon the land by deed of trust or mortgage. Patton v. Hoge, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 443, 1872 Va. LEXIS 35 (1872). It does not impart any new quality to vendors lien.  This section provides that the vendor shall have no lien for unpaid purchase money unless a lien is reserved on the face of the deed, thus abolishing the lien by implication of law and substituting in its place a lien by express contract. This provision was not intended to impart any new quality to the vendors lien, but to end the vexatious litigation growing out of claims for unpaid purchase money against bo na fide purchasers of the legal title. Day v. Hale, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 146, 1872 Va. LEXIS 9 (1872); Gordon v. Rixey, 76 Va. 694, 1882 Va. LEXIS 69 (1882); Stoner v. Harris, 81 Va. 451, 1886 Va. LEXIS 112 (1886); Roanoke Brick &amp; Lime Co. v. Simmons, 20 S .E. 955, 1895 Va. LEXIS 149 (Va. 1895). Express lien is as valid as implied lien formerly was.  A vendors lien expressly reserved on the face of a conveyance, as required by this section, is as valid as to the estate or interest in the land conveyed as t he implied vendors lien formerly was, whether the estate in the land conveyed is an absolute fee simple title or a mere equitable interest therein. Dingus v. Minneapolis Imp. Co., 98 Va. 737, 37 S.E. 353, 1900 Va. LEXIS 100 (1900). Extent of reserved lien depends upon contract.  The extent of the lien reserved on the face of a deed does not depend upon the extent of the vendors interest in the land conveyed, but upon the contract of t he parties as gathered from the deed itself, in reserving the lien. Patterson v. Grottoes Co., 93 Va. 578, 25 S.E. 602, 1896 Va. LEXIS 114 (1896). It creates n o property in land.  Reserving lien for purchase money creates no property in the land. It passes as personalty. Assigning the debt carries the lien. It binds the land for the purchas e money, excluding other claims. Gordon v. Rixey, 76 Va. 694, 1882 Va. LEXIS 69 (1882). Statement not constituting reservation of lien.  The statement in a deed that it is made in consideration of five hundred dollars secured to be paid, without more, does not constitute an express reservat ion of a lien on the land on the face of the deed to secure its payment within the meaning of this section. Harris v. Shield, 111 Va. 643, 69 S.E. 933, 1911 Va. LEXIS 13 (1911). Section does not apply where no conveyance made by vendor.  The statute abolishing the implied lien has no application, it will be perceived, where no conveyance is made by the vendor. By retaining the legal title the vend or preserves his lien unaffected by this section. Day v. Hale, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 146, 1872 Va. LEXIS 9 (1872); Stoner v. Harris, 81 Va. 451, 1886 Va. LEXIS 112 (1886) (see Stovall v. Hardy, 1 Va. Dec. 342 (1879)). And vendor has lien as long as he retains title.  In case of a contract to convey, passing equitable title, of course there is a lien, as a vendor has a lien for purchase money as long as he retains title. Yancey v. Mauck, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 300, 1859 Va. LEXIS 17 (1859). Lien is enforceable against subsequent vendee or lienor.  If the vendor has sold the legal title, but not conveyed, the land would be charged with the purchase money in the hands of a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer , even without notice, and notwithstanding that the vendor had taken personal or other security. Day v. Hale, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 146, 1872 Va. LEXIS 9 (1872); Stoner v. Harris, 81 Va. 451, 1886 Va. LEXIS 112 (1886). For a court of equity will never compel a vendor to part with the legal title until the purchase money has been paid, or the lien therefor has been waived or extinguished. Yancey v. Mauck, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 300, 1859 Va. LEXIS 17 (1859); Coles v. Withers, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 186, 1880 Va.

Deed held deed of trust and not mortgage.  A deed substantially in the form prescribed for a deed of trust by this section is a deed of trust, and not a mortgage, and the fact that it does not prescribe an y terms of sale is immaterial, where the trustee, making a sale thereunder, complies in all respects with § 55-59.

Pflug, 82 Bankr. 807, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1586 (E.D. Va. 198 8). Virginia law requires deed to transfer legal title to real property. However, this rule does not change the fact that petitioners possessed neither a legal nor an equitable interest in the property once the auctioneers hammer fell and the memorandum of sale was signed. At this point, and before settlement, the trustee retains legal titl e to the property, while the purchaser possesses the right to enforce the sale in equity. Abdelhaq v.

Federal preemption.  Because § 55-58.1 granted state banks, but not national banks with no principal office in Virginia, the power to act as a deed of trust trustee and foreclose, a power incidental to a national banks real estate lending power, the National Bank Act preempted § 55-58.1; a national bank could act as a deed of trust trustee with power to foreclose against borrowers.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Principal office.  Highest bidder at a foreclosure sale was entitled to summary judgment in her action to recover her deposit and the contract and memo of sale were void and unenfor ceable by either party because the trustee lacked both the capacity and authority to be named or act as substitute trustee where it knew when it was named as substitute trustee and entered into the memo of sale with the bidder that its principal office w as not within the Commonwealth of Virginia. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 149 (Westmoreland County Aug. 5, 2013). Corporate trustee had to have principal office within Commonwealth.  Actions of a corporate trustee that had its principal office outside Virginia rendered the trustee auction and the memo executed pursuant thereto voidable because the statute required that in order for the trustee to be named or to act as trustee, it had to have its principal office within the Commonwealth; the requirements for a corporation serving as a trustee cannot be read as optional. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Westmoreland County Feb. 26, 2013). Trustees capacity and authority.  Bidders deposit at a foreclosure sale was to be returned to her by a trustee and lender because the memo of sale between the bidder and the trustee was void a nd unenforceable where the trustee lacked both the capacity and authority to be named or act as substitute trustee, and while the lender was not a party to the memo, it currently held the funds based solely upon its claim to the deposit. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 14 (Westmoreland County Jan. 24, 2014). Foreign trustee servin g with Virginia trustee.  Mere appointment of a foreign corporation, who did not qualify as a trustee, together with a Virginia corporation as co-trustees did not render two foreclosure sa les invalid and, therefore, an exception to a commissioners report invalidating the sales was sustained since the otherwise qualified co-trustee was a Virginia corporation. In re Trustee's Sale, 67 Va. Cir. 204, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 182 (Norfolk Mar. 25, 2005). Conclusive presumption.  Purchasers claim to set aside the memo by which she bought the property at the trustee sale was not barred by the statute; the conclusive presumption language must be limited to validating the correctness of the residence or business address of the trustee as it appears in the deed of trust. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Westmoreland County Feb. 26, 2013). Breach of contract action.  Corporate trustees ground of demurrer that the statute did not create a private cause of action in favor of a defaulting buyer was overruled because although the buyer alleged that the trustee violated the statute, her cause of action was for common-law breach of contract.

Text Every deed of trust to secure debts or indemnify sureties is in the nature of a contract and shall be construed according to its terms to the extent not in conflict wit h the requirements of law. Unless the deed of trust provides otherwise, it shall be construed to impose and confer upon the parties and beneficiaries the following duties, rights, and obligations in like manner as if the same were expressly provided for by such deed of trust: 1. The d eed shall be construed as given to secure the performance of each of the covenants entered into by the grantor as well as the payment of the primary obligation. 2. The grantor shall be deemed to covenant that he will pay all taxes, levies, assessments, and charges upon the property, including the fees and charges of such agents or attorneys as th e trustee may deem advisable to employ at any time for the purpose of the trust, so long as any obligation upon the grantor under the deed of trust remains undischarged. 3. The grantor shall be deemed to covenant that he will keep the improvements on the property in tenantable condition, whether such improvements were on the property when the deed of trus t was given or were placed there at a later time. 4. The grantor shall be deemed to covenant that no waste shall be committed or suffered upon the property. 5. The grantor shall be deemed to covenant that in the event of his failure to meet any obligations imposed upon him, then the trustee or any beneficiary may, at his option, satisfy such obligations. The money so advanced, with interest as provided in the deed of trust, shall be a part of the debt secured by the deed of trust, in the event of sale to be paid next after the expenses of executing the trust, and shall be otherwise recoverab le from the grantor as a debt. In addition, to the extent not otherwise covered, the grantor shall be deemed to covenant that amount advanced or incurred by the trustee or any beneficiary under a deed of trust (i) with respect to an obligation secured by a lien or encumbrance prior to the lien of the deed of trust or (ii) for the protection of the lien secured by the deed of trust, together with interest as provided in the deed of trust, shall be a part of the debt secured by the deed of trust, to be pa id next after expenses of executing the trust. 6. A covenant to pay interest shall be deemed a covenant to pay interest on the principal balance as such rate may vary or be modified from time to time by the parties under the original instruments or agreements or a written agreement of modification, whether or not recorded, and all the interest on the principal secured by the deed of trust shall be on an equal priority with the principal debt secured by the deed of trust, in the event of sale to be paid next after the expenses of executing the trust.Any covenant, otherwise authorized by law, that the lender shall be entitled to share in the gross income or the net income, or the gross rent or revenues, or net rents or revenues of the property, or in any portion of the proceeds or appreciation upon sale or appraisal or similar event, shall be on an equal priority with the principal debt secured by the deed of trust, in the event of sale to be paid next after the expenses of executing the trust, and shall be specified in the recorded deed of trust or other recorded document in order to be notice of record as against subsequent parties. 7. In the event of default in the payment of the debt secured, or any part thereof, at maturity, or in the payment of interest when due, or of the breach of any of the covenants entered i nto or imposed upon the grantor, then at the request of any beneficiary the trustee shall forthwith declare all the debts and obligations secured by the deed of trust at once due and payable and may take possession of the property and proceed to sell the same at auction at the premises or in the front of the circuit court building or at such other place in the county or city in which the property or the greater part thereof lies, or in the corporate limits of any city surrounded by or contiguous to such county, or in the case of annexed land, in the county of which the land was formerly a part, as the trustee may select upon such terms and conditions as the trustee may deem best. 8. If the sale is upon credit terms, the deferred purchase money shall bear interest from the day of sale and shall be secured by a deed of trust upon the property contemporaneous with th e trustees deed to the purchaser. 9. The party secured by the deed of trust, or the holders of greater than 50 percent of the monetary obligations secured thereby, shall have the right and power to appoint one or more sub stitute trustees for any reason and, regardless of whether such right and power is expressly granted in such deed of trust, by executing and acknowledging an instrument designating and appointing a substitute. When the instrument of appointment has been executed, the substitute trustee named therein shall be vested with all the powers, rights, authority, and duties vested in the trustee in the original deed of trust. The instrument of appointment shall be recorded in the office of the clerk in which the original deed of trust is recorded prior to or at the time of recordation of any instrument in which a power, right, authority, or duty conferred by the original deed of trust is exercised. 10. In the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, the trustee of such deed of trust shall not sell the property secured by the deed of trust without r eceiving an affidavit signed by the party that provided the notice required by § 55.1-321 confirming the notice was sent to the owner, with a copy of such notice attached to the affidavit. Prior to commencing a foreclosure sale with respect to such re al estate, the trustee shall provide copies of such affidavit and notice, with any personal financial information redacted, to each potential bidder.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. A.General Consideratio n. Section regulates conduct of trustee only so far as deed fails to do so.  It will be seen, on examination, that the object of this section is to prescribe the duties and regulate the conduct of the trustee only so far as the deed fails to do so. Clark v. Moore, 76 Va. 262, 1882 Va. LEXIS 28 (1882). De ed is sole source of his authority.  The trustee can only do with the trust property what the deed, either in express terms or by necessary implication, authorizes him to do. Williams v. Jones, 165 V a. 398, 182 S.E. 280, 1935 Va. LEXIS 307 (1935). De ed of trust considered a contract.  As a deed of trust was a contract under the law, it was clear that plaintiffs claim sounded in contract, not tort; thus, the trial court erred in characterizi ng the claim was a common-law negligence claim. Crosby v. ALG Trustee, LLC, 296 Va. 561, 822 S.E.2d 185, 2018 Va. LEXIS 196 (2018). Only statute that addresses the trustees duties with regard to a foreclosure sale expressly indicates that it does not cover the entire field of duties the tr ustee has in this area; the statute states that in the event of sale under a deed of trust, the trustee shall have the following powers and duties in addition to all others, and this language clearly indicates that the legislature did not intend to limit a trustees powers and duties to those enumerated in the statute. Crosby v. ALG Trustee, LLC, 296 Va. 561, 822 S.E.2d 185, 2018 Va. LEXIS 196 (2018). Section controlling unless otherwise provided.  The provisions of this section are controlling when the deeds of trust do not otherwise provide. Colonial Inv. Co. v. Cherrydale Cement Block Co., 194 Va. 454, 73 S.E.2d 419, 1952 Va. LEXIS 251 (1952). According to this section, when the deed of trust provides otherwise, the statutory requirements are inapplicable and a trustee thus did not violate subsection (7 ) by selling the property at auction without having declared the debt immediately payable where the deed of trust provided that the beneficiary could declare the debt immediately payable prior to the auction. Riley v. Robey, 122 F. Supp. 2d 684, 2000 U.S . Dist. LEXIS 17426 (W.D. Va. 2000). The validity of an acceleration clause in a deed of trust is recognized. Where it is not otherwise provided by the deed of trust, this section requires such a clause to be read into it. Devany v. Colgin, 163 Va. 848, 178 S.E. 15, 1935 Va. LEXIS 245 (1935). A due-on-sale acceleration clause in a deed of trust is not an unreasonable restraint on alienation. Lipps v. First Am. Serv. Corp., 223 Va. 131, 286 S.E.2d 215, 1982 Va. LEXIS 179 (1982); United Va.

Text A. In addition to the advertisement required by § 55.1-322, the trustee or the party secured shall give written notice of the time, date, and place of any proposed sale in execution of a deed of trust, and such notice shall include either (i) the instrument number or deed book and page numbers of the instrument of appointment filed pursuant to § 55.1-320, or (ii) a copy of the executed and notarized appointment of substitute trustee by personal delivery or by mail to (a) the present owner of the property to be sold at his last known address as such owner and address appear in the records of the party secured; (b) any subordinate lienholder who holds a note against the property secured by a deed of trust recorded at least 75 days, in the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, or 30 days, in the case of all other deeds of trust, prior to the proposed sale and whose address is recorded with the deed of trust; (c) any assignee of such a note secured by a deed of trust, provided that the assignment and address of assignee are likewise recorded at least 75 days, in the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, or 30 days, in the case of all other deeds of trust, prior to the proposed sale; (d) any condominium unit owners association that has filed a lien pursuant to § 55.1-1966; (e) any property owners association that has filed a lien pursuant to § 55.1-1833; and (f) any proprietary lessees association that has filed a lien purs uant to § 55.1-2148. Written notice shall be given pursuant to clauses (d), (e), and (f) only if the lien is recorded at least 75 days, in the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, or 30 days, in the case of all oth er deeds of trust, prior to the proposed sale. If the secured party has received notification that the owner of the property to be sold is deceased, the notice required by clause (a) shall be given to (1) the last known address of such owner as such addr ess appears in the records of the party secured; (2) any personal representative of the deceaseds estate whose appointment is recorded among the records of the circuit court where the property is located, at the address of the personal representative that appears in such records; and (3) any heirs of the deceased who are listed on the list of heirs recorded among the records of the circuit court where the property is located, at the addresses of the heirs that appear in such records. Mailing of a co py of the advertisement or a notice containing the same information to the owner by certified or registered mail no less than 60 days prior to such sale, in the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, or 14 days prior to such sale, in the case of all other deeds of trust, and to lienholders, the property owners association or proprietary lessees association, their assigns, and the condominium unit owners association, at the address noted in the memorandum of lien, by ordinary mail no less than 60 days prior to such sale, in the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, or 14 days prior to such sale, in the case of all other deeds of trust, shall be a sufficient compliance wit h the requirement of notice. The written notice of proposed sale when given as provided in this subsection shall be deemed an effective exercise of any right of acceleration contained in such deed of trust or otherwise possessed by the party secured rela tive to the indebtedness secured. The inadvertent failure to give notice as required by this subsection shall not impose liability on either the trustee or the secured party. The foreclosure sale cannot go forward unless the trustee has proof that the no tice has been sent. B. If a note o r other evidence of indebtedness secured by a deed of trust is lost or for any reason cannot be produced and the beneficiary submits to the trustee an affidavit to that effect, the trustee may nonetheless proceed to sale, provided that the beneficiary ha s given written notice to the person required to pay the instrument that the instrument is unavailable and a request for sale will be made of the trustee upon expiration of 60 days from the date of mailing of the notice, in the case of a deed of trust co nveying owner-occupied residential real estate, or 14 days from the date of mailing of the notice, in the case of all other deeds of trust. The notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the person requ ired to pay the instrument as reflected in the records of the beneficiary and shall include the name and mailing address of the trustee. The notice shall further advise the person required to pay the instrument that if he believes he may be subject to a claim by a person other than the beneficiary to enforce the instrument, he may petition the circuit court of the county or city where the property or some part thereof lies for an order requiring the beneficiary to provide adequate protection against any such claim. If deemed appropriate by the court, the court may condition the sale on a finding that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the inst rument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means. If the trustee proceeds to sale, the fact that the instrument is lost or cannot be produced shall not affect the authority of the trustee to sell or the validity of the sale. C. When the wr itten notice of proposed sale is given as provided in this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that the lienholder has complied with any requirement to provide notice of default contained in a deed of trust. Failure to comply with the requirements of notice contained in this section shall not affect the validity of the sale, and a purchaser for value at such sale shall be under no duty to ascertain whether such notice was validly given. D. In the even t of postponement of sale, which may be done in the discretion of the trustee, no new or additional notice is required to be given pursuant to this section. E. In the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, the notice to the owner in subsections A and B shall include the website address of the U.S. Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) Office of Housing Counseling with a listing of HUD -certified housing counseling agencies, the website address and telephone number of the statewide legal aid center, and the following language, or language that is substantially similar, in at least 12-point type: This is NOT a notice to vacate the p remises. You should consider contacting an attorney or your local legal aid or housing counseling agency. F. In the case of a deed of trust conveying owner-occupied residential real estate, the notice to the owner in subsections A and B shall include the date of the last payment received and the amount received; the total amount of principal, interest, costs, and fees due in arrears; and the remaining total principal balance due on the instrument.

Advertiseme nt of sale by a trustee or trustees in execution of a deed of trust shall be in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county or city in which the property to be sold, or any portion of such property, lies pursuant to the following provisions: 1. If th e deed of trust itself provides for the number of publications of such newspaper advertisement, which may be done by using the words advertisement required or similar words followed by the number agreed upon, then no other or different advertisem ent shall be necessary, provided that, if such advertisement be inserted on a weekly basis, it shall be published not less than once a week for two weeks, and if such advertisement be inserted on a daily basis, it shall be published not less than once a day for three days, which may be consecutive days, and in either case shall be subject to the provisions of § 55.1-330 in the same manner as if the method were set forth in the deed of trust. Should the deed of trust provide for advertising on other t han a weekly or daily basis, either of the foregoing provisions shall be complied with in addition to those provided in such deed of trust. Notwithstanding the provisions of the deed of trust, the sale shall be held on any day following the day of the la st advertisement that is no earlier than eight days following the first advertisement or more than 30 days following the last advertisement. 2. If the deed of trust does not provide for the number of publications of such newspaper advertisement, the trustee shall advertise once a week for four successive weeks, provided, howev er, that if the property or some portion of such property is located in a city or in a county immediately contiguous to a city, publication of the advertisement five different days, which may be consecutive days, shall be deemed adequate. The sale shall be held on any day following the day of the last advertisement that is no earlier than eight days following the first advertisement or more than 30 days following the last advertisement. B. Such advert isement shall be placed in that section of the newspaper where legal notices appear or where the type of property being sold is generally advertised for sale. C. In addition to the advertisement required by subsection A, the trustee shall give such other further and different advertisement as the deed of trust may require and in addition may give such additional advertisement as he may deem appropriate. D. In the even t of postponement of sale, which postponement shall be at the discretion of the trustee, advertisement of such postponed sale shall be in the same manner as the original advertisement of sale. E. Failure to comply with the requirements for advertisement contained in this section shall, upon petition, render a sale of the property voidable by the court.

For essay, Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust in Virginia, see 51 U. Rich. L. Rev. 147 (2016). CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. This section evidences strong legislative concern with the sufficiency of advertisements preceding foreclosure sales, with a purpose to insure a degree of publication that will generate sufficient interest to obtain the highest price available as well as to offer the debtor a reasonable time to redeem the debt. That legislative concern ha s increased with the passage of time. Deep v. Rose, 234 Va. 631, 364 S.E.2d 228, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1601, 1988 Va. LEXIS 1 (1988). Both § 55-59.1 and this section were adopted as part of single enactment, Acts 1979, c. 12. But there is a significant difference between them. After providing for written notice to the debtor, § 55-59.1 provides: Failure to comply with the requirements of notice contained in this section shall not affect the validity of the sale under the deed of trust . . . . This section, although a part of the same act, contains no such ameliorative language in case of failure to follow its mandatory time periods. It is apparent that the General Assembly intended that different cons equences would flow from violations of these respective sections. Deep v. Rose, 234 Va. 631, 364 S.E.2d 228, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1601, 1988 Va. LEXIS 1 (1988). Purchasers knowledge of notice to debtor of foreclosure sale.  It might be difficult for a purchaser at a foreclosure sale to ascertain whether 14 days personal notice had been given to the debtor as required by § 55-5 9.1, and the legislature, undoubtedly for that reason, relieved the purchaser of the consequences of the trustees failure in that respect. By contrast, a purchaser who has been attracted to a sale by a series of newspaper advertisements has ready mea ns of ascertaining whether the sale falls within the prescribed time period after publication, as required by § 55-59.2. If the sale falls without that period, he need not bid. Deep v. Rose, 234 Va. 631, 364 S.E.2d 228, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1601, 1988 Va. L EXIS 1 (1988). Duty to give public notice of sale is contractual and statutory.  Deed of trust expressly set out the amount of advertising that must precede the foreclosure sale, and the minimum amount of advertising necessary under the deed o f trust mirrored the minimum requirements stated in the statute, plus the contents of the advertisements were governed by § 55-59.3; the duty to give public notice of the sale by advertising is both contractual and statutory, and not an implied fiduci ary duty. Crosby v. ALG Trustee, LLC, 296 Va. 561, 822 S.E.2d 185, 2018 Va. LEXIS 196 (2018). Minimum and maximum periods between advertisement and sale are mandatory.  It is apparent from the language of this section, that the 8-day minimum and 30-day maximum periods between advertisement and sale are intended to be mandatory, o verriding both the discretion of the trustee and the contractual terms adopted by the parties to the deed of trust. In this crucial respect, the statute before us differs from all its predecessors. Deep v. Rose, 234 Va. 631, 364 S.E.2d 228, 4 Va. Law Rep . 1601, 1988 Va. LEXIS 1 (1988). Sales made in violation of this sections mandatory time periods are void, not merely voidable. The result is to render the sale ineffectual. No title, legal or equitable, passes to the purchaser. Deep v. Rose, 234 Va. 631, 364 S.E.2d 228, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1601, 1988 Va. LEXIS 1 (1988). Compliance with publication requirements.  Although the borrower alleged that defendants violated the federal publication requirements for foreclosure sales pursuant to 12 U.S.C.S. § 3758(3)(A), the Sin gle Family Mortgage Foreclosure Act of 1994 (SFMFA), 12 U.S.C.S. § 3751 et seq., was not applicable because the borrowers loan was not a federal loan or a federally secured loan and even if the SFMFA was applicable, defendants complied with Virgin ia law when they adhered to publication requirements contained in the deed of trust. Mubeidin v. Homecomings Fin. Network, Inc., No. 7:05CV00794, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1112 (W.D. Va. Jan. 9, 2006), aff'd, 183 Fed. Appx. 318, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 13367 (4 th Cir. 2006). Defendant did not fail to provide requisite notice of a foreclosure sale because the notice of sale indicated that it was mailed to plaintiff more than fourteen d ays prior to the sale pursuant to subsection A of § 55-59.1; the notice of sale was published once a week for two successive weeks as required by the deed of trust, and the foreclosure sale was then held more than eight days following the first advert isement and less than thirty days following the last advertisement, as required by subdivision A 1 of § 55-59.2.Gallant v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co., 766 F. Supp. 2d 714, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10209 (W.D. Va. 2011). Standing.  Argument by plaintiff homeowners that defendant financial institutions and lender servicers could not demonstrate standing to institute a foreclosure because they could not prove U.S. Const., Art. III injury failed to the extent standing was used to refer to the requirement that a secured party first prove in court its right to initiate a foreclosure before the procedure commences, because Virginia, the s tate in which the foreclosure took place, was a non-judicial foreclosure state with such foreclosures being governed by the procedures and requirements of §§ 55-59.1, 55-59.2, 55-59.3, and 55-59.4, and such non-judicial foreclosures did not require an interested party to prove standing in a court of law before initiating the foreclosure process.. Tapia v. United States Bank, N.A., 718 F. Supp. 2d 689, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62448 (E.D. Va. 2010). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. Notice.  Creditors motion to plea in bar of the statute of limitations was denied because constructive notice could not begin on the date a deed of trust was filed wit hout evidence that would give rise to a duty for the debtor to conduct a records search at the clerks office; although notice would have been sufficient when the trustee sale was first advertised, a second advertisement did not run creating a questio n of valid notice to the creditor.

Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Advertisement of sale gave sufficient notice to possible buyers.  Trustees advertisement of sale under deed of trust gave adequate notice to debtor and any potential 3rd-party bidder that both real and personal property woul d be sold as part of the foreclosure, where the notes and deed of trust clearly made reference to real and personal property as collateral for the loan and where the advertisement referred to the deed of trust for a description of the property to be sold and expressly stated that the personal property would be conveyed by the bill of sale. Virginia Hous. Dev. Auth. v. Fox Run Ltd. Partnership, 255 Va. 356, 497 S.E.2d 747, 1998 Va. LEXIS 45 (1998). Duty to give public notice of sale is contractual and statutory.  Deed of trust expressly set out the amount of advertising that must precede the foreclosure sale, and the minimum amount of advertising necessary under the deed o f trust mirrored the minimum requirements stated in the statute, plus the contents of the advertisements were governed by § 55-59.3; the duty to give public notice of the sale by advertising is both contractual and statutory, and not an implied fiduci ary duty. Crosby v. ALG Trustee, LLC, 296 Va. 561, 822 S.E.2d 185, 2018 Va. LEXIS 196 (2018). Substantial compliance with this section is sufficient so long as the rights of the part ies are not affected in any material way. Riley v. Robey, 122 F. Supp. 2d 684, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17426 (W.D. Va. 2000). District court did not err in concluding that the advertisement relative to a property substantially complied with § 55-59.3, as defendant mortgage holders advertisement of sale included a description of the property, the only address listed in the deed of trust, and a reference to the deed book and page number where the deed of trust could be found, and even assuming error in the advertisement, plaintiff failed to demonstrate material prejudice, as she presented no evidence to support her conclusion that the failure to include both addresses in the sale notice prejudiced the sale against obtaining the best price. Wood v. MorEquity, Inc., 331 Fed. Appx. 2 43, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 10906 (4th Cir. 2009). Failure to include street address not fatal.  Publication in the notice of sale of a description of the property, combined with the mailing address as listed in the deed of trust and reference to the deed boo k for further descriptions of the property, constituted substantial compliance with the notice requirements of this section and the failure to include the street address did not affect the owners rights in any material way or invalidate the sale. Ril ey v. Robey, 122 F. Supp. 2d 684, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17426 (W.D.

III injury failed to the extent standing was used to refer to the requirement that a secured party first prove in court its right to initiate a foreclosure before the procedure commences, because Virginia, the s tate in which the foreclosure took place, was a non-judicial foreclosure state with such foreclosures being governed by the procedures and requirements of §§ 55-59.1, 55-59.2, 55-59.3, 55-59.4, and such non-judicial foreclosures did not require an interested party to prove standing in a court of law before initiating the foreclosure process.

In the even t of sale under a deed of trust, the trustee shall have the following powers and duties in addition to all others: 1. Writt en one-price bids may be made and shall be received by the trustee from the beneficiary or any other person for entry by announcement of the trustee at the sale. Any person other than the trustee may bid at the foreclosure sale, including a person who ha s submitted a written one-price bid. Upon request to the trustee, any other bidder in attendance at a foreclosure sale shall be permitted to inspect written bids. Whenever the written bid of the beneficiary is the highest bid submitted at the sale, such document shall be filed by the trustee with his account of sale required under § 64.2-1309. The written bid submitted pursuant to this subsection may be prepared by the beneficiary, its agent, or its attorney. 2. The trustee may require of any bidder at any sale a cash deposit of as much as 10 percent of the sale price, unless the deed of trust specifies a higher or lower maximum, which may be done by the words bidders deposit of not more than dollars may be required or similar words, before his bid is received, which shall be refunded to the bidder unless the property is sold to him, otherwise to be applied to his credit in settlement or, should he fail to complete his purchase promptly, to be applied to pay the costs and expense of sale and the balance, if any, to be retained by the trustee as his compensation in connection with that sale.

The trustee shall receive and receipt for the proceeds of sale, account for the same to the commissioner of accounts pursuant to § 64.2-1309 and apply the same, first, to discharge the expenses of executing the trust, including a reasonable commission to the trustee; secondly, to discharge all taxes, levies, and assessments, with costs and interest if they have priority over the lien of the deed of trust, including the due pro rata thereof for the current year; thirdly, to discharge in the order of their priority, if any, the remaining debts and obligations secured by the deed, and any liens of record inferior to the deed of trust under which sale is made, with lawful interest; an d, fourthly, the residue of the proceeds shall be paid to the grantor or his assigns, provided, however, that the trustee as to such residue shall not be bound by any inheritance, devise, conveyance, assignment, or lien of or upon the grantors equity , without actual notice thereof prior to distribution, and provided further that such order of priorities shall not be changed or varied by the deed of trust. The trustees deed shall show the trustees mailing address. B. Upon discha rge, other than by sale by the trustee, of all debts, duties, and obligations imposed by the deed upon the grantor, including any expenses incurred preparatory to sale, then upon the grantors request the trustee shall execute and deliver a good and s ufficient deed of release at the grantors own proper costs and charges.

[Reserved.]. II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.]. II.Decided Under Prior Law. Construction.  Only statute that addresses the trustees duties with regard to a foreclosure sale expressly indicates that it does not cover the entire field of duties the tr ustee has in this area; the statute states that in the event of sale under a deed of trust, the trustee shall have the following powers and duties in addition to all others, and this language clearly indicates that the legislature did not intend to limit a trustees powers and duties to those enumerated in the statute. Crosby v. ALG Trustee, LLC, 296 Va. 561, 822 S.E.2d 185, 2018 Va. LEXIS 196 (2018). This section is permissive, authorizing but not mandating a deposit requirement. Such a requirement is solely for the trustees protection, and the trustee had authority to impose it or to waive it at his discretion. Yaffe v. Heritage Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 235 Va. 577, 369 S.E.2d 404, 4 Va. Law Rep. 3093, 1988 Va. LEXIS 74 (1988). Where the deposit requirement was never made a condition precedent to the sale and the t rustee waived the deposit requirement by recording the sale without a deposit and demanding settlement, an advertisement which contained the words: Cash. Bidders deposit of 10% of the bid price may be required did not relieve bidder who faile d to make payment at trustees sale. Yaffe v. Heritage Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 235 Va. 577, 369 S.E.2d 404, 4 Va. Law Rep. 3093, 1988 Va. LEXIS 74 (1988). Deposit to be paid after bidding.  The ten percent deposit this section permits a trustee to demand is not required prior to the bidding on the property at auction but after the sale price is deter mined. Riley v. Robey, 122 F. Supp. 2d 684, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17426 (W.D. Va. 2000). Continuation of lien in proceeds of foreclosure sale.  Because the debtors divorce decree awarded creditor ex-wife $190,000 as an equitable distribution award and it was to be paid from the sale of the marital hom e, with child support addressed in a separate section under a separate title, the equitable distribution award was not entitled to 11 U.S.C.S. § 507(a)(1)(A) priority, however, since the award was secured by the marital home and the marital home was s old in a foreclosure, the ex-wifes lien continued in the proceeds of the sale after payment of the mortgage. In re Uzaldin, 418 Bankr. 166, 2009 Bankr. LEXIS 3447 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2009). Standing.  Argument by plaintiff homeowners that defendant financial institutions and lender servicers could not demonstrate standing to institute a foreclosure because they could not prove U.S. Const., Art. III injury failed to the extent standing was used to refer to the requirement that a secured party first prove in court its right to initiate a foreclosure before the procedure commences, because Virginia, the s tate in which the foreclosure took place, was a non-judicial foreclosure state with such foreclosures being governed by the procedures and requirements of §§ 55-59.1, 55-59.2, 55-59.3, and 55-59.4, and such non-judicial foreclosures did not require an interested party to prove standing in a court of law before initiating the foreclosure process. Tapia v. United States Bank, N.A., 718 F. Supp. 2d 689, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62448 (E.D. Va. 2010). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Reasonable commission to be paid.  Reasonable commission for a trustee under a deed of trust conducting a foreclosure sale was $9,180 on a sale price of $409,000 pursuant to § 55-59.4, which all owed a reasonable commission. The trustee, who had paid himself five percent of the sale price, was ordered to return $11,270.

Buyers remedy.  Substitute trustees demurrer to a buyers complaint was sustained because although the memorandum or agreement of sale limited the buyers remedy to the refund of her deposit, it allowed the trustee plenary rights or remedies of recovery when the deposit was forfeited; that redirection of payment contra to the statute could mean that the trustee could pursue a claim against the buyer, which it could not have had if the net balance had gone directly to the trustee as compensation.

LEXIS 147 (Westmorelan d County Feb. 26, 2013). Buyers premium.  Memorandum or agreement of sale could be shown to be void because the trustee exceeded its legal authority at the sale by imposing an unannounced surcharge in the form of a buyers premium on the sales price; without factual evidence, the way in which the buyers premium was to be applied in the sale was not known, and thus, the trustees demurrer to the buyers claim that the memo was void was overru led. Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 211 (Northumberland County June 12, 2012), dismissed in part, 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Westmoreland County Feb. 26, 2013). Trustee owed no fiduciary duty to bu yer.  Substitute trustee owed no fiduciary duty to a buyer because the Trustee was not the agent of the buyer, and no statute embodied as public policy the goal of prot ecting bidders at a foreclosure sale from trustee fraud;.Hu v. CorpServe, Inc., 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 211 (Northumberland County June 12, 2012), dismissed in part, 88 Va. Cir. 450, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Westmoreland County Feb. 26, 2013 ). Standing.  Purchaser did not have standing to complain about the application of a forfeited deposit because the purchaser failed to allege any detriment or prejudice to hers elf for signing an agreement that varied the application of her forfeited deposit from that provided in the statute; the purchaser was not a party to the deed of trust but only to the memo seeking the sole remedy to which she was contractually entitled u pon default by the trustee, the refund of her deposit.

As used in this section:Deed of trust means any mortgage, deed of trust, or vendors lien. Judgment lien includes a judgment lien prescribed by § 8.01-458 but does not include any lien in favor of the federal, state, or local government, or any political subdivision thereof.Lien creditor and creditor shall be construed as synonymous and mean the holder, payee, or obligee of a note, bond, or other evidence of debt and shall embrace the lien creditor or his successor in interest as evidenced by proper endorsement or assignment, general or restrictive, upon the note, bond, or other evidence of debt. Payoff letter means a written communication from the lien creditor or servicer stating, at a minimum, the amount outstanding and requir ed to be paid to satisfy the obligation.RESA means Chapter 10 (§ 55.1-1000 et seq.), Real Esta te Settlement Agents.Satisfactory evidence of the payment of the obligation secured by the deed of trust or judgment lien means (i) any one of (a) the original canceled check or a copy of the canceled check, showing all endorsements, payable to the lien creditor or servicer, as applicable, (b) confirmation in written or electronic form of a wir e transfer to the bank account of the lien creditor or servicer, as applicable, or (c) a bank statement in written or electronic form reflecting completion of the wire transfer or negotiation of the check, as applicable, and (ii) a payoff letter or other reasonable documentary evidence that the payment was to effect satisfaction of the obligation secured or evidenced by the deed of trust or judgment lien.Satisfied by payment  includes obtaining written confirmation from the lien creditor that the underlying obligation has a zero balance. Servicer means a person or entity that collects loan payments on behalf of a lien creditor. Settlement agent has the same meaning ascribed to it in § 55.1-1000, provided that a person shall not be a settlement agent unless he is registered pursuant to § 55.1-1014 and otherwise fully in compliance with the applicable provisions of RESA.Title insurance company has the same meaning ascribed to it in § 38.2-4601, provided that the title insurance company seeking to release a lien by the process described in subsection E issued a policy of title insurance, through a title insurance agency or agent as defined in § 38.2-4601.1, for a real estate transaction wherein the loan secured by the lien was satisfied by payment made by the title insurance agency or agent also acting as the settlement agent. B. 1. Except as provided in Article 3 (§ 55.1-346 et seq.), after full or partial payme nt or satisfaction has been made of a debt secured by a deed of trust, vendors lien, or other lien, or any one or more obligations representing at least 25 percent of the total amount secured by such lien, but less than the total number of the obliga tions so secured, or the debt secured is evidenced by two or more separate written obligations sufficiently described in the instrument creating the lien, has been fully paid, the lien creditor shall issue a certificate of satisfaction or certificate of partial satisfaction in a form sufficient for recordation reflecting such payment and release of lien. This requirement shall apply to a credit line deed of trust prepared pursuant to § 55.1-318 only when the obligor or the settlement agent has paid t he debt in full and requested that the instrument be released.If the lien creditor receives notice from a settlement agent at the address identified in its payoff statement requesting that the certificate be sent to such settlement agent, the lien credit or shall provide the certificate within 90 days after receipt of such notice to the settlement agent at the address specified in the notice received from the settlement agent.If the notice is not received from a settlement agent, the lien creditor shall deliver, within 90 days after such payment, the certificate to the appropriate clerks office with the necessary fee for recording by certified mail, return receipt requested, or when there is written proof of receipt from the clerks office, by ha nd delivery, electronic delivery via the clerks electronic filing system, or delivery by a commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt obtained.If the lien creditor has already delivered the certificate to the clerks office by the time it receives notice from the settlement agent, the lien creditor shall deliver a copy of the certificate to the settlement agent within 90 days of the receipt of the notice at the address for notification set forth in th e payoff statement.Except as provided for judgment lien creditors in § 8.01-454, if the lien creditor has not, within 90 days after payment, either provided the certificate of satisfaction to the settlement agent or delivered it to the clerks offi ce with the necessary fee for filing, the lien creditor shall forfeit $500 to the lien obligor. No settlement agent or attorney may take an assignment of the right to the $500 penalty or facilitate such an assignment to any third party designated by the settlement agent or attorney. Following the 90-day period, if the amount forfeited is not paid within 10 business days after written demand for payment is sent to the lien creditor by certified mail at the address for notification set forth in the payoff statement, the lien creditor shall pay any court costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by the obligor in collecting the forfeiture. 2. If the note, bond, or other evidence of debt secured by such deed of trust, vendors lien, or other lien referred to in subdivision 1 or any interest therein has been assigned or tr ansferred to a party other than the original lien creditor, the subsequent holder shall be subject to the same requirements as a lien creditor for failure to comply with this subsection, as set forth in subdivision 1. C. The certifi cate of satisfaction shall be signed by the creditor or his duly authorized agent, attorney, or attorney-in-fact or any person to whom the instrument evidencing the indebtedness has been endorsed or assigned for the purpose of effecting such release. An affidavit shall be filed or recorded with the certificate of satisfaction by the creditor, or his duly authorized agent, attorney, or attorney-in-fact, with such clerk, stating that the debt therein secured and intended to be released or discharged has b een paid to such creditor or his agent, attorney, or attorney-in-fact, who was entitled and authorized to receive such debt when the debt was satisfied. D. When the ce rtificate of satisfaction has been signed and the affidavit required by subsection C has been duly filed or recorded with the certificate of satisfaction with such clerk, the certificate of satisfaction shall operate as a release of the encumbrance as to which such payment or satisfaction is entered and, if the encumbrance is by deed of trust, as a reconveyance of the legal title as fully and effectually as if such certificate of satisfaction were a formal deed of release duly executed and recorded. E. Release of lien by settlement agent or title insurance company.A settlement agent or title insurance company may release a deed of trust or judgment lien in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (i) if the obligation secured by the deed of trust or judg ment lien has been satisfied by payment made by the settlement agent and (ii) whether or not the settlement agent or title insurance company is named as a trustee under the deed of trust or otherwise has received the authority to release the lien. 1. Notic e to lienholder. a. After or accompanying payment in full of the obligation secured by a deed of trust or judgment lien, a settlement agent or title insurance company intending to release a deed of trust or judgment lien pursuant to this subsection shall deliver to the lien creditor by certified mail or commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt obtained, a notice of intent to release the deed of trust or judgment lien with a copy of the payoff letter and a copy of the release to be recorded as provided in this subsection. b. The notice of intent to release shall contain (i) the name of the lien creditor, the name of the servicer if loan payments on the deed of trust or judgment lien are collected by a servicer, or both names; (ii) the name of the settlement agent; (iii) the name of the title insurance company if the title insurance company intends to release the lien; and (iv) the date of the notice. The notice of intent to release shall conform subs tantially to the following form: NOTICE OF INTENT TO RELEASE Notice is hereby given to you concerning the deed of trust or judgment lien described on the certificate of satisfaction, a cop y of which is attached to this notice, as follows: 1.

Requisites for release .  Although a certificate of release of deed of trust executed by a noteholder with respect to a debtors property did not literally follow any of the statutory f orms in § 55-66.4:1, the court had little difficulty in concluding that the certificate, even though omitting the word partial in its title, did not release the deed of trust in its entirety but only as to the debtors other property.

While defendant creditors release of a refinancing deed of trust did not comply exactly with either a Certificate of Satisfaction or a Certificate of Partial Satisfaction, its plain language showed it applied only to a lien against one property, and because it was recorded earlier than plaintiff creditors lien, it had priority on the other property.

Any person who owns or has any interest in real estate or personal property on which an encumbrance as described in § 55.1-339 exists may, after 20 days notice to the person entitled to such encumbrance, apply to the circuit court of the county or city in wh ich such encumbrance is recorded to have the same released or discharged. Upon proof that the encumbrance has been paid or discharged or upon a finding by the court that more than 15 years have elapsed since the maturity of the lien or encumbrance, raisi ng a presumption of payment that is not rebutted at the hearing, such court shall order the clerk to record a certificate of satisfaction or a certificate of partial satisfaction that, when so recorded, shall operate as a release of such encumbrance.All releases made prior to June 24, 1944, by any court under this section upon such presumption of payment so arising and not rebutted shall be validated. B. If the cour t finds that the person entitled to such encumbrance cannot with due diligence be located, and that notice has been given such person in the manner provided by § 8.01-319 or 55.1-348, or that tender has been made of the sum due thereon but has been re fused for any reason by the party to whom due, the court may in its discretion order the sum due to be paid into court, to be there held as provided by law, and to be paid upon demand to the person entitled thereto. The court shall order the same to be r ecorded as provided in subsection A, and such certificate of satisfaction or certificate of partial satisfaction shall operate as a release of the encumbrance. C. Upon a find ing by the court that the holder of a mortgage or deed of trust that has been fully paid or discharged has unjustifiably and without good cause failed or refused to release such mortgage or deed of trust, the court may order that costs and reasonable att orney fees be paid to the petitioning party. This subsection shall not preclude a separate action by the petitioning party for actual damages sustained by reason of such failure or refusal to release the encumbrance. History History.

Section does not confer jurisdiction to litigate collateral issues.  Under this section there is only a single fact to be established; that is, the payment or discharge of the debt secured.

The court had no jurisdiction under this section to determine the liability of an insurance company to the owner of property destroyed upon which he had given a d eed of trust. Wagner v.

Presumption of payment is not affected by passage of statute of limitations.  The presumption of payment of a debt, secured by deed of trust, arising from the lapse of 20 years, is not affected by the passage of Acts 1897-98, p. 516, provid ing a statute of limitations for trust deeds.

A determination of what amount constitutes the sum due under an exercise of a ri ght of anticipation in a deed of trust is contemplated by this section and is necessary to a determination of whether the sum due has been tendered, and cannot be termed a collateral issue. GECC v. Lunsford, 209 Va. 743, 167 S.E.2d 414, 1969 Va. LEXIS 171 (1969). Notice.  Where the suit is one in equity under the general equity jurisdiction of the court, and not a summary statutory proceeding, even though some of the relief obtaina ble under this section is sought (as well as other relief), the giving of the notice in the manner provided for under this section is not mandatory.

Hall Bldg. Corp. v. Edwards, 142 Va. 209, 128 S.E. 521, 1925 Va. LEXIS 331 (1925). Incorrect satisfied in bankruptcy order.  Trial court incorrectly ordered a judgment creditors recorded judgment marked satisfied in bankruptcy; the trial court could only order the release of judgment creditors lien in a § 8.01-455 proceeding upon proof that it had been discharged in bankruptcy; furthermore, debtor had the burden of proof as to his entitlement to relief under § 8.01-455, and the trial court erred in imposing the b urden on judgment creditor to show that debtor had property in the county that was subject to its lien.

Attorney fees denied.  Borrowers were not entitled to an award of attorneys fees because, although a bank ultimately was mistaken about its entitlement to prepayment penalties, the bank did not act both unjustifiably and without good cause in refusing to release encumbrances until it was paid prepayment penalties for the borrowers payments on promissory notes.

As used in this section:New dwelling means a dwelling or house that has not previously been occupied for a p eriod of more than 60 days by anyone other than the vendor or the vendee or that has not been occupied by the original vendor or subsequent vendor for a cumulative period of more than 12 months, excluding dwellings constructed solely for lease. New d welling does not include a condominium or condominium units created pursuant to the Virginia Condominium Act (§ 55.1-1900 et seq.).Structural defects means a defect or defects that reduce the stability or safety of the structure below accepted standards or that restrict the normal use of the structure. B. In every co ntract for the sale of a new dwelling, the vendor shall be held to warrant to the vendee that, at the time of the transfer of record title or the vendees taking possession, whichever occurs first, the dwelling with all of its fixtures is, to the best of the actual knowledge of the vendor or his agents, sufficiently (i) free from structural defects, so as to pass without objection in the trade, and (ii) constructed in a workmanlike manner, so as to pass without objection in the trade. C. In addition , in every contract for the sale of a new dwelling, the vendor, if he is in the business of building or selling such dwellings, shall be held to warrant to the vendee that, at the time of transfer of record title or the vendees taking possession, whi chever occurs first, the dwelling together with all of its fixtures is sufficiently (i) free from structural defects, so as to pass without objection in the trade; (ii) constructed in a workmanlike manner, so as to pass without objection in the trade; an d (iii) fit for habitation. D. The warrant ies described in subsections B and C implied in the contract for sale shall be held to survive the transfer of title. Such warranties are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other express or implied warranties pertaining to the dwelling or its materi als or fixtures. A contract for sale may waive, modify, or exclude any or all express and implied warranties and sell a new home as is only if the words used to waive, modify, or exclude such warranties are conspicuous, as defined by subdivision (b)(10) of § 8.1A-201, set forth on the face of such contract in capital letters that are at least two points larger than the other type in the contract and only if the words used to waive, modify, or exclude the warranties state with specificity the warranty or warranties that are being waived, modified, or excluded. If all warranties are waived or excluded, a contract shall specifically set forth in capital letters that are at least two points larger than the other type in the contract that the dwe lling is being sold as is. E. If there is a breach of warranty under this section, the vendee, or his heirs or personal representatives in case of his death, shall have a cause of action against his vendor for damages, provided, however, for any defect discovered after July 1, 2002, such vendee shall first provide the vendor, by certified mail at his last known address, or by commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt obtained, a written notice stating the nature of the warranty claim. Such notice also may be hand delivered to the vendor with the vendee retaining a receipt of such hand-delivered notice to the vendor or its authorized agent. After such notice, the vendor shall have a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six months, to cure the defect that is the subject of the warranty claim. F. The warrant y shall extend for a period of one year from the date of transfer of record title or the vendees taking possession, whichever occurs first, except that the warranty pursuant to clause (i) of subsection C for the foundation of new dwellings shall exte nd for a period of five years from the date of transfer of record title or the vendees taking possession, whichever occurs first. Any action for its breach shall be brought within two years after the breach thereof. For all warranty claims arising on or after January 1, 2009, sending the notice required by subsection E shall toll the limitations period for six months. G. In the case of new dwellings where fire-retardant treated plywood sheathing or other roof sheathing materials are used in lieu of fire-retardant treated plywood, the vendor shall be deemed to have assigned the manufacturers warranty, at settlement, to the vende e. The vendee shall have a direct cause of action against the manufacturer of such roof sheathing for any breach of such warranty. To the extent any such manufacturers warranty purports to limit the right of third parties or prohibit assignment, such provision shall be unenforceable and of no effect.

Filing action within two years from date buyer notified builder.  If the buyer notifies the builder of any defects covered by the statutory warranty within the one-year statutory warranty period, and the builder fails to remedy such defects, then the builder has breached its statutory duty, and the buyer is entitled to file an action for damages against the builder within two years from the date that the buyer notified the builder of the defect.

Implied warranties of a vendor.  Home purchasers stated a cause of action against the corporate president as they adequately alleged that the corporate presidents joint venture constructed th e new home of the home purchasers, and, as a result, an implied warranty existed that the home was free from structural defects and built in a workmanlike manner; conversely, the home purchasers did not state a cause of action with regard to the individu al and the construction company because the applicable statute required the cause of action be brought against a vendor of the new home and neither of them was a vendor, which meant their demurrer against the home purchasers complaint as to the breac h of warranty claim against them had to be granted. Weiss v. Cassidy Dev. Corp., 63 Va. Cir. 76, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 183 (Fairfax County Aug. 18, 2003). Warranties not mentioned wit h specificity.  Builders motion to dismiss the buyers breach of implied warranty claim was overruled because, while the contract provided that the statutory warranty was specifically waived, the contract did not include the language as is and did not mention any warranties with specificity. Winston v. Tingley Constr. Co., 97 Va. Cir. 163 (Richmond 2013). Filing action without notice to bu ilder.  Seller and builder were entitled to dismissal of a home purchasers action for breach of the implied statutory warranty for a foundation because the seller and builder made affirmative representations that the required statutory notice had not been received by them. Frye v. B &amp; B Contr., Inc., 85 Va. Cir. 475, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 194 (Roanoke County Oct. 31, 2012). Notice to builder adequate.  Builders motion to strike the homeowners breach of warranty was denied where a list of deficiencies was included in a follow-up letter and was sent via ce rtified mail to the address used by the builder, the managing partner of the builder admitted that he received the follow-up letter, and thus, the requirements of subsection D of § 55-70.1 were met. Bessant v. Dey St. Props., LLC, 94 Va. Cir. 493, 201 6 Va. Cir. LEXIS 180 (Norfolk Nov. 21, 2016). Waiver.  Contract provision was ineffective to waive the implied warranties in the sale of a new home, as the font size of the warranty waiver text  which was capitali zed  was not two points larger than the remainder of the contract. Speier v. Renaissance at Victoria Farms, 58 Va. Cir. 90, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 365 (Fairfax County Dec. 3, 2001). Warranty waiver clause in a contract for the construction of a new home was found to be ineffective, as the contractual provision for the waiver of warranties was not effective to waive the implied warranties under § 55-70.1.Weiss v. Cassidy Dev. Corp., 61 Va. Cir. 237, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 22 (Fairfax County Feb. 21, 2003). Demurrer.  Because a buyer did not contest the contractors demurrer to the implied warranty, and because express warranty under § 8.2-313 did not apply to a home cons truction contract, the contrators demurrers were sustained thereto.

Any c onsideration that is payable by a grantee to a grantor for the interest in real property being transferred; 2. Any commission that is payable to a licensed real estate broker for a transfer under an agreement between the broker and the grantor or grantee; 3. Any amount, charge, fee, or interest that is payable by a borrower to a lender under a loan secured by a deed of trust or mortgage on real property, including (i) any fee that is payab le to the lender for consenting to an assumption of the loan or a transfer of the real property subject to the deed of trust or mortgage and (ii) any consideration allowed by law that is payable to the lender in connection with the loan; 4.

The section is itself but declaratory of the common law, and deeds may be assailed by cr editors at large for many causes not embraced within its purview. Notably is this so in respect to assignments of choses in action in fraud or hindrance of creditors. Shufeldt v. Jenkins, 22 F. 359, 1884 U.S. App. LEXIS 2529 (C.C.D. Va. 1884), dismissed, Gibson v. Mill Creek Distilling Co., 131 U.S. 437, 9 S. Ct. 798, 33 L. Ed. 224, 1888 U.S. LEXIS 2466 (1888). This section is merely declaratory of the common law, and, stated simply, provides that a fraudulent conveyance is voidable. Hyman v. Porter, 37 Bankr. 56, 1984 B ankr. LEXIS 6472 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1984). The fraudulent conveyance section and the common-law doctrine of alter ego are complementary rather than contradictory. APAC-Virginia, Inc. v.

Alternative pleadings.  Here, the creditors allegations in the bill of complaint and the nature of the relief sought adequately pled alternative theories of fraudulent and voidable v oluntary transfer in the context of this section and § 55-81. Balzer &amp; Assocs. v. Lakes on 360, Inc., 250 Va. 527, 463 S.E.2d 453, 1995 Va. LEXIS 139 (1995). The creditor made out a prima facie case of a fraudulent transfer and the chancellor thus erred in granting the motion to strike under this theory of recovery. Ba lzer &amp; Assocs. v. Lakes on 360, Inc., 250 Va. 527, 463 S.E.2d 453, 1995 Va. LEXIS 139 (1995). Res judicata.  Former employee who had obtained a judgment against his employer, an LLC, arising out of its failure to pay him according to a compensation agreement, was not bar red by res judicata from bringing a later action to collect the judgment and asserting fraudulent transfer claims under §§ 55-80 and 55-81, as well as an alter ego claim. Bennett v. Garner, 913 F.3d 436, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 1423 (4th Cir. 2019). Sufficiency of plead ing.  Where a liquidating trustee of corporate bankruptcy debtors asserted that transfers from the debtors to corporate insiders were avoidable as fraudulent transfers under 11 U.S.C.S. § 544(b) and § 55-80, the trustee sufficiently pleaded fraud; for each of the transfers the trustee alleged the approximate date, the transferor, the initial and subsequent transferees, and the approximate amount transferred, and the properly alleged fraudulent intent of the insiders was imputed to the debtors. Schnelling v. Crawford, 360 Bankr. 139, 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 159 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2007). Remedies.  Given the unique set of facts, jurisdictional issues, and complexity of attempting to undo the sale of the property, voiding the transfer was not a feasible optio n, but the court was reluctant to say that the General Assembly intended to provide a § 55-80 cause of action without a remedy. It appeared that a monetary judgment against those who transferred debtors interests away from it would have been the m ost appropriate course of action, and debtor, therefore, was awarded an in personam judgment against numerous defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1,615,000. Wellington Apt., LLC v. Clotworthy (In re Wellington Apt., LLC), No. 04-50301-DH A, No. APN 05-5029, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 1954 (Bankr. E.D. Va. July 27, 2006), reprinted, 350 Bankr. 213, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 2362 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2006). B.Form and Mod e of Conveyances. The particular form or mode of conveyance is an immaterial matter, as this section embra ces all transfers and dispositions of property where the intent is to hinder, delay or defraud creditors in enforcing their just claims. Coleman v. Cocke, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 618, 1828 Va. LEXIS 46 (1828); Spence v. Bagwell, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 444, 1849 Va. LEXIS 67 (1849); Stigler's Ex'rx v. Stigler, 77 Va. 163, 1883 Va. LEXIS 46 (1883); Spence v. Repass, 94 Va. 716, 27 S.E. 583, 1897 Va. LEXIS 130 (1897). Bona fide preference is valid.  Save so far as prohibited by the federal Bankruptcy Act, neither at common law nor in Virginia is it immoral or illegal to prefer one creditor to another in a dee d of assignment, neither having any lien, provided there is no design to secure some fraudulent or illegal pecuniary advantage or benefit therefrom to the debtor himself. Hutcheson v. Savings Bank, 129 Va. 281, 105 S.E. 677, 1921 Va. LEXIS 94 (1921) (see Johnson v. Lucas, 103 Va. 36, 48 S.E. 497 (1904)). Under this section it is well settled that an insolvent debtor, known by himself at the time to be insolvent, may make a valid conveyance of a portion or the whol e of his assets to a bona fide creditor or creditors, in satisfaction or on account of existing indebtedness, if that is the sole purpose of the debtor, and the transfer is for full value, although such conveyance may and is intended by the grantor and g rantee or grantees to give such creditor or creditors a preference to the exclusion of others in the distribution of the assets of the debtor. Surratt v. Eskridge, 131 Va. 325, 108 S.E. 677, 1921 Va. LEXIS 27 (1921). Not all preferential transfers are invalid. At common law and under this section, an insolvent debtor may generally make a valid transfer of a portion or the whol e of his assets to a bona fide creditor on account of an existing indebtedness, if that is the sole purpose of the debtor and the transfer is for full value. This is true even though such transfer may and is intended by the debtor and creditor to give su ch creditor a preference to the exclusion of others in the distribution of the debtors assets. This rule applies to corporations which are not banks or trust companies. Bank of Commerce v. Rosemary &amp; Thyme, Inc., 218 Va. 781, 239 S.E.2d 909, 1978 Va. LEXIS 147 (1978). Preferential transfers for full value to bona fide creditors by an insolvent debtor are not invalid absent fraud. It follows, as a corollary, that successful effo rts by such creditors to receive preferential treatment from an insolvent debtor will not be invalidated unless fraud is established. S.W. Rawls, Inc. v. Forrest, 224 Va. 264, 295 S.E.2d 791, 1982 Va. LEXIS 290 (1982). Generally, an insolvent debtor, whether an individual or a corporation, may prefer some bona fide creditors to the exclusion of others. Absent clear and convincin g proof that a debtor made the preference with intent to defraud the other creditors and that the preferred creditor had notice thereof, the unpaid creditors cannot successfully attack the preference as a fraudulent conveyance under this section. Mills v . Miller Harness Co., 229 Va. 155, 326 S.E.2d 665, 1985 Va. LEXIS 187 (1985). But if the purpose to make a bona fide preference is merely incidental to the transaction and is used as a cloak for some other purpose which is fraudulent in actual intent, the transfer is invalid. Bank of Commerce v. Rosemary &amp; Thyme, Inc., 218 Va. 781, 239 S.E.2d 909, 1978 Va. LEXIS 147 (1978). To prefer one creditor to another, neither having any lien, is not in contravention of any rule of law in this State. Until there is a legal lien by judgment or execution fixed upon a debtors property, he may, though in failing circumstances, assign his estate in trust; and if it be done in good faith, he may thereby prefer one cr editor to another, without committing a fraud, within this section, upon the creditors who are delayed and hindered. Nor is it an objection that the conveyance defeats all other creditors of their legal remedies, though they may amount to a majority in n umber and value. Young v. Willis, 82 Va. 291,...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_55.1-401"><akn:num>§ 55.1-401</akn:num><akn:heading>Voluntary gifts, conveyances, assignments, transfers, or charges; void as to prior creditors</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Every gift, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or charge that is not upon consideration deemed valuable in law, or that is upon consideration of marriage by an insolvent transferor or by a transferor who is thereby rendered insolvent, shall be void as to creditors whose debts were contracted at the time such gift, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or charge was made but shall not, on that account merely, be void as to c reditors whose debts have been contracted, or as to purchasers who have purchased, after such gift, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or charge was made.

Section 55-80 compared.  Unlike § 55-80, this section does not require finding of an intent to hinder, delay or defraud on the part of the grantor or grantee. Hyman v.

In order to prove insolvency, both the value of the debtors assets and the amount of his liabilities must be established. Hudson v. Hudson, 249 Va. 335, 455 S.E.2d 14, 1995 Va. LEXIS 41 (1995). Debtor not rendered insolvent.  Under Virginias stranger to title doctrine, which it retained from the common law, debtor wife, who did not have title in property prior to a conveyance of de btor husbands half interest to his daughter, did not become a grantor by virtue of the fact that the deed purported to reserve her a life estate. Applying the formula set forth in the Virginia statutes for valuing debtor husbands single life esta te in the real property, the court determined that debtor husband was not insolvent or rendered insolvent by the conveyance and thus, the transfer was not avoidable as constructively fraudulent under the Bankruptcy Code and Virginia law. Fraley v. Fraley (In re Fraley), No. 17-70067, No. 17-07027, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 916 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Mar. 28, 2018). Unsecured creditors of persons whose property is subject to forfeiture have legal interest in debtors property. United States v.

Contingent interests of debtor, which could not be reached by creditors under Virginia l aw, would not be figured into solvency calculation under this section. Shaia v. Meyer, 206 Bankr. 410, 1997 Bankr. LEXIS 410 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1997), aff'd, No. 3:97cv352, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4900 (E.D. Va. Mar. 12, 1998). The 1988 amendment to this section deals with the creation of rights and duties. Prior t o the effective date of the amendment, any person who transferred property without receiving consideration deemed valuable in law was subject to the provisions of this section. The amendment alters this section by restricting its applicability to insolvent transferors, thus limiting the rights of creditors and expanding the rights of transferors not found to be insolvent. Thus, the 1988 amendment affects substantive rights. Leake v. Mitchell, 108 Bankr. 112, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 2038 (Bankr. W.D. V a. 1989). Chapter 7 trustee was entitled to prejudgment interest in avoidance proceeding on moneta ry judgment awarded under this section. Shaia v. Meyer, 206 Bankr. 410, 1997 Bankr. LEXIS 410 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1997), aff'd, No. 3:97cv352, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4900 (E.D. Va. Mar. 12, 1998). Adequate pleadings.  Where liquidating trustee alleged that any claim by defendants that debtor transferred release to them of any debts they owed in marketing materials provided by r epresentatives employed by debtors outside marketing agency constituted constructively fraudulent transfers, allegation that debtor received nothing in exchange for alleged releases and that debtor was insolvent were sufficient to make prima facie ca se under constructive fraudulent transfer statutes of Virginia. Arrowsmith v. Lemberg Law, LLC, 571 Bankr. 182, 2017 Bankr. LEXIS 870 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2017). Alternative pleadings.  Here, the creditors allegations in the bill of complaint and the nature of the relief sought adequately pled alternative theories of fraudulent and voidable v oluntary transfer in the context of § 55-80 and this section. Balzer &amp; Assocs. v. Lakes on 360, Inc., 250 Va. 527, 463 S.E.2d 453, 1995 Va. LEXIS 139 (1995). Alter ego theory cannot be used defensively to avoid creditor s claims of fraudulent conveyance.  Former business associate was not entitled to dismissal of claims for fraudulent and voluntary conveyance of real property under §§ 55-80 and 55-81, because the associate could not use the theories of veil-piercing and alter ego defensively to protect himself from the claims of creditors; the equitable doctrine of alter ego would not be used conversely to achieve a result opposing its purpose. Hung-Lin Wu v . Tseng, No. 2:06cv346, No. 2:06cv580, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5025 (E.D. Va. Jan. 23, 2007). Res judicata.  Former employee who had obtained a judgment against his employer, an LLC, arising out of its failure to pay him according to a compensation agreement, was not bar red by res judicata from bringing a later action to collect the judgment and asserting fraudulent transfer claims under §§ 55-80 and 55-81, as well as an alter ego claim. Bennett v. Garner, 913 F.3d 436, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 1423 (4th Cir. 2019). B.Vo luntary Conveyances in General. This section excludes all inquiry into the motives and circumstances of the grantor. It adopts the view that if the grantor is indebted at the time of the voluntary settlement, it is presumed to be fraudulent in respect to such debts, and no circumstances will permit those debts to be affected by the settlement, or repel the legal presumpti on of fraud. The effect of the section is to disable the debtor from making any voluntary settlement of his estate to stand in the way of his creditors whose debts were contracted at the time. Johnston v. Gill, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 587, 1876 Va. LEXIS 51 ( 1876). The principle upon which voluntary conveyances are held void as to existing creditors is that a man should be just before he is generous.

Rights of assignee of claim no greater than those of assignor.  Creditor of bankrupt corporation, which had acquired by assignment claims filed originally by corporations owned by the same persons as the bankrupt corporation, stood in the shoes of its assignors; and where the assignors were comakers of the note under attack and thus were prohibited from challenging the transaction, the assignee could not rise higher or acquire rights superior to those its assignors could have asserted.

Such creditor may, in such action, have all the relief with respect to such estate to which he would be entitled after obtaining a judgment for the claim for which he may be entitled to recover. A creditor availing himself of this section shall have a lien from the time of bringing his action on all the estate, real and personal, and a petitioning creditor shall also be entitled to a lien from the time of filing his petition in the court in which the action is brought.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Creditor may sue under this section without first obtaining judgment.  As the law was before this section a creditor could not attack a conveyance for fraud without first obtaining a judgment or decree against his debtor. This sectio n, which originated in the Code of 1849, changed this rule and authorized a creditor at large to institute such a suit without first obtaining judgment. Wallace's Adm'r v. Treakle, 68 Va.

LEXIS 156 (1911); Wood v. Lester, 126 Va. 169, 101 S.E. 52, 1919 Va. LEXIS 84 (1919). This section allows a bill to be filed by a creditor to set aside a conveyance, etc., declared void by §§ 55-80 and 55-81, before obtaining judgment or decr ee, upon the ground that the above sections refer to fraudulent acts that are void. Brown v. Putney, 90 Va. 447, 18 S.E. 883, 1894 Va. LEXIS 11 (1894). The lien given by this section is a lien only upon the property conveyed, and not, like the lien of a judgment, on all of a debtors estate. Davis v. Bonney, 89 Va. 755, 17 S.E. 229, 1893 Va. LEXIS 100 (1893). It is inchoate until conveyance is adjudged void.  This section was intended to benefit those creditors who, by their diligence, succeed in bringing into court for distribution a fund, or assets placed beyond the reach of the unsecured creditors by the fraudulent or voluntary act of the debtor, and such creditors as attack the fraudulent or voluntary act and succeed in subjecting such fund or assets. But the lien provided for is never perfected unless and until t he deed or other act of the debtor attacked is adjudicated to be fraudulent and void. If there is no such adjudication, the lien is inchoate and ineffectual. Quinn-Marshall Co. v. Whittaker, 116 Va. 965, 83 S.E. 398, 1914 Va. LEXIS 110 (1914) (see Wood v . Lester, 126 Va. 169, 101 S.E. 52 (1919)). And it may be waived.  The lien given by this section may be waived by the subsequent contracts and dealings of the creditor with the debtor. Quinn-Marshall Co. v. Whittaker, 116 Va. 96 5, 83 S.E. 398, 1914 Va. LEXIS 110 (1914). Creditor may not be substituted to position of fraudulent grantee.  A creditor who successfully assails a deed of trust on the ground that it secures a fraudulent debt is not entitled to be substituted to the position formerly occ upied by the fraudulent creditor. His lien, if not previously acquired, dates only from the commencement of his suit, and is subordinate to liens previously acquired. The deed is valid as to bona fide debts, and the fraudulent debt is eliminated. Craig v . Hoge, 95 Va. 275, 28 S.E. 317, 1897 Va. LEXIS 36 (1897). Parties are placed in same position as if conveyance had never been made.  The result of setting aside a conveyance, under this section, is to place the parties in the same situation as if the conveyance had never been made, and to subje ct the property to the payment of the creditors of the grantor. Ferguson &amp; Co. v. Daughtrey, 94 Va. 308, 26 S.E. 822, 1897 Va. LEXIS 77 (1897). Provision as to personal decree to be liberally construed.  If from any cause the result of the suit prove unavailing to any creditor united therein, the court may render a personal decree against the debtor for the amount of the creditors claim. This feature of this section is remedial and should be liberally construed, especially as this construction accomplishes the wise end of preventing a multiplicity of suits, terminates litigation, and does no substantial injur y to the debtor. Battle v. Rock, 144 Va. 1, 131 S.E. 344, 1926 Va. LEXIS 225 (1926). Service of attachment does not create debtor-creditor relation.  The service of an attachment upon a garnishee did not create the relation of debtor and creditor between the garnishee and the attaching creditor, within the mean ing of this section and former § 55-83, and did not confer upon such attaching creditor the right to avoid a sale in gross of merchandise by said garnishee for want of conformity to former § 55-83.

Ellison, 22 S.E. 860 (Va. 1895). No lis pendens without interest in property.  Pursuant to § 55-82, as limited by subsection B of § 8.01-268, a plaintiff in an action claiming fraudulent conveyance as to a specific property is not free to file a memorandum of lis pendens on property in which he does not assert or claim an interest. Meliani v. Jade Dunn Loring Metro, L.L.C., 286 F. Supp. 2d 741, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18178 (E.D. Va. 2003). Condominium project owners motion to quash a lis pendens in a condominium purchasers breach of contract and fraud action was granted; because the purchase r neither contracted to purchase a unit in the other three phases, nor obtained a lien on the phases under § 55-82, it followed that the purchaser could not establish an interest in, or file a memorandum of lis pendens on, the three phases. Meliani v. Jade Dunn Loring Metro, L.L.C., 286 F. Supp. 2d 741, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18178 (E.D. Va. 2003). Interlocutory decree as res judicata.  In a suit under this section to set aside a deed of trust as fraudulent, decrees, the first of which established appellants claim as a lien upon the property and referred the cause to a commissioner to take account of liens, and the second of which confirmed the report of the commissioner, to which there was exception, and ordered a sale of the land, did not establish the validity of appellants lien as re s judicata, so that the court could not afterwards consider the question of the invalidity of the lien as against other lien creditors, afterwards setting up by petition alleged error of law in the holding of such decrees apparent from the record, whethe r appellees were or were not formal parties to the cause before the decrees were entered, since the decrees were not final. Motley v. H. Vicello &amp; Bros., 132 Va. 281, 111 S.E. 295, 1922 Va. LEXIS 25 (1922). Attorney fees.  A fraudulent conveyance is not a fraud for which additional attorneys fees, beyond what the statute allows, may be awarded. Simons v. Wassenaar, 268 Bankr. 47 7, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17306 (W.D. Va. 2001). The court did not err in determining the amount of attorneys fees to be awarded where the court found (1) that some legal research was excessive, (2) that som e fees were simply the normal collection activities of a creditor, and (3) that some fees were not related to the fraudulent conveyance action and were, therefore, unrecoverable under the statute.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Parol loan is taken to be fraudulent after five years.  Under the act to prevent frauds and perjuries, a loan of goods and chattels made by parol, to a person with whom, or those claiming under him, possession remains five years, without demand made and pursued by due process of law on the part of the lender, is taken to be fraudulent as to the creditors and purchasers of the persons so remaining in possession. Beasley v. Owen, 13 Va. (3 Hen. &amp; M.) 449, 1809 Va. LEXIS 14 (1809); Gay v. Moseley, 16 Va. (2 Munf) 543, 1812 Va. LEXIS 8 (1812); Lacy v. Wilson, 18 Va. (4 Munf) 313, 1814 Va.

Beale, 45 Va. (4 Gratt .) 93, 1847 Va. LEXIS 27 (1847). But it remains valid between the parties.  A loan of chattels, though not in writing duly recorded, and therefore void as to creditors, the borrower having continued in possession five years without such d emand as would bar their right, is nevertheless effectual between the parties and their representatives, however long the borrower may keep possession. Boyd v. Stainback, 19 Va. (5 Munf) 305, 1817 Va. LEXIS 3 (1817); Scott v. Jones, 76 Va. 233, 1882 Va. LEXIS 24 (1882) (see London v. Turner, 38 Va. (11 Leigh) 403 (1840)). As does parol trust.  Although, where personal property is given to one upon a trust by parol for another, the declaration of trust by parol may be valid as between the donee and the c estui que trust, yet as between the cestui que trust and the creditors of the donee the case is essentially different. London v. Turner, 38 Va. (11 Leigh) 403, 1840 Va. LEXIS 48 (1840). Choses in action are not goods or chattels.  Sections 55-3 and 55-96 and this section all relate to gifts, loans, sales, or partition of the same kind of property, described by the same terms, namely, go ods or chattels or goods and chattels. They are closely connected in subject matter and in the language employed, and it can hardly be doubted that whatever was meant by the words goods or chattels or goods and chattels in any one of these sections must have been intended of the same words in each of the other sections. These words do not apply to choses in action, but only to visible and tangible property. First Nat'l Bank v. Holland, 99 Va. 495, 39 S.E. 126, 1901 Va. LEXIS 70 (1901). Section does not apply to property remaining in possession on hire.  This section does not apply to the case of property remaining in possession of a debtor for more than five years on hire. M'Kenzie v. Macon, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 379 , 1849 Va. LEXIS 6 (1849). Nor to possession of mortgagor after mortgage duly recorded. See Rose's Adm'x v. Burgess , 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 186, 1839 Va. LEXIS 28 (1839). And purchaser from borrower cannot claim benefit of his own possession.  Where possession has not, at the time of a sale, remained five years with the borrower and those claiming under him, the purchaser can have no benefit from this s ection by reason of his own possession after the purchase. The circumstances that the possession by the borrower before the sale, and the possession by the purchaser after the sale, will together make five years cannot avail to give a title to the purcha ser. Lightfoot v. Strother, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 451, 1838 Va. LEXIS 33 (1838). Operation of section is avoided by resumption of possession by gran t of chattel to another.  The operation of this section will be avoided by the lenders resuming possession, or granting the chattels to another by writing duly recorded, within five ye ars. Collins v. Lofftus &amp; Co., 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 5, 1839 Va. LEXIS 14 (1839); Scott v. Jones, 76 Va. 233, 1882 Va. LEXIS 24 (1882). But not by private demand, receipt and redelivery to borrower.  A demand for chattels by the lender, who thereupon receives and immediately redelivers them to the borrower to be held on the same terms as before, the demand, re ceipt, and redelivery being in private, is not sufficient to bar the rights of creditors under this section. Boyd v. Stainback, 19 Va. (5 Munf) 305, 1817 Va. LEXIS 3 (1817). Or resumption of possession or recordation after five years.  Five years peaceable and uninterrupted possession of chattels under a loan not evidenced by deed duly recorded, vests a title in the borrower which inures in favo r of his creditors, and cannot be divested as to them by his returning the chattels to the lender after the five years have expired. Garth's Ex'rs v. Barksdale, 19 Va. (5 Munf) 101, 1816 Va. LEXIS 19 (1816); Taylor v. Beale, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 93, 1847 Va . LEXIS 27 (1847) (see London v. Turner, 38 Va. (11 Leigh) 403 (1840)). If a debtor remains in possession of chattels for five years, under a parol loan, they are liable to satisfy his creditors, though possession is resumed by the le nder before executions are levied upon them. Garth's Ex'rs v. Barksdale, 19 Va. (5 Munf) 101, 1816 Va. LEXIS 19 (1816); Taylor v. Beale, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 93, 1847 Va. LEXIS 27 (1847); Beale v. Digges, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 582, 1850 Va. LEXIS 7 (1850). Where, after a loan to a person with whom, or with those claiming under him, possession has remained five years, a deed is made and recorded by the lender, the de ed cannot affect a creditor of the person in possession, and ought not to be received as evidence against such creditor. Pate v. Baker, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 80, 1837 Va. LEXIS 8 (1837). Until five years after such resumption of possession.  Where possession has remained with the borrower, or with those claiming under him, for five years, and is then resumed by the lender, the possession must continue with the lender for the full period of five years from the time it was actually resumed before the title will be revested in the lender as against a creditor of the borrower. Pate v. Baker, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 80, 1837 Va. LEXIS 8 (1837). But only creditors existing when lender resumes possession are protected.  If no writing declaring a loan is recorded, or no demand is made by the lender and pursued by course of law, for more than five years after possession is commence d, the loan is void as to the borrowers creditor, whose rights cannot be affected by lenders subsequent resumption of possession. But the creditors meant are those whose debts were contracted before the resumption of possession, or conveyance of the chattels, by the lender, they having given credit to loanee on the apparent ownership of the property. Scott v. Jones, 76 Va. 233, 1882 Va. LEXIS 24 (1882). And recordation vacates loan as to debts subsequently contracted.  A deed recorded after possession has remained with a borrower more than five years vacates the loan, not as to debts contracted by the borrower before, but as to those contracted after, its recordation; and the onus is on the creditor to show that his debt was contracted before the deed was recorded, in order to render the property liable.

Aban donment of recorded contract.  Appellant sought to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment lien against land which had been conveyed to her father by one to whom it had been conveyed by the judgme nt debtor by a deed which was never recorded. Prior to the conveyance to the grantor of appellants father, the judgment debtor and his wife had executed a title bond or contract of sale under which they were to convey the property to another party, w hich contract was duly recorded prior to the docketing of the judgment. Appellant contended that this title bond was in legal effect a deed, and, since it was recorded prior to the docketing of the judgment, that the judgment could never have been a lien against the land. The other party to the contract of sale joined with the judgment debtor in the conveyance to the grantor of appellants father, in which conveyance it was stated that the contract of sale had been rescinded and that the other party to the contract joined in such deed as a release deed. It was held that any claim under the title bond or contract had been abandoned and such bond or contract was a nullity, and the land was subject to the judgment lien. Cox v.

Every (i) contract in writing; (ii) deed conveying any estate or term; (iii) deed of gift, or deed of trust, or mortgage conveying real estate or personal property; and (iv) bill of sale, or contract for the sale of personal property, when the possession is allowed to remain with the grantor, shall be void as to all purchasers for valua ble consideration without notice not parties thereto and lien creditors, until and except from the time it is recorded in the county or city in which the property subject to such contract, deed, or bill of sale is located. The fact that any such instrume nt is in the form of or contains the terms of a quit-claim or release shall not prevent the grantee from being a purchaser for valuable consideration without notice, nor be of itself notice to such grantee of any unrecorded conveyance of or encumbrance u pon such real estate or personal property. The mere possession of real estate shall not, of itself, be notice to purchasers for value of any interest or estate therein of the person in possession.

Se ction 43-21 modifies this section.  The effect of § 43-21 is to modify the registry law as contained in this section so far as to give priority to a mechanics lien on the lands of the grantee , who has failed to record his deed, over judgments subsequently obtained against his grantor.

Object of this section was to settle judicial conflict.  This section, which first appeared in the Code of 1849 as § 11 of chapter 118, was intended to put an end to the judicial strife exhibited in certain e arly decisions.

It was not designed to change the debts which would entitle creditors to assail an unrecorded deed, but to define the class of creditors as to whom, if their debts were of the kind and character authorizing them to call it in question, an unrecorded deed would be void. McCandlish v. Keen, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 615, 1857 Va. LEXIS 23 (1857). To what cred itors applicable.  This section does not include creditors claiming under a devise for the payment of debts, or under the statute subjecting real estate to their payment. But the cr editor who may avoid an unrecorded deed must have some lien, by judgment or otherwise, which entitles him to charge the subject conveyed specifically. McCandlish v. Keen, 54 Va.

Section protects purchaser paying only part of purchase price.  Prior to § 2472 of the Code of 1887, similar to this section, a subsequent purchaser under a contract not required to be recorded was not protected against a p rior unrecorded conveyance unless he had paid the whole purchase price before he received notice of the unrecorded conveyance. Fulkerson v. Taylor, 102 Va. 314, 46 S.E. 309 (1904). This was regarded as a hardship, and was corrected by the provisions of t he section. But neither prior nor subsequent to the Code of 1887 did any such hardship exist as to the equitable owner of real estate. Both before and since the revision of 1887, it has been held that where the recording acts do not interfere, the judgme nt creditor can acquire no better right to the estate than the debtor himself has at the date of the recovery of the judgment. McClanahan's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 122 Va. 705, 96 S.E. 453, 1918 Va. LEXIS 137 (1918). And it does not apply to judgment creditors.  This section, which protects a subsequent purchaser under an unrecorded title to the extent of payments made when he receives notice of a prior unrecorded deed or writing and gives him a lien on the property purchased for so much of the purchase money as he had paid before notice, has no application to judgment creditors. Fulkerson v. Taylor, 102 Va. 314, 46 S.E. 309, 1904 Va. LEXIS 72 (1904); McClanahan's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 122 Va. 705, 96 S.E. 453, 1918 Va. LEXIS 137 (1918). As writing refers only to contracts.  The word writing in this section refers to contracts in writing by which a party acquires some interest in land, and not to judgments by which a party acq uires a mere lien upon land. Fulkerson v. Taylor, 102 Va. 314, 46 S.E. 309, 1904 Va. LEXIS 72 (1904). Lien void only for so much of purchase price paid.  Even if it be assumed purchasers did not have actual or constructive notice of the lien, the lien of the deed of trust would only be void as to the purchasers, fo r so much of the purchase price as paid by them under the contract. Village Sav. Bank v. Willey, 65 Bankr. 832 (E.D. Va. 1986). Extent of lien of judgment against vendor where purchaser without perf ect legal title.  Where a valid contract for the sale of land has been entered into, and the recording acts do not interfere, a judgment against the vendor after the contract and b efore deed to the purchaser, and before the entire purchase money has been paid, is a lien on the land only to the extent of the purchase money then unpaid. McClanahans Admr v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 122 Va. 705, 96 S.E. 453 (1918), overruling Fulkers on v. Taylor, 102 Va. 314, 46 S.E. 309 (1904), insofar as it declares that in order for a purchaser under a contract which is not required to be recorded, to be protected as to a subsequent judgment against his vendor, he must, before the date of such ju dgment, have become invested with a perfect equitable title by the payment of the whole of the purchase money. Lien properly granted.  In an action against an alleged previous owner to remove a cloud on title to land where plaintiff, at the time of purchase, did not have actual or constructive no tice of a prior tax suit and sale resulting in delivery of a deed of the property to defendant, and where plaintiff, as the purchaser at a judicial sale, was bound to look to the county land records and the papers in the suit for information as to the pr operty sold, the title and the boundaries, but an examination at the time of the judicial sale of the sources would have disclosed only that the property was titled in the name of the person whose title the court was purporting to sell and that the taxes were delinquent for previous years, the trial court correctly granted the plaintiff a lien on defendants property.

Duty to examine record.  A purchaser of real estate has constructive notice of the recorded title papers of his vendor, and it is the duty of such purchaser to examine the proper records to ascertain whether his vendor, or those under whom he claims, have made any prior conveyances of said real estate, or whether the same is encumbered. Pillow v. Southwest Va. Imp. Co., 92 Va. 144, 23 S.E. 32, 1895 Va. LEXIS 97 (1895). Li mitation on constructive notice.  This section is simply a limitation on the constructive notice that would otherwise arise from recordation and does not allow a purchaser or mortgagee to simply i gnore a conveyance or mortgage recorded prior to the time the grantor acquired record title where the purchaser has actual knowledge or inquiry knowledge of its existence. In the instant matter, the evidence showed no such knowledge. Wilson v. Moir, 359 Bankr. 123, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 3635 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2006).

Wilson v. Moir, 359 Bankr. 123, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 3635 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2006). Chain of title.  Circuit court properly ruled that an ex-wifes deed of trust had priority over a banks deed of trust because, while the banks deed of trust was recorde d before the ex-wifes deed of trust, the after-acquired-title statute did not purport to affect the deeds of third parties or influence the relative priority of their interests, the banks deed of trust was void against the ex-wife as a judgment l ien creditor, and the banks deed of trust was not properly recorded in the ex-wifes chain of title.

Multiply this interest by the present value of an annuity of $1, as set opposite the persons age in the t able, and the product is the gross value of the life estate of such person. B. Example: Su ppose a person whose age is 42 is a tenant for life in the whole of an estate worth $10,500. The annual interest on that sum at eight percent is $840. The present value of an annuity of $1 at the age of 42, as shown by the table, is $10.77, which, multip lied by $840, gives $9,046.80 as the gross value of such life estate in the premises, or the proceeds of such life estate.

Text A. Calculate t he interest at eight percent upon the sum to the income of which, or upon the value of the property to the use of which, the joint life tenants are entitled. Multiply this interest by the present value of an annuity of $1, as shown in Column II of § 5 5.1-500, for the joint equal age of such joint life tenants. The joint equal age of such tenants shall be obtained as follows: Take the difference in age in years between such tenants and refer to the table in § 55.1-502 and add to the younger age the value opposite such difference, and the sum is the joint equal age; take this joint equal age and refer to the table in § 55.1-500 and find in Column II the value of an annuity of $1 a year payable for life during such joint equal age. The product of the interest and the value of an annuity for a given joint equal age is the gross value of the joint life estate of such person therein. B. Example: Do e, age 30, and Roe, age 40, are joint tenants for life in the whole of an estate worth $10,500: The difference in ages is 10 and, as shown by the table in § 55.1-502, the value opposite age difference 10 is seven. Seven added to 30, Does age, give s 37; as shown by the table in § 55.1-500, the value in Column II for an annuity of $1 for two joint lives at joint equal age 37 is $10.44 and no mills, and this, multiplied by $840 (the interest at eight percent on $10,000), gives $8,769.60 as the gr oss value of the joint life estate of such persons.

Finally, a linear interpolation between x = 40 and x = 41 would yield the value of A = 9.378 40.540:40.540:40.540. This figure multiplied by $840 (the interest at eight percent on $10,500) gives $7,877.52 as the gross value of the joint life estate of such persons therein.

Peyton v. Carr's Ex'x, 85 Va. 456, 7 S.E. 848, 1888 Va. LEXIS 55 (1888). Record ation in two or more places.  There is no rule of law, statutory or otherwise, which prevents the valid subsequent recordation in other counties or cities of a deed once recorded in a given co unty or city. The circumstances that the other county or city is subsequently formed out of a portion of the county in which the deed was first recorded, and that it is not necessary to record the deed a second time in such other county or city, are imma terial. The original deed may be recorded in any county or city wherein the property embraced in the deed or any part thereof is located, and it will give the constructive notice provided for by § 55-96. It is only when the original deed has been lost or mislaid that a certified copy thereof has to be used for the recordation thereof in another county or city as provided in § 55-109. Abrahams v.

Sign ature of power of attorney for surviving spouse valid.  Claim for an elective share signed and properly acknowledged by the attorney-in-fact for the surviving husband pursuant to a power of attorney was statutorily val id, although it was not signed by the husband himself, as it met the requirements for recordation of documents generally.

Grubb v. Yacoub, 86 Va. Cir. 503, 2013 Va. Cir. L EXIS 64 (Fairfax County July 3, 2013). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Editors note.  The opinions cited below refer to prior law. Maryland notary public may not notarize in Virginia documents for recordation in Virginia.  A notary public commissioned in the State of Maryland is not authorized to notarize in the Commonwealth documents for recordation in a circuit court clerks of fice in Virginia.

Circuit court clerk may not decline to record a deed of trust that co ntains the grantors social security number, and, regardless of the motivation behind the removal of such information, a clerk who removes a social security number upon recordation of an instrument does so at the risk of liability.

As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning:Attorney means any person licensed as an attorney in Virginia by the Virginia State Bar.Corrective affidavit means an affidavit of a n attorney correcting an obvious description error.Obvious description error means an error in a real property parcel description contained in a recorded deed, deed of trust, or mortgage where (i) such parcel is identified and shown as a separate parcel on a recorded subdivision plat; (ii) such error is apparent by reference to other information on the face of such deed, deed of trust, or mortgage or on an attachment to such deed, deed of trust, or mortgage or by reference to other instruments in the chain of title for the property conveyed thereby; and (iii) such deed, deed of trust, or mortgage r ecites elsewhere the parcels correct address or tax map identification number. An obvious description error includes (a) an error transcribing courses and distances, including the omission of one or more lines of courses and distances or the omission of angles and compass directions; (b) an error incorporating an incorrect recorded plat or a deed reference; (c) an error in a lot number or designation; or (d) an omitted exhibit supplying the legal description of the real property thereby conv eyed. An obvious description error does not include (1) missing or improper signatures or acknowledgments or (2) any designation of the type of tenancy by which the property is owned or whether or not a right of survivorship exists. Recorded subdivision plat means a plat that has been prepared by a land surveyor licensed pursuant to Articl e 1 (§ 54.1-400 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 54.1 and recorded in the clerks office of the circuit court for the jurisdiction where the property is located.Title insur ance company has the same meaning as set forth in § 38.2-4601, provided that the title insurance company issued a policy of title insurance for the transaction in which the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction was recorded. B. Obvious des cription errors in a recorded deed, deed of trust, or mortgage purporting to convey or transfer an interest in real property may be corrected by recording an affidavit in the land records of the circuit court for the jurisdiction where the property is lo cated or where the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction was recorded. No correction of an obvious description error shall be inconsistent with the description of the property in any recorded subdivision plat. C. Prior to re cording a corrective affidavit, the attorney seeking to record the affidavit shall deliver a copy of the affidavit to all parties to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, including the current owner of the property; to the attorney who prepared the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, if known and if possible; and to the title insurance company, if known, and give notice of the intent to record the affidavit and of each partys right to object to the affidavit. For an affidavit to correct an obvious des cription error in a deed as described in clause (a) of the definition of obvious description error in subsection A, notice and a copy of the affidavit shall also be provided to any owner of property adjoining a line to be corrected. The notice an d a copy of the affidavit shall be delivered by personal service, sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or delivered by a commercial overnight delivery service or the United States Postal Service, and a receipt obtained, to the last known add ress of each party to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage to be corrected that (i) is contained in the land book maintained pursuant to § 58.1-3301 by the jurisdiction where the property is located and where the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needi ng correction was recorded; (ii) is contained in the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction; (iii) has been provided to the attorney as a forwarding address; or (iv) has been established with reasonable certainty by other means, and to all o ther persons and entities to whom notice is required to be given. The notice and a copy of the affidavit shall be sent to the property address for the real property conveyed by the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction. If a locality is a p arty to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, the notice and a copy of the affidavit required by this subsection shall be sent to the county, city, or town attorney for the locality, if any, and if there is no such attorney, then to the chief executive f or the locality. For the purposes of this section, the term party includes any locality that is a signatory. If the Commonwealth is a party to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, the notice and a copy of the affidavit required by this subsectio n shall be sent to the Attorney General and to the director, chief executive officer, or head of the state agency or chairman of the board of the state entity in possession or that had possession of the property. D. If, within 30 days after personal service or receiving confirmation of delivery of the notice and a copy of the affidavit (i) to all parties to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, including the current owner of the property; (ii) to the attorney who prepared the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage, if known and if possible; (iii) to the title insurance company, if known; and (iv) to the adjoining property owners, if necessary, pursuant to subsection C, no written objection is received from any party disputing the f acts recited in the affidavit or objecting to its recordation, the corrective affidavit may be recorded by the attorney, and all parties to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage shall be bound by the terms of the affidavit. The corrective affidavit shall contain (a) a statement that no objection was received from any party within the period and (b) a copy of the notice sent to the parties. The notice shall contain the attorneys Virginia State Bar number. The corrective affidavit shall be notarized. E. A correctiv e affidavit that is recorded pursuant to this section operates as a correction of the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage and relates back to the date of the original recordation of the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage as if the deed, deed of trust, or mort gage was correct when first recorded. A title insurance company, upon request, shall issue an endorsement to reflect the corrections made by the corrective affidavit and shall deliver a copy of the endorsement to all parties to the policy who can be foun d. F. The clerk s hall record the corrective affidavit in the deed book and, notwithstanding their designation in the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage needing correction, index the affidavit in the names of the parties to the deed, deed of trust, or mortgage as grantors a nd grantees as set forth in the affidavit. The costs associated with the recording of a corrective affidavit pursuant to this section shall be paid by the party that records the corrective affidavit. An affidavit recorded in compliance with this section shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated in such affidavit. Any person who wrongfully or erroneously records a corrective affidavit is liable for actual damages sustained by any party due to such recordation, including reasonable attorney fees a nd costs. G. The remedie s under this section are not exclusive and do not abrogate any right or remedy under the laws of the Commonwealth other than this section. H.

People's Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Roane, 205 Va. 916, 140 S.E.2d 823, 1965 Va. LEXIS 154 (1965). Taking acknowledgment is act judicial in character.  The act of an officer in taking an acknowledgment of a deed is judicial in its character. Quesenberry v. Barbour, 75 Va. 491, 1881 Va. LEXIS 31 (1881); Corey v. M oore, 86 Va. 721, 11 S.E. 114, 1890 Va. LEXIS 37 (1890). But admitting a deed to record is a purely ministerial act. To hold otherwise would not only be against the law, but would involve the absurdity of devolving upon the clerk the duty of assuming judicial functions in the performance of his ministerial duties. Corey v. Moore, 86 Va. 721, 11 S.E. 114, 1890 Va. LEXIS 37 (1890). Which the cler k must perform.  Where a deed is regular on its face, and the acknowledgment thereof has been taken and certified by a duly authorized officer, it is the duty of the clerk under t his section to admit it to record when presented to him for that purpose. Corey v. Moore, 86 Va. 721, 11 S.E. 114, 1890 Va. LEXIS 37 (1890). Admission to record is equivalent to actual recordation for the purpose of notice. Quese nberry v. Barbour, 75 Va. 491, 1881 Va. LEXIS 31 (1881). Certificate is conclusive evidence of facts stated.  In the absence of fraud, the certificate of the notary of the acknowledgment of a deed is conclusive evidence of all the facts stated therein and required by the statute. Burson v. Andes, 83 Va. 445, 8 S.E. 249, 1887 Va. LEXIS 90 (1887). If it is reasonably certain that grantor made acknowledgment of the instrument in questi on that is sufficient, because the object of the statute is that the notary shall know and certify that the person whose name is signed to the instrument is the person who is acknowledging it. Cumbee v. Myers, 232 Va. 371, 350 S.E.2d 633, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1349, 1986 Va. LEXIS 267 (1986). B.Who May Ta ke Acknowledgments. Acknowledgment implies the existence of two persons; one who makes the acknowledgment, a nd another who receives and certifies it. Quesenberry v. Barbour, 75 Va. 491, 1881 Va. LEXIS 31 (1881); Leftwich v. City of Richmond, 100 Va. 164, 40 S.E. 651, 1902 Va. LEXIS 12 (1902). And a party to a deed cannot take his own acknowledgment of it before himself in his off icial character. Quesenberry v. Barbour, 75 Va. 491, 1881 Va. LEXIS 31 (1881). The clerk of a court cannot take his own acknowledgment of a deed executed by him so as to render it valid as against a subsequent purchaser for value from him, a s a deed admitted to record. Quesenberry v. Barbour, 75 Va. 491, 1881 Va. LEXIS 31 (1881); Leftwich v. City of Richmond, 100 Va. 164, 40 S.E. 651, 1902 Va. LEXIS 12 (1902). An acknowledgment of a writing cannot be taken by one who is interested in it, as the ac t of the officer in taking the acknowledgment is judicial in character. Quesenberry v. Barbour, 75 Va. 491, 1881 Va. LEXIS 31 (1881); Corey v. Moore, 86 Va. 721, 11 S.E. 114, 1890 Va. LEXIS 37 (1890). Such as the grantee or beneficiary in a deed.  The grantee or beneficiary in a deed cannot, as an officer, take the grantors acknowledgment, and a deed so acknowledged and admitted to record cannot effect a notice under the registry laws. Quesenberry v. Barbour, 75 Va. 491, 1881 Va. LEXIS 31 (1881); Corey v. Moore, 86 Va. 721, 11 S.E. 114, 1890 Va. LEXIS 37 (1890). Or the trustee in a deed of trust.  A trustee in a deed of trust, though interested only to the extent of his fees, is within the inhibition against taking an acknowledgment by one who is interested , as any interest whatever, no matter how slight or remote, will work a disqualification. Corey v. Moore, 86 Va. 721, 11 S.E. 114, 1890 Va. LEXIS 37 (1890). But it may be presumed that trustee and notary are different persons.  When trust deed describes trustee as L. Triplett, Jr., and the certificate begins I, L. Triplett, Jr., a notary public, etc., but is signed L. Triplett, N.P., the inference is that the trustee and the notary are different persons; and the clerk is required to admit to record a deed so certified, but that will not preclude an enquiry into the validity of the certificate. Where there was gro ss laches and an appearance of acquiescence in adverse rights in addition to the facts stated above, the deed was held to have been sufficiently acknowledged. Corey v. Moore, 86 Va. 721, 11 S.E. 114, 1890 Va. LEXIS 37 (1890). Deputy clerk.  Under a former statute, an acknowledgment taken by a deputy clerk of a deed to be recorded in the office of his principal was held valid. Town of Gate City v. Ric hmond, 97 Va. 337, 33 S.E. 615 (1899). The deputy is now given express authority by this section and § 55-106 . Aldermen presumed to be justices of the peace.  A deed was acknowledged before two aldermen of New York City, and on such acknowledgment was admitted to record in Virginia. The presumption is warranted that the y are justices of the peace, when they undertake to act as such under authority of the statute, in the absence of proof to the contrary. The deed was properly admitted to record. Welles v. Cole, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 645, 1849 Va. LEXIS 71 (1849). C.Form and Validity of Certificate. Section requires only substantial compliance.  Substantial compliance with the forms of certificates of acknowledgment set out in this section was expressly authorized by the 1924 amendment which inserted the word substantially before to the following effect, immediately preceding each form. People's Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Roane, 205 Va. 916, 140 S.E.2d 823, 1965 Va. LEXIS 154 (1965).

Acknowledgment and oath distinguished.  An acknowledgment merely verifies that the person named executed the document in question. By swearing to a document, on the other hand, one vouches that the cont ents of the writing are true. A person who swears falsely may be guilty of a felony. Wisniewski v. Johnson, 223 Va. 141, 286 S.E.2d 223, 1982 Va. LEXIS 180 (1982). Attorney acknowl edgement.  Acknowledgment certificate indicated that only debtor and his wife acknowledged the deed of trust, which would require them to appear before the notary and state in her presence that the deed of trust was his or her act; they did not appear before the notary, and therefore could not have acknowledged the deed of trust in person. However, § 47.1-15 provided that a signer must acknowledge the document in person, unless otherwise authorized by law to do so, § 47.1-15; therefore, the fact that attorney of debtor and his wife, rather than debtor and his wife, acknowledged the deed of trust did not make the acknowledgment invalid, as long as the attorney was authorized by law to do so.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 15 M.J. Recording Acts, § 2. CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Meaning of recovery.   Recovery, as a legal term, does not necessarily or usually mean the act by which the title or right of possession is acquired; but, on the contrary, its m ore common signification is the final adjudication that the title or right of possession was before acquired, and of right belongs, by virtue of the previous acquisition, to the party in whose favor the decree is made. Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Steinman, 213 F. 557, 1913 U.S. App. LEXIS 1404 (4th Cir. 1913). Thus, it is apparent that the term used in the statute should be given the comprehensive meaning of the establishment by judgment of the right to land, and not th e act of acquiring or regaining possession or acquiring title. Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Steinman, 213 F. 557, 1913 U.S. App. LEXIS 1404 (4th Cir. 1913). What is suit for recovery of land.  A suit to subject land to the payment of a judgment is not a suit for the recovery of land, and this section providing for the record of any recovery of l and under judgment or decree has no application to the decree rendered therein. Steinman v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., 121 Va. 611, 93 S.E. 684, 1917 Va. LEXIS 63 (1917). But see Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Steinman, 213 F. 557, 1913 U.S. App. LEXIS 1404 (4th Cir. 1913). The index to the record of a decree is as much a part of the record as the decree itself . Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Steinman, 213 F. 557, 1913 U.S. App. LEXIS 1404 (4th Cir. 1913).

Failure to provide disclaimer.  Attorneys demurrer to a purchasers action alleging that the failure to file suit against sellers within the one-year limitations period of subsection C of § 55-524 was a breach of an implied obligation to perform legal services, was sustained because there was no negligence on the part of the attorneys for failing to timely file the complaint in the underlying suit; the purpose of residential disclosur e or disclaimer requirements in the Virginia Residential Property Disclosure Act, §§ 55-519 and 55-519.1, is to provide protection to purchasers of residential property against issues as to the property being sold that are not readily apparent but may exist, and a failure to provide a disclaimer, which puts the purchaser on notice of one of the specified potential issues, does not serve the contemplated purpose of the Act, and it is therefore not a disclaimer for purposes of starti ng the one-year statute.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Inconsistent disclosure statements.  In a case in which the home buyers sued a real estate agent for fraud in the inducement because the results of the testing for radon gas in the basement had not b een disclosed, the agent argued unsuccessfully that her compliance with § 55-523 barred the buyers from asserting a viable fraud claim. The seller and the agent signed a radon acknowledgment form stating that they had no knowledge concerning the testi ng of the property for radon or the presence or absence of radon in the property; however, that was inconsistent with the disclosure statement in which the seller and the agent stated that the property had been tested for radon gas, and that failure to a ccurately inform the buyers prevented the agent from obtaining the protection of the statute.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Limitation of actions.  Buyer could not maintain a direct claim under the Virginia Residential Property Disclosure Act, subsection C of § 55-524, against the sellers for allegedly fai ling to make certain disclosures to the buyer in a disclaimer statement that the sellers gave to the buyer of residential property that contained numerous building restrictions, as the buyer did not bring an action within one year of the time in which th e buyer allegedly did not receive the proper disclosures. However, the buyer could maintain an action against the sellers agents for claims brought ex contractu or ex delicto against them, as the buyers action was filed against them well within t he one-year statute of limitation for personal injury, § 8.01-243, and contracts, governed by § 8.01-246, running from the settlement date regarding the relevant real estate transaction. McGlen v. Barrett, 78 Va. Cir. 90, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 6 (Fai rfax County Jan. 9, 2009). Defects not limited to those listed in the Virginia Residential Property Disclosure Act.  Actionable defects under the Virginia Residential Property Disclosure Act (VRPDA) are not limited to those defects that were set out in the VRPDA, because the listed defects relate to known defects to be disclosed, and they do not relate to disclaimer statements; section 55-519 states that the disclosure form may include the listed defects but does not indicate the exclusivity of the list, and because the VRPDA does not otherwise define defects, the list of potential defects in § 55-519 does not constrain the use of the term defects. McGlen v. Rosenfeld, 82 Va. Cir. 108, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 3 (Fairfax County Jan. 13, 2011). Failure to provide notice of defect.  Attorneys demurrer to a purchasers action alleging that their failure to file her suit against sellers within the one-year limitations period of the Virgi nia Residential Property Disclosure Act (VRPDA) was a breach of an implied obligation to perform legal services was overruled as to the purchasers claim that the sellers failure to provide notice of the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (CBPA) was a defect because a damages action based on the failure to provide notice of the CBPA was a remedy under the VRPDA as it existed on the date of contracting. McGlen v. Rosenfeld, 82 Va. Cir. 108, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 3 (Fairfax County Jan. 13, 2011). Attorneys demurrer to a purchasers action alleging that the failure to file suit against sellers within the one-year limitations period of subsection C of § 55-524 was a breach of an implied obligation to perform legal services, was sustained because there was no negligence on the part of the attorneys for failing to timely file the complaint in the underlying suit; the purpose of residential disclosur e or disclaimer requirements in the Virginia Residential Property Disclosure Act, §§ 55-519 and 55-519.1, is to provide protection to purchasers of residential property against issues as to the property being sold that are not readily apparent but may exist, and a failure to provide a disclaimer, which puts the purchaser on notice of one of the specified potential issues, does not serve the contemplated purpose of the Act, and it is therefore not a disclaimer for purposes of starti ng the one-year statute.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Relation to common law.  Virginia Consumer Real Estate Settlement Protection Act (CRESPA) contained no abrogation clause, and did not otherwise indicate any intent to preclude common-law claims. In the absence of such intent, the court could not impute a statutory abrogation of common-law rights; therefore, the court found that common-law claims against the bond could proceed. First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. W. Sur. Co., No. 1:09-cv-403, 200 9 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44231 (E.D. Va. May 27, 2009). When settlement occurs .  Sellers motion to dismiss an action for specific performance of a real estate sales contract was denied because paragraph 6 of the contract relied upon by sel ler in its motion to dismiss, applied by its plain terms only prior to closing and the sale had in effect closed, since seller had delivered the necessary deed and other closing documents to the escrow agent and purchaser had supplied the purchase money; a settlement occurs once the escrow agent has received the documents and funds necessary to carry out the terms of the sales contract and there has been compliance with the conditions of the contract.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. Standing to pursue claim.  Demurrer filed by a settlement agent was overruled because a real estate agents allegations of a violation of the Virginia Wet Settlement Act (WSA), § 6.1- 2.10 et seq. [now § 55-525.1 et seq.], based on the settlement agents failure to escrow a disputed sum, under an instruction by the seller, pending a determination of the appropriate disbursement of the settlement proceeds survived the demurrer. T he settlement agents contention that only those to whom it owed a fiduciary duty had standing to make a claim under the WSA was without merit because the WSA displayed the Virginia General Assemblys intention that an instruction to violate the pl ain terms of an agreement by a person to whom a fiduciary duty was owed was not to be acted upon.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. Standing to pursue claim.  Demurrer filed by a settlement agent was overruled because a real estate agents allegations of a violation of the Virginia Wet Settlement Act (WSA), § 6.1- 2.10 et seq. [now § 55-525.1 et seq.], based on the settlement agents failure to escrow a disputed sum, under an instruction by the seller, pending a determination of the appropriate disbursement of the settlement proceeds survived the demurrer. T he settlement agents contention that only those to whom it owed a fiduciary duty had standing to make a claim under the WSA was without merit because the WSA displayed the Virginia General Assemblys intention that an instruction to violate the pl ain terms of an agreement by a person to whom a fiduciary duty was owed was not to be acted upon.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Economic loss doctrine.  Because the duties allegedly breached under title insurance companies constructive fraud claim against their settlement agents arose solely from an agency agr eement and personal guarantees, the constructive fraud claim was precluded by the economic loss doctrine. Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. Wash. Settlement Group, LLC, 87 Va. Cir. 77, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 136 (Fairfax County Sept. 4, 2013). Breach of fiduciary duty claims sufficiently pleaded.  Title insurance companies sufficiently alleged breach of fiduciary duty claims against settlement agents because the companies alleged that the settlement agents violated the statutory duties required of them as settlement agents under § 55-525.25. However, the companies, at that time, could only bring suit for property transactions in which they had actually made payments. Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. Wash. S ettlement Group, LLC, 87 Va. Cir. 77, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 136 (Fairfax County Sept. 4, 2013). Fraud claims sufficiently pleaded.  Title insurance companies sufficiently alleged fraud claims against settlement agents because the companies alleged that the settlement agents intentionally made false statements on certain HUD-1 settlement statements, in violation of the statutory duties required of them as settlement agents under § 55-525.25. However, the companies, at that time, could only bring suit for property transactions in which they had actually made payments. Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. Wash. Settlement Group, LLC, 87 Va.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Applicability.  Defendants conviction for trespassing under § 18.2-119 was appropriate, in part because the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, § 55-248.2, wa s inapplicable since defendant leased the apartment as a student. A residence at a public or private institution, if incidental to detention or the provision of medical, geriatric, educational, counseling, religious or similar services, was exempted from the Act. Maciel v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 9 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2011). Editors note. The decision cited below was written under former § 55-248.3:1. Tenant may not recover damages for personal injuries resulting fr om a landlords violation.  In a negligence action, a tenant could not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlords alleged noncompliance with duties imposed by § 55-248.13 of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, §§ 55-248.2 through 55-248.40, because the Act does not, either through the express language of §§ 55-248.40, 55-248.21, and 55-248.4 or by necessary implication, abrogate the com mon-law rule that a landlord was not liable in tort for a tenants personal injuries caused by the landlords failure to repair premises under the tenants control and possession. Sections 55-248.3:1, 55-248.4, 55-248.21, and 55-248.40 revealed that the Act provided a comprehensive scheme governing contractual relationships between landlords and tenants instead of creating a statutory cause of action allowing a tenant to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlords nonco mpliance with the Act.

If, however, the applicat ion deposit was made by cash, certified check, cashiers check, or postal money order, such refund shall be made within 10 days of the applicants failure to rent the unit if the failure to rent is due to the landlords rejection of the applicat ion. If the landlord fails to comply with this section, the applicant may recover as damages suffered by him that portion of the application deposit wrongfully withheld and reasonable attorney fees. B. A landlord may request that a prospective tenant provide information that will enable the landlord to determine whether each applicant may become a tenant. The landlord may photocopy each applicants drivers license or other similar photo identification, con taining either the applicants social security number or control number issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to § 46.2-342. However, a landlord shall not photocopy a U.S. government-issued identification so long as to do so is a viol ation of 18 U.S.C. § 701. The landlord may require, for the purpose of determining whether each applicant is eligible to become a tenant in the landlords dwelling unit, that each applicant provide a social security number issued by the U.S. Social Security Administration or an individual taxpayer identification number issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. C.

B. A landlord shall offer a prospective tenant a written rental agreement containing the terms governing the rental of the dwelling unit and setting forth the terms and conditions of the landlord-tenant relationship and shall provide with it the statement of tenant ri ghts and responsibilities developed by the Department of Housing and Community Development and posted on its website pursuant to § 36-139. The parties to a written rental agreement shall sign the form developed by the Department of Housing and Communi ty Development and posted on its website pursuant to § 36-139 acknowledging that the tenant has received from the landlord the statement of tenant rights and responsibilities. The written rental agreement shall be effective upon the date signed by the parties. C. If a landlo rd does not offer a written rental agreement, the tenancy shall exist by operation of law, consisting of the following terms and conditions: 1. The p rovision of this chapter shall be applicable to the dwelling unit that is being rented; 2.

However, as provided in § 55.1-1208, th e landlord shall not require a tenant to pay both a security deposit and the cost of damage insurance premiums if the total amount of any security deposit and damage insurance premiums exceeds the amount of two months periodic rent. The landlord shal l notify a tenant in writing that the tenant has the right to obtain a separate policy from the landlords policy for damage insurance. If a tenant elects to obtain a separate policy, the tenant shall submit to the landlord written proof of such cover age and shall maintain such coverage at all times during the term of the rental agreement. Where a landlord obtains damage insurance coverage on behalf of a tenant, the insurance policy shall provide coverage for the tenant as an insured. The landlord sh all recover from the tenant the actual costs of such insurance coverage and may recover administrative or other fees associated with administration of a damage insurance policy, including a tenant opting out of the insurance coverage provided by the land lord pursuant to this subsection.

A landlord may require a tenant to pay for the cost of premiums for such renters insurance obtained by the landlord, in order to prov ide such coverage for the tenant as part of rent or as otherwise provided in this section. As provided in § 55.1-1200, such payments shall not be deemed a security deposit but shall be rent. The landlord shall notify a tenant in writing that the tenan t has the right to obtain a separate policy from the landlords policy for renters insurance. If a tenant elects to obtain a separate policy, the tenant shall submit to the landlord written proof of such coverage and shall maintain such coverage a t all times during the term of the rental agreement. If a tenant allows his renters insurance policy required by the rental agreement to lapse for any reason, the landlord may provide any landlords renters insurance coverage to such tenant. T he tenant shall be obligated to pay for the cost of premiums for such insurance as rent or as otherwise provided herein until the tenant has provided written documentation to the landlord showing that the tenant has reinstated his own renters insuran ce coverage. C. If the land lord requires that such premiums be paid to the landlord prior to the commencement of the tenancy, the total amount of all security deposits, insurance premiums for damage insurance, and insurance premiums for renters insurance shall not exceed the a mount of two months periodic rent.

The owner, manager, or operator of the residential buildi ng may charge and collect from the tenant additional service charges, including monthly billing fees, account set-up fees, or account move-out fees, to cover the actual costs of administrative expenses and billings charged to the residential building own er, manager, or operator by a third-party provider of such services, provided that such charges are agreed to by the residential building owner and the tenant in the rental agreement or lease. The residential building owner may require the tenant to pay a late charge of up to $5 if the tenant fails to make payment when due, which shall not be less than 15 days following the date of mailing or delivery of the bill sent pursuant to this section. The late charge shall be deemed rent (i) as defined in § 55.1-1200 if a ratio utility billing system is used in a residential multifamily dwelling unit subject to this chapter or (ii) as defined in § 55.1-1300 if a ratio utility billing system is used in a manufactured home park subject to the Manufactured Home Lot Rental Act (§ 55.1-1300 et seq.). E. Energy allo cation equipment shall be tested periodically by the owner, manager, or operator of the residential building. Upon the request by a tenant, the owner shall test the energy allocation equipment without charge. The test conducted without charge to the tena nt shall not be conducted more frequently than once in a 24-month period for the same tenant. The tenant or his designated representative may be present during the testing of the energy allocation equipment. A written report of the results of the test sh all be made to the tenant within 10 working days after the completion of the test. F. The owner o f any residential building shall maintain adequate records regarding energy submetering equipment, energy allocation equipment, water and sewer submetering equipment, or a ratio utility billing system. A tenant may inspect and copy the records for the le ased premises during reasonable business hours at a convenient location within or serving the residential building. The owner of the residential building may impose and collect a reasonable charge for copying documents, reflecting the actual costs of mat erials and labor for copying, prior to providing copies of the records to the tenant. G. Notwithstan ding any enforcement action undertaken by the State Corporation Commission pursuant to its authority under § 56-245.3, tenants and owners shall retain any private right of action resulting from any breach of the rental agreement or lease terms require d by this section or § 56-245.3, if applicable, to the same extent as such actions may be maintained for breach of other terms of the rental agreement or lease under this chapter, if applicable. The use of energy submetering equipment, energy allocati on equipment, water and sewer submetering equipment, or a ratio utility billing system is not within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services under Chapter 56 (§ 3.2-5600 et seq.) of Title 3.2. H. In lieu of increasing the rent, the owner, manager, or operator of a residential building may employ a program that utilizes a mathematical formula for allocating the actual or anticipated local government fees billed to the residential building owner among the ten ants in such residential building if clearly stated in the rental agreement or lease. Permitted allocation methods may include formulas based upon square footage, occupancy, number of bedrooms, or some other specific method agreed to by the residential b uilding owner and the tenant in the rental agreement or lease. Such owner, manager, or operator of a residential building may also charge and collect from each tenant additional service charges, including monthly billing fees, account set-up fees, or acc ount move-out fees, to cover the actual costs of administrative expenses for administration of such a program. If the building is residential and is subject to (i) this chapter, such local government fees and administrative expenses shall be deemed to be rent as defined in § 55.1-1200 or (ii) the Manufactured Home Lot Rental Act (§ 55.1-1300 et seq.), such local government fees and administrative expenses shall be deemed to be rent as defined in § 55.1-1300. I. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an owner, manager, or operator of a residential building from including water, sewer, electrical, natural gas, oil, or other utilities in the amount of rent as specified in the rental agreement or lease.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Failure to comply with move-in inspection requirement.  Although failing to comply with § 55-248.11:1 requiring a move-in inspection may significantly limit the landlords claim for damages, this restriction is n ot itself without limitation. Common sense dictates that the absence of a move-in inspection does not empower a tenant with an unfettered and unchecked ability to exert willful, and perhaps cataclysmic, damage on a residence during the duration of the te nancy. Copperpen, LC v. Gioscio, 99 Va. Cir. 286, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 312 (Clarke County June 29, 2018). Landlords violation of the statutory requirement for a move-in inspection should act as a de facto presumption to bar a landlords recovery where there is a dispute or conflict in the evidence of damages on which reasonable persons could differ because of the absence of the probative benchmark the move-in inspection would have established. Conversely, if there is no conflict, dispute or question that the t enant caused damage during the relevant period then a landlords recovery for those damages should not be barred despite the landlords failure to comply with § 55-248.11:1.Copperpen, LC v. Gioscio, 99 Va. Cir. 286, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 312 (Clar ke County June 29, 2018). Failure to provide move-in inspection did not automatically preclude recovery.  Failure of landlord to meet his statutory obligation under § 55-248.11:1 for a move-in inspection did not automatically preclude any and all recovery by the la ndlord for damages during the tenancy. There was conflict and questions about whether the damage was due to issues that were the responsibility of the landlord or tenants. Copperpen, LC v. Gioscio, 99 Va. Cir. 286, 2018 Va. Cir.

Landlord and Tenant, § 37. CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Tenant may not recover damages for personal injuries resulting fr om a landlords violation.  In a negligence action, a tenant could not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlords alleged noncompliance with duties imposed by § 55-248.13 of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, because the Act does not, either through the express language of §§ 55-248.40, 55-248.21, and 55-248.4 or by necessary implication, abrogate the common-law rule that a landlord was not liable in tort for a tenants personal injuries caused by the landlords failure to repair premises under the tenants control and possession. Sections 55-248.3:1, 55-248.4, 55-248.21, and 55-248.40 revealed that the Act provided a comprehensive scheme governing contractual relationships between landlords and tenants instead of creating a statutory cause of action allowing a tenant to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlords noncompliance with the Act.

Warranty of habita bility.  Where tenants alleged that they developed respiratory ailments and incurred property damage as a result of exposure to toxic mold in their apartment, defendants w ere entitled to summary judgment as to the claim that defendants breached a common-law implied warranty of habitability because it was not cognizable under Virginia law and the tenants failed to assert a separate claim under the Virginia Residential Land lord Tenant Act. Roche v. Lincoln Prop. Co., 175 Fed. Appx. 597, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 8588 (4th Cir. 2006).

Maintenance of premises.  Because a tenant died after falling from a deck with defective railings despite a lease provision that the decedent was to maintain the premises, §§ 55-248. 13 and 55-248.16 required a landlord to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition in compliance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code, § 36-97 et seq.; consequently, the landlord was not entitled to summary judgment in the adminstrators  wrongful death action.

Brown, 79 Va. Cir. 29, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 66 (Newport News Apr. 1, 2 009). Whether door is part of the common area and whether landlord ac ted within a reasonable time period are questions of fact.  Summary judgment motions filed by the landlord and the injured party were denied as: (1) whether the broken door, upon which the injured party fell, was part of t he common area, which the landlord had a duty to maintain under the common law and § 55-248.13, was a question of fact as the door faced the exterior of the building and the porch, for which the landlord would normally be responsible, but also faced t he interior of the apartment demised individually to the tenant, (2) whether the landlord acted to repair the door within a reasonable time period after being informed that it was broken was also a question of fact, and (3) the landlords defenses of assumption of the risk and contributory negligence were neither so unfounded as to be discarded as a matter of law, nor so compelling that no reasonable person could find otherwise.

No landlord may demand or receive a security deposit, however denominated, in an amount or value in excess of two months periodic rent. Upon termination of the tenancy or the date the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, whichever occurs last, such security deposi t, whether it is property or money held by the landlord as security as provided in this section, may be applied by the landlord solely to (i) the payment of accrued rent, including the reasonable charges for late payment of rent specified in the rental a greement; (ii) the payment of the amount of damages that the landlord has suffered by reason of the tenants noncompliance with § 55.1-1227, less reasonable wear and tear; (iii) other damages or charges as provided in the rental agreement; or (iv) actual damages for breach of the rental agreement pursuant to § 55.1-1251. The security deposit and any deductions, damages, and charges shall be itemized by the landlord in a written notice given to the tenant, together with any amount due to the ten ant, within 45 days after the termination date of the tenancy or the date the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, whichever occurs last. As of the date of the termination of the tenancy or the date the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, whichever occurs las t, the tenant shall be required to deliver possession of the dwelling unit to the landlord. If the termination date is prior to the expiration of the rental agreement or any renewal thereof, or the tenant has not given proper notice of termination of the rental agreement, the tenant shall be liable for actual damages pursuant to § 55.1-1251, in which case, the landlord shall give written notice of security deposit disposition within the 45-day period but may retain any security balance to apply again st any financial obligations of the tenant to the landlord pursuant to this chapter or the rental agreement. If the tenant fails to vacate the dwelling unit as of the termination of the tenancy, the landlord may file an unlawful detainer action pursuant to § 8.01-126. B. Where there is more than one tenant subject to a rental agreement, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by each of the tenants, disposition of the security deposit shall be made with one check being payable to all such tenants and sent to a forwarding address prov ided by one of the tenants. The landlord shall make the security deposit disposition within the 45-day time period required by subsection A, but if no forwarding address is provided to the landlord, the landlord may continue to hold such security deposit in escrow. If a tenant fails to provide a forwarding address to the landlord to enable the landlord to make a refund of the security deposit, upon the expiration of one year from the date of the end of the 45-day time period, the landlord may remit such sum to the State Treasurer as unclaimed property on a form prescribed by the administrator that includes the name; social security number, if known; and last known address of each tenant on the rental agreement. If the landlord or managing agent is a re al estate licensee, compliance with this subsection shall be deemed compliance with § 54.1-2108 and corresponding regulations of the Real Estate Board. C. Nothing in this section shall be construed by a court of law or otherwise as entitling the tenant, upon the termination of the tenancy, to an immediate credit against the tenants delinquent rent account in the amount of the security deposit. The landlord shall apply the security deposit in accordance with this section within the 45-day time period required by subsection A. However, provided that the landlord has given prior written notice in accordance with this section, the landlord may withhold a reasonable portion of the security deposit to cover an amount of the balance due on the water, sewer, or other utility account that is an obligation of the tenant to a third-party provider under the rental agreement for the dwelling unit, and upon payment of such o bligations the landlord shall provide written confirmation to the tenant within 10 days, along with payment to the tenant of any balance otherwise due to the tenant. In order to withhold such funds as part of the disposition of the security deposit, the landlord shall have so advised the tenant of his rights and obligations under this section in (i) a termination notice to the tenant in accordance with this chapter, (ii) a written notice to the tenant confirming the vacating date in accordance with this section, or (iii) a separate written notice to the tenant at least 15 days prior to the disposition of the security deposit. Any written notice to the tenant shall be given in accordance with § 55.1-1202.The tenant may provide the landlord with writt en confirmation of the payment of the final water, sewer, or other utility bill for the dwelling unit, in which case the landlord shall refund the security deposit, unless there are other authorized deductions, within the 45-day period required by subsec tion A. If the tenant provides such written confirmation after the expiration of the 45-day period, the landlord shall refund any remaining balance of the security deposit held to the tenant within 10 days following the receipt of such written confirmati on provided by the tenant. If the landlord otherwise receives confirmation of payment of the final water, sewer, or other utility bill for the dwelling unit, the landlord shall refund the security deposit, unless there are other authorized deductions, wi thin the 45-day period. D. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the landlord from making the disposition of the security deposit prior to the 45-day period required by subsection A and charging an administrative fee to the tenant for such expedited processing, if the rental agreement so provides and the tenant requests expedited processing in a separate written document. E. The landlor d shall notify the tenant in writing of any deductions provided by this section to be made from the tenants security deposit during the course of the tenancy. Such notification shall be made within 30 days of the date of the determination of the dedu ction and shall itemize the reasons in the same manner as provided in subsection F. No such notification shall be required for deductions made less than 30 days prior to the termination of the rental agreement. If the landlord willfully fails to comply w ith this section, the court shall order the return of the security deposit to the tenant, together with actual damages and reasonable attorney fees, unless the tenant owes rent to the landlord, in which case the court shall order an amount equal to the s ecurity deposit credited against the rent due to the landlord. In the event that damages to the premises exceed the amount of the security deposit and require the services of a third-party contractor, the landlord shall give written notice to the tenant advising him of that fact within the 45-day period required by subsection A. If notice is given as prescribed in this subsection, the landlord shall have an additional 15-day period to provide an itemization of the damages and the cost of repair. This se ction shall not preclude the landlord or tenant from recovering other damages to which he may be entitled under this chapter. The holder of the landlords interest in the premises at the time of the termination of the tenancy, regardless of how the in terest is acquired or transferred, is bound by this section and shall be required to return any security deposit received by the original landlord that is duly owed to the tenant, whether or not such security deposit is transferred with the landlords interest by law or equity, regardless of any contractual agreements between the original landlord and his successors in interest. F. The landlor d shall: 1. Maint ain and itemize records for each tenant of all deductions from security deposits provided for under this section that the landlord has made by reason of a tenants noncompliance with § 55.1-1227, or for any other reason set out in this section, dur ing the preceding two years; and 2. Permit a tenant or his authorized agent or attorney to inspect such tenants records of deductions at any time during normal business hours. G. Upon reques t by the landlord to a tenant to vacate, or within five days after receipt of notice by the landlord of the tenants intent to vacate, the landlord shall provide written notice to the tenant of the tenants right to be present at the landlords inspection of the dwelling unit for the purpose of determining the amount of security deposit to be returned. If the tenant desires to be present when the landlord makes the inspection, he shall, in writing, so advise the landlord, who in turn shall noti fy the tenant of the date and time of the inspection, which must be made within 72 hours of delivery of possession. Following the move-out inspection, the landlord shall provide the tenant with a written security deposit disposition statement, including an itemized list of damages. If additional damages are discovered by the landlord after the security deposit disposition has been made, nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the landlord from recovery of such damages against the tenant, provided, however, that the tenant may present into evidence a copy of the move-out report to support the tenants position that such additional damages did not exist at the time of the move-out inspection. H. If the tena nt has any assignee or sublessee, the landlord shall be entitled to hold a security deposit from only one party in compliance with the provisions of this section. I. The landlor d may permit a tenant to provide damage insurance coverage in lieu of the payment of a security deposit. Such damage insurance in lieu of a security deposit shall conform to the following criteria: 1.

Not remove or tamper with a properly functioning carbon monoxide alarm installed by the landlord, including the removal of any working batteries, so as to render the carbon monoxide al arm inoperative.

Use reasonable efforts to maintain the dwelling unit and any other part of the premises that he occupies in such a condition as to prevent accumulation of moisture and the growth of mold and promptly notify the landlord of any moisture accumulation that occurs or of any visible evidence of mold discovered by the tenant; 11. Not paint or disturb painted surfaces or make alterations in the dwelling unit without the prior written approval of the landlord, provided that (i) the dwelling unit was constructe d prior to 1978 and therefore requires the landlord to provide the tenant with lead-based paint disclosures and (ii) the landlord has provided the tenant with such disclosures and the rental agreement provides that the tenant is required to obtain the la ndlords prior written approval before painting, disturbing painted surfaces, or making alterations in the dwelling unit; 12.

Maintenance of premises.  Because a tenant died after falling from a deck with defective railings despite a lease provision that the decedent was to maintain the premises, §§ 55-248. 13 and 55-248.16 required a landlord to keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition in compliance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code, § 36-97 et seq.; consequently, the landlord was not entitled to summary judgment in the adminstrators  wrongful death action. Cromer v. Johnson Vill., L.L.C., 68 Va. Cir. 442, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 195 (Charlottesville Sept. 2, 2005). Defendants did not uphold their obligation to maintain a dwelling unit and to notify plaintiff of pests and other damages, as the property was clean and was prese nted to defendants in good condition when they began living at the property in 2010, and a witness who lived adjacent to the property never testified that she observed mold in the property and she visited it consistently before defendants moved in.

The tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord to enter into the dwelling unit in order to inspect the premises; make necessary or agreed-upon repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements; supply necessary or agreed-upon services; or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, ten ants, workmen, or contractors. 2. If, upon inspection of a dwelling unit during the term of a tenancy, the landlord determines there is a violation by the tenant of § 55.1-1227 or the rental agreement materially aff ecting health and safety that can be remedied by repair, replacement of a damaged item, or cleaning in accordance with § 55.1-1248, the landlord may make such repairs and send the tenant an invoice for payment. If, upon inspection of the dwelling unit during the term of a tenancy, the landlord discovers a violation of the rental agreement, this chapter, or other applicable law, the landlord may send a written notice of termination pursuant to § 55.1-1245. 3. If the rental agreement so provides and if a tenant without reasonable justification declines to permit the landlord or managing agent to exhibit the dwelling unit for sale or lease, t he landlord may recover damages, costs, and reasonable attorney fees against such tenant.As used in this subdivision, reasonable justification includes the tenants reasonable concern for his own health, or the health of any authorized occupan t, during a state of emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to § 44-146.17 in response to a communicable disease of public health threat as defined in § 44-146.16, provided that the tenant has provided written notice to the landlord informing the landlord of such concern. In such circumstances, the tenant shall provide to the landlord or managing agent a video tour of the dwelling unit or other acceptable substitute for exhibiting the dwelling unit for sale or lease. 4. The landlord may enter the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant in case of emergency. The landlord shall not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. Except in case of emergency or if it is impractical to do so, the landlord shall give the tenant notice of his intent to enter and may enter only at reasonable times. Unless impractical to do so, the landlord shall give the tenant at least 72 hours notice of r outine maintenance to be performed that has not been requested by the tenant. If the tenant makes a request for maintenance, the landlord is not required to provide notice to the tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during a state of emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to § 44-146.17 in response to a communicable disease of public health threat as defined in § 44-146.16, the tenant may provide written notice to the landlord requesting that one or more nonemergency property conditions in the dwelling unit not be addressed in the normal course of business of the landlord due to such communicable disease of public health threat. In such case, the tenant shall be deemed to have waived any and all claims and rights under this chapter against the landlord for failure to address such nonemergency property conditions. At any time thereafter, the tenant may consent in writing to the landlord addressing such nonemergency property conditions in the normal course of business of the landlord. In th e case of a tenant who has provided notice that he does not want nonemergency repairs made during the state of emergency due to a communicable disease of public health threat, the landlord may nonetheless enter the dwelling unit to do nonemergency repair s and maintenance with at least seven days written notice to the tenant and at a time consented to by the tenant, no more than once every six months, provided that the employees and agents sent by the landlord are wearing all appropriate and reasonab le personal protective equipment as required by state law. Furthermore, if the landlord is required to conduct maintenance or an inspection pursuant to the agreement for the loan or insurance policy that covers the dwelling unit, the tenant shall allow s uch maintenance or inspection, provided that the employees and agents sent by the landlord are wearing all appropriate personal protective equipment as required by state law. 5. During the pendency of an unlawful detainer filed by the landlord against the tenant, the landlord may request the court to enter an order requiring the tenant to provide the landlord with access to such dwelling unit. B. Upon the so le determination by the landlord of the existence of a nonemergency property condition in the dwelling unit that requires the tenant to temporarily vacate the dwelling unit in order for the landlord to properly remedy such property condition, the landlor d may, upon at least 30 days written notice to the tenant, require the tenant to temporarily vacate the dwelling unit for a period not to exceed 30 days to a comparable dwelling unit, or hotel, as selected by the landlord and at no expense or cost to the tenant. The landlord shall not be required to pay for any other expenses of the tenant that arise after the temporary relocation period. The landlord and tenant may agree for the tenant to temporarily vacate the dwelling unit in less than 30 days. F or purposes of this subsection, nonemergency property condition means (i) a condition in the dwelling unit that, in the determination of the landlord, is necessary for the landlord to remedy in order for the landlord to be in compliance with § 55.1-1220; (ii) the condition does not need to be remedied within a 24-hour period, with any condition that needs to be remedied within 24 hours being defined as an emergency condition; and (iii) the condition can only be effectively remedied by the temporary relocation of the tenant pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.The tenant shall continue to be responsible for payment of rent under the rental agreement during the period of any temporary relocation. The landlord shall pay all cos ts of repairs or remediation required to address the nonemergency property condition. Refusal of the tenant to cooperate with a temporary relocation pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed a breach of the rental agreement, unless the tenant agrees to vacate the unit and terminate the rental agreement within the 30-day notice period. If the landlord properly remedies the nonemergency property condition within the 30-day period, nothing in this section shall be construed to entitle the tenant to termi nate the rental agreement. Further, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the landlord from taking legal action against the tenant for any noncompliance that occurs during the period of any temporary relocation pursuant to this subsection. During the pendency of an unlawful detainer filed by the landlord against the tenant, the landlord may request the court to enter an order requiring the tenant to provide the landlord with access to such dwelling unit. C. The landlor d has no other right to access except by court order or that permitted by §§ 55.1-1248 and 55.1-1249 or if the tenant has abandoned or surrendered the premises. D. The tenant may install within the dwelling unit new security systems that the tenant may believe necessary to ensure his safety, including chain latch devices approved by the landlord and fire detection devices, provided that: 1. Insta llation does no permanent damage to any part of the dwelling unit; 2. A duplicate of all keys and instructions for the operation of all devices are given to the landlord; and 3. Upon termination of the tenancy, the tenant is responsible for payment to the landlord for reasonable costs incurred for the removal of all such devices and repairs to all damaged area s. E. Upon writte n request of a tenant in a dwelling unit, the landlord shall install a carbon monoxide alarm in the tenants dwelling unit within 90 days. The landlord may charge the tenant a reasonable fee to recover the costs of the equipment and labor for such ins tallation. The landlords installation of a carbon monoxide alarm shall be in compliance with the Uniform Statewide Building Code (§ 36-97 et seq.).

CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Tenant may not recover damages for personal injuries resulting fr om a landlords violation.  In a negligence action, a tenant could not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlords alleged noncompliance with duties imposed by § 55-248.13 of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, §§ 55-248.2 through 55-248.40, because the Act does not, either through the express language of §§ 55-248.40, 55-248.21, and 55-248.4 or by necessary implication, abrogate the com mon-law rule that a landlord was not liable in tort for a tenants personal injuries caused by the landlords failure to repair premises under the tenants control and possession. Sections 55-248.3:1, 55-248.4, 55-248.21, and 55-248.40 revealed that the Act provided a comprehensive scheme governing contractual relationships between landlords and tenants instead of creating a statutory cause of action allowing a tenant to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlords nonco mpliance with the Act.

Tenants awarded atttorneys fees where landlord improperly stored personal property.  In an action for damages by tenants against landlords, the trial court erred by not awarding attorneys fees under § 55-248.21, a provision of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, § 55-248.2 et seq., because the evidence was undisputed that the landlords managing agents actions in improperly storing the personal property and ultimately destroying it without giving the required notice were willful violations of the Act, thus requiring an award of attorneys fees for prevailing on that claim.

Landlords insurer had right to proceed against tenants who started a fire.  Landlord waived any rights it had under the lease against its tenants for starting a fire in the leased apartment by returning the tenants security deposit. H owever, the landlord did not waive its negligence claim against the tenants, which arose independently of the lease, and therefore the landlords insurer could proceed in subrogation against the tenants on the negligence claim.

In an actio n for possession based upon nonpayment of rent or in an action for rent by a landlord when the tenant is in possession, the tenant may assert as a defense that there exists upon the leased premises a condition that constitutes, or will constitute, a fire hazard or a serious threat to the life, health, or safety of the occupants of the dwelling unit, including (i) a lack of heat, running water, light, electricity, or adequate sewage disposal facilities; (ii) an infestation of rodents; or (iii) a conditio n that constitutes material noncompliance on the part of the landlord with the rental agreement or provisions of law. The assertion of any defense provided for in this section shall be conditioned upon the following: 1. Prior to the commencement of the action for rent or possession, the landlord or his agent refused or, having a reasonable opportunity to do so, failed to remedy the condition for which he was served a written notice of the condition by the tenant or was notif ied of such condition by a violation or condemnation notice from an appropriate state or local agency. For the purposes of this subsection, what period of time shall be deemed to be unreasonable delay is left to the discretion of the court, except that t here shall be a rebuttable presumption that a period in excess of 30 days from receipt of the notification by the landlord is unreasonable; and 2. The tenant, if in possession, has paid into court the amount of rent found by the court to be due and unpaid, to be held by the court pending the issuance of an order under subsection C. B. It shall be a sufficient answer to such a defense provided for in this section if the landlord establishes that (i) the conditions alleged in the defense do not in fact exist; (ii) such conditions have been removed or remedied; (iii) such conditions have been cause d by the tenant, his guest or invitee, members of the family of such tenant, or a guest or invitee of such family member; or (iv) the tenant has unreasonably refused entry to the landlord to the premises for the purposes of correcting such conditions. C. The court s hall make findings of fact upon any defense raised under this section or the answer to any defense and shall issue any order as may be required, including any one or more of the following: 1. Reduc ing rent in such amount as the court determines to be equitable to represent the existence of any condition set forth in subsection A; 2. Terminating the rental agreement or ordering the surrender of the premises to the landlord; or 3. Referring any matter before the court to the proper state or local agency for investigation and report and granting a continuance of the action or complaint pending receipt of such inv estigation and report. When such a continuance is granted, the tenant shall deposit with the court any rents that will become due during the period of continuance, to be held by the court pending its further order, or, in its discretion, the court may us e such funds to (i) pay a mortgage on the property in order to stay a foreclosure, (ii) pay a creditor to prevent or satisfy a bill to enforce a mechanics or materialmans lien, or (iii) remedy any condition set forth in subsection A that is found by the court to exist. D. If it appea rs that the tenant has raised a defense under this section in bad faith or has caused the violation or has unreasonably refused entry to the landlord for the purpose of correcting the condition giving rise to the violation, the court may impose upon the tenant the reasonable costs of the landlord, including court costs, the costs of repair where the court finds the tenant has caused the violation, and reasonable attorney fees. E. If the cour t finds that the tenant has successfully raised a defense under this section and enters judgment for the tenant, the court, in its discretion, may impose upon the landlord the reasonable costs of the tenant, including court costs, and reasonable attorney fees.

The tenant may assert that there exists upon the leased premises a condition that constitutes a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or with provisions of law or that, if not promptly corrected, will constitute a fire hazard or serious t hreat to the life, health, or safety of occupants of the premises, including (i) a lack of heat or hot or cold running water, except where the tenant is responsible for payment of the utility charge and where the lack of such heat or hot or cold running water is the direct result of the tenants failure to pay the utility charge; (ii) a lack of light, electricity, or adequate sewage disposal facilities; (iii) an infestation of rodents; or (iv) the existence of paint containing lead pigment on surface s within the dwelling, provided that the landlord has notice of such paint. The tenant may file such an assertion in a general district court in which the premises is located by a declaration setting forth such assertion and asking for one or more forms of relief as provided for in subsection D. B. Prior to th e granting of any relief, the tenant shall show to the satisfaction of the court that: 1. Prior to the commencement of the action, the landlord or his agent refused or, having a reasonable opportunity to do so, failed to remedy the condition for which he was served a written notice of the condition by the tenant or was notified of such condition b y a violation or condemnation notice from an appropriate state or local agency. For the purposes of this subsection, what period of time shall be deemed to be unreasonable delay is left to the discretion of the court, except that there shall be a rebutta ble presumption that a period in excess of 30 days from receipt of the notification by the landlord is unreasonable; and 2. The tenant has paid into court the amount of rent called for under the rental agreement, within five days of the date due under the rental agreement, unless or until such amount is mod ified by subsequent order of the court under this chapter.

Ordering that the escrow be continued until the conditions causing the complaint are remedied; 4. Ordering that the amount of rent, whether paid into the escrow account or paid to the landlord, be abated as determined by the court in such an amount as may be equitable to represent the existence of any condition found by the court to exist. In all cases where the court deems that the tenant is entitled to relief under this chapter, the burden shall be upon the landlord to show cause why there should not be an abatement of rent; 5. Ordering any amount of moneys accumulated in escrow disbursed to the tenant where the landlord refuses to make repairs after a reasonable time or to the landlord or to a contractor cho sen by the landlord in order to make repairs or to otherwise remedy the condition. In either case, the court shall in its order insure that moneys thus disbursed will be in fact used for the purpose of making repairs or effecting a remedy; 6.

The court, on motion of either party or on its own motion, may hold hearings subsequent to the initial proceeding in order to further determine the rights and obligations of the parties. Distribution of escrow moneys may only occur by order of the court after a hearing of which both parties are given notice as required by law or upon motion of both the landlord and tenant or upon certification by the appropriate inspector that the work required by the court to be done has been satisfactorily completed.

Effective date. This section is effective October 1, 2019. § 55.1-1244.1. Tenants remedy by repair. Text A. For purpose s of this section, actual costs means (i) the amount paid on an invoice to a third-party licensed contractor or a licensed pesticide business by a tenant, local government, or nonprofit entity or (ii) the amount donated by a third-party contracto r or pesticide business as reflected on such contractors or pesticide businesss invoice. B. If (i) ther e exists in the dwelling unit a condition that constitutes a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or with provisions of law or that, if not promptly corrected, will constitute a fire hazard or serious threat to the life, healt h, or safety of occupants of the premises, including an infestation of rodents or a lack of heat, hot or cold running water, light, electricity, or adequate sewage disposal facilities, and (ii) the tenant has notified the landlord of the condition in wri ting, the landlord shall take reasonable steps to make the repair or to remedy such condition within 14 days of receiving notice from the tenant. C. If the land lord does not take reasonable steps to repair or remedy the offending condition within 14 days of receiving a tenants notice pursuant to subsection B, the tenant may contract with a third-party contractor licensed by the Board for Contractors or, in the case of a rodent infestation, a pesticide business employing commercial applicators or registered technicians who are licensed, certified, and registered with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services pursuant to Chapter 39 (§ 3.2-3900 e t seq.) of Title 3.2, to repair or remedy the condition specified in the notice. A tenant who contracts with a third-party licensed contractor or pesticide business is entitled to recover the actual costs incurred for the work performed, not exceeding th e greater of one months rent or $1,500. Unless the tenant has been reimbursed by the landlord, the tenant may deduct the actual costs incurred for the work performed pursuant to the contract with the third-party contractor or pesticide business after submitting to the landlord an itemized statement accompanied by receipts for purchased items and third-party contractor or pest control services. D. A local gov ernment or nonprofit entity may procure the services of a third-party licensed contractor or pesticide business on behalf of the tenant pursuant to subsection B. Such assistance shall have no effect on the tenants entitlement under this section to be reimbursed by the landlord or to make a deduction from the periodic rent. E.

Except as o therwise provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or a violation of § 55.1-1227 materially affecting health and safety, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in 21 days and that the rental agreement shall terminate as provid ed in the notice. B. If the brea ch is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise and the tenant adequately remedies the breach prior to the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement shall not terminate. C. If the tena nt commits a breach that is not remediable, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after recei pt of the notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, when a breach of the tenants obligations under this chapter or the rental agreement involves or constitutes a criminal or a willful act that is not remediable and that poses a threat to heal th or safety, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement immediately and proceed to obtain possession of the premises. For purposes of this subsection, any illegal drug activity involving a controlled substance, as used or defined by the Drug Contro l Act (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.), or any activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety, by the tenant, an authorized occupant, or a guest or invitee of the tenant shall constitute an immediate nonremediable violation for which the landlord may proceed to terminate the tenancy without the necessity of waiting for a conviction of any criminal offense that may arise out of the same actions. In order to obtain an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating the tenancy for illegal drug activity or for any other activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety, the landlord shall prove any such violations by a preponderance of the evidence. However, where the illegal drug activity or any activity that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act that also poses a threat to health and safety is engaged in by an authorized occupant or a guest or invitee of the tenant, the tenant shall be presumed to have knowledge of such activities unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The initial hearing on the landlords action for immediate possession of the premises shall be held wi thin 15 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant; however, the court shall order an earlier hearing when emergency conditions are alleged to exist upon the premises that constitute an immediate threat to the health or safety of the other tena nts. After the initial hearing, if the matter is scheduled for a subsequent hearing or for a contested trial, the court, to the extent practicable, shall order that the matter be given priority on the courts docket. Such subsequent hearing or contest ed trial shall be heard no later than 30 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant. During the interim period between the date of the initial hearing and the date of any subsequent hearing or contested trial, the court may afford any further r emedy or relief as is necessary to protect the interests of parties to the proceeding or the interests of any other tenant residing on the premises. Failure by the court to hold either of the hearings within the time limits set out in this section shall not be a basis for dismissal of the case. D. If the tena nt is a victim of family abuse as defined in § 16.1-228 that occurred in the dwelling unit or on the premises and the perpetrator is barred from the dwelling unit pursuant to § 55.1-1246 on the basis of information provided by the tenant to the lan dlord, or by a protective order from a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to § 16.1-253.1 or 16.1-279.1 or subsection B of § 20-103, the lease shall not terminate solely due to an act of family abuse against the tenant. However, these provisi ons shall not be applicable if (i) the tenant fails to provide written documentation corroborating the tenants status as a victim of family abuse and the exclusion from the dwelling unit of the perpetrator no later than 21 days from the alleged offen se or (ii) the perpetrator returns to the dwelling unit or the premises, in violation of a bar notice, and the tenant fails to promptly notify the landlord within 24 hours that the perpetrator has returned to the dwelling unit or the premises, unless the tenant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant had no actual knowledge that the perpetrator violated the bar notice, or it was not possible for the tenant to notify the landlord within 24 hours, in which case the tenant shall promptly notify the landlord, but in no event later than seven days. If the provisions of this subsection are not applicable, the tenant shall remain responsible for the acts of the other co-tenants, authorized occupants, or guests or invitees pursuant to § 55 .1-1227 and is subject to termination of the tenancy pursuant to the lease and this chapter. E. If the tena nt has been served with a prior written notice that required the tenant to remedy a breach, and the tenant remedied such breach, where the tenant intentionally commits a subsequent breach of a like nature as the prior breach, the landlord may serve a wri tten notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the subsequent breach, make reference to the prior breach of a like nature, and state that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice. F. If rent is unpaid when due, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment, and of the landlords intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within the five- day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55.1-1251. If a check for rent is delivered to the landlord drawn on an account with insufficient funds, or if an electronic funds transfer has been rejected because of insufficient funds or a stop-payment order has been placed in bad faith by the authorizing party, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment and of the landlords intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid by cash, cashiers check, certified check, or a completed electronic funds transfer within the five-day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55.1-1251. Nothing shall be construed to prevent a landlord from seeking an award of costs or attorney fees under § 8.01-27.1 or civil recovery under § 8.01-27.2, as a part of other damages requested on the unlawful detainer filed pursuant to § 8.01-126, provided that the landlord has given notice in accordance with § 55.1-1202, which notice may be included in the five-day termination notice provided in acc ordance with this section. G. Except as o therwise provided in this chapter, the landlord may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for any noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or § 55.1-1227. In the event of a breach of the rental agreement or noncompliance by the ten ant, the landlord shall be entitled to recover from the tenant the following, regardless of whether a lawsuit is filed or an order is obtained from a court: (i) rent due and owing as contracted for in the rental agreement, (ii) other charges and fees as contracted for in the rental agreement, (iii) late charges contracted for in the rental agreement, (iv) reasonable attorney fees as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law, (v) costs of the proceeding as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law only if court action has been filed, and (vi) damages to the dwelling unit or premises as contracted for in the rental agreement. H.

No landlord may accept full payment of rent, as well as any damages, money judgment, award of attorney fees, and court costs, and receive an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to an unlawful detainer action filed under Article 13 ( § 8.01-124 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01 and proceed with eviction under § 55.1-1245, unless there are bases for the entry of an order of possession other than nonpayment of rent stated in the unlawful detainer action filed by the landlord. H owever, a landlord may accept partial payment of rent and other amounts owed by the tenant to the landlord and receive an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to an unlawful detainer action filed under Article 13 (§ 8.01 -124 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01 and proceed with eviction for nonpayment of rent under § 55.1-1245, provided that the landlord has stated in a written notice to the tenant that any and all amounts owed to the landlord by the tenant, including payment of any rent, damages, money judgment, award of attorney fees, and court costs, would be accepted with reservation and would not constitute a waiver of the landlords right to evict the tenant from the dwelling unit. Such notice may be include d in a written termination notice given by the landlord to the tenant in accordance with § 55.1-1245, and if so included, nothing herein shall be construed by a court of law or otherwise as requiring such landlord to give the tenant subsequent written notice. Such notice shall include the following language: Any partial payment of rent made before or after a judgment of possession is ordered will not prevent your landlord from taking action to evict you. However, full payment of all amounts you o we the landlord, including all rent as contracted for in the rental agreement that is owed to the landlord as of the date payment is made, as well as any damages, money judgment, award of attorney fees, and court costs made at least 48 hours before the s cheduled eviction will cause the eviction to be canceled, unless there are bases for the entry of an order of possession other than nonpayment of rent stated in the unlawful detainer action filed by the landlord. If the landlord elects to seek posses sion of the dwelling unit pursuant to § 8.01-126, the landlord shall provide a copy of this notice to the court for service to the tenant, along with the summons for unlawful detainer. If the dwelling unit is a public housing unit or other housing uni t subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, nothing in this section shall be construed to require that written notice be given to any public agency paying a portion of the rent under the rental agreement. If a landlor d enters into a new written rental agreement with the tenant prior to eviction, an order of possession obtained prior to the entry of such new rental agreement is not enforceable. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a landlord with four or fewer rental dwelling units, or up to a 10 percent interest in four or fewer rental dwelling units, may limit a tenants use of the right of redemption to once per lease period, provided that the landlord provides written notice of such limitation to the tenant. B. The tenant may pay or present to the court a redemption tender for payment of all rent due and owing as of the return date, including late charges, attorney fees, and court costs, at or before the first return date on an action for unlawful detainer.If the tenant p resents a redemption tender to the court at the return date, the court shall continue the action for unlawful detainer for 10 days following the return date for payment to the landlord of all rent due and owing as of the return date, including late charg es, attorney fees, and court costs, and dismiss the action upon such payment. Should the landlord not receive full payment of all rent due and owing as of the return date, including late charges, attorney fees, and court costs, within 10 days of the retu rn date, the court shall, without further evidence, grant to the landlord judgment for all amounts due and immediate possession of the premises. For purposes of this section, redemption tender means a written commitment to pay all rent due and ow ing as of the return date, including late charges, attorney fees, and court costs, by a local government or nonprofit entity within 10 days of such return date. C. In cases of unlawful detainer, a tenant, or any third party on behalf of a tenant, may pay the landlord or the landlords attorney or pay into court all (i) rent due and owing as of the court date as contracted for in the rental agreement, (ii) other charges and fees as contracted for in the rental agreement, (iii) late charges contracted for in the rental agreement and as provided by law, (iv) reasonable attorney fees as contracted for in the rental agreement and as provided by law, and (v) costs of the procee ding as provided by law, at which time the unlawful detainer proceeding shall be dismissed, unless there are bases for the entry of an order of possession other than nonpayment of rent stated in the unlawful detainer action filed by the landlord. D. If such pay ment has not been made as of the return date for the unlawful detainer, the tenant, or any third party on behalf of the tenant, may pay to the landlord, the landlords attorney, or the court all amounts claimed on the summons in unlawful detainer, inc luding current rent, damages, late charges, costs of court, any civil recovery, attorney fees, and sheriff fees, including the sheriff fees for service of the writ of eviction if payment is made after issuance of the writ, no less than 48 hours before th e date and time scheduled by the officer to whom the writ of eviction has been delivered to be executed. Upon receipt of such payment, the landlord, or the landlords attorney or managing agent, shall promptly notify the officer to whom the writ of ev iction has been delivered to be executed that the execution of the writ of eviction shall be canceled.

Except as p rovided in this section or as otherwise provided by law, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession or by causing a termination of the rental agreement pursuant t o § 55.1-1253 or 55.1-1410 after he has knowledge that (i) the tenant has complained to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for enforcement of a building or housing code of a violation applicable to the premises materially affecting heal th or safety, (ii) the tenant has made a complaint to or filed an action against the landlord for a violation of any provision of this chapter, (iii) the tenant has organized or become a member of a tenants organization, or (iv) the tenant has testif ied in a court proceeding against the landlord. However, the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to prevent the landlord from increasing rent to that which is charged for similar market rentals nor decreasing services that apply equally to all tenants. B. If the land lord acts in violation of this section, the tenant is entitled to the applicable remedies provided for in this chapter, including recovery of actual damages, and may assert such retaliation as a defense in any action against him for possession. The burde n of proving retaliatory intent shall be on the tenant. C. Notwithstan ding subsections A and B, a landlord may terminate the rental agreement pursuant to § 55.1-1253 or 55.1-1410 and bring an action for possession if: 1. Viola tion of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant, an authorized occupant, or a guest or invitee of the tenant; 2. The tenant is in default in rent; 3. Compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires alteration, remodeling, or demolition that would effectively deprive the tenant of use of the dwelling unit; or 4. The tenant is in default of a provision of the rental agreement materially affecting the health and safety of himself or others. The maintenance of the action provided in this section does not release the landlord from liability under § 55.1-1226. D. The landlor d may also terminate the rental agreement pursuant to § 55.1-1253 or 55.1-1410 for any other reason not prohibited by law unless the court finds that the reason for the termination was retaliation.

Available remedies.  This section discloses a legislative intent to provide contract remedies, not a recovery in tort, because: (1) the assignment to the court of the factual determin ation of whether a landlord is responsible for an act or omission prohibited by the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, §§ 55-248.2 through 55-248.40, is entirely appropriate in an equitable claim, but at odds with the role of the court v is-`-vis the jury in an action at law for damages, such as an action for personal injury; (2) to allow the question of whether a tenant may recover damages for personal injuries to turn on the courts discretion would be inconsistent with the recogniz ed principle of tort law that a plaintiff is entitled to compensation sufficient to make him whole; and (3) the provision allowing a court to enjoin a landlord from continuing an act or omission prohibited by the Act and to award damages in its discretio n conforms to the longstanding authority of chancery courts to award damages incident to an award of equitable relief. Isbell v. Commercial Inv. Assocs., 273 Va. 605, 644 S.E.2d 72, 2007 Va. LEXIS 52 (2007). Tenant may not recover damages for personal injuries resulting fr om a landlords violation.  In a negligence action, a tenant could not recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlords alleged noncompliance with duties imposed by § 55-248.13 of the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, §§ 55-248.2 through 55-248.40, because the Act does not, either through the express language of §§ 55-248.40, 55-248.21, and 55-248.4 or by necessary implication, abrogate the com mon-law rule that a landlord was not liable in tort for a tenants personal injuries caused by the landlords failure to repair premises under the tenants control and possession. Sections 55-248.3:1, 55-248.4, 55-248.21, and 55-248.40 revealed that the Act provided a comprehensive scheme governing contractual relationships between landlords and tenants instead of creating a statutory cause of action allowing a tenant to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from a landlords nonco mpliance with the Act.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. The Virginia Fair Housing Law (§ 36-96.1 et seq.) and the Mobile (now Manufactured) Home Lot Rental Act (§ 55-248.41 et seq.) complement each other and are in no way conflicting. Hudler v. Cole, 236 Va. 389, 374 S.E.2d 39, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1002, 1988 Va. LEXIS 160 (1988). The Virginia Fair Housing Law forbids a wide variety of discriminatory practices which impede sale or rental of dwellings to initial prospective purchaser s or tenants; anti-discrimination provisions contained in the Mobile (now Manufactured) Home Lot Rental Act address a different situation, namely, an existing tenant in a mobile home park who wishes to sell to a third person the mobile home he ow ns and occupies. Hudler v. Cole, 236 Va. 389, 374 S.E.2d 39, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1002, 1988 Va. LEXIS 160 (1988). Applicability of Virginia Fair Housing Law.  The Virginia Fair Housing Law, § 36-96.1 et seq., applies to the rental of space in a mobile home park. Hudler v. Cole, 236 Va. 389, 374 S.E.2d 39, 5 Va.

Mobile home.  Where the structures at issue were built on chassis so that they could be towed to their points of intended use, they fell within the ambit of the definition of a mobile home under former § 55-248.41. Forster v. Hall, 265 Va. 293, 576 S.E.2d 746, 2003 Va. LEXIS 19 (2003). Landlord may not unreasonably impede sale of mobile home.  The anti-discrimination provisions contained in the Mobile (now Manufactured) Home Lot Rental Act dictate that an existing tenant in a mobile home park wh o wishes to sell his occupied mobile home to a third person may not be unreasonably impeded by the landlord upon whose land the mobile home is intended to remain. Hudler v. Cole, 236 Va. 389, 374 S.E.2d 39, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1002, 1988 Va. LEXIS 160 (1988). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Negligence per se claim.  Denial of a mobile home park landlords demurrer to a former tenants claim for negligence per se was appropriate because the tenants complaint made out a prima facie negligence per se claim based on the landlords alleged violations of the Virginia Manufactured Home Lot Rental Act, Va.

Permitted allocation methods may include formulas ba sed on square footage, occupancy, number of bedrooms, or some other specific method agreed to by the building or campground owner and the tenant in the rental agreement or lease. Water and sewer submetering equipment means equipment used to measure actual water or sewer usage in any nonresidential rental unit, as defined in § 56-245.2, when such equipment is not owned or controlled by the utility or other provider of water or sewer service that provides service to the building in which the nonresidential rental unit is located or campground where the campsite is located. B. Energy subm etering equipment, energy allocation equipment, water and sewer submetering equipment, or a ratio utility billing system may be used in a building or campground if clearly stated in the rental agreement or lease for the leased premises. All energy submet ering equipment and energy allocation equipment shall meet the requirements and standards established and enforced by the State Corporation Commission pursuant to § 56-245.3. C. If energy s ubmetering equipment, water and sewer submetering equipment, or energy allocation equipment is used in any building or campground, the owner, manager, or operator of the building or campground shall bill the tenant for electricity, oil, natural gas, or w ater and sewer for the same billing period as the utility serving the building or campground, unless the rental agreement or lease expressly provides otherwise. The owner, manager, or operator of the building or campground may charge and collect from the tenant additional service charges, including monthly billing fees, account set-up fees, or account move-out fees, to cover the actual costs of administrative expenses and billing charged to the building or campground owner, manager, or operator by a thi rd-party provider of such services, provided that such charges are agreed to by the building or campground owner and the tenant in the rental agreement or lease. The building or campground owner may require the tenant to pay a late charge of up to $5 if the tenant fails to make payment when due, which shall not be less than 15 days following the date of mailing or delivery of the bill sent pursuant to this section. D. If a ratio utility billing system is used in any building or campground, in lieu of increasing the rent, the owner, manager, or operator of the building or campground may employ such a program that utilizes a mathematical formula for allocating, among the tenants i n a building or campground, the actual or anticipated water, sewer, electrical, oil, or natural gas billings billed to the building or campground owner from a third-party provider of the utility service. The owner, manager, or operator of the building or campground may charge and collect from the tenant additional service charges, including monthly billing fees, account set-up fees, or account move-out fees, to cover the actual costs of administrative expenses and billings charged to the building or cam pground owner, manager, or operator by a third-party provider of such services, provided that such charges are agreed to by the building or campground owner and the tenant in the rental agreement or lease. The building or campground owner may require the tenant to pay a late charge of up to $5 if the tenant fails to make payment when due, which shall not be less than 15 days following the date of mailing or delivery of the bill sent pursuant to this section. E. Energy allo cation equipment shall be tested periodically by the owner, manager, or operator of the building or campground. Upon the request by a tenant, the owner shall test the energy allocation equipment without charge. The test conducted without charge to the te nant shall not be conducted more frequently than once in a 24-month period for the same tenant. The tenant or his designated representative may be present during the testing of the energy allocation equipment. A written report of the results of the test shall be made to the tenant within 10 working days after the completion of the test. F. The owner o f any building or campground shall maintain adequate records regarding energy submetering equipment, water and sewer submetering equipment, energy allocation equipment, or a ratio utility billing system. A tenant may inspect and copy the records for the leased premises during reasonable business hours at a convenient location within the building or campground. The owner of the building or campground may impose and collect a reasonable charge for copying documents, reflecting the actual costs of material s and labor for copying, prior to providing copies of the records to the tenant. G. Notwithstan ding any enforcement action undertaken by the State Corporation Commission pursuant to its authority under § 56-245.3, tenants and owners shall retain any private right of action resulting from any breach of the rental agreement or lease terms require d by this section or § 56-245.3, if applicable, to the same extent as such actions may be maintained for breach of other terms of the rental agreement or lease under this chapter, if applicable. The use of energy submetering equipment, water and sewer submetering equipment, energy allocation equipment, or a ratio utility billing system is not within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services under Chapter 56 (§ 3.2-5600 et seq.) of Title 3.2. H. In lieu of increasing the rent, the owner, manager, or operator of a building or campground may employ a program that utilizes a mathematical formula for allocating the actual or anticipated local government fees billed to the building or campground owner among the tenants in such building or campground if clearly stated in the rental agreement or lease for the leased premises. Permitted allocation methods may include formulas based upon square footage, occupancy, number of bedrooms, or some other specific method agreed to by the building or campground owner and the tenant in the rental agreement or lease. Such owner, manager, or operator of a building or campground may also charge and collect from each tenant additional service charges, including monthly billing fees, account set-up fees, or account move-out fees, to cover the actual costs of administrative expenses for administration of such a program. I. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an owner, manager, or operator of a building or campground from including water, sewer, electrical, natural gas, oil, or other utilities in the amount of rent as specified in the rental agreement or lease.

A year-to-y ear tenancy in a nonresidential rental property may be terminated by either party giving three months notice, in writing, prior to the end of any year of the tenancy, of his intention to terminate the same. A month-to-month tenancy may be terminated by either party giving 30 days notice in writing, prior to the next rent due date, of his intention to terminate the same, unless the rental agreement provides for a different notice period. Written notice of termination shall be given in accordance with this chapter or the lease agreement. B.

Changes in use shall include conversion to hotel, motel, apartment hotel, or other commercial use, planned unit development, substantial rehabili tation, demolition, or sale to a contract purchaser requiring an empty building.

Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. When lease or contract governs notice.  By this section, in case of a tenancy from year to year (or from month to month), notice of intention to terminate the tenancy is required, but other tenancies ar e left to be governed in this regard by the lease or contract between the parties, and notice to quit is either required or not required as may be provided for or not provided for in the agreement between the parties. Marks v. Goria Bros., 121 Va. 491, 9 3 S.E. 675, 1917 Va. LEXIS 53 (1917). Lease for fixed term may not require notice from tenant.  This section addresses the necessity and type of notice required to terminate various kinds of tenancies and provides, in part, that notice is not necessary from or to a tenant whose term is to end at a certain time; a one-year, fixed term lease ends at a certain time within the meaning of this section and a tenant may not, therefore, be subject to liability for failing to comply with a lease provision re quiring notice of his intent to vacate the premises at the end of the fixed term. Sweeney v. West Group, Inc., 259 Va. 776, 527 S.E.2d 787, 2000 Va. LEXIS 63 (2000). Where a tenancy from year to year is created by the express terms of a lease or contract , the distinguishing characteristic that it may be terminated by either party upon due notice to the other is never absent. Marks v. Goria Bros., 121 Va. 491, 93 S.E. 675, 1917 Va. LEXIS 53 (1917). Agreements not creating tenancy from year to year.  An agreement for the renewal of a lease provided that the tenant was to get the house at the price stated therein, for one year, after his year expired, and was t o have the preference each succeeding year thereafter. It was held that this did not create a tenancy from year to year so as to entitle the tenant to the legal notice to quit. Crawford v. Morris, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 90, 1848 Va. LEXIS 28 (1848). Agreement held to create the relation of owner and cropper, or employer and employee, so that the employee or cropper was not entitled to the notice specified in this section for terminating a yearly tenancy, before being required to vacate the premises. Clark v. Harry, 182 Va. 410, 29 S.E.2d 231, 1944 Va. LEXIS 190 (1944). Re levance of invalid written lease.  The provisions of a written lease, which was treated as invalid because of the absence of the corporate seal of the lessor, were nevertheless considered in determ ining that the lessors failure to demand rent did not constitute a waiver of the notice requirement of this section. Stores Bldg. Corp. v. Conover, 204 Va. 457, 132 S.E.2d 458, 1963 Va. LEXIS 172 (1963). Holding over after notice.  Where a notice is given by a tenant of an intention to vacate under this section before his lease expires, such notice does not differentiate the case from any ho lding over by a tenant after the expiration of his term, the case being a holding over after the date named in the notice when the premises should have been vacated. Grice v. Todd, 120 Va. 481, 91 S.E. 609, 1917 Va. LEXIS 134 (1917). Involuntary holding over does not create tenancy by implication. Grice v. Todd, 120 Va. 481, 91 S.E. 609, 1917 Va. LEXIS 134 (1917). A tenancy from month to month was held not shown by the evidence, but rather a tenancy a t will which landlord could terminate at pleasure. Shorter v. Shelton, 183 Va. 819, 33 S.E.2d 643, 1945 Va. LEXIS 230 (1945). Protections required for evicting tenants from federally assisted housing.  The substantive right not to be arbitrarily evicted from federally assisted housing on the mere expiration of a lease requires that a tenant be afforded the follo wing protections: (1) timely notice specifying the reasons for the eviction; (2) an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses and present his own evidence; (3) the right to retain an attorney; and (4) the right to an impartial decision based solely on the evidence adduced at the hearing. Anderson v. Denny, 365 F. Supp. 1254, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11806 (W.D. Va. 1973). Tenants residing in federally assisted housing are entitled to a declaratory judgment that they cannot be evicted from their tenancies until they receive notice a lleging good cause and until such allegations are proved in a hearing in the state courts, under the procedural and substantive law of Virginia. Anderson v. Denny, 365 F. Supp. 1254, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11806 (W.D. Va. 1973). Actions of landlord brought within ambit of state action.  State law permits eviction without just cause upon the giving of proper notice but the government involvement of this section and federal statutory assistance pro grams quite clearly brings the actions of the landlord within the ambit of state action. Anderson v. Denny, 365 F. Supp. 1254, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11806 (W.D. Va. 1973). A federal court will not assume that a tenants substantive federal rights will not be protected in the state courts in accordance with Article VI of the United States Constitution. State courts have been and should continue to be the primary forums in which landlord-tenant disputes are resolved. Anderson v. Denny, 365 F. Supp. 1254, 197 3 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11806 (W.D. Va. 1973). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. Virginia does not favor perpetua l leases.  If confronted with the issue, the Supreme Court of Virginia would probably follow the rationale of the federal McLean court and require that there be clear and unequivocal language which indicates the intent to create a perpetual lease. Wintergreen Ptnrs. v. Wintergreen Real Estate Co., 1999 Va. Cir. LEXIS 774 (Nelson County Oct. 22, 1999). Landlords termination of lease that allowed tenant perpetual renewals.  Court (1) decided that landlords nine-month termination notice to tenant was reasonable notice since there was no lease provision that governed the landlord s giving of a notice to terminate, and (2) allowed the landlord to terminate the lease, which provided for automatic 12-month extensions unless the tenant gave 12-month advance notice to terminate. Because the lease did not clearly state that the ten ant could renew it in perpetuity, using words of perpetuity, such as forever, for all time, and in perpetuity and law did not favor perpetual leases, the landlord could terminate the lease upon giving of reasonable notice.

But in case of such destruction there shall be a reasonable reduction of the rent for such time as may elapse until there are again upon the premises buildings of as much value to the tenant for his purposes as what may have been so destroyed, and, in case of such deprivation of possession, a like reduction until possession of the premises is restored to him.

This section is itself exculpatory in nature and does not create or impose an additional liability upon a tenant. Monterey Corp. v. Hart, 216 Va. 843, 224 S.E.2d 142, 1976 Va. LEXIS 214 (1976). A lease agreement which provides for cessation of rent in the event of fire damage unles s the damage is the result of negligence of the tenant or her agents or employees is consistent with this section because each absolves a tenant from responsibility for payment of rent where a leased building is destroyed by fire without fault or neglige nce on the part of the tenant. Monterey Corp. v. Hart, 216 Va. 843, 224 S.E.2d 142, 1976 Va. LEXIS 214 (1976). Intent defines respective obligations.  The language, . . . unless there be other words showing it to be the intent of the parties that he should be so bound, indicates that the court must look to the ultimate intention of the parties in defining their respective obligations and liabilities. Monterey Corp. v. Hart, 216 Va. 843, 224 S.E.2d 142, 1976 Va. LEXIS 214 (1976). Fault, as used in the statute, means the omission of some duty which the tenant ought to perform, and is practically synonymous with negligence. Powell v. John E. Hughes Orphanage, 148 Va. 331, 138 S.E. 637, 1927 Va. LEXIS 234 (1927). And the liability of the tenant depends upon his negligence. Powell v. John E. Hughes Orp hanage, 148 Va. 331, 138 S.E. 637, 1927 Va. LEXIS 234 (1927). It is not sufficient, to entitle the tenant to a reduction in the rent, that the buildings on the leased premises have been destroyed, but it is made a condition to that right that they were destroyed without fault or negligence on his part. Richmond Ice Co. v. Crystal Ice Co., 103 Va. 465, 49 S.E. 650, 1905 Va. LEXIS 14 (1905). This section has been construed to mean that unless there be other words showing it to be the intent of the parties that he should be so bound, negligence must be present on the part of the lessee before any recovery can be had against him for damage to the leased premises at the termination of the lease. Warehouse Distribs., Inc. v. Prudential Storage &amp; Van Corp., 208 Va. 784, 161 S.E.2d 86, 1968 Va. LEX IS 183 (1968). Unless there are other words in the covenant showing the tenant should be so bound, he i s not required to rebuild or pay rent if the buildings are destroyed without his fault or negligence. Vaughan v. Mayo Milling Co., 127 Va. 148, 102 S.E. 597, 1920 Va. LEXIS 41 (1920). This section applies when there is simply a promise to pay the rent on the part of the l essee. Stieffen v. Darling, 158 Va. 375, 163 S.E. 353, 1932 Va. LEXIS 261 (1932). And not when payment or abatement is governed by contract.  This section expressly excepts a case where there are other words in the lease which set out the condition governing the payment or abatement of rent. In such cas e, neither the common law nor the statute has any application, and the subject is governed by the express contract of the parties. Stieffen v. Darling, 158 Va. 375, 163 S.E. 353, 1932 Va. LEXIS 261 (1932). A covenant to leave in good repair is not a covenant to rebuild, under the statute, and he who would hold a tenant to the obligation to rebuild must produce a contract containing other words showing it to be the intent of the parties that he should be so bound. Willis v. Wrenn's Ex'x, 141 Va. 385, 127 S.E. 312, 1925 Va. LEXIS 416 (1 925). A tenant who contracted to repair is not bound to rebuild a parapet, which was not necessary to the preservation or protection of the property, where it fell beca use of hidden structural defects unknown to the tenant. In order to bind the tenant to reconstruct it, his covenant ought to be special and expressed, and so clear as to leave no doubt. Willis v. Wrenn's Ex'x, 141 Va. 385, 127 S.E. 312, 1925 Va. LEXIS 41 6 (1925). Nor to repair where tenant is without fault.  A tenants covenant to leave the premises in good repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, did not bind the lessee to repair or rebuild if he was w ithout fault or negligence. Powell v. John E. Hughes Orphanage, 148 Va. 331, 138 S.E. 637, 1927 Va. LEXIS 234 (1927). A tenant was bound only to pay for necessary and proper repairs, and not to replace or r ebuild, where he contracted to leave the premises in good repair and not to call upon the landlord for any repairs during the lease, and to pay for all necessary and proper repairs. Willis v. Wrenn's Ex'x, 141 Va. 385, 127 S.E. 312, 1925 Va. LEXIS 416 (1 925). Covenant qualified by specifying certain repairs.  A covenant in a lease to keep the building in repair, followed by a clause, separated from it only by a semicolon, that the tenant should replace all glass broken , and repair damages from bursting pipes, applies only to the repairs enumerated, and not to a destruction of the property. Richmond Ice Co. v. Crystal Ice Co., 99 Va. 239, 37 S.E. 851, 1901 Va. LEXIS 34 (1901). Express agreement of parties controls.  The provision in this section relieving a lessee of the duty to repair or rebuild is inapplicable where the parties have expressly agreed that the lessee should r ebuild or renew the heating plant. In this situation, the express agreement of the parties controls. Zimmerman v. Savoy Hotel Corp., 199 Va. 73, 97 S.E.2d 727, 1957 Va. LEXIS 164 (1957). Where the tenant agreed in the lease that it would be responsible for the breakage of all glass in the said premises . . . and to replace the same without del ay, regardless of how the same was broken, this language showed the intention of the parties that the tenant would be bound for these repairs even though the tenant was free of fault or negligence. Warehouse Distribs., Inc. v. Prudential Storage &amp; Va n Corp., 208 Va. 784, 161 S.E.2d 86, 1968 Va. LEXIS 183 (1968). Covenant to repair does not make tenant liable for fire damage.  Where a covenant to repair relates to the right of the lessees to make alterations and changes in the leased property, and to their duty to make needed repairs be cause of alterations, wear, tear and usage, containing no language showing the intent of the parties that the tenant should be personally bound for fire damage, such tenant is not liable for fire damage under this section. Burton v. Chesapeake Box &amp; Lumb er Corp., 190 Va. 755, 57 S.E.2d 904, 1950 Va. LEXIS 166 (1950). The amount which a tenant is entitled to have his rent reduced under this section is the diminished value of the leased premises to the tenant for his purposes, caused by the destruction of buildings on the premises. Richmond Ice Co. v. Crystal Ice Co., 103 Va. 465, 49 S.E. 650, 1905 Va. LEXIS 14 (1905). Landlords du ty to rebuild.  This section does not impose upon the landlord any positive duty to rebuild. National Motels, Inc. v. Howard Johnson, Inc., 373 F.2d 375, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 762 3 (4th Cir. 1967). Averment and proof.  In order to entitle the tenant to a reduction of rent where the buildings on leased premises have been destroyed, it is necessary for the tenant to aver and prove that the buildings were destroyed without fault or negligence on his part. And he must also prove that the value of the leased premises for his purposes has been thereby diminished. Richmond Ice Co. v. Crystal Ice Co., 103 Va. 465, 49 S.E. 650, 1905 Va. LEXIS 14 (1905).

For related discussion, see 5A M.J. Covenants, §§ 3. CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Reentry clause is mere security for rent.  It seems that a clause of reentry for nonpayment of rent is in general considered as a mere security for the rent, and that a forfeiture will not be enforced, alt hough the demand for the rent be made, provided the tenant satisfies the rent due and compensates the landlord for any damages he may have sustained in consequence of the formers default. Johnston v. Hargrove, 81 Va. 118, 1885 Va. LEXIS 16 (1885). This section was not designed to alter the rules of the common law in respect to the for feiture of estates for nonpayment of rent, but to authorize a concise and abbreviated form of leases and other conveyances. Johnston v. Hargrove, 81 Va. 118, 1885 Va. LEXIS 16 (1885). Rule as to necessity for demand is unchanged.  By an ancient rule of the common law, before a lessor can exercise a stipulated right of reentry for breach of covenant to pay rent, he must make an actual demand upon the tenant for the payment thereof, unless by special agreement the requirement of demand has been dispensed with. The rule as respects the necessity for demand remains unaltered in general by this section. Johnston v. Hargrove, 81 Va. 118, 1885 Va . LEXIS 16 (1885). Demand must be made on last day of extended period.  Where the right of reentry is made to depend upon the fact that the rent shall be behind and unpaid for a specified period after the same becomes due, the demand must be made on the last day of the extended time; otherwise the lessor is not entitled to reenter, for every required formality must be strictly observed. Johnston v. Hargrove, 81 Va. 118, 1885 Va. LEXIS 16 (1885). Form of lease.  Fifteen-year lease did not include a seal of any kind, and thus, it failed to satisfy the common-law seal requirement embedded in the definition of deed u nder the Statute of Conveyances, nor did the lease include any specific seal substitutes recognized in § 11-3; because rent was received on a monthly basis, the occupation of the premises and the monthly payment of rent implied a month-to-month tenanc y, which was paid for through the last month of occupancy.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Declaration.  Declaration of protective covenants and restrictions for a subdivision fulfilled the qualifications of a declaration and an architectual control committee fulfilled the qualifications of a property owners association because the declaration expressly imposed upon the committee a duty to maintain a road and authorized it to impose a variable assessment of one-sixth of the cost of such maintenan ce on the owners of each respective lot. Shepherd v. Conde, 293 Va. 274, 797 S.E.2d 750, 2017 Va. LEXIS 56 (2017). Pr operty owners association.  Legislature has amended the code section in two places at the same time with divergent effects; the courts therefore must assume that the General Assembly intende d the elements to be disjunctive in the statutory definition of declaration but conjunctive in the definition of property owners association. Shepherd v. Conde, 293 Va. 274, 797 S.E.2d 750, 2017 Va. LEXIS 56 (2017). Circuit court erred by ruling that amendments to the declaration of protective covenants and restrictions for a subdivision were binding only on some lot owners, to the exclusion of the contestants because the declaration and the identical language in one of the amendments allowed the owners to adopt the amendments by a two-thirds majority vote, and such amendments were binding on all owners; the changes were to the declaration in its entirety. Shepherd v. Conde, 293 Va. 274, 797 S.E.2d 750, 2017 Va. LEXIS 56 (2017). Home owners association did not fulfill either of the requirements to qualify as a property owners association within the meaning of the Virginia Prop erty Owners Association Act because nothing in an amendment to the declaration of protective covenants and restrictions for a subdivision either imposed upon the association a duty to maintain a road or authorized it to impose assessments for the cos ts of such maintenance. Shepherd v. Conde, 293 Va. 274, 797 S.E.2d 750, 2017 Va. LEXIS 56 (2017). Common area.  Demarcation of a road as an easement on the plat incorporated into the declaration of protective covenants and restrictions for a subdivision was sufficient to fu lfill the designation requirement of the definition of common area; property need not be conveyed or leased to a property owners association to qualify as common area so long as the association is required to maintain the property for the use of its members and the property is designated as common area in the declaration.

Authority to make assessments.  Homeowners association could levy assessments against the developer of the real estate subdivision, as a lot owner, for proper expenses for the common area and am enities of the subdivision. However, under the terms of the declaration, the association could not bar the developer from exercising a right to vote granted by the declaration simply by adopting by-laws in conflict with the declaration.

[Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Association not property owners association.  Homeowners association was not a property owners association under the Virginia Property Owners Association Act, §§ 55-508 through 55-517.2, as it could not identify a document recorded in the land records of the jurisdiction where some property of the development was located, expressly requiring the association to maintain the common areas or roads; the duty had to be expressly stated in the re corded documents and could not be inferred or implied. Dogwood Valley Citizens Ass'n v. Winkelman, 267 Va. 7, 590 S.E.2d 358, 2004 Va. LEXIS 4 (2004). By-laws purporting to give a purported homeowners association a duty to maintain the roads and common areas of a development were not a declaration un der the Virginia Property Owners Association Act (POAA), § 55-508 et seq., even though the by-laws were recorded in the land records, as the assumption of the duty was voluntary, and was not required by the declarations in the deeds of dedication of the development; the association was not a property owners association under the POAA. Dogwood Valley Citizens Ass'n v. Shifflett, 275 Va. 197, 654 S.E.2d 894, 2008 Va. LEXIS 2 (2008). As sessment lien had third priority.  Virginia Property Owners Act did not invalidate the authority conferred on a homeowners association by a declaration to levy or enforce maintenance assess ments, but complemented the declaration by providing the mechanism for creating and perfecting such liens; however, the language in the declaration could not supersede established Virginia law as to the perfection and priority of liens.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Editors note.  The opinions cited below refer to prior law. Homeowners association may limit units offered for rent by single owner.  If properly written, adopted and enforced, authorized as to purpose and not in conflict with an associations declarations, bylaws or rules and regulations, a homeowners association may covenant to limit the number of housing units within the association that may be offered for rent by the owner to tenants. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Kathy J. Byron, Member, House of Delegates, 10-078, (01/24/11). No statute prohibits a developer-homebuilder from maintaining majo rity control of a property owners association until construction of community property is completed and transferred to the association. Any recourse that a homeowner may have regarding defective community pr operty, whether in material or workmanship, is a private cause of action.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. No right to rescind based on updates.  Clause (iii) of subsection A permits a real estate purchaser to cancel a contract within three days after receiving a Property Owners Association Act disclosu re packet, or upon notice that a packet will not be available. That same section also permits a purchaser who has received a packet to request an update in clause (iv) of subsection A. However, a plain reading of the statute shows that the purchaser has no direct right under this clause to rescind the contract based on requested updates. Daly v. Gulick Grp., Inc., 99 Va.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. Adequacy of disclosure package.  Buyers did not have the right to terminate their contract with the seller to purchase a home, even if the disclosure packet given to them was inadequate because i t did not contain certain documents. Statutory law gave the buyers three days from the time they received the disclosure packet, be it adequate or inadequate, to terminate the sales agreement, and, thus, their attempt to terminate it four months after re ceipt of the disclosure packet and signing of the sale agreement was invalid since they had not timely attempted to cancel the sales agreement.

Homeowners association may limit units offered for rent by single owner.  If properly written, adopted and enforced, authorized as to purpose and not in conflict with an associations declarations, bylaws or rules and regulations, a homeowners association may covenant to limit the number of housing units within the association that may be offered for rent by the owner to tenants. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Kathy J. Byron, Member, House of Delegates, 10-078, (01/24/11). Developers con trol of homeowners association.  Since the Virginia Property Owners Act does not expressly provide or otherwise allow for a developer to maintain control of a homeowners association for a spe cific period of time or until a specific number of lots or units are sold, there is no Virginia Code provision to evaluate for constitutionality.

The board o f directors shall also have the power, to the extent the declaration or rules and regulations duly adopted pursuant to such declaration expressly so provide, to (i) suspend a members right to use facilities or services, including utility services, pr ovided directly through the association for nonpayment of assessments that are more than 60 days past due, to the extent that access to the lot through the common areas is not precluded and provided that such suspension shall not endanger the health, saf ety, or property of any owner, tenant, or occupant, and (ii) assess charges against any member for any violation of the declaration or rules and regulations for which the member or his family members, tenants, guests, or other invitees are responsible. C.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Member rights.  This act vests in a majority of members, as members of a property owners association, the right to repeal or amend any rule or regulation adopted by the b oard of directors if such rule or regulation has been adopted by the board with respect to use of the common areas. Lake Monticello Owners' Ass'n v. Lake, 250 Va. 565, 463 S.E.2d 652, 1995 Va. LEXIS 125 (1995). Given the language of this section and where association members must submit to these rules, regulations, and binding policies as long as they own homes in the co mmunity, the proposal at issue if enacted by majority vote, would merely impose limitations upon the boards powers authorized by this code section. Lake Monticello Owners' Ass'n v. Lake, 250 Va. 565, 463 S.E.2d 652, 1995 Va. LEXIS 125 (1995). Property owners association lacked authority.  Property owners association boards parking policy was invalid because it effectively, and without authority, divested the unit owners of a property right granted in the declaration of covenants that ran with the land and the boards action exceeded its authority under the Property Owners Association Act. White v. Boundary Ass'n, Inc., 271 Va. 50, 624 S.E.2d 5, 2006 Va. LEXIS 15 (2006). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Real estate developers right to vo te.  Homeowners association could levy assessments against the developer of the real estate subdivision, as a lot owner, for proper expenses for the common area and am enities of the subdivision. However, under the terms of the declaration, the association could not bar the developer from exercising a right to vote granted by the declaration simply by adopting by-laws in conflict with the declaration. New Bethel Estate s, LLC v. Howell, 93 Va. Cir. 86, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 44 (Amherst County Mar. 17, 2016). Penalties reso lution not permitted by declaration.  Homeowners associations enactment of a resolution allowing it to impose fines and penalties for noncompliance with the associations rules could be an ultra vires act because the associations declaration did not expressly allow it to impose fines as required by § 55-513. Farran v. Olde Belhaven Towne Owners Ass'n, 80 Va. Cir. 508, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 92 (Fairfax July 8, 2010). Violations constituted a sin gle violation.  Although a homeowners association asked the court to charge the owner for 41 separate violations, the court found that the various alleged violations amounted to one overriding violation, the failure to comply with the application approved by the association to build her house; therefore, the association was entitled to an assessment against the lot in the amount of $10 to be assessed for a period of 90 days, for a total of $900, for the owners continuing failure to comply with the approved application. Lee's Crossing Homeowners' Ass'n v. Zinone, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 206 (Loudoun County Sept. 13, 2011). Standing.  Homeowners association member had standing to sue a neighbor and the neighbors agent for common area damage because (1) an applicable declaration did not bar standing, (2) another applicable declaration allowed standing, and (3) subsection A of § 55-515 and this section gave the homeowners association no exclusive authority to sue, as the legislature gave a condominium owners association such a uthority but did not do so in the Virginia Property Owners Association Act, so the member had standing in a proper case, and this was such a case, since the homeowners association was not statutorily or contractually obligated to act. Bro oks v. Stallings, 92 Va. Cir. 39, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 207 (Augusta County Mar. 3, 2015). Injunction denied.  Injunction, for purposes of § § 55.1-1819, 55.1-1828, was not warranted; although homeowners had a strong interest in protecting their property rights, ther e were adequate alternative remedies available and no indication that the homeowners association had or would seek to enforce the holiday policies previously deemed unenforceable. Belmont Glen Homeowners Assoc. v. Sainani, 107 Va. Cir. 61, 2021 Va. C ir. LEXIS 22 (Loudoun County Feb. 10, 2021). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Editors note.  The opinions cited below refer to prior law. Homeowners association may limit units offered for rent by single owner.  If properly written, adopted and enforced, authorized as to purpose and not in conflict with an associations declarations, bylaws or rules and regulations, a homeowners association may covenant to limit the number of housing units within the association that may be offered for rent by the owner to tenants.

B. No associat ion shall prohibit an owner from installing a solar energy collection device on that owners property unless the recorded declaration for the association establishes such a prohibition. However, an association may establish reasonable restrictions con cerning the size, place, and manner of placement of such solar energy collection devices on property designated and intended for individual ownership and use. Any disclosure packet pursuant to § 55.1-1809 given to a purchaser shall contain a statement setting forth any restriction, limitation, or prohibition on the right of an owner to install or use solar energy collection devices on his property. C. A restricti on shall be deemed not to be reasonable if application of the restriction to a particular proposal (i) increases the cost of installation of the solar energy collection device by five percent over the projected cost of the initially proposed installation or (ii) reduces the energy production by the solar energy collection device by 10 percent below the projected energy production of the initially proposed installation. The owner shall provide documentation prepared by an independent solar panel design s pecialist, who is certified by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners and is licensed in Virginia, that is satisfactory to the association to show that the restriction is not reasonable according to the criteria established in this su bsection.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. The homeowners association had the authority to assess both of debtors lots sinc e the declarations initially agreed upon stated that their purpose, among other things, was to require that each lot on the plat of the subdivision share equally in the annual assessments. In re McConnell, 198 Bankr. 181, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 887 (Bankr. E. D. Va. 1996). Lack of authorit y to assess.  Bankruptcy plan that was proposed by a homeowners association that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy could not be confirmed under 11 U.S.C.S. § 1129 because, inter alia, it was not feasible and was not proposed in good faith; although the homeowners association imposed a special assessment on its members to pay the costs of defending a lawsuit that was filed by three members who challenged a parking polic y the homeowners association adopted, the special assessment was not authorized under the homeowners associations Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions and exceeded the homeowners associations authority under § 55-5 14. In re Manchester Oaks Homeowners Ass'n, No. 11-10179-BFK, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 951 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Mar. 12, 2014). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Authority of receiver.  Where the original de facto officers of the homeowners association, the developers, were removed for improprieties, the receiver appointed by a court acted wi thin its powers in imposing increased assessments on the property owners; the property owners could not raise an affirmative defense of statutory recoupment in response to that assessment. Lake Holiday Country Club, Inc. v. Teets, 56 Va. Cir. 113, 2001 V a. Cir. LEXIS 447 (Frederick County Apr. 5, 2001). Lack of authority to assess.  Where a subdivision declaration provided that road assessments could only be made against lots that abutted private roads, the homeowners association lacked a uthority under subsection A of § 55-514 to make special road assessments against all of the lots in the subdivision. Davis v. Wyckland Homes Ass'n, 61 Va. Cir. 432, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 56 (Fairfax County Apr. 8, 2003). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Editors note.  The opinion cited below refers to prior law. Enforcement through de activation of bar codes.  Property owners association resolution to deactivate a members barcode decal if he or she is more than sixty days late paying a special assessment, may no t legally be applied against the owner if doing so would deny the owner direct access to his or her property through the roads of the development, which are common areas.

[Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. At torney fees for prevailing party.  Based on the appellate courts conclusion that the associations board exceeded its authority in adopting the parking policy, the circuit courts award o f attorneys fees and costs to the board as the prevailing party was erroneous. The unit owners were the prevailing parties under that statute and, as such, were entitled to recover the reasonable attorneys fees and costs expended in prosecuting t heir claims. White v. Boundary Ass'n, Inc., 271 Va. 50, 624 S.E.2d 5, 2006 Va. LEXIS 15 (2006). Trial courts award of attorneys fees to the unit owners, who were the prevailing party in an action to enforce the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, a nd Restrictions, was permitted for those fees related to the breach of contract claim. Manchester Oaks Homeowners Ass'n v. Batt, 284 Va. 409, 732 S.E.2d 690, 2012 Va. LEXIS 161 (2012). Property owners associations annual assessment that included a fee for inspecting each property owners lot to ensure that it complied with the associa tions rules violated Va. Code Ann. § 55.1-1805, because the assessment for lot-compliance inspection fees was not expressly authorized by the associations declaration and the fees were not for services relating to the common area.  As prevailing parties, the homeowners were entitled under Va. Code Ann. § 55.1-1828 to their reasonable attorney fees and costs for litigating these issues in the circuit court, on appeal, and on remand. Burkholder v. Palisades Park Owners Ass'n, 76 Va. App. 577, 882 S.E.2d 906, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2023). Reasonable fees.  Decision the Virginia Supreme Court issued under § 55-515 established a basis for awarding reasonable attorneys fees under § 55-79.53 to an LLC that suc cessfully objected to a claim a condominium owners association filed against the LLCs Chapter 11 bankruptcy estate; however, evidence the LLC presented did not show that its request for reimbursement of $198,950 in fees was reasonable, and the co urt approved reimbursement only in the amount of $59,850 and disallowed reimbursement of an additional $82,960 in fees the LLC incurred in reaching a settlement with the association because the settlement was not approved by the court. Gordon Props., LLC v. First Owners' Assoc. of Fourty Six Hundred Condo. (In re Gordon Props., LLC), No. 09-18086-RGM (), No. 2, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 4034 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Sept. 26, 2013). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Homeowners could not assert a cause of action against a homeowners association board because the board was not a lot owner or one entitled to occupy a lot. Bennett v. Loudoun Valley Home Owners' Ass'n, 73 Va. Cir. 466, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 220 (Loudoun County July 30, 2007). Restrictive covenants satisfied.  In a case governed by § 55-515, a homeowners associations action seeking the removal of a fence and a hot tub failed as a developer granted the lot purchas ers permission to install the hot tub and fence, and the developer had the authority under the declarations to make changes permitting the fence and hot tub. Parkway Place Homeowners Ass'n v. Hovis, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 137 (Roanoke County Sept. 26, 2007) . Sufficiency of pleadings.  Homeowners pleadings relating to a homeowners association boards unlawful grant of neighbors variance request were insufficient to survive demurre r because review to that decision was limited by the business judgment rule; pleadings were sufficient to survive demurrer where they suggested ultra vires acts through the use of procedural defaults. Bennett v. Loudoun Valley Home Owners' Ass'n, 73 Va. Cir. 466, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 220 (Loudoun County July 30, 2007). Standing.  Homeowners association member had standing to sue a neighbor and the neighbors agent for common area damage because (1) an applicable declaration did not bar standing, (2) another applicable declaration allowed standing, and (3) subsection A of this section and § 55-513 gave the homeowners association no exclusive authority to sue, as the legislature gave a condominium owners association such a uthority but did not do so in the Virginia Property Owners Association Act, so the member had standing in a proper case, and this was such a case, since the homeowners association was not statutorily or contractually obligated to act. Bro oks v. Stallings, 92 Va. Cir. 39, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 207 (Augusta County Mar. 3, 2015). Injunction denied.  Injunction, for purposes of § § 55.1-1819, 55.1-1828, was not warranted; although homeowners had a strong interest in protecting their property rights, ther e were adequate alternative remedies available and no indication that the homeowners association had or would seek to enforce the holiday policies previously deemed unenforceable. Belmont Glen Homeowners Assoc. v. Sainani, 107 Va. Cir. 61, 2021 Va. C ir. LEXIS 22 (Loudoun County Feb. 10, 2021). Attorney fees.  When a property owner filed three actions against a property owners association, two of which were dismissed, the association could not, in the third action, recover attorneys fees against the owner as the prevailing party in the first two cases, under § 55-515 of the Virginia Property Owners Association Act, § 55-508 et seq., because it did not seek such relief in those cases and, under Va. Sup . Ct. R. 1:1, the trial court lost jurisdiction to award it 21 days after entering a final order dismissing the cases, as it did not retain jurisdiction to award attorneys fees at a later time, so the property owner was entitled to summary judgment a s to the associations request for fees in the prior cases. Rebarick v. Georgetown Woods Owners Ass'n, 62 Va. Cir. 155, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 96 (Fairfax County June 11, 2003). Where there was a lack of actual controversy, rendering the action moot, and as no judgment could have been awarded, there could have been no prevailing party und er the Virginia Supreme Courts definition for an award of attorneys fees and costs; therefore, the matter had to be dismissed. Rose Hall HOA, Inc. v. Jelinek, 66 Va. Cir. 172, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 311 (Fairfax County Oct. 28, 2004). Homeowners association was entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees under § 55-515 in its action to recover past due homeowners association fees incur red after the homeowner filed for bankruptcy relief. Brambleton Cmty. Ass'n v. Than, 79 Va. Cir. 393, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 118 (Fairfax County Oct. 14, 2009). Declarations governing the owners association and its members and this statute required the court to award plaintiff its reasonable attorney fees and costs as the time and effort expended by plaintiffs attorneys was substantial given the history of the case; the nature and complexity of the services exceeded that of a standard breach of contract case; plaintiffs attorneys obtained the result plaintiff sought; and plaintiffs claimed fees were reasonable. Winding Brook Owner's Ass'n v. Thomlyn, LLC, 96 Va. Cir. 173, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 125 (Hanover County July 26, 2017). Recovery of attorney fees.  Individual homeowners claims against a homeowners association for raiding the associations capital reserves to pay its attorneys fees, in violatio n of § 55-514.1, was, if proven, grounds for the homeowners recovery of attorneys fees from the homeowners association under § 55-515.

Construction.  Subsection F is conspicuously precise, requiring the certification to verify that the requisite majority signed the amendment or ratifications thereof, and there is a difference between adopting an amendment and signing it or some written ratification of it; subsection F demands the extra precaution of requiring the members voting in favor of an amendment verify that vote with their signatures, no doubt to discou rage quarrelsome disputes between neighbors about who voted for what and when. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, 291 Va. 269, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016). Property Owners Association Act authorizes the creation and enforcement of restrictive covenants against nonconsenting landowners in a manner unknown to the c ommon law; the General Assembly policed the imposition of these covenants with strict procedural requirements, not the least of which is the plainly worded command that no recorded amendment shall be effective unless it is accompanied by a certif ication verifying the requisite majority signed the amendment or a ratification of it. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, 291 Va. 269, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016). General Assembly created something entirely new to the law, the right to form private associations having power over land use, while adding precautions to honor t he common laws ancient antipathy toward restrictions on the free use of private property. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, 291 Va. 269, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016). Declarant could provide for unilateral amendment of declaration.  Subdivisions declaration of protective covenants contained a provision for unilateral amendment of the declaration by the developer for a two-year period; thi s provision was not inconsistent with subsection D of § 55-515.1 and subsection F of § 55-515.2 because these statutes provided ancillary means for amending the declaration. Nothing in the Property Owners Association Act prohibited the declaran t from making express provisions in the declaration for a different manner of amending the declaration. Zinone v. Lee's Crossing Homeowners Ass'n, 282 Va. 330, 714 S.E.2d 922, 2011 Va. LEXIS 186 (2011). Statute of limitations .  Circuit court erred in granting a homeowners associations special plea in bar and dismissing property owners case as untimely under subsection E, beca use the one-year limitations period ran only from the date of an effective amendment, and a proper certification pursuant to subsection F was not satisfied. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, 291 Va. 269, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016). Subsection E begins to run the limitations period when the amendment becomes effective under subsection F, and that interpretation does not offend logic or render the statute inoperable; a challenge to the validity of an amendment can be asserted on grounds other than its failure to become effective under subsection F, and in such circumstances, the challenge could still be barred by the limitations period in sub section E. Tvardek v. Powhatan Vill. Homeowners Ass'n, 291 Va. 269, 784 S.E.2d 280, 2016 Va. LEXIS 7 (2016). Literal reading of subsection E does not create an irreconcilable inconsistency in the statutory text; just the opposite is true because a literal reading avoids the most basic of textual inconsistencies, the same word meaning two different things in the same statute.

Statute of limitations.  Given that there was no association in place as of the time of the adoption of the eighth declaration of the amended restrictive covenants and easements in 2016, it could not constitute an amendment adopted by the association as set forth in Va. Code Ann. §§ 55-515.1, 55.1-1829 E; consequently, the statute of limitations did not bar consideration of plaintiffs claims in their 2019 complaint. McNaughton v. Mt. Brook of Troy, Inc., 108 Va.

The cost of recording and releasing the memorandum shall be taxed against the person found liable in any judgment or order enforcing such lien. C. Prior to fi ling a memorandum of lien, a written notice shall be sent to the property owner by certified mail, at the property owners last known address, informing the property owner that a memorandum of lien will be filed in the circuit court clerks office of the applicable county or city.

The association, at its option, may from time to time remove the trustee and appoint a successor trustee. 3. If the lot owner meets the conditions specified in this subdivision prior to the date of the foreclosure sale, the lot owner shall have the right to have enforcement of the perfected l ien discontinued prior to the sale of the lot. Those conditions are that the lot owner (i) satisfy the debt secured by lien that is the subject of the nonjudicial foreclosure sale and (ii) pay all expenses and costs incurred in perfecting and enforcing t he lien, including advertising costs and reasonable attorney fees. 4. In addition to the advertisement required by subdivision 5, the association shall give written notice of the time, date, and place of any proposed sale in execution of the lien, includ ing the name, address, and telephone number of the trustee, by hand delivery or by mail to (i) the present owner of the property to be sold at his last known address as such owner and address appear in the records of the association, (ii) any lienholder who holds a note against the property secured by a deed of trust recorded at least 30 days prior to the proposed sale and whose address is recorded with the deed of trust, and (iii) any assignee of such a note secured by a deed of trust, provided that th e assignment and address of the assignee are likewise recorded at least 30 days prior to the proposed sale.

The advertisement of sale by the association shall be in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county or city in which the property to be sold, or any portion of such propert y, is located pursuant to the following provisions: a. The association shall advertise once a week for four successive weeks; however, if the property or some portion of such property is located in a city or in a county immediately contiguous to a city, publication of the advertisement on five different days , which may be consecutive days, shall be deemed adequate.

Such advertisement shall be placed in that section of the newspaper where legal notices appear or where the type of property being sold is generally advertised for sale. The adver tisement of sale, in addition to such other matters as the association finds appropriate, shall set forth a description of the property to be sold, which description need not be as extensive as that contained in the deed of trust but shall identify the p roperty by street address, if any, or, if none, shall give the general location of the property with reference to streets, routes, or known landmarks. Where available, tax map identification may be used but is not required. The advertisement shall also i nclude the date, time, place, and terms of sale and the name of the association.

However, for the purposes of clauses (i) and (iii), declarant does not include an institutional lender that acquires title by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure unless such lender offers to dispose of its interest in a condominium unit not previously disposed of to anyone not in the business of selling real estate for his own account, except as otherwise provided in § 55.1-1947. Declarant does not include an ind ividual who acquires title to a condominium unit at a foreclosure sale. Dispose or disposition refers to any voluntary transfer of a legal or equitable interest in a condominium unit to a purchaser, but does not include the transfer or release of securit y for a debt. Electronic means means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient of such communication.

Parcels of airspace constitute land within the meaning of this chapter. Any requirement in this chapter of a legally sufficient description shall be deemed to in clude a requirement that the upper or lower boundaries, if any, of the parcel in question be identified with reference to established datum. Leasehold condominium means a condominium in all or any portion of which each unit own er owns an estate for years in his unit, or in the land within which that unit is situated, or both, with all such leasehold interests due to expire naturally at the same time. A condominium including leased land, or an interest in such land, within whic h no units are situated or to be situated is not a leasehold condominium within the meaning of this chapter. Limited common element means a portion of the common elements reserved for the exclusi ve use of those entitled to the use of one or more, but less than all, of the units. Nonbinding reservation agreement means an agreement between the declarant and a prospe ctive purchaser that is in no way binding on the prospective purchaser and that may be canceled without penalty at the sole discretion of the prospective purchaser. Offer means any inducement, solicitation, or attempt to encourage any person to acquir e any legal or equitable interest in a condominium unit, except as security for a debt.

Substantially identical units shall be assigned the same par value, but units located at substantially different heights above the ground, or having substantially different views, or having substantially different amenities or other characteristics tha t might result in differences in market value may be considered substantially identical within the meaning of §§ 55.1-1917 and 55.1-1918. Person means a natural person, corporation, partnership, association, trust, or other entity capable of holding title to real property, or any combination thereof. Purchaser means any person, other than a declarant, that acquires by means of a volunt ary transfer a legal or equitable interest in a condominium unit, other than (i) a leasehold interest, including renewal options, of less than 20 years or (ii) as security for a debt. Settlement agent means the same as that term is defined in § 55.1-1000. Size means the number of cubic feet, or the number of square feet of ground or floor s pace, within each unit as computed by reference to the plat and plans and rounded to the nearest whole number. Certain spaces within the units, including attic, basement, or garage space, may be omitted from such calculation or partially discounted by th e use of a ratio, so long as the same basis of calculation is employed for all units in the condominium and so long as that basis is described in the declaration. Special declarant rights means any right reserved for the benefit of a declarant, or o f a person or group of persons that becomes a declarant, to (i) expand an expandable condominium; (ii) contract a contractable condominium; (iii) convert convertible land or convertible space or both; (iv) appoint or remove any officers of the unit owner s association or the executive board pursuant to subsection A of § 55.1-1943; (v) exercise any power or responsibility otherwise assigned by any condominium instrument or by this chapter to the unit owners association, any officer, or the exec utive board; or (vi) maintain sales offices, management offices, model units, and signs pursuant to § 55.1-1929. Unit means a portion of the condominium designed and intended for individual ownership and use.

Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Treatment of condominium in which no units have been transferred.  The court rejected developers contention that this section requires a taxing authority to treat a condominium in which no units have been transferred as a sin gle parcel. This section permits the taxing authority to assess individually each completed unit in a condominium project without regard to ownership, and to include in that assessment a proportional share of the assessment of common areas of the project which are not subject to withdrawal or conversion by the declarant. Orchard Glen E., Inc. v. Board of Supvrs., 254 Va. 307, 492 S.E.2d 150, 1997 Va. LEXIS 96 (1997). Assessment of individual condominium units.  All assessments of real estate shall be at their fair market value, and the court concluded that the circuit court did not err in striking the taxpayers evide nce because the taxpayers burden to prove that real property was assessed at more than its fair market value necessarily required that the taxpayer establish the propertys fair market value. Because the real property at issue consisted of condomi nium units, the taxpayer was required to, but failed to, produce evidence to show the fair market value of each individual unit pursuant to § 55-79.42; moreover, to the extent there were market-driven impediments to selling the units individually and limitations on the rental income that could be realized, such factors may affect each units fair market value, but they did not alter the statutory requirement that condominiums be treated as separate parcels of real estate and be separately assessed or the taxpayers burden to establish each units fair market value in order to show that its real property was assessed at more than fair market value as required by subsection A of § 58.1-3984.

No zoning o r other land use ordinance shall prohibit condominiums solely on the basis of the form of ownership, nor shall any condominium be treated differently by any zoning or other land use ordinance that would permit a physically identical project or developmen t under a different form of ownership. Except as provided in subsection E, no local government may require further review or approval to record condominium instruments when a property has previously complied with subdivision, site plan, zoning, or other applicable land use regulations. B. Subdivision and site plan ordinances in any locality shall apply to any condominium in the same manner as such ordinances would apply to a physically identical project or development under a different form of ownership; however, the declarant need not apply for or obtain subdivision approval to record condominium instruments if site plan approval for the land being submitted to the condominium has first been obtained. C. During deve lopment of a condominium containing additional land or withdrawable land, phase lines created by the condominium instruments shall not be considered property lines for purposes of subdivision. If the condominium can no longer be expanded by the addition of additional land, then the owner of the land not part of the condominium shall subdivide such land prior to its conveyance, unless such land is subject to an approved site plan as provided in subsection B, or prior to modification of such approved site plan. In the event of any conveyance of land within phase lines of the condominium, the condominium and any lot created by such conveyance shall be deemed to comply with the local subdivision ordinance, provided that such land is subject to an approved site plan. D. During the period of declarant control and as long as the declarant has the right to create additional units or to complete the common elements, the declarant has the authority to execute, file, and process any subdivision, site plan, zoning, or other land use appl ications or disclosures, including related conditional zoning proffers and agreements that do not create an affirmative obligation on the unit owners association without its consent, with respect to the common elements or applications affecting more than one unit, notwithstanding that the declarant is not the owner of the land.In accordance with subsection B of § 55.1-1956, once the declarant no longer has such authority, the executive board of the unit owners association, if any, and if not, then a representative duly appointed by the unit owners association, shall have the authority to execute, file, and process any subdivision, site plan, zoning, or other land use applications or disclosures, including related conditional zoning proff ers and agreements that do not create an affirmative obligation on the declarant without its consent, with respect to the common elements or applications affecting more than one unit, notwithstanding that the unit owners association is not the owner of the land. Such applications shall not adversely affect the rights of the declarant to develop additional land. For purposes of obtaining building and occupancy permits, the unit owner, including the declarant if the declarant is the unit owner, shall apply for permits for the unit, and the unit owners association shall apply for permits for the common elements, except that the declarant shall apply for permits for convertible land. E. Localities may provide by ordinance that the declarant of a proposed conversion condominium that does not conform to the zoning, land use, and site plan regulations of the respective locality in which the property is located shall secure a special use permit, a spe cial exception, or a variance, as the case may be, prior to such propertys becoming a conversion condominium. The local authority shall grant a request for such a special use permit, special exception, or variance filed on or after July 1, 1982, if t he applicant can demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the local authority that the nonconformities are not likely to be adversely affected by the proposed conversion. The local authority shall not unreasonably delay action on any such request. I n the event of an approved conversion to condominium ownership, a locality, sanitary district, or other political subdivision may impose such charges and fees as are lawfully imposed by such locality, sanitary district, or political subdivision as a resu lt of construction of new structures to the extent that such charges and fees, or portions of such charges and fees, imposed upon property subject to such conversions may be reasonably related to greater or additional services provided by the locality, s anitary district, or political subdivision as a result of the conversion. F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit application of any provision of the Uniform Statewide Building Code (§ 36-97 et seq.) or any local ordinances regulating design and construction of roads, sewer and water lines, stormwater management facilitie s, and other public infrastructure to a condominium in a manner different from the manner in which such provision is applied to other buildings of similar physical form and nature of occupancy.

A permanently assigned limited common element is a limited common element that cannot be reassigned or that can be reassigned only with the consent of the unit owner of the unit to which it is assigned in accordance with § 55.1-1919 .

C. 1. If portions of any unit are taken by eminent domain, the court shall determine the f air market value of the portions of such unit not taken, and the undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to any such units shall be reduced, in the case of each such unit, in proportion to the diminution in the fair market value of such un it resulting from the taking. 2. The portions of undivided interest in the common elements thereby divested from the unit owners of any such units shall be reallocated among those units and the other units in the cond ominium in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements, with any units partially taken participating in such reallocation on the basis of their undivided interests as reduced in accordance with subdivision 1. 3. The court shall enter an order reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include just compensation to the unit owner of any unit partiall y taken for that portion of his undivided interest in the common elements divested by operation of subdivision 1 and not revested by operation of subdivision 2, as well as for that portion of his unit taken by eminent domain. D. If, however , the taking of a portion of any unit makes it impractical to use the remaining portion of that unit for any lawful purpose permitted by the condominium instruments, then the entire undivided interest in the common elements appertaining to that unit shal l thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements, and the remaining portion of that unit shall thenceforth be a common element. The court shall enter an o rder reflecting the reallocation of undivided interests produced thereby, and the award shall include just compensation to the unit owner of such unit for his entire undivided interest in the common elements and for his entire unit. E. Votes in th e unit owners association, rights to future common surpluses, and liabilities for future common expenses not specially assessed, appertaining to any unit taken or partially taken by eminent domain, shall thenceforth appertain to the remaining units, being allocated to them in proportion to their relative voting strength in the unit owners association, with any units partially taken participating in such reallocation as though their voting strength in the unit owners association had been redu ced in proportion to the reduction in their undivided interests in the common elements, and the order of the court shall provide accordingly.

At the time of the conveyance to the first purchaser of a condominium unit following the recordation of the declaration, every mortgage, deed of trust, any other perfected lien, or any mechanics or materialmens liens affecting all of the condominium or a gr eater portion of the condominium than the condominium unit conveyed shall be paid and satisfied of record, or the declarant shall forthwith have such condominium unit released of record from all such liens not so paid and satisfied. The provisions of thi s subsection shall not apply, however, to any withdrawable land in a contractable condominium, nor shall any provision of this subsection be construed to prohibit the unit owners association from mortgaging or causing a deed of trust to be placed on any portion of the condominium within which no units are located, so long as the period of declarant control specified in § 55.1-1943 has expired and so long as the bylaws authorize such action. This subsection does not apply to any lien on more than one condominium unit in a condominium in which all units are restricted to nonresidential use and in which all unit owners whose condominium units will be subject to such lien expressly agree to assume or take subject to such lien. B. If any lien , other than a deed of trust or mortgage, becomes effective against two or more condominium units subsequent to the creation of the condominium, any unit owner may remove his condominium unit from that lien by payment of the amount attributable to his co ndominium unit. Such amount shall be computed by reference to the liability for common expenses appertaining to that condominium unit pursuant to subsection D of § 55.1-1964. Subsequent to such payment, discharge, or other satisfaction, the unit owner of that condominium unit shall be entitled to have that lien released as to his condominium unit in accordance with the provisions of § 55.1-341, and the unit owners association shall not assess, or have a valid lien against, that condominium uni t for any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in §§ 55.1-1964 and 55.1-1966.

Property subject to lien.  Subcontractors liens, which were directed toward an association of condominium owners, were valid despite the fact that the liens included some 40 units that were considered public property and owned by the county because the 940 unreleased unit owners did not suffer a shift in the lien burden from the 40 released units; instead, the percentage of indebtedness had already been apportioned, and it remained app ortioned in the same amount. The lien was not invalidated  rather, it merely could not be enforced against the units owned by the county. Belle View Condos. v. Drytech, Inc., 65 Va. Cir. 169, 2004 Va. Cir.

Compromise of claim as to full and accurate disclosure requirement.  A condominium unit owners association had the authority to compromise, over the objection of individual unit owners, a claim against the condominium developer alleging that in the sale of condominium units, the developer had violated the full and accurate disclosure requirement of § 55-79.90 by representing to prospective purchasers that a parcel of land, which appeared to be included in the condom inium project, would be improved as a park for use of unit owners when in fact the parcel was not part of the condominium project, was zoned for commercial use, and was intended by the developer to be sold for commercial development and alleging that com mercial use of the disputed parcel would violate restrictive covenants to which the parcel was subject. Frantz v. CBI Fairmac Corp., 229 Va. 444, 331 S.E.2d 390, 1985 Va. LEXIS 221 (1985).

B. Unless expr essly prohibited by the condominium instruments, a limited common element may be reassigned or converted to a common element upon written application of the unit owners concerned to the principal officer of the unit owners association, or to such oth er officer as the condominium instruments may specify. The officer to whom such application is duly made shall forthwith prepare and execute an amendment to the declaration reassigning all rights and obligations with respect to the limited common element involved.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. [Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Authority to reassign parking space.  Reassignment of limited common elements in a condominium building, such as the parking spaces at issue, was permitted only with the consent of all property owners affected by the reassignment. Therefore, the condominium building had no authority to confiscate property belonging to one unit owner and to reassign that property to another physically handicapped owner. Commonwealth ex rel. Fair Hous. Bd. v. Windsor P laza Condo. Ass'n, 289 Va. 34, 768 S.E.2d 79, 2014 Va. LEXIS 198 (2014). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Interpretation.  In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development that was purportedly assigned by a prior owner to a different unit owner, the vari ous controlling statutory provisions were to be read together because, based on the statutory language, the general requirement that mortgagee consent was required was not supplanted by a specific rule. Nicksolat v. Gharavi, 87 Va. Cir. 106, 2013 Va. Cir . LEXIS 89 (Fairfax County Sept. 16, 2013). Assignment of parking space a nullity.  In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development, when the prior unit owner failed to obtained the consent of the trustees on the d eed of trust before reassigning the parking space to a different unit owner, he violated the statutory provision that required their prior consent, such that he lost his statutory right to assign the parking space, and his subsequent purported assignment thereof was a nullity. Nicksolat v. Gharavi, 87 Va. Cir. 106, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 89 (Fairfax County Sept. 16, 2013). In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development, as the proper consent of the trustees of the deed of trust was not obtained prior to an attempted assignment of a unit owners parking space, the assignment was a nullity, such that upon foreclosure of the owners unit, the successful bidder purchased title to both the unit and the space. Nicksolat v. Gharavi, 87 Va. Cir. 106, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 89 (Fairfax County Sept. 16, 2013). Estoppel by deed applied.  Although the requirements of subsections A and B of § 55-79.57 were not met in that the purported conveyance of a storage area was not reflected by the condomi nium instruments as an amendment to the condominium instruments was never recorded, the storage area was conveyed to owners association because the doctrine of estoppel by deed applied; as between parties to a 1988 deed, including any successors-in-i nterest, the deed evidenced a clear and unambiguous conveyance of the storage area for good and valuable consideration. The limited liability companys claim for ejectment was in derogation of the 1988 deed. Gordon Props., LLC v. First Owners' Ass'n o f Forty Six Hundred Condo., Inc., 79 Va. Cir. 683, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 33 (Alexandria Apr. 3, 2009). Conveyance did not require associations approval.  In purchasers quiet title action, assignees were ordered to cease any and all use of parking spaces that were appurtenant to a condominium unit because the pu rchasers possessed the exclusive right to use the spaces when they bought the unit at a foreclosure sale; the right to use the limited common elements was legitimately transferred to a trustee by a deed of trust, that conveyance did not require the condo minium associations approval, and when the deed of trust was recorded the public had constructive notice of its existence and its provisions, including the right to foreclose upon default.

D. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsections A and B, a time-share interest in a unit that has been subjected to a time-share instrument pursuant to § 55.1-2208 may be conveyed prior to substantial completion of that unit if (i) a completion bond has been filed in compliance with subsection B of § 55.1-1921 and remains in full force and effect until the unit is certified as substantially complete in accordance with subsections A and B and (ii) the settlement agent or title insurance company insuring the tim e-share estate in the unit certifies to the purchaser in writing, based on information provided by the Common Interest Community Board, that the bond has been filed with the Common Interest Community Board.

If the termination agreement requ ires that any property in the condominium be sold or otherwise disposed of following termination, title to the property, upon termination, shall vest in the unit owners association as trustee for the holders of all interest in the units. Thereafter, the unit owners association shall have powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale or disposition. Until the termination has been concluded and the proceeds have been distributed, the unit owners association shall continue in existence wi th all the powers the unit owners association had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of the unit owners as provided in subsection I. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, for as long as the unit owners association holds title to the property, each unit owner or his successor in interest shall have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the property that formerly constituted his unit. During the period that the unit owner or his successor in interest has the right to occupancy, each unit owner or his successor in interest shall remain liable for any assessment or other obligation impose d on the unit owner by this chapter or the condominium instruments. G. If the prop erty that constitutes the condominium is not sold or otherwise disposed of following termination, title to all the property in the condominium shall vest in the unit owners, upon termination, as tenants in common in proportion to the unit owners resp ective interests as provided in subsection I. In such an event, any liens on a unit shall shift accordingly, and a lien may be enforced only against a unit owners tenancy in common interest, but the lien shall not encumber the entire property formerl y constituting the condominium. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner or his successor in interest shall have the exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the property that formerly constituted the unit owners unit. H. Following t ermination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of property, together with the assets of the unit owners association, shall be held by the unit owners association as trustee for unit owners or lien holders on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, any creditor of the unit owners association who holds a lien on the unit that was recorded before termination may enforce the lien in the same manner as any lien holder. Any other creditor of the unit owners ass ociation shall be treated as if he had perfected a lien on the units immediately before termination. I. Unless the condominium instruments as originally recorded or as amended by 100 percent of the unit owners provide otherwise, the respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections F, G, and H shall be as follows: 1. Excep t as provided in subdivision 3, the respective interests of the unit owners shall be as set forth in the termination agreement. 2. Except as provided in subdivision 3, if the respective interests of the unit owners are based on the respective fair market values of their units, limited common elements, and common e lement interests immediately before the termination, the fair market values shall be determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the unit owners association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and become final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by unit owners of units to which one quarter of the votes in the unit owners association appertain. The proportion of any unit owners interest to the interest of all un it owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owners unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and their common element interests. 3. If the method of determining the respective interests of the unit owners in the proceeds of sale or disposition is other than the fair market values, then the association shall provide each unit owner with a notice stating the result of that method for his unit and, no later than 30 days after transmission of that notice, if 10 percent of the unit owners dispute the interest to be distributed to their units, those unit owners may requ ire the association to obtain an independent appraisal of the condominium units. If the fair market value of the units of the objecting unit owners is at least 10 percent more than the amount that the unit owners would have received using the method agre ed upon by the membership, then the association shall adjust the respective interests of the unit owners so that each unit owners share is based on the fair market value for each unit. If the fair market value is less than 10 percent more than the am ount that the objecting unit owners would have received using the agreed-upon method, then the agreed-upon method shall be implemented and the objecting unit owners shall receive the distribution less their pro rata share of the cost of their appraisal. 4. If the method of determining the respective interests of the unit owners cannot be implemented because any unit or limited common element is destroyed, the interests of all unit owners are the unit owners respective common element interests immediately before the termination. 5. Unless the termination agreement provides otherwise, each unit owner shall satisfy and cause the release of any mortgage, deed of trust, lease, or other lien or encumbrance on his unit at the time required by the termination agreement. J. Except as p rovided in subsection K, foreclosure of any mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien, or enforcement of a mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium, shall not alone terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or en forcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium, other than withdrawable land, shall not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable land shall not alone wit hdraw the land from the condominium, but the person who takes title to the withdrawable land shall have the right to require from the unit owners association, upon request, an amendment that excludes the land from the condominium.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Po wers of unit owners not unlimited.  While this chapter is designed to and does permit the exercise of wide powers by an association of unit owners, these powers are limited by general law and the ch apter itself. Unit Owners Ass'n of Buildamerica-1 v. Gillman, 223 Va. 752, 292 S.E.2d 378, 1982 Va. LEXIS 263 (1982). Power exercised by the condominium association is contractual in nature and is the creat ure of the condominium documents to which all unit owners subject themselves in purchasing their units. Unit Owners Ass'n of Buildamerica-1 v. Gillman, 223 Va. 752, 292 S.E.2d 378, 1982 Va. LEXIS 263 (1982). Amendments to condominium restrictions, rules, and regulations should be measured by a standard of reasonableness, and courts should refuse to enforce regulations that are found to be unreasonable. Inquiry must be made into whether the association has acted within the scope of its authority as defined under this chapter and by its own master deed and bylaws, and whether it has abused its discretion by promulgating arbitrary and capricious rules and regulations bearing no relation to the purposes of the condominium. Unit Owners Ass'n of Buildamerica-1 v. Gillman, 223 Va. 752, 292 S.E.2 d 378, 1982 Va. LEXIS 263 (1982). A condominium restriction or limitation, reasonably related to a legitimate purpose, does not inherently violate a fundamental right and may be enforced if it serves a legitimate purpose and is reasonably applied. Unit Owners Ass'n of Buildamerica-1 v. Gillman, 223 Va. 752, 292 S.E.2d 378, 1982 Va. LEXIS 263 (1982). No authorization to impose fines, penalties, etc.  There is no language in this chapter which authorizes the executive or governing board of a condominium to levy fines, impose penalties, or exact forfeitures for violation of bylaws and regulations by unit owners. Unit Owners Ass'n of Buildamerica-1 v. Gillman, 223 Va. 752, 292 S.E.2d 378, 1982 Va. LEXIS 263 (1982). Regulation which restricts the use of parking spaces and the weight of vehicles occupying such spaces is not a zoning regulation adopted under the police power; rather, when adopted lawfully and reasonably, it becomes a mutual agreement entered into by the condominium unit owners.

If any prov ision in the condominium instruments requires the written consent of a mortgagee in order to amend the condominium instruments, the unit owners association shall be deemed to have received the written consent of a mortgagee if the unit owners ass ociation sends the text of the proposed amendment by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the mortgagee at the address supplied by such mortgagee in a written request to the unit owners association to receive notice of proposed amendments to the condominium instruments and receives no written objection to the adoption of the amendment from the mortgagee within 60 days of the date that the notice of amendment is sent by the unit owners association, unless the condominium instruments expre ssly provide otherwise. If the mortgagee has not supplied an address to the unit owners association, the unit owners association shall be deemed to have received the written consent of a mortgagee if the unit owners association sends the text of the proposed amendment by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the mortgagee at the address filed in the land records or with the local tax assessors office and receives no written objection to the adoption of the amendment from the mortg agee within 60 days of the date that the notice of amendment is sent by the unit owners association, unless the condominium instruments expressly provide otherwise.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Purported assi gnment affected mortgagees rights.  Uncertainty as to the proper ownership of a parking space that was purportedly transferred by a prior condominium owner to a different unit owner prior to foreclo sure on the prior owners unit specifically affected the mortgagees rights. Nicksolat v. Gharavi, 87 Va. Cir. 106, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 89 (Fairfax County Sept. 16, 2013). Interpretation.  In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development that was purportedly assigned by a prior owner to a different unit owner, the vari ous controlling statutory provisions were to be read together because, based on the statutory language, the general requirement that mortgagee consent was required was not supplanted by a specific rule. Nicksolat v. Gharavi, 87 Va. Cir. 106, 2013 Va. Cir . LEXIS 89 (Fairfax County Sept. 16, 2013). Assignment of parking space a nullity.  In determining proper ownership of a parking space in a condominium development, when the prior unit owner failed to obtained the consent of the trustees on the d eed of trust before reassigning the parking space to a different unit owner, he violated the statutory provision that required their prior consent, such that he lost his statutory right to assign the parking space, and his subsequent purported assignment thereof was a nullity.

The condomi nium instruments may authorize the declarant, or a managing agent or some other person selected or to be selected by the declarant, to appoint and remove some or all of the officers of the unit owners association or its executive board, or to exercis e powers and responsibilities otherwise assigned by the condominium instruments and by this chapter to the unit owners association, the officers, or the executive board. The declarant, managing agent, or other person selected by the declarant to so a ppoint and remove officers or the executive board or to exercise such powers and responsibilities otherwise assigned to the unit owners association, the officers, or the executive board shall be subject to liability as fiduciaries of the unit owners for their action or omissions during the period of declarant control as specified in the condominium instruments or, if not so specified, within such period as defined in this section. But no amendment to the condominium instruments shall increase the sc ope of such authorization if there is any unit owner other than the declarant, and no such authorization shall be valid after the time limit set by the condominium instruments or after units to which three-fourths of the undivided interests in the common elements appertain have been conveyed, whichever occurs first. For the purposes of the preceding sentence only, the calculation of the fraction of undivided interest shall be based upon the total undivided interests assigned or to be assigned to all uni ts registered with the Common Interest Community Board pursuant to subsection B of § 55.1-1978 and described pursuant to subdivision A 4, B 2, or C 8 of § 55.1-1916. B. The time li mit initially set by the condominium instruments shall not exceed five years in the case of an expandable condominium; three years in the case of a condominium other than an expandable condominium, containing any convertible land; or two years in the cas e of any other condominium. Such time period shall begin upon settlement of the first unit to be sold in any portion of the condominium.Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of the declarant, such time limits may be extended for a period not to e xceed 15 years from the settlement of the first unit to be sold in any portion of the condominium or after units to which three-fourths of the undivided interests in the common elements appertain have been conveyed, whichever occurs first, provided that (i) a special meeting is held prior to the expiration of the initial period of declarant control; (ii) at such special meeting, the extension of such time limits is approved by a two-thirds affirmative vote of the unit owners other than the declarant; an d (iii) at such special meeting, there is an election of a warranty review committee consisting of no fewer than three persons unaffiliated with the declarant.Prior to any such vote, the declarant shall furnish to the unit owners in the notice of such sp ecial meeting made in accordance with § 55.1-1949 a written statement in a form provided by the Common Interest Community Board that discloses that an affirmative vote extends the right of the declarant, or a managing agent or some other person select ed by the declarant, to (a) appoint and remove some or all of the officers of the unit owners association or its executive board and (b) exercise powers and responsibilities otherwise assigned by the condominium instruments and by this chapter. In ad dition, such statement shall contain both a notice of the effect of the extension of declarant control on the enforcement of the warranty against structural defects provided by the declarant in accordance with § 55.1-1955 and a statement that a unit o wner is advised to exercise whatever due diligence the unit owner deems necessary to protect his interest. C. If entered into any time prior to the expiration of the period of declarant control, no contract or lease entered into with the declarant or any entity controlled by the declarant, management contract, employment contract, or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities, which is directly or indirectly made by or on behalf of the unit owners association, its executive board, or the unit owners as a group, shall be entered into for a period in excess of two years. Any such contract or agreement entered into on or after July 1, 1978, may be terminated without penalty by the unit owners association or its executive board upon not less than 90 days written notice to the other party given not later than 60 days after the expiration of the period of declarant control. Any such contract or agreement may be renewed for periods not in excess of two years; however, at the end of any two-year period the unit owners association or its executive board may terminate any further renewals or extensions o f such contract or agreement. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any lease referred to in § 55.1-1910 or subject to subsection E of § 55.1-1916. D. If entered into at any time prior to the expiration of the period of declarant control, any contract, lease, or agreement, other than those subject to the provisions of subsection C, may be entered into by or on behalf of the unit owners association, its execut ive board, or the unit owners as a group, if such contract, lease, or agreement is bona fide and is commercially reasonable to the unit owners association at the time entered into under the circumstances. E. This sectio n does not apply to any contract, incidental to the disposition of a condominium unit, to provide to a unit owner for the duration of such unit owners life, or for any term in excess of one year, nursing services, medical services, other health-relat ed services, board and lodging and care as necessary, or any combination of such services. The rule of property law known as the rule restricting unreasonable restraints on alienation shall not be applied to defeat any provision of the condominium instru ments requiring that the unit owners be parties to such contracts. F. If the unit owners association is not in existence or does not have officers at the time of the creation of the condominium, the declarant shall, until there is such an association with such officers, have the power and the responsibility to act in all instance s where this chapter requires action by the unit owners association, its executive board, or any officer. G. Thirty days prior to the expiration of the period of declarant control, the declarant shall notify the governing body of the locality in which the condominium is located of the forthcoming termination of declarant control.

For the pur poses of this section, affiliate of a declarant means any person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a declarant. A person controls a declarant if the person (i) is a general partner, officer, director, or employer of the declarant; (ii) directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with one or more persons or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, holds with power to vote, or holds proxies representing more than 20 percent of the voting interests in the dec larant; (iii) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the declarant; or (iv) has contributed more than 20 percent of the capital of the declarant. A person is controlled by a declarant if the declarant (a) is a general partn er, officer, director, or employer of the person; (b) directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with one or more other persons or through one or more subsidiaries, owns, controls, holds with power to vote, or holds proxies representing more than 20 pe rcent of the voting interest in the person; (c) controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the person; or (d) has contributed more than 20 percent of the capital of the person. Control does not exist if the powers described in this subsection are held solely as security for an obligation and are not exercised. B. No special declarant right may be transferred except by a document evidencing the transfer recorded in every county and city in which any portion of the condominium is located. The instrument shall not be effective unless executed by the transferee. C. Upon transf er of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant shall be as follows: 1. The t ransferor shall not be relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and shall remain liable for warranty obligations imposed upon him by subsection B of § 55.1-1955. Lack of privity shall not deprive any unit owner of standing t o bring an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor. 2. If the successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the transferor shall also be jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligation or liabi lity of the successor that relates to the condominium. 3. If a transferor retains any special declarant rights, but transfers other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor shall also be liable for all obligations and liabilities relating to the retained special declarant rights and imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the condominium instruments. 4. A transferor shall have no liability for any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation or for any other act or omission, arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declarant who is not an affiliate of the transferor. D. Except as o therwise provided by the mortgage or deed of trust, in case of foreclosure of a mortgage, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under receivership proceedings or the Bankruptcy Code as codified in Title 11 of the Unite d States Code of any unit owned by a declarant or land subject to development rights: 1. A per son acquiring title to all the land being foreclosed or sold shall, but only upon his request, succeed to all special declarant rights related to that land reserved by that declarant, or only to any rights reserved in the declaration pursuant to § 55. 1-1929 and held by that declarant to maintain sales offices, management offices, model units, or signs. 2. The judgment or instrument conveying title shall provide for transfer of only the special declarant rights requested.For the purposes of this subsection, development rights mea ns any right or combination of rights to expand an expandable condominium, contract a contractable condominium, convert convertible land, or convert convertible space. E. Upon forecl osure, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust, tax sale, judicial sale, or sale under receivership proceedings or the Bankruptcy Code as codified in Title 11 of the United States Code of all units and other land in the condominium owned by a declarant, (i) that declarant ceases to have any special declarant rights and (ii) any period of declarant control reserved under subsection A of § 55.1-1943 shall terminate, unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all special declarant rights held by that declarant to a successor declarant. F. The liabili ties and obligations of any person who succeed to any special declarant right shall be as follows: 1. A suc cessor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or by the condominium instruments. 2. A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in subdivisions 3 and 4, who is not an affiliate of a declarant shall be subject to all obligations and lia bilities imposed by this chapter or the condominium instruments on a declarant that relate to his exercise or nonexercise of special declarant rights, or on his transferor, except for (i) misrepresentations by any prior declarant, (ii) warranty obligatio ns as provided in subsection B of § 55.1-1955 on improvements made by any previous declarant or made before the condominium was created, (iii) breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or his appointees to the executive board, or (i v) any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferors acts or omissions after the transfer. 3. Unless he is an affiliate of a declarant, a successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain sales offices, management offices, model units, or signs shall not exercis e any other special declarant right and shall not be subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant, except the liabilities and obligations arising under Article 4 (§ 55.1-1970 et seq.) as to disposition by that successor. 4. A successor to all special declarant rights held by his transferor who is not an affiliate of that transferor and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosur e or a judgment or instrument conveying title to units under subsection D may declare his intention in a recorded instrument to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, until transferring all special declarant rights to any pe rson acquiring title to any unit owned by the successor, or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right reserved by his transferor pursuant to subsection A of § 55.1-1943. Any attempted exercise of those rights is void. So long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this subsection, he shall not be subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant other than liabil ity for his acts and omissions relating to the exercise of rights reserved under subsection A of § 55.1-1943. G. Nothing in this section subjects any successor to a special declarant right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor declarant, other than claims and obligations arising under this chapter or the condominium instruments.

Installation of solar energy collection devices. Text A. As used in this section, solar energy collection device means any device manufactured and sold for the sole purpose of facilitating the collection and beneficial use of solar energy, including passive heating panels or building components and solar photovol taic apparatus. B. No unit own ers association shall prohibit an owner from installing a solar energy collection device on that owners property unless the recorded declaration for the unit owners association establishes such a prohibition. However, a unit owners associ ation may establish reasonable restrictions concerning the size, place, and manner of placement of such solar energy collection devices on property designated and intended for individual ownership and use. Any resale certificate pursuant to § 55.1-199 0 given to a purchaser shall contain a statement setting forth any restriction, limitation, or prohibition on the right of an owner to install or use solar energy collection devices on his property. C. A restricti on shall be deemed not to be reasonable if application of the restriction to a particular proposal (i) increases the cost of installation of the solar energy collection device by five percent over the projected cost of the initially proposed installation or (ii) reduces the energy production by the solar energy collection device by 10 percent below the projected energy production of the initially proposed installation. The owner shall provide documentation prepared by an independent solar panel design s pecialist, who is certified by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners and is licensed in Virginia, that is satisfactory to the unit owners association to show that the restriction is not reasonable according to the criteria establ ished in this subsection. D. The unit ow ners association may prohibit or restrict the installation of solar energy collection devices on the common elements or common area within the real estate development served by the unit owners association.

Any proxy shall be void if not signed by or on behalf of the unit owner. If the unit owner is more than one person, any such unit owner may object to the proxy at or prior to the meeting, whereupon the proxy shall be dee med revoked. Any proxy shall terminate after the first meeting held on or after the date of that proxy or any recess or adjournment of that meeting. The proxy shall include a brief explanation of the effect of leaving the proxy uninstructed. E. Unless expr essly prohibited by the condominium instruments, a unit owner may vote at a meeting of the unit owners association in person, by proxy, or by absentee ballot. Such voting may take place by electronic means, provided that the executive board has adopt ed guidelines for such voting by electronic means.

Eligibility for membership in owners association board of directors.  The mere leasing of a unit, for a period of less than 20 years, does not meet the definition of the term dispose and, therefore, does not disqualify a uni t owner who becomes a nonresident from membership eligibility on the associations board of directors.

Except to t he extent otherwise provided by the condominium instruments, all powers and responsibilities, including financial responsibility, with regard to maintenance, repair, renovation, restoration, and replacement of the condominium shall belong (i) to the unit owners association in the case of the common elements and (ii) to the individual unit owner in the case of any unit or any part of such unit, except to the extent that the need for repairs, renovation, restoration, or replacement arises from a condi tion originating in or through the common elements or any apparatus located within the common elements, in which case the unit owners association shall have such powers and responsibilities. Each unit owner shall afford to the other unit owners and t o the unit owners association and to any agents or employees of either such access through his unit as may be reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise and discharge their respective powers and responsibilities. To the extent that damage is inf licted on the common elements or any unit through which access is taken, the unit owner causing the same, or the unit owners association if it caused the damage, shall be liable for the prompt repair of such damage. B. Notwithstan ding anything in this section to the contrary, the declarant shall warrant or guarantee against structural defects each of the units for two years from the date each is conveyed and all of the common elements for two years. For each unit, the declarant s hall also warrant that the unit is fit for habitation in the case of a residential unit and constructed in a workmanlike manner so as to pass without objection in the trade. The two-year warranty as to each of the common elements begins whenever that com mon element has been completed or, if later, (i) as to any common element within any additional land or portion of the additional land, at the time the first unit in that additional land is conveyed; (ii) as to any common element within any convertible l and or portion of the convertible land, at the time the first unit in the convertible land is conveyed; and (iii) as to any common element within any other portion of the condominium, at the time the first unit in that portion is conveyed. For the purpos es of this subsection, no unit shall be deemed conveyed unless conveyed to a bona fide purchaser. Any conveyance of a condominium unit transfers to the purchaser all of the declarants warranties against structural defects imposed by this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, structural defects shall be those defects in components constituting any unit or common element that reduce the stability or safety of the structure below accepted standards or restrict the normal intended use of all or part of the structure and that require repair, renovation, restoration, or replacement. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to make the declarant responsible for any items of maintenance relating to the units or common elements. C. An action f or breach of any warranty prescribed by this section shall begin within (i) five years after the date such warranty period began or (ii) one year after the formation of any warranty review committee pursuant to subsection B of § 55.1-1943, whichever o ccurs last. However, no such action shall be maintained against the declarant unless a written statement by the claimant, or his agent, attorney, or representative, of the nature of the alleged defect has been sent to the declarant by registered or certi fied mail at his last known address, as reflected in the records of the Common Interest Community Board, more than six months prior to the beginning of the action giving the declarant an opportunity to cure the alleged defect within a reasonable time, no t to exceed five months. Sending the notice required by this subsection shall toll the statute of limitations for beginning a breach of warranty action for a period not to exceed six months. D. If the init ial period of declarant control has been extended in accordance with subsection B of § 55.1-1943, the warranty review committee, referred to in this section as the committee, shall have (i) subject to the provisions of subdivision 3, the irrev ocable power as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the unit owners association to assert or settle in the name of the unit owners association any claims involving the declarants warranty against structural defects with respect to all of the common elements and (ii) the authority to levy an additional assessment against all of the units in proportion to their respective undivided interests in the common elements pursuant to § 55.1-1964 if the committee determines that the assessments levied by the unit owners association are insufficient to enable the committee reasonably to perform its functions pursuant to this subsection. The committee or the declarant shall notify the governing body of the locality in which the condominium is located o f the formation of the committee within 30 days of its formation. Within 30 days after such notice, the local governing body or an agency designated by the local governing body shall advise the chair of the committee of any outstanding violations of appl icable building codes, local ordinances, or other deficiencies of record. Members of the committee shall be insured, indemnified, and subject to liability to the same extent as officers or directors under the condominium instruments or applicable law. Th e unit owners association shall provide sufficient funds reasonably necessary for the committee to perform the functions set out in this subsection and to: 1. Engag e an independent architect, engineer, legal counsel, and such other experts as the committee may reasonably determine; 2. Investigate whether there exists any breach of the warranty as to any of the common elements. The committee shall document its findings and the evidence that supports such findings. Su ch findings and evidence shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to the declarant without the consent of the committee; and 3. Assert or settle in the name of the unit owners association any claims involving the declarants warranty on the common elements, provided that (i) the committee sends the decla rant at least six months prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations a written statement pursuant to subsection C of the alleged nature of any defect in the common elements giving the declarant an opportunity to cure the alleged defect; (ii) th e declarant fails to cure the alleged defect within a reasonable time; and (iii) the declarant control period or the statute of limitations has not expired. E. Within 45 d ays after the formation of the committee, the declarant shall deliver to the chair of the committee (i) a copy of the latest available approved plans and specifications for all improvements in the project or as-built plans if available; (ii) all associat ion insurance policies that are currently in force; (iii) any written unexpired warranties of the contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, and manufacturers applicable to the condominium; and (iv) a list of manufacturers of paints, roofing materials, and other similar materials if specified for use on the condominium property.

Warranty on common elements of condominium project.  Subsection B extends to each purchaser of a condominium unit a two-year warranty against structural defects in his unit, beginning on the date of delivery of the deed to his individual unit. By contrast, the General Assembly did not provide for staggered warranty periods on the common elements dating from the delivery of individual deeds to the respective units, but chose instead to date that warranty from a sing le, readily ascertainable time: completion of the structure or conveyance of the first unit, whichever occurs later. Harbour Gate Owners' Ass'n v. Berg, 232 Va. 98, 348 S.E.2d 252, 3 Va. Law Rep. 552, 1986 Va. LEXIS 234 (1986). Subsection B imposes a warranty during the two-year period which begins on either the date of completion or the date of conveyance of the first unit, whichever da te is later. The warranty expires, however, two years after its commencement, and the dates of delivery of deeds conveying units subsequent to the first have no effect upon it. Harbour Gate Owners' Ass'n v. Berg, 232 Va. 98, 348 S.E.2d 252, 3 Va. Law Rep . 552, 1986 Va. LEXIS 234 (1986). Warranty period defines when cause of action for breach may accrue.  The two-year warranty period provided by subsection B is not a limitation governing the assertion of a right of action; rather, it defines the period within which a cause of action for breach of warranty may accrue. Harbour Gate Owners' Ass'n v. Berg, 232 Va. 98, 348 S.E.2d 252, 3 Va. Law Rep. 552, 1986 Va. LEXIS 234 (1986). The two-year warranty period in subsection B circumscribes the interval of time within which the warranty exists. If a breach occurs before the two-year warranty expires, a cause of action accrues. If a person suffers damage or injury as a result of the breach, a right of action accrues to him. Harbour Gate Owners' Ass'n v. Berg, 232 Va. 98, 348 S.E.2d 252, 3 Va. Law Rep. 552, 1986 Va.

Authorized actions.  Language of subsection A of § 55-79.53 is expressed in plain and unambiguous terms which authorizes two types of litigation, with the first type concerning act ions for failure to comply with provisions contained in relevant condominium instruments or in the Virginia Condominium Act, §§ 55-79.39 through 55-79.103; such actions for noncompliance may be brought by a unit owners association, its executiv e organ or managing agent, or by one or more aggrieved unit owners on their own behalf or as a class action; the second type of litigation addressed by subsection A of § 55-79.53 authorizes a unit owners association of a condominium to bring suit in its own name for any claims or actions related to the common elements of a condominium, as set forth in subsection B of § 55-79.80; such suits include, among other things, the right to assert, through litigation or the defense against litigation, a ny claims or actions related to common elements. Mozley v. Prestwould Bd. of Dirs., 264 Va. 549, 570 S.E.2d 817, 2002 Va. LEXIS 151 (2002).

Necessary parties.  In a case in which plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that her condominium unit was uninhabitable due to mold caused by water leaks from common elements, the subject matter of this litigation precluded the conclusion that the other unit owners were necessary parties. With only a pecuniary interest in the outcome, the other unit owners merely had a general interest in this litigation, and the action could proceed with out joinder of all unit owners as defendants.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under prior law. Liability for agents torts.  Plaintiffs negligence claim against a condominium association and its president, alleging she was injured when her dog was attacked by the presidents dogs , survived the associations demurrer because the complaint was sufficient to support plaintiffs claim that the president was the associations agent and that the association might be liable for her actions under the Virginia Condominium Act. M cCarthy v. Fennessey, 87 Va. Cir. 143, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 84 (Norfolk Oct. 2, 2013). Suits against individuals.  While § 55-79.80:1 precluded bringing actual and constructive fraud actions against an individual defendant, it did not bar plaintiffs attempts to hold ind ividual defendants liable by piercing the corporate veil. 313 Freemason v. Freemason Assocs., 59 Va. Cir. 407, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 365 (Norfolk Aug. 30, 2002). Defendants motion to amend in order to file a third-party complaint and a counterclaim was denied, as allowing the amendment would not serve the ends of justi ce. The counterclaim was barred by res judicata, and allowing individual members of a condominium association to be joined as third-party defendants was improper under § 55-79.80:1, which required that tort and contract actions involving condominiums be brought against the association. Highridge Place Condo. Unit Owner's Ass'n v. Langley, 72 Va. Cir. 21, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 187 (Nelson County Mar. 30, 2006). On Count IV for fraud in the inducement, fraudulent misrepresentation, and actual fraud, demurrers by the declarant, a limited liability company (LLC), and the co -managers were overruled and demurrers by the real estate company and the realtor were sustained as they were agents for the LLC and any statements they made were meant to induce the purchasers to enter into a contract with the LLC. The real estate compa ny and the realtor did not rise to the level of co-managers of the declarant; therefore, the action was not properly brought against the real estate company and the realtor, pursuant to subsection A of § 55-79.80:1.Millisor v. Anchor Point Ventures, L .L.C., 77 Va. Cir. 246, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 278 (Hopewell Nov. 7, 2008). Because the complaint by a condominium unit lessee did not allege that individual unit owner was a member of the board of the condominium association, and no alle gation suggested that the owner was a member until after the filing of the complaint, the court had to accept the reasonable inference that the owner was acting in the owners individual capacity. Because the complaint alleged that the board members a cted outside the scope of the members membership, the members could not, for purposes of a demurrer, receive the benefit of immunity.

Memorandum of joint lien held defective.  Where work had been done and materials furnished for a condominium under two separate and distinct contracts which added disproportionate values to the properties liened, a memorandum which failed to apportion the amounts due between the several properties benefited was defective and the lien void.

A memorandum of lien failed to comply with § 43-3 when an unapportioned amount was claimed upon all units of a condominium, whereas one contract was for work o n 132 units and another was for work on common element of entire 264-unit project, and the memorandum did not seek to secure only a claim to extent plaintiff had added value but instead attempted to lien property not benefited by work.

Asse ssment in proportion to votes.  State court order was quite clear and, contrary to a bankruptcy courts interpretation, stated that debtors restaurant unit was subject to assessment for t he common expenses relating to a condominium owners associations operation and management, clearly defined such expenses, and fixed the units proportionate liability. Order accorded with the purpose of the default catch-all rule in the Virgin ia Condominium Act and reached a fundamentally fair result, effectively taxing debtor at a rate commensurate with its representation in the condominiums governing body and, by disallowing associations proof of claim, bankruptcy court erred by fai ling to give full preclusive effect to the state courts order.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law. Association allo wed to impose reasonable user fee.  Courts prior conclusion that assessments for limited common elements should have been governed by subsection A of § 55-79.83 was contrary to the declaratio n and the Condominium Act, and, instead, subsection B applied; the owners association was allowed to impose a reasonable user fee.

Such leases or extensions shall not be required, however, in the case of any apartments or units that will in the course of the conversion be substantially altered in the p hysical layout, restricted exclusively to nonresidential use, or be converted in such a manner as to require relocation of the tenant in premises outside of the project being converted. H. The governi ng body of any county utilizing the optional urban county executive form of government (§ 15.2-800 et seq.) or the optional county manager plan of government (§ 15.2-702 et seq.), or of any city or town adjoining any such county, may require by ord inance that the declarant of any residential condominium converted from multi-family rental use shall reimburs...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_55.1-1983"><akn:num>§ 55.1-1983</akn:num><akn:heading>Escrow of deposits</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Tax bills shall be issued for each individual cooperative apartment unit.No assessment of any parcel improved by a multi-unit cooperative a partment complex, whether the assessment was made before or after the adoption of this subsection, shall be held to be invalid because of the use of the method described in this subsection to determine the assessment. D. Any duly au thorized real estate assessor, board of assessors, or department of real estate assessments may require that all declarants, associations, master associations, and proprietary lessees associations in the county or city subject to local taxation furni sh to such assessor, board, or department on or before a time specified a statement listing all transfers of the cooperative apartment units over a specified period of time and a statement listing all owners and proprietary lessees of the cooperative apa rtment units as of a specified date. Each such statement shall be certified as to its accuracy by the declarant, association, master association, or proprietary lessees association for which the statement is furnished or by a duly authorized agent of such declarant or association. Any statement required by this subsection shall be kept confidential in accordance with the provisions of § 58.1-3. E. Subsections C and D apply to all cooperatives created in the Commonwealth, whether created before, on, or after July 1, 1982. However, subsections C and D do not apply to any multi-unit cooperative apartment complex the cooperative apartment units of which have bee n continually in use as such since December 31, 1967. F. Any residen tial cooperative association the members of which are owners of cooperative interests in a cooperative under this chapter shall not be deemed to be a business for any state and local purposes, including liability for payment of sales, meals, hotel, motel , or gross receipts taxes and business licenses, to the extent that such residential cooperative association collects payments from residents of such cooperative. G. Any tangibl e personal property owned by a residential cooperative association that would be considered household goods and personal effects if owned and used by an individual or by a family or household incident to maintaining an abode shall be considered household goods and personal effects owned and used by an individual or by a family or household incident to maintaining an abode for the purposes of § 58.1-3504 and any local ordinance authorized pursuant to § 58.1-3504.

No zoning o r other land use ordinance shall prohibit cooperatives as such by reason of their form of ownership. No cooperative shall be treated differently by any zoning or other land use ordinance that would permit a physically identical project or development und er a different form of ownership. B. Subdivision and site plan ordinances in any locality shall apply to any cooperative in the same manner as such ordinances would apply to a physically identical project or development under a different form of ownership. Nevertheless, the declarant need not apply fo r or obtain subdivision approval to record cooperative instruments against a portion of the land that may be submitted to the cooperative if the site plan approval for the land being submitted to the cooperative has first been obtained. C. During deve lopment of a cooperative containing additional land or withdrawable land, phase lines created by the cooperative instruments shall not be considered property lines for purposes of subdivision. If the cooperative may no longer be expanded by the addition of additional land, the owner of the land not part of the cooperative shall subdivide such land prior to its conveyance, unless such land is subject to an approved site plan as provided in subsection B, or prior to modification of such approved site plan . In the event of any conveyance of land within phase lines of the cooperative, the cooperative and any lot created by such conveyance shall be deemed to comply with the local subdivision ordinance, provided that such land is subject to an approved site plan. D. Localities may provide by ordinance that proposed cooperatives comprising conversion buildings and the use of such conversion buildings that do not conform to the zoning, land use, and site plan regulations of the respective county or city in which the property is located shall secure a special use permit, a special exception, or variance, as applicable, prior to such propertys becoming a cooperative. The local authority shall grant a request for such a special use permit, special exception, or variance filed on or after July 1, 1982, if the applicant can demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the local authority that the nonconformities are not likely to be adversely affected by the proposed conversion. The local authority shall not unreasonably delay action on any such request. In the event of an approved conversion, a locality, sanitary district, or other political subdivision may impose such charges and fees as are lawfully imposed by such locality, sanitary district, or other political subdivisio n as a result of construction of new structures to the extent that such charges and fees, or portions of such charges and fees, imposed upon property subject to such conversions may be reasonably related to greater or additional services provided by the locality, sanitary district, or political subdivision as a result of the conversion. E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit application of any provision of the Uniform Statewide Building Code (§ 36-97 et seq.), or any local ordinances regulating the design and construction of roads, sewer and water lines, stormwater management faci lities, or other public infrastructure, that is not expressly applicable to cooperatives by reason of their form of ownership to a cooperative in a manner different from the manner in which such provision is applied to other buildings of similar physical form and nature of occupancy.

Except in t he case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain, or in the case of foreclosure of a security interest against the entire cooperative that has priority over the declaration, cooperative ownership may be terminated only by agreement of proprietary l essees of cooperative interests to which at least four-fifths of the votes in the association are allocated or any larger percentage the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the cooperative a re restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. B. An agreemen t to terminate must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement or ratification of such agreement in the same manner as a deed by the requisite number of proprietary lessees. The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agre ement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all such ratifications must be recorded in every county or city in which a portion of the cooperative is situated and is effective only upon recordation. C. The associa tion, on behalf of the proprietary lessees, may contract for the sale of real estate in the cooperative, but the contract is not binding until approved pursuant to subsections A and B. After such approval, the association has all powers necessary and app ropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded, and the proceeds of such sale are distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Except to the extent that any provisions in the declaration l imit the amount that may be received by a proprietary lessee upon termination, as set forth in subdivision A 12 of § 55.1-2116, proceeds of the sale must be distributed to holders of liens against the association and against the cooperative interests and to proprietary lessees, all as their interests may appear, in accordance with subsections D and E. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each proprietary lessee and his suc cessors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his unit. During the period of such occupancy, each proprietary lessee and his successors in interest remain liable for all assessments a nd other obligations imposed on proprietary lessees by this chapter or the declaration. D. Following t ermination of the cooperative, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for proprietary lessees and holders of liens against the association and the cooperative interests , as their interests may appear. The declaration may provide that all creditors of the association have priority over any interests of proprietary lessees and creditors of proprietary lessees. Where the declaration provides such a priority, following ter mination, creditors of the association holding liens on the cooperative that were recorded or docketed before termination may enforce their liens in the same manner as any lienholder, and all other creditors of the association are to be treated as if the y had perfected liens against the cooperative immediately before termination. Unless the declaration provides that all creditors of the association have such priority: 1. The l ien of each creditor of the association that was perfected against the association before termination becomes a lien against each cooperative interest upon termination as of the date the lien was perfected; 2. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens against the cooperative interests immediately before termination; 3. The amounts of the liens of the associations creditors described in subdivisions 1 and 2 against each of the cooperative interests must be proportionate to the ratio that that coop erative interests common expense liability bears to the common expense liability of all the cooperative interests; 4. The lien of each creditor of each proprietary lessee that was perfected before termination continues as a lien against that proprietary lessees cooperative interest as of the date the lien was perfected; and 5. The assets of the association shall be distributed to all proprietary lessees and all lienholders against their cooperative interests as their interests may appear in the order describ ed in subdivisions 1 through 4, and creditors of the association are not entitled to payment from any proprietary lessee in excess of the amount of the creditors lien against that proprietary lessees cooperative interest. E. The respect ive interests of proprietary lessees referred to in subsections C and D are as follows: 1. Excep t as provided in subdivision 2, the respective interests of proprietary lessees are the fair market values of their cooperative interests immediately before the termination, as determined by one or more independent appraisers selected by the association. Appraisers selected shall hold a designation awarded by a major, nationwide testing or certifying professional appraisal society or association. The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the proprietary lessees and becomes final unless disapproved within 30 days after distribution by proprietary lessees of cooperative interests to which 25 percent of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any proprietary lessees interest to that of all proprietary les sees is determined by dividing the fair market value of that proprietary lessees cooperative interest by the total fair market values of all the cooperative interests. 2. If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value of the unit or limited common element before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all proprietary lessees are their respective ownership interests in the association immediately before the termination.

Except as p rovided in the declaration, the bylaws, subsection B, or other provisions of this chapter, the executive board may act in all instances on behalf of the association. In the performance of their duties, the officers and members of the executive board are required to exercise (i) the care required of fiduciaries of the proprietary lessees if appointed by the declarant and (ii) ordinary and reasonable care if elected by the proprietary lessees. B. The executi ve board may not act on behalf of the association to amend the declaration; to terminate the cooperative; to elect members of the executive board, except as provided in the declaration pursuant to subsection F; or to determine the qualifications, powers, and duties or terms of office of executive board members. The executive board may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of any term. C. Within 30 d ays after adoption of any proposed budget for the cooperative, the executive board shall provide a summary of the budget to all the proprietary lessees and shall set a date for a meeting of the proprietary lessees to consider ratification of the budget. Such meeting shall be held not less than 14 nor more than 30 days after mailing of the summary. The meeting place, date, and time shall be provided with the budget summary. Unless at that meeting a majority of all the proprietary lessees or any larger vo te specified in the declaration reject the budget, the budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is present. In the event the proposed budget is rejected, the periodic budget last ratified by the proprietary lessees shall be continued until such time a s the proprietary lessees ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the executive board. D. Subject to subsection E, the declaration may provide for a period of declarant control of the association, during which period a declarant, or persons designated by him, may appoint and remove the officers and members of the executive board. Regardless of the perio d provided in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates no later than the earlier of (i) 60 days after conveyance of 75 percent of the cooperative interests that may be created to proprietary lessees other than a declarant, (ii) two years after all declarants have ceased to offer cooperative interests for sale in the ordinary course of business, or (iii) two years after any development right to add new units was last exercised. A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint a nd remove officers and members of the executive board before termination of that period, but in that event he may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or executive board, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective. E. No later th an 60 days after conveyance of 25 percent of the cooperative interests that may be created to proprietary lessees other than a declarant, at least one member and at least 25 percent of the members of the executive board must be elected by proprietary les sees other than the declarant. No later than 60 days after conveyance of 50 percent of the cooperative interests that may be created to proprietary lessees other than a declarant, at least one-third of the members of the executive board must be elected b y proprietary lessees other than the declarant. F. Unless the declaration provides for the selection of one or more independent members of the executive board, no later than the termination of any period of declarant control the proprietary lessees shall elect an executive board of at least three members, at least a majority of whom must be proprietary lessees. To the extent that the declaration so provides, the members of the executive board appointed by the declarant may continue to serve out their terms, and the declarant may continue to appoint a minority of t he members of the executive board until all of the development rights reserved by the declarant have been exercised or have expired. In addition, the declaration may provide for the selection of one or more independent members of the executive board, who are neither proprietary lessees nor affiliated directly or indirectly in any way with the declarant, by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the executive board. The executive board shall elect the officers. The executive board members and officers sh all take office upon election. G. Notwithstan ding any provision of the declaration or bylaws to the contrary, the proprietary lessees, by a two-thirds vote of all persons entitled to vote at any meeting of the proprietary lessees at which a quorum is present, may remove any member of the executive board with or without cause, other than a member appointed by the declarant.

No special declarant rights created or reserved under this chapter may be transferred except by an instrument evidencing the transfer recorded in every county or city in which any portion of the cooperative is located. The instrument is not effective unless execute d by the transferee. B. Upon transf er of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows: 1. A tra nsferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer and remains liable for warranty obligations imposed upon him by this chapter. Lack of privity does not deprive any proprietary lessee of standing to maintain an action to enforce any obligation of the transferor. 2. If a successor to any special declarant right is an affiliate of a declarant, the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the successor for any obligations or liabilities of th e successor relating to the cooperative. 3. If a transferor retains any special declarant rights, but transfers other special declarant rights to a successor who is not an affiliate of the declarant, the transferor is liable for any obligations or liabilities imposed on a declarant by this chapter or by the declaration relating to the retained special declarant rights and arising after the transfer. 4. A transferor has no liability for any act or omission or any breach of a contractual or warranty obligation arising from the exercise of a special declarant right by a successor declar ant who is not an affiliate of the transferor. C. Unless othe rwise provided in a security agreement, in case of foreclosure of a security agreement, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a security agreement or sale under receivership proceedings or the Bankruptcy Code as codified in Title 11 of the Uni ted States Code, of any cooperative interests owned by a declarant or of real estate in a cooperative subject to development rights: 1. A per son acquiring all the cooperative interests or real estate being foreclosed or sold shall succeed, but only upon his request, to all special declarant rights related to that property held by that declarant or only to any rights reserved in the declaratio n pursuant to § 55.1-2125 and held by that declarant to maintain models, sales offices, and signs. 2. The judgment or instrument conveying title shall provide for transfer of only the special declarant rights requested. D. Upon forecl osure, tax sale, judicial sale, sale by a trustee under a security agreement, or sale under receivership proceedings or the Bankruptcy Code as codified in Title 11 of the United States Code, of all cooperative interests or real estate in a cooperative ow ned by a declarant: 1. The d eclarant ceases to have any special declarant rights, and 2. The period of declarant control as provided in subsection D of § 55.1-2134 terminates unless the judgment or instrument conveying title provides for transfer of all special declaran t rights held by that declarant to a successor declarant. E. The liabili ties and obligations of a person who succeeds to special declarant rights are as follows: 1. A suc cessor to any special declarant right who is an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed on the transferor by this chapter or by the declaration. 2. A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in subdivision 3 or 4, who is not an affiliate of a declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed by this chapter or the declaration: a. On a declarant that relate to his exercise or non-exercise of special declarant rights; or b. On his transferor, other than: (1) Misrepresentations by any previous declarant; (2) Warranty obligations on improvements made by any previous declarant or made before the cooperative was created; (3) Breach of any fiduciary obligation by any previous declarant or his appointees to the executive board; or (4) Any liability or obligation imposed on the transferor as a result of the transferors acts or omissions after the transfer. 3. A successor to only a right reserved in the declaration to maintain models, sales offices, and signs pursuant to § 55.1-2125, if he is not an affiliate of a declarant, may not exerc ise any other special declarant right and is not subject to any liability or obligation as a declarant, except the obligation to provide a current public offering statement, any liability arising as a result of providing a public offering statement, and obligations under Article 5 (§ 55.1-2173 et seq.). 4. A successor to all special declarant rights held by his transferor who is not an affiliate of that declarant and who succeeded to those rights pursuant to a deed or other instrument of conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or a judgment or instrument conveying title to cooperative interests or real estate subject to development rights under subsection C may declare his intention in a recorded instrument to hold those rights solely for tra nsfer to another person. After declaring such an intention in a recorded instrument, until transferring all special declarant rights to any person acquiring title to any cooperative interest or real estate subject to development rights owned by the succe ssor, or until recording an instrument permitting exercise of all those rights, that successor may not exercise any of those rights other than any right held by his transferor to control the executive board in accordance with the provisions of subsection D of § 55.1-2134 for the duration of any period of declarant control, and any attempted exercise of those rights is void. So long as a successor declarant may not exercise special declarant rights under this subsection, he is not subject to any liabi lity or obligation as a declarant other than liability for his acts and omissions under subsection D of § 55.1-2134. F. Nothing in this section subjects any successor to a special declarant right to any claims against or other obligations of a transferor declarant, other than claims and obligations arising under this chapter or the declaration.

The total amount of insurance after applicatio n of any deductibles shall be not less than 80 percent of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations, and other items normally excluded from p roperty policies; and 2.

E. An insuranc e policy issued to the association does not prevent a proprietary lessee from obtaining insurance for his own benefit. F. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, upon written request, to any proprietary lessee or holder of a security interest. The insurer issuing the policy may not can cel or refuse to renew it until 30 days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each proprietary lessee, and each holder of a security interest to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known address. G. Any portion of the cooperative for which insurance is required under this section that is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless (i) the cooperative is terminated; (ii) repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance; or (iii) 80 percent of the proprietary lessees, including every proprietary lessee of a unit or assigned limited common element that will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild. The cost of repair or rep lacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If the entire cooperative is not repaired or replaced, (a) the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements must be used to restore the damaged area to a conditi on compatible with the remainder of the cooperative and (b) except to the extent that other persons will be distributees, the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements that are not rebuilt must be distributed to the proprietary lessees of those units and the proprietary lessees of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lien holders, as their interests may appear, and the remainder of the proceeds must be distributed to all the proprietary lessee s or lien holders, as their interests may appear, in proportion to the common expense liabilities of all the cooperative interests. If the proprietary lessees vote not to rebuild any unit, the allocated interests of the cooperative interest of which that unit is a part are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under subsection A of § 55.1-2105, and the association shall promptly prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocatio ns. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, § 55.1-2128 governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the cooperative is terminated. H. The provisi ons of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a cooperative whose units are all restricted to nonresidential use. History History. 1982, c. 277, § 55-470; 2019, c. 712.

Except for assessments under subsections C, D, E, and F, all common expenses shall be assessed against all the cooperative interests in accordance with the allocations set forth in the declaration pursuant to subsection A of § 55.1-2118.Any past-due common expen se assessment or installment bears interest at the rate established by the association not exceeding 18 percent per year. C. To the exte nt required by the declaration: 1. Any c ommon expense associated with the maintenance, repair, or replacement of a limited common element must be assessed equally against the cooperative interests for the units to which that limited common element is assigned, or in any other proportion that t he declaration provides; 2. Any common expense or portion benefiting fewer than all of the units must be assessed exclusively against the cooperative interests for the units benefited; and 3. The costs of insurance must be assessed in proportion to risk, and the costs of utilities must be assessed in proportion to usage. D.

Commo n expenses may be assessed against all cooperative interests in accordance with the standards in general use from time to time among full-service senior housing communities in the United States for the purpose of fairly and equitably establishing the fee s and charges imposed on their residents to pay for all common expenses of such senior housing communities, including the expenses of providing services and amenities, such standards to be determined by the executive board of the association, acting reas onably; 2. Common expenses may be assessed against any cooperative interest that has been created pursuant to the declaration but as to which construction of the unit appurtenant to such cooperat ive interest has not been completed, provided that nothing contained in this subdivision shall relieve the declarant of its obligations under subsection B of § 55.1-2138; and 3. Common expenses may be assessed against any cooperative interest as to which the unit appurtenant to such cooperative interest has been completed until the unit is initially permanentl y occupied, provided, however, that all such cooperative interests shall pay all direct expenses of the association related to such cooperative interests and any common expenses that directly benefit such cooperative interest, in each case, determined in accordance with the provisions set forth in the declaration or the associations bylaws, provided, however, that if neither the declaration nor the bylaws contain such provisions, then such expenses shall be paid in accordance with the allocations se t forth in the declaration pursuant to subsection A of § 55.1-2118. G. If common e xpense liabilities are reallocated, common expense assessments and any installment not yet due shall be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities.

The associa tion has a lien on a cooperative interest for any assessment levied against that cooperative interest or fines imposed against its owner from the time the assessment or fines become due. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, fees, charges, late char ges, fines, and interest charged pursuant to subdivisions A 11 and 12 of § 55.1-2133 are enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first in stallment becomes due. Upon nonpayment of the assessment, the proprietary lessee may be evicted in the same manner as provided by law in the case of an unlawful holdover by a commercial tenant, and the lien may be foreclosed as provided by this section. The associations lien may be foreclosed (i) by judicial sale in like manner as a mortgage on real estate or (ii) by power of sale as provided in subsection I. B. A lien unde r this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a cooperative interest except (i) liens and encumbrances on the cooperative that the association creates, assumes, or takes subject to; (ii) any first security interest encumbering only the c ooperative interest of a proprietary lessee and perfected before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent; and (iii) liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the cooperative or the cooperative interest. The lien is also prior to the security interests described in clause (ii) to the extent of the common expense assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the association pursuant to subsection A of § 55.1-2133 that would have become due in the absence of acceleration during the six months immediately preceding institution of an action to enforce the lien. This subsection does not affect the priority of mechanics or materialmens liens or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association. The lien under this section is not subject to homestead or other exemptions. C. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same property, those liens have equal priority. D. Recording o f the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien. No further recordation or filing of any claim of lien for assessment under this section is required. E. A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within three years after the full amount of the assessment becomes due. F. This sectio n does not prohibit actions to recover sums for which subsection A creates a lien or prohibit an association from taking a transfer in lieu of foreclosure. G. A judgment in any action brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party. H. Upon writte n request, the association shall furnish to a proprietary lessee a statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against his cooperative interest. The statement shall be in recordable form. The statement shall be furnished within 10 business d ays after receipt of the request and is binding on the association, the executive board, and every proprietary lessee. I. The associa tion, upon nonpayment of assessments and compliance with this subsection, may sell the cooperative interest. Sale may be at a public sale or by private negotiation and at any time and place, but every aspect of the sale, including the method, advertising , time, place, and terms, must be reasonable. The association shall give to the proprietary lessee and any sublessees of the proprietary lessee reasonable written notice of the time and place of any public sale or, if a private sale is intended, of the i ntention of entering into a contract to sell and of the time after which a private disposition may be made. The same notice must also be sent to any other person who has a recorded interest in the cooperative interest that would be cut off by the sale, b ut only if the interest was on record seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date of any public sale or seven weeks before the date specified in the notice as the date after which a private sale may be made. The notices required by th is subsection may be sent to any address reasonable in the circumstances. Sale may not be held until five weeks after the sending of the notice. The association may buy at any public sale and, if the sale is conducted by a fiduciary or other person not r elated to the association, at a private sale. J. The proceed s of a sale under subsection I shall be applied in the following order: 1. The r easonable expenses of sale; 2. The reasonable expenses of securing possession before sale; holding, maintaining, and preparing the cooperative interest for sale, including payment of taxes and other governmental cha rges, premiums on hazard and liability insurance, and, to the extent provided for by agreement between the association and the proprietary lessee, reasonable attorney fees and other legal expenses incurred by the association; 3. Satisfaction in the order of priority of any prior claims of record; 4. Satisfaction of the associations lien; 5. Satisfaction in the order of priority of any subordinate claim of record; and 6. Remittance of any excess to the proprietary lessee. Unless otherwise agreed, the proprietary lessee is liable for any deficiency. K. If a cooper ative interest is sold under subsection I, a good faith purchaser for value acquires the proprietary lessees interest in the cooperative interest free of the associations debt that gave rise to the lien under which the sale occurred and any subor dinate interest, even though the association or other person conducting the sale failed to comply with the requirements of this section. The person conducting the sale under subsection I shall execute a conveyance to the purchaser sufficient to convey th e cooperative interest that states that the conveyance is executed by him, after a foreclosure by power of sale of the associations lien and that he has power to make the sale. Signature and title or authority of the person signing the conveyance as grantor and a recital of the facts of nonpayment of the assessment and of the giving of the notices required by subsection I are sufficient proof of the facts recited and of his authority to sign. Further proof of authority is not required even though th e association is named as grantee in the conveyance. L. At any time before the association has disposed of the cooperative interest or entered into a contract for its disposition under the power of sale, the proprietary lessee or the holder of any subordinate security interest may cure the proprietary lessees defaul t and prevent sale or other disposition by tendering the performance due under the security agreement, including any amounts due because of exercise of a right to accelerate, plus the reasonable expenses of proceeding to foreclosure incurred to the time of tender, including reasonable attorney fees of the creditor.

For the pur poses of this section:Disabled means suffering from a severe, chronic physical or mental impairme nt that results in substantial functional limitations.Elderly means not less than 62 years of age . B. A declarant of a cooperative containing conversion buildings shall give each of the tenants of a conversion building formal notice of the conversion at the time the cooperative is registered by the Common Interest Community Board. This notice shall advise each tena nt of (i) the offering price of the cooperative interests for the unit he occupies; (ii) the projected common expense assessments against that cooperative interest for at least the first year of the cooperatives operation; (iii) any relocation servic es, public or private, of which the declarant is aware; (iv) any measure taken or to be taken by the declarant to reduce the incidence of tenant dislocation; and (v) the details of the relocation plan, if any is provided by the declarant, to assist tenan ts in relocating. No tenant or subtenant may be required to vacate upon less than 120 days notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct that disturbs other tenants peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tena ncy may not be altered during that period. Until the expiration of the 120-day period, the declarant shall have no right of access to the unit except as provided in this section and in subsection A of § 55.1-1229 except that, upon 45 days written notice to the tenant, the declarant may enter the unit in order to make additional repairs, decorations, alterations, or improvements, provided that (a) the making of the same does not constitute an actual or constructive eviction of the tenant and (b) s uch entry is made either with the consent of the tenant or only at times when the tenant is absent from the unit. Failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession. The declarant shall also provide general notice to the tenants of the cooperative or proposed cooperative at the time of application to the Common Interest Community Board, in addition to the formal notice required by this subsection. C. For 60 days after delivery or mailing of the formal notice described in subsection B, the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey the cooperative interest for each unit or proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases the unit associated with that cooperative interest. A specific statement of the purchase price and the amount of any initial or special cooperative fee due from the purchaser on or before settlement of the purchase contract and the basis of such fee shall be giv en to the tenant. If a tenant fails to purchase the cooperative interest during that 60-day period, the offeror shall not offer to dispose of an interest in that cooperative interest during the following 180 days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection does not apply to any cooperative interest in a conversion building if the unit that is part of that cooperative interest will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use or t he boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the residential unit before conversion. D. If a seller , in violation of subsection C, conveys a cooperative interest to a purchaser for value who has no knowledge of the violation, that conveyance extinguishes any right a tenant may have under subsection C to purchase that cooperative interest if the deed s tates that the seller has complied with subsection C but does not affect the right of a tenant to recover damages from the seller for a violation of subsection C. E. If a notice of conversion specifies a date by which a unit or proposed unit must be vacated, and otherwise complies with the provisions of §§ 55.1-1202 and 55.1-1225, the notice also constitutes a notice to vacate as specified by §§ 55.1-1410, 55.1-1202 , and 55.1-1225. The details of the relocation plan, if any is provided by the declarant for assisting tenants in relocating, shall also be provided to the tenant. F. Any localit y may require by ordinance that the declarant of a conversion cooperative file with that governing body all information required by the Common Interest Community Board pursuant to § 55.1-2176 and a copy of the formal notice required by subsection B. S uch information shall be filed with that governing body when the application for registration is filed with the Common Interest Community Board, and such copy of the formal notice shall be filed with that governing body whenever it is sent to tenants. No fee shall be imposed for such filings with a governing body. G. The governi ng body of any county utilizing the urban county executive form of optional government (§§ 15.2-800 through 15.2-858) or the county manager plan of optional government (§§ 15.2-702 through 15.2-749), or of any city or town adjoining any such county, may require by ordinance that the declarant of any residential cooperative containing conversion buildings converted from multi-family rental use shall reimburse any tenant displaced by the conversion for amounts actually expended to relocate as a result of such dislocation. The reimbursement shall not be required to exceed the amount that the tenant would have been entitled to receive under §§ 25.1-407 and 25.1-415 if the real estate comprising the condominium had been condemned by the De partment of Highways and Transportation. H. Any localit y may require by ordinance that elderly or disabled tenants, occupying as their residence up to 20 percent of the apartments or units in a cooperative containing conversion buildings at the time of issuance of the general notice required by subsection B, be offered leases or extensions of leases on the apartments or units they occupy or on other apartments or units of at least equal size and overall quality for up to three years beyond the date of such notice.The terms and conditions of such leases or e xtensions of leases shall be as agreed upon by the lessor and the lessee, provided that the rent for such apartment or unit shall not be in excess of reasonable rent for comparable apartments or units in the same market area as such conversion building.S uch leases or extensions shall not be required, however, in the case of any apartments or units that will, in the course of the conversion, be substantially altered in physical layout, restricted exclusively to nonresidential use, or be converted in such a manner as to require relocation of the tenant in premises outside of the project being converted. I. Nothing in this section permits termination of a lease by a declarant in violation of its terms.

Attorney fees.  While a member of a real estate cooperative asserted that the trial court erred by concluding that there was no adversity, the member did not assign error to the courts reliance on this improper factor in reaching its decision to deny attorneys fees.

The notice shall further inform the time-share estate owner of the right to bring a court action in the circuit court of the county or city where the time-share project is located to assert the nonexistence of a debt or any other defenses of the time-share estate owner to the sale. 2. After expiration of the 60-day notice period provided in subdivision 1, the association may appoint a trustee to conduct the sale. The appointment of the trustee shall be filed in the clerks office of the circuit court in the county or city in which the time-share project is located. It shall be the duty of the clerk in whose office such appointment is filed to record and index the same, as provided in this subsection, in the name s of the persons identified therein as well as in the name of the association.

This sectio n applies to all time-share estate programs and, when provided by the time-share instrument, to time-share use programs. B. A time-shar e project may be terminated in whole by the developer at any time and for any reason if such developer is the sole owner of all time-shares within the time-share project. Such termination shall be accomplished by the developer executing and recording a t ermination document where the time-share instrument is recorded. Time-shares subject to this section also may be terminated by written agreement of the time-share owners having at least 51 percent of the time-shares or by written agreement of such larger percentage of the time-share owners as may otherwise be provided in the time-share instrument. The termination agreement shall specify a date upon which it shall become void, unless it is recorded before that date in the clerks office of the appropr iate court where the time-share project is located. C. If the term ination agreement sets forth the material terms of a contract or proposed contract under which an estate or interests equal to the sum of the time-shares are to be sold and designates a trustee to effect the sale, the termination agreement becomes effect ive upon recordation, and title to that estate or interest vests upon termination in the trustee for the benefit of the time-share owners, to be transferred pursuant to the contract. If the termination agreement does not set forth the material terms of a contract or proposed contract under which an estate or interests equal to the sum of the time-shares are to be sold and designates a trustee to effect the sale, the termination agreement becomes effective upon recordation, and title to an estate or inte rests equal to the sum of the time-shares therein vests upon termination in the time-share owners in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection F. Liens on the time-shares shall accordingly encumber the respective interests; and i n this instance, any co-owner of that estate or interest may maintain an action for partition or for allotment or sale in lieu of partition pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth. D. Except as o therwise specified in the termination agreement, so long as the former time-share owners or their trustee holds title to the estate or interests equal to the sum of the time-shares, each former time-share owner and his successor in interest have the same rights with respect to the use, enjoyment, and occupancy in the former time-share unit that such former time-share owner and his successor in interest would have had if termination had not occurred, together with the same liabilities and other obligatio ns imposed by this act or the time-share instrument. E. After termi nation of all time-shares in a time-share project and adequate provision for payment of the claims of the creditors for time-share expenses, distribution shall be made, in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection F, to the forme r time-share owners and their successors in interest of (i) the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section, (ii) the proceeds of any personalty held for the use and benefit of the former time-share owners, and (iii) any other funds held for the use an d benefit of the former time-share owners. F. The time-sh are instrument may specify the respective fractional or percentage interest that will be owned by each former time-share owner after termination, in accordance with the provisions of this section. Otherwise, not more than 180 days prior to the terminatio n, an appraisal shall be made of the fair market value of each time-share by one or more impartial qualified appraisers selected either by the trustee designated in the termination agreement or by the managing entity if no trustee was so designated. The appraisal shall also state the corresponding fractional or percentage interests calculated in proportion to those values and in accordance with this subsection. A notice stating all of those values and corresponding interests and the return address of th e sender shall be sent by certified or registered mail, by the managing entity or the trustee designated in the termination agreements, to all of the time-share owners. The appraisal governs the magnitude of each interest unless (i) at least 25 percent o f the time-share owners deliver, within 60 days after the date the notices were mailed, written disapprovals to the return address of the sender of the notice or (ii) the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, entered during or after that p eriod, holds that the appraisal should be set aside. The appraisal and the calculation of interests shall be made in accordance with the following: 1. If th e termination agreement sets forth the material terms of a contract or proposed contract for the sale of the estate or interests equal to the sum of the time-shares, each time-share conferring a right of occupancy during a limited number of time periods shall be appraised as if the time until the date specified for the conveyance of the property had already elapsed. Otherwise, each time-share of that kind shall be appraised as if the time until the date specified pursuant to subsection B had already ela psed. 2. The interest of each time-share owner is the value of the time-share he owned divided by the sum of the values of all time-shares in the unit or units to which his time-share applies. G. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against all of the time-shares in a time-share project does not of itself terminate those time-shares.

A possibili ty of reverter contained in a reverter deed for a time-share estate subject to reverter is valid, is enforceable in law and in equity, and shall operate to transfer title to the time-share estate from each grantee in such deed back to the developer, prov ided that the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The r everter deed from the developer contains the possibility of reverter by insertion of the language required by subsection E; 2. A grantee in the reverter deed is in default and has been provided after such default with at least two written notices to this effect with no less than a 10-calendar day right to cure in each notice; 3. A grantee in the reverter deed has been provided with no less than 30 calendar days within which to cure the default before exercise of the possibility of reverter occurs; 4. At the time of exercise of the possibility of reverter, the developer is the sole holder of the note and the sole beneficiary under the deed of trust; 5. The exercise by the developer of the possibility of reverter is evidenced by an affidavit duly recorded where the reverter deed was recorded that contains the following information: a. A description of the time-share project and time-share estate and a statement that, upon recordation of the affidavit, title to such time-share estate reverts back to the developer; b.

The signature of a duly authorized representative of the developer verified under oath as to its truth of the statements contained in such affidavit; and 6. A copy of the recorded affidavit described in subdivision A 5 is sent by the developer to each purchaser at his address as maintained by the developer or the association, along with th e statement from the developer explaining the consequences of such affidavit with emphasis on subdivisions A 5 a, d, and e.

The foregoing shall not be deemed to apply to any purchaser at foreclosure or grantee in a deed in li eu of foreclosure, provided that the purchaser or grantee is a financial institution and the mortgagee, creditor, or beneficiary under the instrument being foreclosed or giving rise to the deed in lieu of foreclosure.

Rather, society prefers to keep real property within the family as most broadly defined, or within the hands of those whom the deceased has designated. United States v. 198.73 Acres of Land, 800 F.2d 434, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 30527 (4th Cir. 1986). The statute of distribution was not the appropriate law to use in determining the heirs of the last owner of record although he directed his executors to sell the property and divide the proceeds among his heirs, since the land was never sold. When the conversion was intended for a particular purpose, and the purpose fails, equity regar ds the owner as not having directed a conversion. The purpose of dividing the proceeds from the sale of real estate among the immediate heirs was never carried out. Therefore there was no equitable conversion and the land retained its character as real p roperty. United States v. 198.73 Acres of Land, 800 F.2d 434, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 30527 (4th Cir. 1986). Commonwealth estopped from taking inconsistent positions.  Where the Commonwealth took the position that the heirs were entitled to six percent of the condemnation proceeds and that the Commonwealth was entitled to the ot her 94%, it was estopped from taking a view inconsistent with its previous position since had the heirs abandoned the property, they would not have been entitled to receive any of the proceeds. One premise of the Commonwealths position before the dis trict court, therefore, must have been that the third-party defendants had not abandoned the property.

Necessity for inquest.  When the title to land fails from defect of heirs, or when from any cause there ceases to be an individual proprietor of the land, it reverts back to the communit y, and inquest of office is necessary. Sands v. Lynham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291, 1876 Va. LEXIS 24 (1876). Nature and p urpose of inquest.  An inquest does not constitute an escheat. It is simply the means by which the State furnishes authentic record evidence of her title. Sands v. Lynham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291, 1876 Va. LEXIS 24 (1876). Irregularity in proceedings.  As the title of the State does not depend upon the inquest, it cannot be affected by any errors or irregularities in the proceedings of the escheator. Sands v. Ly nham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291, 1876 Va. LEXIS 24 (1876). Entry by State when land held by adverse possession.  If the possession of land be vacant at the death of the owner, both title and possession are at once transferred to the State; but if the land be held by adverse possession, the State must enter by her officers. Such an entry, however, is not essential to the States title. Sands v. Lynham, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 291, 1876 Va. LEXIS 24 (1876).

If within 1 20 days from the date of sale, a purchaser submits evidence satisfactory to the State Treasurer that the property described in the grant does not exist or was improperly escheated, the State Treasurer may refund the purchase price, less the expenses of s ale and the escheators fee.

After any s ale of escheated lands and upon certification verified by oath of the local treasurer or other officer charged with the collection of local real estate taxes that the land so sold was, at the time of escheat to the Commonwealth, subject to the lien of un paid local real estate taxes or that the land so sold was, at any time prior to sale, subject to other assessments, including liens for demolition, cutting or removing weeds, or abating any nuisance on the escheated land, all of which assessments were va lidly assessed, levied, or imposed by the locality on the lands within 20 years preceding the date of the escheat or inquest, the State Treasurer shall, upon receipt of the proceeds of sale, deduct the escheators commission and costs of the inquest a nd sale.

[Reserved.] II. Decided Under Prior Law. I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Division fence statutes, this section and § 55-318, are not unconstitutional special legislation as applied to owners of adjoining property who do not want land fenced or to contribute to cost of the fencing. Holy Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, 241 Va. 425, 404 S.E.2d 48, 77 Va. Law Rep. 2257, 1991 Va. LEXIS 46 (1991). Classification scheme is not unreasonable or arbitrary.  The classification scheme in this section, discriminatory though it may be, is not unreasonable or arbitrary simply because it favors owners of land used for agri cultural purposes over owners of industrial, commercial, or subdivided property. Without question, the opt-out provision applies to all persons who are similarly situated and applies to all parts of the Commonwealth where like conditions exist. To that extent the provisions are general. Holy Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, 241 Va. 425, 404 S.E.2d 48, 77 Va. Law Rep. 2257, 1991 Va. LEXIS 46 (1991). Legislative intent.  The 1970 General Assembly in amending this section, unlike the 1887 General Assembly, was faced with continued urbanization in the land use of the Commonwealth ev idenced by proliferation of residential subdivisions, commercial shopping centers, and industrial complexes and was also confronted with the division fence law which permitted owners of commercial, industrial, and subdivided property whose lands abutted agricultural property to allow their land to lie open without being fenced. With this collision of interests between rural and urban Virginia, the mutual benefit, convenience, and welfare of all the Commonwealths citizens demanded that conditions su ch as the probability of livestock roaming through residential neighborhoods, commercial shopping centers, industrial parks, and associated streets, be avoided. Holy Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, 241 Va. 425, 404 S.E.2d 48, 77 Va. Law Rep. 2257, 1991 Va. LEXI S 46 (1991). The legislature decided that agricultural owners should have primary control over establishment of division fences and that the cost of erecting a division fence between agricultural land and commercial, industrial, and subdivided land should be shared equally, and not be borne solely by the agricultural owner. Holy Hill Farm Corp. v. Rowe, 241 Va. 425, 404 S.E.2d 48, 77 Va. Law Rep. 2257, 1991 Va. LEXIS 46 (1991 ). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The case cited below was decided under prior law.

The owner o f the land on which a trespass as described in § 55.1-2835 was committed shall have the right, within 90 days after the discovery of such trespass and the identity of the trespasser, to notify the trespasser and to appoint an experienced timber estima tor to determine the amount of damages. For the purposes of determining damages, the value of the timber cut shall be calculated by first determining the value of the timber on the stump. Within 30 days after receiving notice of the alleged trespass and of the appointment of such estimator, the alleged trespasser, if he does not deny the fact of trespass, shall appoint an experienced timber estimator to participate with the one already so appointed in the estimation of damages. If the two estimators can not agree, they shall select a third person, experienced and disinterested, who shall make a decision that shall be final and conclusive and not subject to appeal. The estimation of damages and the rendition of statement must be effected within 30 days f rom the receipt of notice of appointment, by the trespasser, of an estimator.If the alleged trespasser fails to appoint an estimator within the prescribed time, or to notify within such time that the allegation of the fact of trespass is disputed, the es timator appointed by the injured party may make an estimate, and collection or recovery may be had accordingly. B.

I.[Reserved.] II.Decided Under Prior Law. Reforestation costs not dependent on establishing value of improperly t aken timber.  There is nothing in subsection B of § 55-332 that states that an owner is only entitled to reforestation costs, legal costs, or the costs of ascertaining the v alue of the timber after he or she first establishes the value of the timber that was improperly taken. Instead, the statute makes clear that the person who removed the timber shall be liable to pay all of these damages to the owner. Chacey v. Garvey, 29 1 Va. 1, 781 S.E.2d 357, 2015 Va. LEXIS 185 (2015). Plaintiff s estimate of compensatory damages was properly admitted where plaintiff a ppointed a principal in forestry services corporation, as a timber estimator, and he, with the assistance of a consulting forester, prepared the final report.

Attorneys fees not directly associated legal fees.  Prevailing property owner on a timber trespass claim was not entitled to attorney fees where although subsection B of § 55-332 provided for any directly associ ated legal costs that an owner incurred as a result of the trespass, the General Assembly had not included the right to recover attorneys fees. Chacey v. Garvey, 291 Va. 1, 781 S.E.2d 357, 2015 Va. LEXIS 185 (2015). Strictly construing the plain language of subsection B of § 55-332, as the Supreme Court of Virginia is required to do, a prevailing party under the statute is entitled to recover any directly associated legal costs that she incurred as a result of the trespass. She is not, however, entitled to recover attorneys fees. Chacey v. Garvey, 291 Va. 1, 781 S.E.2d 357, 2015 Va. LEXIS 185 (2015).

Exculpatory provisio ns.  Parties could enter into exculpatory agreements and no exception at law precluded a private self-storage facility, such as the corporation, from limiting its risk as to its customers  moreover, the court was unwilling to create such an exception under the circumstances of the case  accordingly, the corporations liability was limited pursuant to the exculpatory provisions contained in the rental agreem ent. There was no basis to conclude that the corporation possessed an unfair bargaining position over the renter, nor that the exculpatory clause contained in the rental agreement violated public policy; the release, interpreted based on its plain and un ambiguous language, could be readily understood by a reasonable person in the renters position; and finally, the renters asserted claim was clearly within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.

If any occupant is in default under a rental agreement, the owner shall notify the o ccupant of such default by regular mail at his last known address, or, if expressly provided for in the rental agreement, such notice may be given by electronic means. If such default is not cured within 10 days after its occurrence, then the owner may p roceed to enforce such lien by selling the contents of the occupants unit at public auction, for cash, and apply the proceeds to satisfaction of the lien, with the surplus, if any, to be disbursed as provided in this section. Before conducting such a public auction, the owner shall notify the occupant as prescribed in subsection C. The rental agreement may provide the occupant with the option to designate an alternative contact to receive the notices required by this section. Failure or refusal of a n occupant to designate an alternative contact shall not affect the rights or remedies afforded to an occupant or owner pursuant to the provisions of this section or any other provision of law. No alternative contact shall have any right to access the le ased space or any personal property stored within unless expressly stated otherwise in the rental agreement. 2. In the case of personal property having a fair market value in excess of $1,000, and against which a creditor has filed a financing statement in the name of the occupant at the State C orporation Commission or in the county or city where the self-service storage facility is located or in the county or city in the Commonwealth shown as the last known address of the occupant, or if such personal property is a watercraft required by the l aws of the Commonwealth to be registered and the Department of Wildlife Resources shows a lien on the certificate of title, the owner shall notify the lienholder of record, by certified mail, at the address on the financing statement or certificate of ti tle, at least 10 days prior to the time and place of the proposed public auction. If the owner of the personal property cannot be ascertained, the name of John Doe shall be substituted in the proceedings provided for in this section and no wr itten notice shall be required. Whenever a watercraft is sold pursuant to this subsection, the Department of Wildlife Resources shall issue a certificate of title and registration to the purchaser of such watercraft upon his application containing the se rial or motor number of the watercraft purchased, together with an affidavit by the lienholder, or by the person conducting the public auction, evidencing compliance with the provisions of this subsection. B. Whenever th e occupant is in default, the owner shall have the right to deny the occupant access to the leased space. C. After the o ccupant has been in default for a period of 10 days, and before the owner can sell the occupants personal property in accordance with this chapter, the owner shall send a further notice of default, by verified mail, postage prepaid, to the occupant a t his last known address, or, if expressly provided for in the rental agreement, such notice may be given by electronic means, provided that the sender retains sufficient proof of the electronic delivery, which may be an electronic receipt of delivery, a confirmation that the notice was sent by facsimile, or a certificate of service prepared by the sender confirming the electronic delivery. Such notice of default shall include: 1. An it emized statement of the owners claim, indicating the charges due on the date of the notice and the date when the charges became due; 2. A demand for payment of the charges due within a specified time not less than 20 days after the date of the notice; 3. A statement that the contents of the occupants leased space are subject to the owners lien; 4. A conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within the time stated, the contents of the occupants space will be sold at public auction at a specified time and place; and 5.

At any time prior to the public auction pursuant to this section, the occupant may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and thereby redeem the personal property. E. In the even t of a public auction pursuant to this section, the owner may satisfy his lien from the proceeds of the public auction and shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to the occupant or other lienholder referred to in this chapter. However, th e owner shall not be obligated to hold any balance for a lienholder of record notified pursuant to subdivision A 2, or any other lien creditor, that fails to claim an interest in the balance within 30 days of the public auction. So long as the owner comp lies with the provisions of this chapter, the owners liability to the occupant under this chapter shall be limited to the net proceeds received from the public auction of any personal property and, as to other lienholders, shall be limited to the net proceeds received from the public auction of any personal property covered by such superior lien. F. Any public auction of the personal property shall be held (i) at the self-service storage facility, (ii) at the nearest suitable place to where the personal property is held or stored, or (iii) online. G. A purchaser in good faith of any personal property sold or otherwise disposed of pursuant to this chapter takes such property free and clear of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid. H. Any notice made pursuant to this section shall be presumed delivered when it is (i) deposited with the United States Postal Service and properly addressed to the occupants last known address with postage prepaid or (ii) sent by electronic means, provided that t he sender retains sufficient proof of the electronic delivery, which may be an electronic receipt of delivery, a confirmation that the notice was sent by facsimile, or a certificate of service prepared by the sender confirming the electronic delivery. In the event of a dispute, the sender shall have the burden to demonstrate delivery of the notice of default. I. In the case of any motor vehicle, so long as the motor vehicle remains stored within such leased space, the owner shall have a lien on such vehicle in accordance with § 46.2-644.01.
