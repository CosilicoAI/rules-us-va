Circuit court properly dismissed requesters petition to obtain donor information from George Mason University (GMU) and a foundation because GMU and the found ation were separate and distinct entities, one being a public institution and the other being a private corporation; to the extent that while wearing her GMU hat, the GMU vice-president handled foundation documents, those documents remained foundation do cuments and as such, were not subject to the Virginia Freedom of Information Act.

Transparent GMU v. George Mason Univ., 298 Va. 222, 835 S.E.2d 544, 2019 Va. LEXIS 155 (2019). Circuit court properly dismissed requesters petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to obtain donor information from George Mason University (GMU) and a found ation because the foundations records were not subject to disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA); the foundation was not an entity of GMU for purposes of VFOIA because it was an independent non-stock corporation that coexist ed alongside GMU.

The governi ng board of each public institution of higher education and each accredited nonprofit private institution of higher education may provide by regulation or institution policy for the care, restitution, sale, destruction, or disposal of unclaimed personal property, whether lost or abandoned, in the possession of the institution. Whenever procedures in accordance with such regulations or institution policies and this section are followed and ownership cannot be established with respect to certain property, neither the institution nor any of its agents or employees is liable to any person claiming any interest in the property. B. In the case of tangible personal property, other than registered motor vehicles, lost or abandoned at a public institution of higher education or accredited nonprofit private institution of higher education: 1. The i nstitution, upon receipt of such property, shall make reasonable efforts to give notice that the property has been found to any person that the institution determines to reasonably appear to be the owner. The institution shall hold such property for at l east 120 days. The institution shall allow a claim upon satisfactory proof of such claim and payment of the institutions reasonable charges for storage or other services necessary to preserve the property. 2. After the 120-day period, the institution may sell the property to the highest bidder at public auction or by sealed bid at whatever location that the institution reasonably determines to afford the most favorable market for the property. The institution may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if it considers the price bid insufficient. The net proceeds of any such sale shall be held for at least 90 days and if n o claim is made on the property within that time, such funds shall be credited to the institutions operating fund. If the institution determines that the probable cost of sale of property will exceed the sale proceeds, the property is inherently dang erous, or the property may not lawfully be sold or used, the institution may provide for any such property, as appropriate under the circumstances, to be destroyed or discarded at an appropriate location, retained for use by the institution, or donated t o an appropriate charitable organization. 3. Any sale pursuant to this subsection shall be preceded by reasonable notice of the sale, taking into consideration the type and value of property. Such notice shall include at minimum the posting on a student bulletin board and publication in a school newspaper. The institution, by the same time, shall mail notice of the sale to the last known address of any person that the institution determines to reasonably appear to be the owner. C.

Notwithstanding any provisions of Chapter 12 of Title 46.2, the proceeds of any sale of a motor vehicle lost or abandoned on institutional property shal l be credited to the institutions operating fund after the 90-day holding period. The governing board of a public institution of higher education that has a campus or part of a campus in a locality that has not adopted such an ordinance may adopt reg ulations dealing with motor vehicles abandoned on such campus or such part of the campus. Such regulations shall comply with all provisions of Chapter 12 of Title 46.2 and have the same legal effect as though the institution is a political subdivision as defined in that chapter and the regulation is an ordinance. The proceeds from any sale resulting from such regulations shall be held for at least 90 days and if no claim to the motor vehicle is made within that time, such funds shall be credited to the institutions operating fund. D. Whenever an y intangible personal property is believed to be lost or abandoned on the campus of a public institution of higher education, it shall be administered as provided in Article 3 (§ 55.1-2524 et seq.) of Chapter 25 of Title 55.1.

This chapte r may be cited as the Preparing for the Top Jobs of the 21st Century: The Virginia Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2011, the Top Jobs Act, or TJ21. B. The objecti ve of this chapter is to fuel strong economic growth in the Commonwealth and prepare Virginians for the top job opportunities in the knowledge-driven economy of the 21st century by establishing a long-term commitment, policy, and framework for sustained investment and innovation that will (i) enable the Commonwealth to build upon the strengths of its excellent higher education system and achieve national and international leadership in college degree attainment and personal income and (ii) ensure that t hese educational and economic opportunities are accessible and affordable for all capable and committed Virginia students. C. In furthera nce of the objective set forth in subsection B, the following purposes shall inform the development and implementation of funding policies, performance criteria, economic opportunity metrics, and recommendations required by this chapter: 1. To en sure an educated workforce in the Commonwealth through a public-private higher education system whose hallmarks are instructional excellence, affordable access, economic impact, institutional diversity and managerial autonomy, cost-efficient operation, t echnological and pedagogical innovation, and reform-based investment; 2. To take optimal advantage of the demonstrated correlation between higher education and economic growth by investing in higher education in a manner that will generate economic growth, job creation, personal income growth, and revenues generated for state and local government in the Commonwealth; 3. To (i) place the Commonwealth among the most highly educated states and countries by conferring approximately 100,000 cumulative additional undergraduate degrees on Virginians between 2011 and 2025, accompanied by a comparable percentage increase in privately conferred undergraduate degrees in the Commonwealth over the same period and (ii) achieve this purpose by expanding enrollment of Virginians at public institutions of higher educ ation and private institutions of higher education, improving undergraduate graduation and retention rates in the higher education system in the Commonwealth, and increasing degree completion by Virginians with partial credit toward a college degree, inc luding students with ongoing job and family commitments who require access to nontraditional college-level educational opportunities; 4. To enhance personal opportunity and earning power for individual Virginians by (i) increasing college degree attainment in the Commonwealth, especially in high-demand, high-income fiel ds such as STEM and health care fields and (ii) providing information about the economic value and impact of individual degree programs by institution; 5. To promote university-based research that produces outside investment in the Commonwealth, fuels economic advances, triggers commercialization of new products and processes, fosters th e formation of new businesses, leads businesses to bring their facilities and jobs to the Commonwealth, and in other ways helps place the Commonwealth on the cutting edge of the knowledge-driven economy; 6. To support the national effort to enhance the security and economic competitiveness of the United States and secure a leading economic position for the Commonwealth through increased r esearch and instruction in STEM and related fields that require qualified faculty, appropriate research facilities and equipment, public-private and intergovernmental collaboration, and sustained state support; 7. To preserve and enhance the excellence and cost-efficiency of the Commonwealths higher education system through reform-based investment that promotes innovative instructional model s and pathways to degree attainment, including optimal use of physical facilities and instructional resources throughout the year, technology-enhanced instruction, sharing of instructional resources between colleges, universities, and other degree-granti ng entities in the Commonwealth, increased online learning opportunities for nontraditional students, improved rate and pace of degree completion, expanded availability of dual enrollment and advanced placement options and early college commitment progra ms, expanded comprehensive community college transfer options leading to bachelors degree completion, and enhanced college readiness before matriculation; 8. To realize the potential for enhanced benefits from the Restructured Higher Education Financial and Administrative Operations Act (§ 23.1-1000 et seq.) through a sustained commitmen t to the principles of autonomy, accountability, affordable access, and mutual trust and obligation underlying the restructuring initiative; 9. To establish a higher education funding framework and policy that promotes stable, predictable, equitable, and adequate funding, facilitates effective planning at the institutional and state levels, provides incentives for increased enrollment of Virginia students at public institutions of higher education and nonprofit private institutions of higher education, provides need-based financial aid for low-income and middle-income student s and families, relieves the upward pressure on tuition associated with loss of state support due to economic downturns or other causes, and provides financial incentives to promote innovation and enhanced economic opportunity in furtherance of the objec tive of this chapter set forth in subsection A; and 10. To recognize that the unique mission and contributions of each public institution of higher education and private institution of higher education is consistent with the desire to bu ild upon the strengths of the Commonwealths excellent system of higher education, afford these unique missions and contributions appropriate safeguards, and allow these attributes to inform the development and implementation of funding policies, perf ormance criteria, economic opportunity metrics, and recommendations in the furtherance of the objective of this chapter set forth in subsection B.

Following c onsultation with each public institution of higher education and the Higher Education Advisory Committee described in § 23.1-309, the Council shall calculate the basic operations and instruction funding need of each public institution of higher educat ion as provided in subsection B for each year of the next biennium and make such calculation available to the Governor, the General Assembly, and all public institutions of higher education. The Governor shall take into account each institutions basi c operations and instruction funding need and the Commonwealths funding split policy established in the general appropriation act by which 67 percent of an institutions cost of education for Virginia students is funded from the state general fund and 33 percent from funds other than the state general fund during the preparation of his proposed biennial budget bill for the next biennium, and the General Assembly shall take such items into account in enacting the general appropriation act for the next biennium. Between such biennial recalculations, the General Assembly may increase or decrease the appropriation of basic operations and instruction funding to a public institution of higher education to correspond with an increase or decrease in Vir ginia undergraduate student enrollment at the institution as provided in § 23.1-304, or the institutions meeting or not meeting targeted financial incentives listed in § 23.1-305, or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by the General Assem bly. B. The basic o perations and instruction funding need of each public institution of higher education for each fiscal year of the biennium shall consist of the sum of (i) the institutions cost of education for the total enrollment in actual attendance during the fis cal year that ended on June 30 of each odd-numbered year, which shall be determined using a cost-based funding policy that consists of (a) a set of formulas for calculating (1) educational cost based on faculty-student ratios by discipline and level and (2) the educational and general programs of instruction, academic support, student services, institutional support, and operation and maintenance of physical plant and (b) adjustments based on particular state policies or specific institutional missions or conditions; (ii) the amount required to reach the Commonwealths faculty salary goal of the 60th percentile of the most recently reported average faculty salaries paid by that institutions peer institutions as established in the general appropr iation act; and (iii) such other funding for educational and general services as the General Assembly may appropriate. C. State gener al funds shall be allocated and appropriated to public institutions of higher education in a fair and equitable manner such that, to the extent practicable, the percentage of the cost of education for Virginia students enrolled at an institution to be fu nded from state general funds is the same for each institution. To the extent that the percentages differ among institutions, that fact shall be taken into account as the Governor deems appropriate in his proposed biennial budget bill and by the General Assembly as it deems appropriate in the general appropriation act.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Jurisdiction.  Under § 17.1-405, the Virginia Court of Appeals only has jurisdiction over an appeal from an administrative agency, not over an administrative decision made by an entity that is not purely an administrative agency. The Court of Appeals thus lacks jurisdiction over a trial court decision on appeal from the determination of a state university pursuant to § 23-7.4; appellate jurisdiction of such cases lies in the Virginia Supreme Court under subdivision A 3 of § 8.01-670. George Mason Univ. v. Floyd, 275 Va. 32, 654 S.E.2d 556, 2008 Va. LEXIS 11 (2008). In-state tuition properly denied.  As a student admitted he relocated to Virginia for the primary purpose of attending law school, and many facts on which he relied to support his purported Virgini a domicile could be deemed auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives or were also performed by temporary Virginia residents, he was properly denied in-state tuition under subsection B of § 23-7.4.George Mason Univ. v. Floyd, 275 Va. 32, 654 S .E.2d 556, 2008 Va. LEXIS 11 (2008). Denial of the students application for in-state tuition was supported by evidence that the student applied to several universities outside of Virginia and mov ed to Virginia only after being accepted to the university, the student gave inconsistent answers when asked whether he intended to stay in Virginia indefinitely, and the student returned to China for more than a month during the year in which he was sup posedly establishing his Virginia domicile. Va. Commonwealth Univ. v. Zhuo Cheng Su, 283 Va. 446, 722 S.E.2d 561, 2012 Va. LEXIS 53 (2012). As a dependent students spouse did not obtain a Virginia drivers license within one year of the first day of class, a universitys determination that t he spouse had not been domiciled in Virginia for the requisite one year period and that the student was thus not eligible for in-state tuition was not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law. George Mason Univ. v. Veng, 2012 Va. LEXIS 232 (Va . Sept. 14, 2012). Circuit court did not err in finding that the university was not required to consider the students permanent residency application because he had not applied for permanent residence until May 25, 2021, and the relevant time frame for establishing domicile was before the date of the alleged entitlement. Kinuani v. George Mason Univ., 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 9 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 10, 2023). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Domiciliary intent.  Where a student was presumed to have come to Virginia solely to attend school and the students wife did not indicate a commitment to remain in Virginia, the u niversity residency appeals committee properly denied in-state tuition. Echols v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 64 Va. Cir. 330, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 197 (Richmond Apr. 5, 2004). No factor alone is determinative.  All the factors for determining the right to in-state tuition status listed in § 23-7.4 shall be considered, but none of the factors alone are determinative of domiciliary intent or lack thereof. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). Employment factor broadly interpre ted.  While § 23-7.4 specifies that a written offer of employment should be considered a factor in determining domiciliary intent, the applicable regulation, former 8 VAC § 40-120-40 E. 10. c., broadly interprets that factor, and the Virginia Commonwealth University Residency Board must consider other evidence of likely future employment besides a written offer. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 200 1 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). In-state status found.  Self-supporting graduate student, who moved to Virginia to live with her fiance and who intended to seek employment in Virginia and to obtain her license there, w as entitled to in-state tuition status; the student showed 8 of the 10 factors for domiciliary status, and offered strong evidence of the ninth, future employment. The Virginia Commonwealth University Residency Boards denial of in-state tuition statu s was arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). Because a student established all 11 factors in § 23-7.4 to determine domiciliary intent and also presented many other factors evidencing an intent to remain i n the Commonwealth, including the purchase of a home, a universitys residency committee denial of in-state tuition was arbitrary and capricious. Gauthier v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 67 Va. Cir. 341, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 158 (Richmond May 23, 2005). In-state tuition properly denied.  Pursuant to subsection A of § 23-7.4:3, the decision of a universitys domicile appeals committee to deny a students petition to be reclassified as an i n-state student was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; the university could have reasonably concluded that a student failed to rebut, by clear and convincing evidence, the presumption contained in § 23-7.4 that he came to Virginia primaril y to attend the universitys law school and that the steps the student took to establish his domicile in Virginia were auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives. Milakovich v. George Mason Univ., 75 Va. Cir. 11, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 9 (Fairfax County Jan. 28, 2008). Because a university reasonably concluded that a student came to Virginia primarily to attend its law school and that the steps the student took to establish Virg inia as the students domicile were secondary or auxiliary to the full-time study of law, the university properly denied the students application for in-state tuition under § 23-7.4.O'Shea v.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Jurisdiction.  Under § 17.1-405, the Virginia Court of Appeals only has jurisdiction over an appeal from an administrative agency, not over an administrative decision made by an entity that is not purely an administrative agency. The Court of Appeals thus lacks jurisdiction over a trial court decision on appeal from the determination of a state university pursuant to § 23-7.4; appellate jurisdiction of such cases lies in the Virginia Supreme Court under subdivision A 3 of § 8.01-670. George Mason Univ. v. Floyd, 275 Va. 32, 654 S.E.2d 556, 2008 Va. LEXIS 11 (2008). In-state tuition properly denied.  As a student admitted he relocated to Virginia for the primary purpose of attending law school, and many facts on which he relied to support his purported Virgini a domicile could be deemed auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives or were also performed by temporary Virginia residents, he was properly denied in-state tuition under subsection B of § 23-7.4.George Mason Univ. v. Floyd, 275 Va. 32, 654 S .E.2d 556, 2008 Va. LEXIS 11 (2008). Denial of the students application for in-state tuition was supported by evidence that the student applied to several universities outside of Virginia and mov ed to Virginia only after being accepted to the university, the student gave inconsistent answers when asked whether he intended to stay in Virginia indefinitely, and the student returned to China for more than a month during the year in which he was sup posedly establishing his Virginia domicile. Va. Commonwealth Univ. v. Zhuo Cheng Su, 283 Va. 446, 722 S.E.2d 561, 2012 Va. LEXIS 53 (2012). As a dependent students spouse did not obtain a Virginia drivers license within one year of the first day of class, a universitys determination that t he spouse had not been domiciled in Virginia for the requisite one year period and that the student was thus not eligible for in-state tuition was not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law. George Mason Univ. v. Veng, 2012 Va. LEXIS 232 (Va . Sept. 14, 2012). State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) guidelines provided no support for a students assertion that a universitys decision to deny her in- state tuition was arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law; SCHEV policy is not a statute or an administrative regulation and, thus, does not have the force of law. George Mason Univ. v. Malik, 296 Va. 289, 819 S.E.2d 420, 2018 Va. LEXIS 138 ( 2018). Circuit court erred in finding that a universitys decision to deny a students tuition reclassification request was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because it exceeded the scope of its review by reweighing the evidence and substituting its judgment for that of the university; ample evidence supported the universitys conclusion that the student failed to prove her alleged Virginia domicile an d reinforced the primacy of education as her reason for residing in Virginia. George Mason Univ. v. Malik, 296 Va. 289, 819 S.E.2d 420, 2018 Va. LEXIS 138 (2018). Circuit court did not err in finding that the university was not required to consider the students permanent residency application because he had not applied for permanent residence until May 25, 2021, and the relevant time frame for establishing domicile was before the date of the alleged entitlement. Kinuani v. George Mason Univ., 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 9 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 10, 2023). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No factor alone is determinative.  All the factors for determining the right to in-state tuition status listed in § 23-7.4 shall be considered, but none of the factors alone are determinative of domiciliary intent or lack thereof. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). Domiciliary intent.  Where a student was presumed to have come to Virginia solely to attend school and the students wife did not indicate a commitment to remain in Virginia, the u niversity residency appeals committee properly denied in-state tuition. Echols v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 64 Va. Cir. 330, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 197 (Richmond Apr. 5, 2004). Employment factor broadly interpre ted.  While § 23-7.4 specifies that a written offer of employment should be considered a factor in determining domiciliary intent, the applicable regulation, former 8 VAC § 40-120-40 E. 10. c., broadly interprets that factor, and the Virginia Commonwealth University Residency Board must consider other evidence of likely future employment besides a written offer. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 200 1 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). In-state status found.  Self-supporting graduate student, who moved to Virginia to live with her fiance and who intended to seek employment in Virginia and to obtain her license there, w as entitled to in-state tuition status; the student showed 8 of the 10 factors for domiciliary status, and offered strong evidence of the ninth, future employment. The Virginia Commonwealth University Residency Boards denial of in-state tuition statu s was arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). Because a student established all 11 factors in § 23-7.4 to determine domiciliary intent and also presented many other factors evidencing an intent to remain i n the Commonwealth, including the purchase of a home, a universitys residency committee denial of in-state tuition was arbitrary and capricious. Gauthier v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 67 Va. Cir. 341, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 158 (Richmond May 23, 2005). In-state tuition properly denied.  Pursuant to subsection A of § 23-7.4:3, the decision of a universitys domicile appeals committee to deny a students petition to be reclassified as an i n-state student was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; the university could have reasonably concluded that a student failed to rebut, by clear and convincing evidence, the presumption contained in § 23-7.4 that he came to Virginia primaril y to attend the universitys law school and that the steps the student took to establish his domicile in Virginia were auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives.

Students sh all not ordinarily establish domicile by the performance of acts that are auxiliary to fulfilling educational objectives or are required or routinely performed by temporary residents of the Commonwealth. Students shall not establish domicile by mere phys ical presence or residence primarily for educational purposes. B. A married i ndividual may establish domicile in the same manner as an unmarried individual. C. A nonmilita ry student whose parent or spouse is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States may establish domicile in the same manner as any other student. D. Any alien h olding an immigration visa or classified as a political refugee may establish domicile in the same manner as any other student. However, absent congressional intent to the contrary, any individual holding a student visa or another temporary visa does not have the capacity to intend to remain in the Commonwealth indefinitely and is therefore ineligible to establish domicile and receive in-state tuition charges. E. The domicil e of a dependent student shall be rebuttably presumed to be the domicile of the parent or legal guardian (i) claiming him as an exemption on federal or state income tax returns currently and for the tax year prior to the date of the alleged entitlement o r (ii) providing him with substantial financial support. The spouse of an active duty military service member, if such spouse has established domicile and claimed the dependent student on federal or state income tax returns, is not subject to minimum inc ome tests or requirements. F. The domicil e of an unemancipated minor or a dependent student 18 years old or older may be the domicile of either the parent with whom he resides, the parent who claims the student as a dependent for federal or Virginia income tax purposes for the tax year prior to the date of the alleged entitlement and is currently so claiming the student, or the parent who provides the student with substantial financial support. If there is no surviving parent or the whereabouts of the parents are unknown, then the domicile of an unemancipated minor shall be the domicile of the legal guardian of such unemancipated minor unless circumstances indicate that such guardianship was created primarily for the purpose of establishing domicile. G. Continuousl y enrolled non-Virginia students shall be presumed to be in the Commonwealth for educational purposes unless they rebut such presumption with clear and convincing evidence of domicile. H. A non-Virgi nia student is not eligible for reclassification as a Virginia student unless he applies for and is approved for such reclassification. Any such reclassification shall only be granted prospectively from the date such application is received. I. A student w ho knowingly provides erroneous information in an attempt to evade payment of out-of-state tuition charges shall be charged out-of-state tuition for each term, semester, or quarter attended and may be subject to dismissal from the institution. All disput es relating to the veracity of information provided to establish domicile in the Commonwealth are appealable as set forth in § 23.1-510. J. No student shall be deemed ineligible to establish domicile and receive in-state tuition charges solely on the basis of the immigration status of his parent.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Jurisdiction.  Under § 17.1-405, the Virginia Court of Appeals only has jurisdiction over an appeal from an administrative agency, not over an administrative decision made by an entity that is not purely an administrative agency. The Court of Appeals thus lacks jurisdiction over a trial court decision on appeal from the determination of a state university pursuant to § 23-7.4; appellate jurisdiction of such cases lies in the Virginia Supreme Court under subdivision A 3 of § 8.01-670. George Mason Univ. v. Floyd, 275 Va. 32, 654 S.E.2d 556, 2008 Va. LEXIS 11 (2008). In-state tuition properly denied.  As a student admitted he relocated to Virginia for the primary purpose of attending law school, and many facts on which he relied to support his purported Virgini a domicile could be deemed auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives or were also performed by temporary Virginia residents, he was properly denied in-state tuition under subsection B of § 23-7.4.George Mason Univ. v. Floyd, 275 Va. 32, 654 S .E.2d 556, 2008 Va. LEXIS 11 (2008). Denial of the students application for in-state tuition was supported by evidence that the student applied to several universities outside of Virginia and mov ed to Virginia only after being accepted to the university, the student gave inconsistent answers when asked whether he intended to stay in Virginia indefinitely, and the student returned to China for more than a month during the year in which he was sup posedly establishing his Virginia domicile. Va. Commonwealth Univ. v. Zhuo Cheng Su, 283 Va. 446, 722 S.E.2d 561, 2012 Va. LEXIS 53 (2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No factor alone is determinative.  All the factors for determining the right to in-state tuition status listed in § 23-7.4 shall be considered, but none of the factors alone are determinative of domiciliary intent or lack thereof. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). Domiciliary intent.  Where a student was presumed to have come to Virginia solely to attend school and the students wife did not indicate a commitment to remain in Virginia, the u niversity residency appeals committee properly denied in-state tuition. Echols v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 64 Va. Cir. 330, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 197 (Richmond Apr. 5, 2004). Employment factor broadly interpre ted.  While § 23-7.4 specifies that a written offer of employment should be considered a factor in determining domiciliary intent, the applicable regulation, former 8 VAC § 40-120-40 E. 10. c., broadly interprets that factor, and the Virginia Commonwealth University Residency Board must consider other evidence of likely future employment besides a written offer. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 200 1 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). In-state status found.  Self-supporting graduate student, who moved to Virginia to live with her fiance and who intended to seek employment in Virginia and to obtain her license there, w as entitled to in-state tuition status; the student showed 8 of the 10 factors for domiciliary status, and offered strong evidence of the ninth, future employment. The Virginia Commonwealth University Residency Boards denial of in-state tuition statu s was arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law. Kay v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 57 Va. Cir. 136, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 426 (Richmond Nov. 15, 2001). Because a student established all 11 factors in § 23-7.4 to determine domiciliary intent and also presented many other factors evidencing an intent to remain i n the Commonwealth, including the purchase of a home, a universitys residency committee denial of in-state tuition was arbitrary and capricious. Gauthier v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 67 Va. Cir. 341, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 158 (Richmond May 23, 2005). In-state tuition properly denied.  Pursuant to subsection A of § 23-7.4:3, the decision of a universitys domicile appeals committee to deny a students petition to be reclassified as an i n-state student was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; the university could have reasonably concluded that a student failed to rebut, by clear and convincing evidence, the presumption contained in § 23-7.4 that he came to Virginia primaril y to attend the universitys law school and that the steps the student took to establish his domicile in Virginia were auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives. Milakovich v. George Mason Univ., 75 Va. Cir. 11, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 9 (Fairfax County Jan. 28, 2008). Because a university reasonably concluded that a student came to Virginia primarily to attend its law school and that the steps the student took to establish Virg inia as the students domicile were secondary or auxiliary to the full-time study of law, the university properly denied the students application for in-state tuition under § 23-7.4.O'Shea v. George Mason Univ., 82 Va. Cir. 566, 2007 Va. Cir. L EXIS 327 (Fairfax County July 13, 2007). Illustrative cases.  Student demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that for more than one year prior to her request for in-state tuition entitlement, she was a bona fide domic iliary and that there was no reasonable factual basis to support the colleges decision to deny the student in-state tuition; the colleges decision was thus arbitrary and capricious. Lau v. Mary Washington College, 57 Va. Cir. 491, 2000 Va . Cir. LEXIS 635 (Fredericksburg Nov. 3, 2000). Universitys residency committee did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying a student in-state tuition status and in finding she had not changed her do micile, even though she displayed many of the factors listed in the statute, including living in the state for more than a year, paying in-state income tax, and holding in-state motor vehicle, vehicle registration, and voter identification cards. Those a ctions could be considered auxiliary to her educational purposes in the state and did not necessitate a finding that the student had changed her domicile. Gauthier v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 64 Va. Cir. 395, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 193 (Richmond May 4, 2004) . Universitys decision that a student was not entitled to in-state tuition was arbitrary and capricious because the decision violated both the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Domicile Guidelines and § 23-7.4, and the university departed from the established standard in determining the students domicile appeal; the university failed to isolate the core factors unique to the circumstances o f the case as required by § 04.C of the Guidelines, and its methodology made the last objective action provided in State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Domicile Guideline § 04.C.1 an essential act, regardless of its releva nce to the case or its categorization as a core factor, which was contrary to the statutes mandate that all applicable factors were considered and even the Guidelines own requirement that no one factor is necessarily determinative and opposing fa cts must be balanced against each other.

Each appeal s process shall include an initial determination, an intermediate review of the initial determination, and a final administrative review. The final administrative decision shall be in writing. A copy of this decision shall be sent to the student. Either the intermediate review or the final administrative review shall be conducted by an appeals committee consisting of an odd number of members.

History History. 1996, cc. 931, 981, § 23-7.4:3; 2016, c. 588. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2006, c. 806, cl. 2, provides: That, upon the passage of this provision and pursuant to subsection B of § 23-7.4:3 [now this section], the State Cou ncil of Higher Education shall revise its guidelines for determining in-state tuition charges, which are not subject to the Administrative Process Act, to incorporate subsection E of § 23-7.4 by July 1, 2006, including, but not limited to, notice to students who may be or may become subject to the surcharge and guidelines and criteria for granting waivers of the surcharge. CASE NOTES Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. In-state tuition properly denied.  As a student admitted he relocated to Virginia for the primary purpose of attending law school, and many facts on which he relied to support his purported Virgini a domicile could be deemed auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives or were also performed by temporary Virginia residents, he was properly denied in-state tuition under subsection B of § 23-7.4.George Mason Univ. v. Floyd, 275 Va. 32, 654 S .E.2d 556, 2008 Va. LEXIS 11 (2008). Denial of the students application for in-state tuition was supported by evidence that the student applied to several universities outside of Virginia and mov ed to Virginia only after being accepted to the university, the student gave inconsistent answers when asked whether he intended to stay in Virginia indefinitely, and the student returned to China for more than a month during the year in which he was sup posedly establishing his Virginia domicile. Va. Commonwealth Univ. v. Zhuo Cheng Su, 283 Va. 446, 722 S.E.2d 561, 2012 Va. LEXIS 53 (2012). Circuit court erred in finding that a universitys decision to deny a students tuition reclassification request was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because it exceeded the scope of its review by reweighing the evidence and substituting its judgment for that of the university; ample evidence supported the universitys conclusion that the student failed to prove her alleged Virginia domicile an d reinforced the primacy of education as her reason for residing in Virginia. George Mason Univ. v. Malik, 296 Va. 289, 819 S.E.2d 420, 2018 Va. LEXIS 138 (2018). Per Va. Code Ann. § 23.1-510(C), a circuit court did not err in finding that the universitys denial of a non-citizen students request for in-state tuit ion for the fall semester was not arbitrary or capricious where the university considered and primarily relied on the State Council of Higher Education for Virginias Domicile Guidelines, and those guidelines explicitly and clearly stated that pending asylum claims were not eligible for domicile review. Kinuani v. George Mason Univ., 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 9 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 10, 2023). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS In-state tuition properly denied.  Pursuant to subsection A of § 23-7.4:3, the decision of a universitys domicile appeals committee to deny a students petition to be reclassified as an i n-state student was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; the university could have reasonably concluded that a student failed to rebut, by clear and convincing evidence, the presumption contained in § 23-7.4 that he came to Virginia primaril y to attend the universitys law school and that the steps the student took to establish his domicile in Virginia were auxiliary to fulfilling his educational objectives. Milakovich v. George Mason Univ., 75 Va. Cir. 11, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 9 (Fairfax County Jan. 28, 2008). Although the student lived in Virginia for more than one year, registered a car in Virginia, registered to vote in Virginia, had declared financial independence f rom the students parents, had obtained a job in Virginia, and procured a bank account in Virginia, the universitys denial of the students in-state tuition application was not arbitrary or capricious where the student moved to the state only a fter being admitted to the university and the student reduced the students enrollment to part-time because the student could not afford full-time attendance, a clearly education purpose. Wittich v. George Mason Univ., 75 Va. Cir. 311, 2008 Va. Cir. L EXIS 67 (Fairfax County July 3, 2008). Universitys decision that a student was not entitled to in-state tuition was arbitrary and capricious because the decision violated both the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Domicile Guidelines and § 23-7.4, and the university departed from the established standard in determining the students domicile appeal; the university failed to isolate the core factors unique to the circumstances o f the case as required by § 04.C of the Guidelines, and its methodology made the last objective action provided in State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Domicile Guideline § 04.C.1 an essential act, regardless of its releva nce to the case or its categorization as a core factor, which was contrary to the statutes mandate that all applicable factors were considered and even the Guidelines own requirement that no one factor is necessarily determinative and opposing fa cts must be balanced against each other. Veng v. George Mason Univ., 83 Va. Cir. 154, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 91 (Fairfax County July 7, 2011), rev'd, No. 111776, 2012 Va. LEXIS 232 (Va. Sept. 14, 2012). No due process violation based on lack of evidentiary hearing.  Universitys failure to provide the student an opportunity to be heard on an application for in-state tuition at an evidentiary hearing did not violate the stu dents due process rights because there was no requirement that the student be afforded an evidentiary hearing.

Const., Art. VIII, § 11, a section narrowly drawn in precise language . To rule this chapter unconstitutional under the general principles of other sections would do violence to the intention of the revisors of the Constitution. Miller v. Ayres, 213 Va. 251, 191 S.E.2d 261, 1972 Va. LEXIS 344 (1972). Purpose of chapter.  This chapter is designed to implement the provisions of Va. Const., Art. VIII, § 11. It has as a purpose the appropriation of money from the general fund for f inancial aid to undergraduate students at institutions of higher education in Virginia. Miller v. Ayres, 213 Va. 251, 191 S.E.2d 261, 1972 Va. LEXIS 344 (1972). This chapter has a secular purpose whose primary effect is not to advance or inhibit rel igion and the administration of which does not constitute an excessive entanglement of government with religion. Miller v. Ayres, 213 Va. 251, 191 S.E.2d 261, 1972 Va. LEXIS 344 (1972). This chapter does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment by limiting loans (now grants) to Virginia students attending nonprofit institutions of higher education in the Commonwealth, thus discriminating against Virginia students attending proprietary institutions of higher learning in the Commonwealth and Virginia students attending instituti ons of higher learning outside the Commonwealth. Miller v. Ayres, 213 Va. 251, 191 S.E.2d 261, 1972 Va. LEXIS 344 (1972).

Constitutionality of section.  This section is constitutional to the extent that it provides financial aid in the form of conditional grants, repayable in the manner specified therein, to stude nts in nonsectarian private institutions. Miller v. Ayres, 214 Va. 171, 198 S.E.2d 634, 1973 Va. LEXIS 277 (1973). The programs of this section do not violate the establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment. Miller v. Ayres, 214 Va. 171, 198 S.E.2d 634, 1973 Va. LE XIS 277 (1973). In permitting repayment of financial aid by employment by religious organizations, this section has not specially favored religious organizations in any respect. Instead, it has grouped them with charitable, scientific, literary, educational, and other organizations having worthy quasi-public purposes. There is no violation of the First Amendment in this or any other aspect of this section. Miller v. Ayres, 214 V a. 171, 198 S.E.2d 634, 1973 Va. LEXIS 277 (1973). This section is constitutional to the extent that it provides financial aid in the form of loans to students attending the eligible educational institutions defin ed therein, both sectarian and nonsectarian, such loans to be repayable only in money or by employment by the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions.

C. Upon receip t of information pursuant to subsection B, the Title IX coordinator or his designee shall promptly report the information, including any personally identifiable information, to a review committee established pursuant to subsection D. Nothing in this sect ion shall prevent the Title IX coordinator or any other responsible employee from providing any information to law enforcement with the consent of the victim. D.

The local governing body may only petition the c ircuit court for such concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to a request by the local law-enforcement agency. C. Each public institution of higher education and private institution of higher education that establishes a campus police force pursuant to this article shall enter into and become a party to a mutual aid agreement with an adjacent local law-enforcement agency or th e Department of State Police for the use of their regular and auxiliary joint forces, equipment, and materials when needed in the investigation of any felony criminal sexual assault or medically unattended death occurring on property owned or controlled by such institution or any death resulting from an incident occurring on such property.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Authority of campus police.  Amendment to statute clearly suggested the legislatures intention was to extend the authority of campus police, such that the statute authorized campus police officers to exercise their powers on their own campus, on another campus by invitation, and upon the streets, sidewalks, and highways immediately adjacent to such campuses. Councill v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 610, 560 S.E.2d 472, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 1 44 (2002). Because a campus police officers concurrent jurisdiction under §§ 19.2-249, 19.2-250, and 23-234 extended up to one mile beyond the citys corporate limits, the officer was well within the statutorily prescribed jurisdiction when the officer stopped and arrested defendant for drunk driving 200 yards into the adjoining county. Boatwright v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 169, 647 S.E.2d 515, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 281 (2007). Officers without authority under section could make private citizen arrest.  Campus police officers who lacked authority to make an off-campus arrest of a burglary suspect under this section nevertheless retained the power as private citiz ens to place the suspect under arrest where they had reasonable grounds to believe that he was involved in the burglary. Hall v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 559, 389 S.E.2d 921, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1730, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (1990). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Authority of campus police outside of jurisdictional limits.  Although an agreement pursuant to §§ 23-234 and 15.2-1726 was invalid and defendant was arrested beyond a university police officers jurisdictional limi ts, which made a certificate of breath analysis inadmissible, the rest of the evidence was admissible under the good faith exception to the Fourth Amendments exclusionary rule. Commonwealth v. Borek, 68 Va. Cir. 323, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 196 ( Charlottesville Aug. 4, 2005). § 23.1-815.1. (Effective until July 1, 2026) Facial recognition technology; approval; penalty. Text A. For purpose s of this section: Authorized use means the use of facial recognition technology to (i) help identify an individual when there is a reasonable suspicion the individual has committed a crime; (ii) help identify a crime victim, including a victim of online sexual abuse material; (iii) help identify a person who may be a missing person or witness to criminal a ctivity; (iv) help identify a victim of human trafficking or an individual involved in the trafficking of humans, weapons, drugs, or wildlife; (v) help identify an online recruiter of criminal activity, including but not limited to human, weapon, drug, a nd wildlife trafficking; (vi) help a person who is suffering from a mental or physical disability impairing his ability to communicate and be understood; (vii) help identify a deceased person; (viii) help identify a person who is incapacitated or otherwi se unable to identify himself; (ix) help identify a person who is reasonably believed to be a danger to himself or others; (x) help identify an individual lawfully detained; (xi) help mitigate an imminent threat to public safety, a significant threat to life, or a threat to national security, including acts of terrorism; (xii) ensure officer safety as part of the vetting of undercover law enforcement; (xiii) determine whether an individual may have unlawfully obtained one or more state drivers licen ses, finan...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_23.1-816"><akn:num>§ 23.1-816</akn:num><akn:heading>Extending police power of public institutions of higher education beyond boundaries; jurisdiction of general district courts; duty of attorneys for the Commonwealth</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

History History. 1991, c. 711, § 23-234.1; 2016, c. 588. Annotations CASE NOTES Territorial jurisdiction.  Circuit court properly overruled defendants motion to suppress because, assuming without deciding that a Virginia Military Institute police officer arrested d efendant outside of his territorial jurisdiction, the issuance of an arrest warrant by a judicial officer cured any defect in the arrest, defendant never challenged the magistrates finding of probable cause or the validity of the warrant upon which h e was tried, and there was no legal basis for defendants assertion that he was denied procedural due process and that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress inasmuch as he had a full and fair opportunity to attempt to prove or disp rove any prejudicial effect of the violation.

A waiver shall not be granted allowing a baccalaureate public institution to (i) generally reject the transfer of all coursework that is a part of the Uniform Certificate of General Studies P rogram or Passport Program or (ii) generally reject the transfer of a course from the Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program or Passport Program for all pathway maps and degrees. An application for a waiver shall identify with particularity the c ourse for which the institution is seeking a waiver and the particular pathway or degree to which the waiver would apply. The application shall provide justification for the waiver and shall designate alternative courses offered through the System that m ay be completed by a student in order to complete a transferable, 30-credit-hour Uniform Certificate or 15-credit-hour Passport. The Council shall adopt guidelines regarding the criteria to be used to review and issue decisions regarding waiver requests. Such waiver requests shall only be granted if the baccalaureate public institution of higher education provides evidence that the specified pathway or degree requires a specialized, lower division course not available through the System. Once approved, notice of a waiver granted by the Council shall be included in the online portal established pursuant to § 23.1-908. D. The Council shall develop guidelines for associate-degree-granting and baccalaureate public institutions of higher education to use in mapping pathways for the completion of credits in particular programs of study, including the courses recommended to be taken in a dual enrollment, comprehensive community college, and baccalaureate public institution setting in order to pursue a specific degree or career. Such guidelines shall define the elements of a pathway map and identify the pathway maps to be developed. Init ial guidelines adopted for mapping such pathways shall establish a multiyear schedule for the development and implementation of pathway maps for all fields of study. E. Each baccal aureate public institution of higher education, in cooperation and consultation with the System, shall develop pathway maps consistent with the guidelines established pursuant to subsection D. Such pathways maps shall clearly set forth the courses that a student at a comprehensive community college is encouraged to complete prior to transferring to the baccalaureate institution. The goal of the career education pathway maps shall be to assist students in achieving optimal efficiencies in the time and co st of completing a degree program. Such program map shall also clearly identify the courses, if any, for which the baccalaureate institution has received a waiver from transfer pursuant to subsection C. F. The Council shall prepare a comprehensive annual report on the effectiveness of transferring from comprehensive community colleges to baccalaureate public institutions of higher education, including a review of the effectiveness of the use of pathway maps in achiev ing efficiencies and cost savings in the completion of a degree program. The report shall include the following elements: completion rates, average time to degree, credit accumulation, post-transfer student academic performance, and comparative efficienc y. The Council shall adopt guidelines for data submission from public institutions of higher education necessary for such report, and all institutions shall report such data in accordance with the guidelines. The report shall be made publicly available o n the Council website and on the online portal maintained pursuant to § 23.1-908. G. Each compre hensive community college shall develop agreements for postsecondary attainment with the public high schools in the school divisions that such comprehensive community college serves specifying the options for students to complete an associate degree, the Passport Program, or the Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program concurrent with a high school diploma. Such agreements shall specify the credit available for dual enrollment courses and Advanced Placement courses with qualifying exam scores of t hree or higher. H. The provisi ons of this section shall not apply to any public institution of higher education established pursuant to Chapter 25 (§ 23.1-2500 et seq.).

Circuit court properly dismissed requesters petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to obtain donor information from George Mason University (GMU) and a found ation because the foundations records were not subject to disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA); the foundation was not an entity of GMU for purposes of VFOIA because it was an independent non-stock corporation that coexist ed alongside GMU. Transparent GMU v. George Mason Univ., 298 Va. 222, 835 S.E.2d 544, 2019 Va. LEXIS 155 (2019). Alter ego.  Circuit court did not err when it found that a foundation was not the alter ego of George Mason University (GMU) because the foundation and GMU are indepe ndent corporate entities, and their relationship was governed by formal contractual arrangements that reflected their independent status; veil piercing is not warranted when conduct is expressly authorized by the General Assembly.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Possession of records.  University was empowered to create a foundation for the purpose of collecting private donations on behalf of the university; the foundations possession of rec ords and performance of that function were not dispositive factors towards the foundations status as a public body because they were simply factors for the court to consider in reaching that conclusion.

As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:Authority means the Virginia Colleg e Building Authority.Bond means any bond, note, or other evidences of indebtedness or obligation of the Authority pursuant to this article.Eligible institution means public institutions of high er education, as that term is defined in § 23.1-100; Eastern Virginia Medical School; the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research; the New College Institute; the Roanoke Higher Education Authority; the Southern Virginia Higher Education Center; t he Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center; the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind; and the Wilson Workforce and Rehabilitation Center.Equipment means any personal property, including computer hardware and software, and any other improvements, including infrastructure improvements relating to equipment, used to support academic instru ction and research at eligible institutions.Project has the same meaning as set forth in § 23 .1-1100. B. Providing f unds for the construction of projects at eligible institutions is or may be hindered, impeded, and delayed by the high financing costs resulting from the sale of bonds of such eligible institutions in the open market, and it is desirable that the Authori ty may (i) serve the purposes of eligible institutions by purchasing such bonds and financing the construction of projects at a lower cost, which facilitates such construction and (ii) issue its own revenue bonds for the purpose of paying the costs of su ch projects. C. There is an urgent need to provide substantial amounts of new scientific, technical, and other equipment for academic instruction, research, and related activities at eligible institutions so that they may remain competitive in attracting high-quality faculty and o btaining research grants, and it is desirable that the Authority may finance the purchase of such equipment to provide eligible institutions with such equipment at the lowest possible cost, which facilitates the acquisition and supply of such equipment t o eligible institutions and increases the purchasing power of their funds, including funds provided by tuition and fees and appropriations from the General Assembly.

For related discussion, see 3C M.J. Colleges and Universities, § 7. CASE NOTES Religious training or theological education construed.  As used in subsection (e), the phrase theological education is applicable to a seminary or other institution whose purpose is to prepare students for voca tions associated with ordination, such as rabbi, minister or priest. By contrast, the phrase religious training is applicable to institutions or departments within institutions whose purpose is preparation of students for religious vocations othe r than those associated with ordination, which would include missionary or director of religious education. In either case, the primary function is educating students for religious vocations. Virginia College Bldg. Auth. v. Lynn, 260 Va. 608, 538 S.E.2d 682, 2000 Va. LEXIS 147 (2000) (decided under prior law). Teaching of secular subjects from religious viewpoint permitted.  Although a university was pervasively sectarian in both policy and practice, the primary purpose of its programs, except in its divinity school, was to prepare gr aduate students for secular vocations; the fact that it taught various secular subjects from a religious viewpoint did not preclude the validation of bonds under this section, as the prohibition in subsection (e) relating to schools that provide religiou s training or theological education does not proscribe teaching of otherwise secular subjects from a religious viewpoint.

Annotations CASE NOTES Participation of private religious university program not contrary to establishment clause.  With the exception of its school of divinity, allowing a private religious university to participate in the Virginia College Building Authority (VCBA) bond financ ing program did not offend the establishment clause; the issuance of VCBA bonds on behalf of the university did not result in governmental indoctrination because the VCBA determines eligibility for aid neutrally, any funds that the university would recei ve would be from the private choices of investors, the aid would have no impermissible content, no government funds would ever reach the universitys coffers, no government funds would be used or pledged for any purpose, and this carefully constrained program could not reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.

Power to revoke degree.  Because degree revocation is reasonably necessary to effectuate the board of visitors power to confer degrees and to regulate student discipline, that power m ust be implied, giving the board the authority to revoke a degree for good cause and after due process. Goodreau v. Rector, 116 F. Supp. 2d 694, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15086 (W.D. Va. 2000). University qualified as a person subject to extortion.  Where defendant was charged with knowingly, and with intent to extort from a public university a sum of money or other thing of value, mailing a letter containing a threat to injure certain thesis advisors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 876(b), the university qualified as a person subject to extortion because the term person, as used in the extortion element of § 876(b), was not limited to living and breathing persons. Furthermore, the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. § 1, included corporations within the meaning of the term person, and the university was a corporation under §§ 23-69 and 23-76. United States v. Bly, 510 F.3d 453, 2007 U.S. A pp. LEXIS 29214 (4th Cir. 2007). Property maintenance.  When a subcontractors employee was injured while removing electrical conduit from a public universitys building, the university was his statutory employer because the maintenance and preservation of the universitys buildings was something the university was required by § 23-76 to do, so it was part of the universitys trade, business or occupation, and the workers remedies against the univer sity were limited to his workers compensation remedies, under the exclusivity provision of the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, subsection A of § 65.2-307. Jones v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 218, 591 S.E.2d 72, 2004 Va. LEXIS 22 (2004). Where visitors have been wrongfully deprived of their offices, mandamus is the remedy. L ewis v. Whittle, 77 Va. 415, 1883 Va. LEXIS 73 (1883). Implied powers.  The board of visitors of the University of Virginia has the implied authority to revoke a previously granted degree as part of its authority over disciplinary mat ters, notwithstanding the fact that such authority is not expressly granted by this section. Goodreau v. Rector, 116 F. Supp. 2d 694, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15086 (W.D. Va. 2000). Immunity from suit.  As long as the board of visitors acts within the scope of the authority granted it by this section and its actions are not interdicted by the federal Constitution , it may well be immune from suit. However, where alleged acts by the board, if proved, would be constitutionally impermissible, the board of visitors would not be immune, but it would fall within the coverage of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 , since the board acts under color of law. Jervey v. Martin, 336 F. Supp. 1350, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15643 (W.D. Va. 1972). Wide discretion is vested in the board of visitors.  Great care and judicial discretion should be exercised when the federal courts are asked to interfere with the administration of colleges and universities. On the other hand, it has been held by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that no matter how wide the discretion of the board is, it cannot be exercised so as to arbitrarily deprive persons of their constitutional rights. Jervey v. Martin, 336 F. Supp . 1350, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15643 (W.D. Va. 1972). Weapons restrictions.  George Mason University promulgated 8 VAC § 35-60-20 to restrict the possession or carrying of weapons in its facilities or at university events by individuals other than police officers and the regulation did not impose a total ban of weapons on campus, but was tailored to restrict weapons only in those places where people congregated and were most vulnerable, inside campus buildings and at campus events; ind ividuals could still carry or possess weapons on the open grounds of the university, and in other places on campus not enumerated in the regulation. Therefore, the university, which was state owned under § 23-91.25, was a sensitive place and 8 VAC § 35-60-20 was constitutional and did not violate Va. Const., Art. I, § 13 or U.S. Const., amend. II. Digiacinto v. Rector &amp; Visitors of George Mason Univ., 281 Va. 127, 704 S.E.2d 365, 2011 Va.

The governi ng board of each public institution of higher education may establish a compensation plan designed to provide incentives for voluntary early retirement of teaching and research staff employed in nonclassified, faculty positions.

C. Any compens ation plan established pursuant to this section shall include the institutional needs and objectives to be served, the kind of incentives to be offered, the sources of available funding for implementation, and any additional qualifications required of el igible faculty employees established by the governing board. Any such compensation plan shall explicitly reserve to the governing board the authority to modify, amend, or repeal the plan. However, no such amendment, modification, or repeal is effective a s to any individual who retires under the plan prior to the effective date of the amendment, modification, or repeal. D. The cash pa yments offered under any such compensation plan shall not exceed 150 percent of the employees base annual salary reflected in the Personnel Management Information System at the time of election to participate. Any such payment shall be allocated over at least two years. Such compensation may include payment of insurance benefits by the institution until the participant reaches the age of 65. The total cost in any fiscal year for any compensation plan established under this section shall not exceed o ne percent of the institutions corresponding fiscal year state general fund appropriation for faculty salaries and associated benefits. E. The Governo r may establish, with the assistance of the Council, uniform criteria for such compensation plans. Prior to the adoption, modification, amendment, or repeal of any such compensation plan, the governing board shall obtain the Governors approval. The G overnor shall provide a copy of each approved plan to the Chairmen of the House Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations. All compensation plans shall be reviewed for legal sufficiency by the Office of the Attorn ey General prior to adoption, modification, amendment, or repeal. F. The Adminis trative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) does not apply to the establishment of such compensation plans or any implementing regulations or criteria.

The University is a public instituti on.  The University of Virginia is controlled through a public corporation created for the purpose, and is a public institution governed and controlled by the State. P hillips v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., 97 Va. 472, 34 S.E. 66, 1899 Va. LEXIS 62 (1899). Its grounds and buildings are the property of the State, used for public purposes. Phill ips v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., 97 Va. 472, 34 S.E. 66, 1899 Va. LEXIS 62 (1899). And no mechanics lien can be claimed upon the buildings and grounds of the Universit y. Phillips v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., 97 Va. 472, 34 S.E. 66, 1899 Va. LEXIS 62 (1899). The University has the powers expressly conferred upon it and implied power to do whatev er is reasonably necessary to effectuate them. Batcheller v. Commonwealth, 176 Va. 109, 10 S.E.2d 529, 1940 Va. LEXIS 238 (1940). It may operate a commercial airport where the main purpose in establishing such airport is the training of students in the science of aeronautics. Batcheller v. Commonwealth, 176 Va. 109, 10 S.E.2d 529, 1940 Va. LEXIS 238 (1940). And other incidental enterprises are conducted by the University, and by institutions of the State similar to the University, the authority to conduct such enterprises having been generally accepted. Thus, the University operates a large hospital, a farm, a dining hall, and many other necessary but incidental enterprises. Batcheller v. Comm onwealth, 176 Va. 109, 10 S.E.2d 529, 1940 Va. LEXIS 238 (1940). A suit against the Board of Visitors is equivalent to a suit against the University of V irginia. Collin v. Rector &amp; Bd. of Visitors of UVA, 873 F. Supp. 1008, 1995 U.S. Dist.

University qualified as a person subject to extortion.  Where defendant was charged with knowingly, and with intent to extort from a public university a sum of money or other thing of value, mailing a letter containing a threat to injure certain thesis advisors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 876(b), the university qualified as a person subject to extortion because the term person, as used in the extortion element of § 876(b), was not limited to living and breathing persons. Furthermore, the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. § 1, included corporations within the meaning of the term person, and the university was a corporation under §§ 23-69 and 23-76. United States v.

The ability of the University to provide medical and health sciences education and related research is dependent upon the maintenance of high-quality teaching hospitals and related health care and health maintenance facilities, collectively referred to in this arti cle as the Medical Center, and the maintenance of a Medical Center serving such purposes requires specialized management and operation that permit the Medical Center to remain economically viable and participate in cooperative arrangements reflective of changes in health care delivery. B. Notwithstan ding the provisions of § 32.1-124 exempting hospitals and nursing homes owned or operated by an agency of the Commonwealth from state licensure, the Medical Center shall be, for so long as the Medical Center maintains its accreditation by a national a ccrediting organization granted authority by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ensure compliance with Medicare conditions of participation pursuant to § 1865 of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1395bb), deemed to be licensed as a hospital for purposes of other law relating to the operation of hospitals licensed by the Board of Health. The Medical Center shall not, however, be deemed to be a licensed hospital to the extent that any law relating to licensure of hos pitals specifically excludes the Commonwealth or its agencies. As an agency of the Commonwealth, the Medical Center shall remain (i) exempt from licensure by the Board of Health pursuant to § 32.1-124 and (ii) subject to the Virginia Tort Claims Act ( § 8.01-195.1 et seq.). This subsection shall not be construed as a waiver of the Commonwealths sovereign immunity. C. The Univers ity may create, own in whole or in part, or otherwise control corporations, partnerships, insurers, or other entities whose activities promote the operations of the Medical Center and its mission; cooperate or enter into joint ventures with such entities and with government bodies; and enter into contracts in connection with its operations. Without limiting the power of the University to issue bonds, notes, guarantees, or other evidence of indebtedness pursuant to subsection D in connection with such ac tivities, no such creation, ownership, or control shall create any responsibility of the University, the Commonwealth, or any agency of the Commonwealth for the operations or obligations of any such entity or in any way make the University, the Commonwea lth, or any agency of the Commonwealth responsible for the payment of debt or other obligations of such entity. All such interests shall be reflected on the financial statements of the Medical Center. D. Notwithstan ding the provisions of Chapter 11 (§ 23.1-1100 et seq.), the University may issue bonds, notes, guarantees, or other evidence of indebtedness without the approval of any other governmental body subject to the following provisions: 1. Such debt is used solely for the purpose of paying not more than 50 percent of the cost of capital improvements in connection with the operation of the Medical Center or related issuance costs, reserve funds, and other financing expenses, including interest d uring construction and acquisitions and for up to one year thereafter. 2. The only revenues of the University pledged to the payment of such debt are those derived from the operation of the Medical Center and related health care and educational activities, a nd no general fund appropriation and special Medicaid disproportionate share payments for indigent and medically indigent patients who are not eligible for the Virginia Medicaid Program is pledged for the payment of such debt. 3. Such debt states that it does not constitute a debt of the Commonwealth or a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth. 4. Such debt is not sold to the public. 5. The total principal amount of such debt outstanding at any one time does not exceed $25 million. 6. The Treasury Board approves the terms and structure of such debt. 7. The purpose, terms, and structure of such debt are promptly communicated to the Governor and the Chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees. 8. All such indebtedness is reflected on the financial statements of the Medical Center. E. Subject to meeting the conditions set forth in subsection D, such debt may be in such form and have such terms as the board may provide and shall be in all respects debt of the University for the purposes of §§ 23.1-1110, 23.1-1115, and 23.1-1116.

The economi c viability of the Medical Center, the requirement for its specialized management and operation, and the need of the Medical Center to participate in cooperative arrangements reflective of changes in health care delivery, as set forth in § 23.1-2212, depend upon the ability of the management of the Medical Center to make and promptly implement decisions necessary to conduct the affairs of the Medical Center in an efficient, competitive manner. It is critical to and in the best interests of the Common wealth that the University continues to fulfill its mission of providing quality medical and health sciences education and related research and, through the presence of its Medical Center, continues to provide for the care, treatment, health-related serv ices, and education activities associated with Virginia patients, including indigent and medically indigent patients. Because the ability of the University to fulfill this mission is highly dependent upon revenues derived from providing health care throu gh its Medical Center, and because the ability of the Medical Center to continue to be a reliable source of such revenues is heavily dependent upon its ability to compete with other providers of health care that are not subject to the requirements of law applicable to agencies of the Commonwealth, the University may implement the following modifications to the management and operation of the affairs of the Medical Center in order to enhance its economic viability: 1. a. For any Medical Center capital project entirely funded by a nongeneral fund appropriation made by the General Assembly, all post-appropriation review, approval, administrative, and policy and procedure functions performed by the Department of General Servic es, the Division of Engineering and Buildings, the Department of Planning and Budget, and any other agency that supports the functions performed by these departments are delegated to the University, subject to the following stipulations and conditions: ( i) the board shall develop and implement an appropriate system of policies, procedures, reviews, and approvals for Medical Center capital projects to which this subsection applies; (ii) the system so adopted shall provide for the review and approval of a ny Medical Center capital project to which this subsection applies to ensure that, except as provided in clause (iii), the cost of any such capital project does not exceed the sum appropriated for the project and the project otherwise complies with all r equirements of the Code of Virginia regarding capital projects, excluding only the post-appropriation review, approval, administrative, and policy and procedure functions performed by the Department of General Services, the Division of Engineering and Bu ildings, the Department of Planning and Budget, and any other agency that supports the functions performed by these departments; (iii) the board may, during any fiscal year, approve a transfer of up to 15 percent of the total nongeneral fund appropriatio n for the Medical Center to supplement funds appropriated for a capital project of the Medical Center, provided that the board finds that the transfer is necessary to effectuate the original intention of the General Assembly in making the appropriation f or the capital project in question; (iv) the University shall report to the Department of General Services on the status of any such capital project prior to commencement of construction of, and at the time of acceptance of, any such capital project; and (v) the University shall ensure that Building Officials and Code Administrators (BOCA) Code and fire safety inspections of any such project are conducted and such projects are inspected by the State Fire Marshal or his designee prior to certification fo r building occupancy by the Universitys assistant state building official to whom such inspection responsibility has been delegated pursuant to § 36-98.1. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to relieve the University of any reporting requireme nt pursuant to § 2.2-1513. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the terms and structure of any financing of any capital project to which this subsection applies shall be approved pursuant to § 2.2-2416. b. No capital project to which this subsection applies shall be materially increased in size or materially changed in scope beyond the plans and justifications that were the basis fo r the projects appropriation unless (i) the Governor determines that such increase in size or change in scope is necessary due to an emergency or (ii) the General Assembly approves the increase or change in a subsequent appropriation for the project. After construction of any such capital project has commenced, no such increase or change shall be made during construction unless the conditions in clause (i) or (ii) have been satisfied. 2. a. The University is exempt from the provisions of § 2.2-1149 and any rules, regulations, and guidelines of the Division of Engineering and Buildings regarding leases of real property that it enters into on behalf of the Medical Center and, pursuant to poli cies and procedures adopted by the board, may enter into such leases subject to the following conditions: (i) the lease shall be an operating lease and not a capital lease as defined in guidelines established by the Secretary of Finance and generally acc epted accounting principles; (ii) the Universitys decision to enter into such a lease shall be based upon cost, demonstrated need, and compliance with guidelines adopted by the board that direct that (a) competition be sought to the maximum practical degree, (b) all costs of occupancy be considered, and (c) the use of the space to be leased is necessary and efficiently planned; (iii) the form of the lease is approved by the Special Assistant Attorney General representing the University; (iv) the lea se otherwise meets all requirements of law; (v) the leased property is certified for occupancy by the building official of the political subdivision in which the leased property is located; and (vi) upon entering such leases and upon any subsequent amend ment of such leases, the University provides copies of all lease documents and any attachments to such lease documents to the Department of General Services. b. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 2.2-1155 and subdivision B 1 of § 23.1-1301, but subject to policies and procedures adopted by the board, the University may lease, for a purpose consistent with the mission of the Medical Center and for a term not to exceed 50 years, property in the possession or control of the Medical Center. c. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, the terms and structure of any financing arrangements secured by capital leases or other similar lease financing agreements sha ll be approved pursuant to § 2.2-2416. 3. a. Con tracts awarded by the University on behalf of the Medical Center for the procurement of goods, services, including professional services, construction, or information technology and telecommunications in compliance with this subdivision are exempt from ( i) the Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ 2.2-4300 et seq.), except as provided in this section; (ii) the requirements of the Division of Purchases and Supply of the Department of General Services as set forth in Article 3 (§ 2.2-1109 et seq.) of C hapter 11 of Title 2.2; (iii) the requirements of the Division of Engineering and Buildings as set forth in Article 4 (§ 2.2-1129 et seq.) of Chapter 11 of Title 2.2; and (iv) the authority of the Chief Information Officer and the Virginia Information Technologies Agency as set forth in Chapter 20.1 (§ 2.2-2005 et seq.) of Title 2.2 regarding the review and approval of contracts for (a) the construction of Medical Center capital projects and (b) information technology and telecommunications projec ts. b. The University shall adopt and at all times maintain guidelines generally applicable to the procurement of goods, services, construction, and information technology and telecommun ications projects by the Medical Center or by the University on behalf of the Medical Center. Such guidelines shall be based upon competitive principles and in each instance seek competition to the maximum practical degree. The guidelines shall (i) imple ment a system of competitive negotiation for professional services; (ii) prohibit discrimination against the bidder or offeror in the solicitation or award of contracts on the basis of the race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin of the bidder or offeror; and (iii) incorporate the prompt payment principles of §§ 2.2-4350 and 2.2-4354 and may (a) take into account the dollar amount of the intended procurement, the term of the anticipated contract, and the likely extent of competition; (b) implement a prequalification procedure for contractors or products; (c) include provisions for cooperative procurement arrangements with private health or educational institutions or public agencies or institutions of th e states or territories of the United States or the District of Columbia; and (d) implement provisions of law. c. Sections 2.2-4311, 2.2-4315, 2.2-4342 (which shall not be construed to require compliance with the prequalification application procedures of subsection B of § 2.2-4317), and 2 .2-4330 and §§ 2.2-4333 through 2.2-4341 and 2.2-4367 through 2.2-4377 shall continue to apply to procurements by the Medical Center and the University on behalf of the Medical Center. B. Subject to conditions that are prescribed in the budget bill pursuant to § 2.2-1509, the State Comptroller shall credit, on a monthly basis, to the nongeneral fund operating cash balances of the Medical Center the imputed interest earned by the investment of suc h nongeneral fund operating cash balances, including those balances derived from patient care revenues, on deposit with the State Treasurer.

The University may apply some or all of such proceeds to the payment or defeasance of its obligations issued to finance the hospital facilities, and the Aut hority may issue its bonds to finance or refinance such payment. G. Funds held by or for the University or any of its predecessors or divisions, including funds held by the University Foundation or the MCV Foundation for the benefit of MCV Hospitals or any of its predecessors for use in operating, maintaining, or constructing hospi tal facilities, providing medical and health sciences education, or conducting medical or related research may be transferred, in whole or in part, to the Authority if the University or any foundation determines that the transfer is consistent with the i ntended use of the funds. The University may direct in writing that all or part of the money or property representing its beneficial interest under a will, trust agreement, or other donative instrument be distributed to the Authority if the University de termines that such direction furthers any of the original purposes of the will, trust agreement, or other instrument. Such a direction shall not be considered a waiver, disclaimer, renunciation, assignment, or disposition of the beneficial interest by th e University. A fiduciarys distribution to the Authority pursuant to such a written direction from the University is a distribution to the University for all purposes relating to the donative instrument, and the fiduciary has no liability for distrib uting any money or property to the Authority pursuant to such a direction. Nothing in this section shall deprive any court of its jurisdiction to determine whether such a distribution is appropriate under its cy pres powers or otherwise. H. The Authori ty shall not operate any hospital pursuant to this section prior to execution of the lease and agreement required by this section and such other agreements as may be necessary or convenient in the Universitys judgment to provide for the transfer of t he operations of the hospital facilities to the Authority, unless and to the extent that the University approves otherwise. I. The Univers ity may assign and the Authority may accept the rights and assume the obligations under any contract or other agreement of any type relating to financing or operating the hospital facilities. Upon evidence that such assignment and acceptance has been mad e, all agencies and instrumentalities of the Commonwealth shall consent to such assignment and accept the substitution of the Authority for the University as a party to such agreement to the extent that the Universitys obligations under such agreemen t relate to the ownership, operation, or financing of the hospital facilities. Indebtedness previously incurred by the Commonwealth, the Virginia Public Building Authority, the Virginia College Building Authority, and any other agency or instrumentality of the Commonwealth to finance the hospital facilities may continue to remain outstanding after the transfer and assignment of such agreement by the University to the Authority. J. The transfe r of the hospital facilities from the University to the Authority does not require a certificate of public need pursuant to Article 1.1 (§ 32.1-102.1 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 32.1. All licenses, permits, certificates of public need, or other aut horizations of the Commonwealth, any agency of the Commonwealth, or any locality held by the University in connection with the ownership or operation of the hospital facilities are transferred without further action to the Authority to the extent that th e Authority undertakes the activity permitted by such authorizations. All agencies and officers of the Commonwealth and all localities shall confirm such transfer by the issuance of new or amended licenses, permits, certificates of public need, or other authorizations upon the request of the University and the Authority. K. If for any reason the Authority cannot replace the University as a party to any agreement in connection with the financing, ownership, or operation of the hospital facilities, the Authority and the University may require the Authority to act as agent for the Univer sity in carrying out its obligations under such agreement or receiving the benefits under such agreement, or both.

The Authority shall reimburse the Virginia Retirement S ystem for the actual cost of actuarial services necessary to determine the present value of the accrued basic benefit of employees who elect to transfer to the Authoritys retirement plan.

Even if the Court were n ot to agree, however, VCU Health System Authority also satisfies the criteria of a quasi-municipal corporation and therefore would be entitled to immunity for governmental functions.

Single-sex education.  Virginia failed to show exceedingly persuasive justification for excluding all women from the citizen-soldier training afforded by VMI. Therefore, the United Stat es Supreme Court would affirm the Fourth Circuits initial judgment, which held that Virginia had violated the Fourteenth Amendments equal protection clause. Because the remedy proffered by Virginia  the Mary Baldwin Virginia Womens Instit ute for Leadership (VWIL) program  does not cure the constitutional violation, i.e., it does not provide equal opportunity, the United States Supreme Court would reverse the Fourth Circuits final judgment in this case.
