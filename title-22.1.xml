Transition provisions. At its regular session of 1977, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to make a study of the laws governing public elementary and secondary education in the Commonwealth and to recommend to the House Education Committee and the Senate Education and Health Committee such legislation as the members of the Commission should deem advisable or necessary. In January of 1980, the Commission sent to the Gover nor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 22, Education. This report, which was published as House Document No. 21 of the 1980 session, contains revisers notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commissions draft of the revision of Title 22, as amended by the General Assembly, became c. 559 of the Acts of 1980. Effective Oct. 1, 1980, it repeals Title 22 and enacts in lieu thereof a new Title 22.1. In addition to its revision by c. 559, former Title 22 was also amended by certain other acts passed at the 1980 session. As required by § 30-152, the Code Com mission has incorporated these amendments into new Title 22.1. Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 22 and earlier statutes. Editors note.

The public schools in each school division shall be free to each person of school age who resides within the school division. Every person of school age shall be deemed to reside in a school division: 1. When the person is living with a natural parent or a parent by legal adoption; 2. When, in accordance with the provisions of § 22.1-360, the person is living with a noncustodial parent or other person standing in loco parentis, not solely for school purposes, pur suant to a Special Power of Attorney executed under 10 U.S.C. § 1044b by the custodial parent; 3. When the parents of such person are dead and the person is living with a person in loco parentis who actually resides within the school division; 4. When the parents of such person are unable to care for the person and the person is living, not solely for school purposes, with another person who resides in the school division and i s (i) the court-appointed guardian, or has legal custody, of the person; (ii) acting in loco parentis pursuant to placement of the person for adoption by a person or entity authorized to do so under § 63.2-1200; or (iii) an adult relative providing te mporary kinship care as that term is defined in § 63.2-100.

A school division may also require the parent or adult relative to obtain written verification from the local department of social services where the parent or parents live, or from both that depart ment and the department of social services where the kinship provider lives, that the kinship arrangement serves a legitimate purpose that is in the best interest of the person other than school enrollment. With written consent from the parent or adult r elative, for the purposes of expediting enrollment, a school division may obtain such written verification directly from the local department or departments of social services. The verification process shall be consistent with confidentiality provisions of Article 5 (§ 22.1-287 et seq.) of Chapter 14 of this title and Chapter 1 (§ 63.2-100 et seq.) of Title 63.2. If the kinship care arrangement lasts more than one year, a school division may require continued verification directly from one or both departments of social services as to why the parents are unable to care for the person and that the kinship care arrangement serves a legitimate purpose other than school enrollment. A local school division may enroll a person living with a relative in a kinship care arrangement that has not been verified by a local department of social services; 5. When the person is living in the school division not solely for school purposes, as an emancipated minor; 6. When all or any portion of the building in which such person resides (i) with another person as set forth in subdivisions 1 through 4 or (ii) as an emancipated minor as set forth in su bdivision 5 is taxable by the locality in which the school division is located; or 7.

Who i s attending a school free of charge in accordance with this section shall be charged tuition by that school division upon such childs relocation to military housing located in another school division in the Commonwealth, pursuant to orders received b y such childs parent to relocate to base housing. Such children shall be allowed to continue attending school in the school division they attended immediately prior to the relocation and shall not be charged tuition for attending such school; 2.

Such children shall be allowed to remain enrolled in the current school division free of tuition through the end of the school year; and 3. Who is eligible to attend school free of charge in accordance with this section shall be charged tuition by a school division that will be the childs school division of residence o nce his service member parent is relocated pursuant to orders received. Such a child shall be allowed to enroll in the school division of the childs intended residence if documentation is provided, at the time of enrollment, of military orders of the service member parent or an official letter from the service members command indicating such relocation.

D. Consistent with the authority of the Board pursuant to Article VIII, Section 5 of the Constitution of Virginia to designate school divisions in the Commonwealth of such geographic size and school-age population as will best promote the realization of the standards of quality, local school boards may submit proposals for the consolidation of school divisions to the Board of Education.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. New district may not be created which would impede process of school desegregation.  A new school district may not be created where its effect would be to impede the process of dismantling a racially dual system. Wright v. Council of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S. Ct. 2196, 33 L. Ed. 2d 51, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 31 (1972). Where the effect of a new second-class citys proposal was to erect new boundary lines for the purpose of school attendance in a district where no such lines h ad previously existed, and where a racially dual school system had long flourished, the proposal would be judged according to whether it hindered or furthered the process of school desegregation. If the proposal would impede the dismantling of the dual s ystem, then a federal district court, in the exercise of its remedial discretion, could enjoin it from being carried out. Wright v. Council of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 92 S. Ct. 2196, 33 L. Ed. 2d 51, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 31 (1972). State Board, acting alone, could not consolidate school systems of Richmond, Henrico and Chesterfield.  Neither under the old Constitution and statutes in effect prior to July 1, 1971, nor under the new Constitution and statutes in effect after that date, could the State Board of Education, acting alone, have effected the consolidation of the school systems of Richmond, Henrico and Chesterfield into a single system under the control of a single school board.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Constitutionality of legislation.  Virginia Constitution was violated because the statutes at issue purported to establish a statewide school division that was not supervised by a school board, pur ported to divest local school boards of authority to supervise public schools within their respective school divisions, and purported to require local school boards to relinquish control of school property to the Opportunity Educational Institution and p urported to prohibit school boards from selling real property without Opportunity Educational Institutions permission.

Two or more school boards may, with the consent of the State Board, establish joint or regional schools, including regional public charter schools as defined in § 22.1-212.5, comprehensive schools offering all-day academic programs and career and technical educa tion, and regional residential charter schools for at-risk pupils, for the use of their respective school divisions and may jointly purchase, take, hold, lease, convey and condemn both real and personal property for such joint, regional, or regional publ ic charter schools. The school boards, acting jointly, shall have the same power of condemnation as other school boards except that land so condemned shall not be in excess of 30 acres for the use of any one joint or regional school. The title to all pro perty acquired for such purposes shall vest jointly in the school boards in such respective proportions as the school boards may determine, and the schools shall be managed and controlled by the school boards jointly, in accordance with such regulations as are promulgated by the State Board. With the approval of the participating school boards and the respective local governing bodies, title to property acquired for a joint school shall be vested in the governing body of such school. The school boards o perating a regional public charter school shall determine the school division to which any regional public charter school is assigned for the purposes of any restrictions on the number of public charter schools imposed by § 22.1-212.11. B. Effective J uly 1, 2008, joint, regional, or regional charter schools in operation prior to the promulgation of new regulations may request a waiver of the new regulation requirements. This waiver request shall be submitted to the Board of Education on a form and in a manner prescribed by the Board. If the Board of Education grants the waiver request, the approved school shall continue to operate under the previous regulations. C. Consistent with the provisions of this section, two or more school boards may, with the consent of the State Board, establish joint or regional schools, including regional public charter schools, to serve as high schools offering (i) in addition to a comprehensive high school curriculum, specialized training to students desiring to pursue careers in law enforcement, fire fighting, emergency and rescue services, and other occupations addressing public safety and welfare; or (ii) a specialized curriculum leading to a high school diploma and a postsecondary credential, such as industry certification, career certificate, or degree; or (iii) both.Such schools described in clause (i) may be designed to incorporate the instructional services of retired or disabled emerg ency, fire, rescue, and law-enforcement personnel and internships with local agencies and organizations providing such emergency, fire, rescue, and law-enforcement services.The relevant school boards operating schools described in clause (ii) may, by agr eement, establish alternative schedules for the delivery of instruction that may include alternatives to standard school day and year requirements, subject to the issuance of any necessary waivers by the Board of Education pursuant to § 22.1-79.1 and relevant Board regulations. Such school boards may contract with an accredited institution of higher education or other postsecondary school licensed or certified by the Board of Education or the State Council of Higher Education, as the case may be, pur suant to Chapter 16 (§ 22.1-319 et seq.) of this title or Article 3 (§ 23.1-213 et seq.) of Chapter 2 of Title 23.1, to deliver such instruction, which may include specialized instruction and training for students who are eligible to enroll in publ ic high schools, consistent with §§ 22.1-3, 22.1-5, and 22.1-213. D. Joint or re gional schools, such as academic year Governors Schools, may set the school calendar so that the first day students are required to attend school shall comport with the calendar of any of the participating school divisions, including those granted a waiver, as prescribed in § 22.1-79.1.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Any funds available for school purposes may be appropriated to build joint schoolhouses, from whatever source they may be derived, whether under a special act, or under any general acts providing methods for raising funds for district school purposes. But this is only true if the special act does not specifically provide how the funds deriv ed from the bond issue under the act should be appropriated. Where the special act is full and complete in itself and specific as to the appropriation of the funds derived from it, the act cannot be pursued for the purpose of raising funds and when they are raised then abandoned and a provision of the general law applied as to the allocation of the funds, when there is a conflict between the general law and the special act upon the question of allocation.

CASE NOTES The power to operate, maintain and supervise public schools in Virginia is, and has alwa ys been, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the local school boards and not within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education. Bradley v. School Bd., 462 F.2d 1058, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 9202 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S. Ct. 1952, 36 L. Ed. 2d 771, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 68 (1973) (decided under prior law). School board vested with supervision of schools.  Both the Constitution of Virginia and the corresponding statute mandate that the supervision of schools in each school division shall be vested in a school board. Bristol Va. School Bd. v. Quarles, 235 Va. 108, 366 S.E.2d 82, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2039, 1988 Va. LEXIS 22 (1988). Governmental immunity.  School boards partake of the sovereignty of the State with regard to immunity from tort liability. Kellam v. School Bd., 202 Va. 252, 117 S.E.2d 96, 1960 Va. LEXI S 214 (1960) (decided under prior law). Liability of l ocal school boards under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Local governing bodies, including school boards and municipal officials in their official capacities, can be sued directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief when alleged unconstitutional action executes governmental policy or custom. Local school boards in Virginia are charged with being the local governing bodies of the school divisions, and retain sole final decision-maki ng authority. Flickinger v. School Bd., 799 F. Supp. 586, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11704 (E.D. Va. 1992). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Redistricting plans.  Parents of elementary school students who sued the school board were unsuccessful in their attempt to annul its adoption of new school attendance zones, as they f ailed to meet their burden under § 22.1-87 to prove the boards redistricting decision affecting their children was arbitrary, capricious, or done in bad faith. Hunn v. Loudoun County Sch. Bd., 98 Va. Cir. 418, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 63 (Loudoun Count y Aug. 20, 2012). Governmental immunity.  County public schools plea in bar of sovereign immunity was granted because a contractors unjust enrichment and quantum meruit causes of action were barre d by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Akian, Inc. v. Spotsylvania Cty. Pub. Schs, 100 Va. Cir. 80, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 329 (Spotsylvania County Sept. 21, 2018). Sovereign immunity protection provided to a school board, as an agency or arm of the Commonwealth, for tort claims encompasses quasi-contract claims as well, and neither the common law obligation of the Commonwealth to abide by its contracts nor the statute subjects the Commonwealth to quasi-contract claims of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit; these causes of action are not subject to the theories and remedie s of contract law nor are they immixed with contract or arise therefrom. Akian, Inc. v. Spotsylvania Cty. Pub. Schs, 100 Va. Cir. 80, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 329 (Spotsylvania County Sept. 21, 2018). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Governmental immunity.  School board that employs janitors is pursuing a governmental function for purposes of immunity from tort liability. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honora ble David Englin, Member, House of Delegates, 07-095, 2008 Va. AG LEXIS 5 (2/28/08). County school board is solely responsibility for school consolidation.  A school board is solely responsible for the decision whether and how to consolidate schools, and a county board of supervisors may not instruct the school board to consolidate schools or how to consolidate schools, but may make a recommendation. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Terry C. Kilgore, Member, House of Delegates, 10-118, (12/08/10). Modification of decisions regarding consolidation.  When circumstances change, a school board may revisit any decision regarding consolidation of schools. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Dan C. Bow ling, Member, House of Delegates 08-034, 2008 Va. AG LEXIS 18 (7/10/08). Outs ourcing of administrative functions by school board.  Outsourcing of certain functions by a school board is permissible so long as school boards and localities comply with statutory and constitutional restrictions. S ee opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable T. Scott Garrett, M.D., Member, House of Delegates, 10-122, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (01/21/11). Consolidation of school board and county administrative functions.  A school board can consolidate certain functions with a locality, but in doing so the school board may not abrogate its duties or compromise its independence with respect to its core responsibilities. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable T. Scott Garrett, M.D., Member, House of Delegates, 10-122, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (01/21/11). School safety.  Virginia law authorizes school resource officers and certain school security officers to possess firearms on public school grounds as school safety personnel, but such authority is not extended to teachers and administrators. See opinion of Attorney General to Ms. Shannon Dion, Director, Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services, 18-042, (8/28/2018). Selection of textbooks.  A local school board may select and use textbooks that are not approved by the Board of Education, provided it complies with the Boards regulations governing such selection. Further, a local school board must give official approval of criteria to be used for review and assessment of textbooks at the local level. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert G. Marshall, Member, House of Dele gates, 09-022, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 32 (7/27/09). School board has the authority to remove books from a public school library for reasons such as pervasive vulgarity, educational unsuitability, or age inappropriateness based on its good faith educational judgment; such decisions regardi ng any particular materials, however, would require the school board to make a factual determination. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Frank S. Hargrove, Sr., Member, House of Delegates, 02-097 (4/22/03). Establishment of payroll dates.  The authority to establish payroll dates for school division employees rests with the school board, including the establishment of regular payroll periods, but th e mechanics of making the payments to schools rest with the treasurer of the locality. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable G. Glenn Oder and The Honorable Marty G. Eubank, Treasurer, City of Newport News, 11-003, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 14 (2/25/1 1). Discrimination.  Because the power to protect students and employees from discrimination in the public school system is a power fairly implied from the express grant of authority to school boards under Article VIII, § 7 of the Constitution of Virginia and from the specific authority granted to boards by the General Assembly in §§ 22.1-28, 22.1-78 and 22.1-253.13:7, the Dillon Rule does not prevent school boards from amen ding their antidiscrimination policies to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

Annotations CASE NOTES Virginias statutory scheme for appointing local school boards does not violate the First Amendment, even though some of the original supporters of that scheme hoped it would exclude African-Americans from school boards. Such an effect is by no means inevitable and the statutes do not facially place a unique burden on African-Americans . Irby v. Fitz-Hugh, 692 F. Supp. 610, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17201 (E.D.

Virginias statutory scheme for appointing local school boards does not violate the Thirteenth Amendment, even though the system appears to limit African-American participation. The Fifteenth Amendment, the Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment address the issue directly and can provide adequate protection. Irby v. Fitz-Hugh, 692 F.

Annotations CASE NOTES Cons titutionality of system of appointing school boards.  Even if the system of appointing district school boards was conceived and maintained until 1971 for the purpose of limiting African-American participation in the selection of and participation on school boards, in a challenge to the system based on the federal Constitution and the Voting Rights Act the state met its burden of showing that since 1971 the system has not been maintained for racially discriminatory r easons.

Virginias statutory scheme for appointing local school boards does not violate the First Amendment, even though some of the original supporters of that scheme hoped it would exclude African-Americans from school boards.

Referendum in certain consolidated cities. Text Notwithstanding the provisions of this article or any other statutory provision, where an existing city and a county consolidate into a consolidated city and where the county at the time of consolidation is providing all school services to the existing city by contract pursuant to § 22.1-27 and the voters of the county have approved direct election of the school board, the consolidation plan or agreement shall provi de for the election of school board members directly by the voters of the consolidated city without the necessity of a further referendum under § 22.1-57.2; in such case, the consolidation plan or agreement shall provide that the members of the initia l school board shall be elected from the municipal election districts designated in the consolidation plan or agreement.

Election of school board members; election of tie breaker. Text A. If a majori ty of the qualified voters voting in such referendum vote in favor of changing the method of selecting school board members to direct election by the voters, then the members of the school board shall be elected by popular vote. Elections of school board members in a county, city, or town shall be held to coincide with the elections for members of the governing body of the county, city, or town at the regular general election in November or the regular general election in May, as the case may be. B. The initial elected board shall consist of the same number of members as the appointed school board it replaces, and the members shall be elected from the established county or municipal election districts, at large, or a combination thereof, on the same basis as t he school board previously was appointed. If the appointed school board being replaced has not been appointed either on an at-large basis or on the basis of the established county or municipal election districts, or a combination thereof, the members sha ll be elected at large unless the governing body of the county, city, or town provides for the election of school board members on the basis of the established county or municipal election districts. If the appointed school board being replaced has been appointed at large, the governing body of the county, city, or town may establish school election districts for the election of school board members. The governing body may provide for a locality-wide district, one or more districts comprised of a part o f the locality, or any combination thereof, and for the apportionment of one or more school board members to any district.The terms of the members of the elected school board for any county, city, or town shall be the same as the terms of the members of the governing body for the county, city, or town. In any locality in which both the school board and the governing body are elected from election districts, as opposed to being elected wholly on an at-large basis, the elections of the school board member and governing body member from each specific district shall be held simultaneously except as otherwise provided in §§ 22.1-57.3:1, 22.1-57.3:1.1, and 22.1-57.3:1.2.At the first election for members of the school board, so many members shall be ele cted as there are members to be elected at the regular election for the governing body. At each subsequent regular election for members of the governing body, the same number of members of the school board shall be elected as the number of members to be elected at the regular election to the governing body. However, if the number of members on the school board differs from the number of members of the governing body, the number of members elected to the school board at the first and subsequent general e lection shall be either more or less than the number of governing body members, as appropriate, to the end that the number of members on the initial elected school board is the same as the number of members on the appointed board being replaced.Except as provided in §§ 22.1-57.3:1, 22.1-57.3:1.1, and 22.1-57.3:1.2, the terms of the members of the school board shall be staggered only if the terms of the members of the governing body are staggered. If there are more, or fewer, members on the school board than on the governing body, the number of members to be elected to the school board at the first and subsequent election for school board members shall be the number required to establish the staggered term structure so that (i) a majority of the m embers of the school board is elected at the same time as a majority of the members of the governing body; (ii) if one-half of the governing body is being elected and the school board has an even number of members, one-half of the members of the school b oard is elected; (iii) if one-half of the governing body is being elected and the school board has an odd number of members, the majority by one member of the school board is elected at the first election and the remainder of...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_22.1-58"><akn:num>§ 22.1-58</akn:num><akn:heading>Division superintendent required</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text For each school division there shall be a division superintendent of schools.

For related discussion, see 16 M.J. Schools, § 11.1. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Power to operate, maintain and supervise public schools in Virginia is, and has always b een, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the local school boards and not within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education. Bradley v. School Bd., 462 F.2d 1058, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 9202 (4th Cir. 1972), aff'd, 412 U.S. 92, 93 S. Ct. 1952, 36 L. Ed. 2d 771, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 68 (1973). Governmental immunity.  School boards partake of the sovereignty of the State with regard to immunity from tort liability. Kellam v. School Bd., 202 Va. 252, 117 S.E.2d 96, 1960 Va. LEXI S 214 (1960). The fact that this section provides that school boards may sue and be sued does not affect their governmental immunity for tortious personal injur y. Kellam v. School Bd., 202 Va. 252, 117 S.E.2d 96, 1960 Va. LEXIS 214 (1960). In a case in which a reporter asserted a state law claim for defamation against a county school board, the board was immune from suit for tort claims, which inclu ded the reporters defamation claim. Cole v. Buchanan County Sch. Bd., 661 F. Supp. 2d 569, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101811 (W.D. Va. 2009). In a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 case in which a reporter sued a county board of education for monetary damages and injunctive relief, asserting that they had violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by retaliating against him for publicly criticizing the board and its members, the board unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment, arguing that it could not be sued for damages by virtue of the Eleventh Amendmen t. A judgment would not have to be paid from the states treasury; while the board received money from the state and it had to follow statewide rules regarding aspects of course curriculum or annual budgets, those factors did not shift the balance tow ard a finding of sovereign immunity. Cole v. Buchanan County Sch. Bd., 661 F. Supp. 2d 569, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101811 (W.D. Va. 2009). Suit by board must be br ought in corporate name.  A suit to recover a fund belonging to the county school board must be brought in its corporate name. A suit by persons styling themselves the directors of the cou nty school board of their county cannot be maintained. Stewart v. Thornton, 75 Va. 215, 1881 Va. LEXIS 6 (1881). State not necessary party to litigation involving local school board.  See United States v. County Sch. Bd., 221 F. Supp. 93, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7737 (E.D. Va. 1963). Board can act only through duly authorized agents.  A local school board, as with other bodies corporate, can act only through its duly authorized agents and, of necessity, must delegate responsibility for the day to day operation of schools to its agents and employees. Pleasants v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 646, 203 S.E.2d 114, 1974 Va. LEXIS 192 (1974). Liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Local governing bodies, including school boards and municipal officials in their official capacities, can be sued directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief when alleged unconstitutional action executes governmental policy or custom. Flickinger v. School Bd., 799 F. Supp. 586, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11704 (E.D. Va. 1992). Whether viewed as arms of the county or state government or as independent subdivisions of the State, county school boards are not persons within the mean ing of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and are not proper defendants in a suit under that statute and its jurisdictional counterpart. Likewise, for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 purposes, there is no distinction in principle between a county school board and the persons in th eir official capacities of whom it is comprised. Jones v. Dinwiddie County Sch. Bd., 373 F. Supp. 1105, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9026 (E.D. Va. 1974). But see Flickinger v. School Bd., 799 F. Supp. 586, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11704 (E.D. Va. 1992). Supervision of schools vested in school boards.  Summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs was reversed as the city could not be required to fund a federal court order mandating the system-wide retrofitting of cit y schools, under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 12131-34, without any determination that the city discriminated against or otherwise excluded plaintiffs from its services and activities; to impose a funding ob ligation on the city in the absence of any underlying finding of liability disrespected the long-standing structure of local government and impaired the Commonwealths ability to structure its state institutions and run its schools. The settlement ter ms ultimately reached by plaintiffs and the school board as a result of arms-length negotiation were obligations on the school boards part and it could present whatever ADA duties it had, not only to the city, but also to other funding entities. Baco n v. City of Richmond, 475 F.3d 633, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 1404 (4th Cir. 2007). Right to contract does not expressly confer right to arbitrate.  Both the Public Procurement Act, former § 11-35 et seq. [see now § 2.2-4300 et seq.], and former § 15.1-508 [see now § 15.2-1404] confirm that the Vir ginia General Assembly does not consider the grant of a right to contract as expressly conferring a right to agree to arbitrate. W.M. Schlosser Co. v. School Bd., 980 F.2d 253, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 30278 (4th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 909, 113 S . Ct. 2340, 124 L. Ed. 2d 251, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 3243 (1993). Power to bargain collectively not conferred on local boards.  Recent Virginia history of public employee collective bargaining is persuasive, if not conclusive, that the General Assembly, the source of legislative intent wit h regard to the powers of boards to enter into contracts and to hire employees and fix the terms and conditions of their employment, has never conferred upon local boards, by implication or otherwise, the power to bargain collectively and that express st atutory authority, so far withheld, is necessary to confer the power. Commonwealth v. County Bd., 217 Va. 558, 232 S.E.2d 30, 1977 Va. LEXIS 204 (1977). To the extent that the policies of a county board and school board permit collective bargaining and collective bargaining agreements with recognized labor organiz ations, the policies are invalid, and because the contracts entered into are the products of such collective bargaining, the agreements are void. Commonwealth v. County Bd., 217 Va. 558, 232 S.E.2d 30, 1977 Va. LEXIS 204 (1977). School boards are subject to statutes of limitation, since they are incorporated within the meaning of the former second sentence of § 8.01-231, excepting from that section agencies incorporated for charitable or educational purposes. County School Bd. v. Whitlow, 223 Va. 157, 286 S.E.2d 230, 1982 Va. LEXIS 183 (1982). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Sovereign immunity.  Sovereign immunity protection provided to a school board, as an agency or arm of the Commonwealth, for tort claims encompasses quasi-contract claims as well, and neither the common law obligation of the Commonwealth to abide by its contracts nor the statute subjects the Commonwealth to quasi-contract claims of unjust enrichment and quantum meruit; these causes of action are not subject to the theories and remedie s of contract law nor are they immixed with contract or arise therefrom. Akian, Inc. v. Spotsylvania Cty. Pub. Schs, 100 Va. Cir. 80, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 329 (Spotsylvania County Sept. 21, 2018). County public schools plea in bar of sovereign immunity was granted because a contractors unjust enrichment and quantum meruit causes of action were barre d by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Akian, Inc. v. Spotsylvania Cty. Pub. Schs, 100 Va. Cir. 80, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 329 (Spotsylvania County Sept. 21, 2018). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL County school board does not have authority to prohibit the possession of firearms at school board meetings that are not held on school property. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James E. Barnett, County Attorney for York County, 06-072, 2007 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (1/29/07). Rules of School Board restricting speech at public meetings.  Certain rules of School Board restricting the speech of speakers at public meetings violate the free speech rights of speakers; the Board may not constitutionally bar speakers from discussing personnel issues or identifying individual school employees or officials during public session. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Richard L (Rick) Morris, Member, House of Delegates, 15-020, 2016 Va. AG LEXIS 5 (4/15/16). School construction financing.  School Boards potential lease of a school facility in connection with the financing of the schools construction pursuant to the Public-Private Education F acilities and Infrastructure Act of 2002, would not be considered a debt of the city subject to the limitations of Article VII, § 10 of the Constitution of Virginia.

For related discussion, see 16 M.J. Schools, § 22. CASE NOTES Liability of school boar ds under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Local governing bodies, including school boards and municipal officials in their official capacities, can be sued directly under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief when alleged unconstitutional action executes governmental policy or custom. Flickinger v. School Bd., 799 F. Supp. 586, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11704 (E.D. Va. 1992). The delegation of power to the school board includes the function of adopting and applyi ng local policies, rules, and regulations for the supervision of the schools, including the management of a teaching staff. Underwood v. Henry County Sch. Bd., 245 Va. 127, 427 S.E.2d 330, 9 Va. Law Rep. 904, 1993 Va. LEXIS 47 (1993). School boards authority.  Supreme Court held that a local school board did not have the authority to adopt a policy requiring parents to provide a birth certificate and proof of residence in the county for any child who is homeschooled pursuant to § 22.1-78 because that statute only allows school boards to adopt regulations for the supervision of public schools. The school board was enjoined from enforcing the policy. Sosebee v. Frankl in Cty. Sch. Bd., 299 Va. 17, 843 S.E.2d 367, 2020 Va. LEXIS 62 (2020). It is clear that a school boards authority under § 22.1-78 to adopt regulations for the supervision of schools means for the supervision of public schools, not home instruction. Sosebee v. Franklin Cty. Sch. Bd., 299 Va. 17, 843 S.E.2d 367, 2020 Va. LEXIS 62 (2020). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Violation of regulations.  Parents of gifted public school students were entitled to an injunction against a school board because they sufficiently alleged that they and their child were im mediately or imminently affected by a school board decision to remove standardized testing as a prerequisite for admission to a Governors School since Governors Schools were, by definition, programs developed solely for gifted students, the elimi nation of the standardized tests, and the failure to replace those tests with other equivalent testing, allowed a cause of action for invoking judicial review since such actions might, in addition to violating promulgated regulations, violate the statuto ry prohibition against adopting policies in contravention of promulgated regulations. KC v. Fairfax Cty. Sch. Bd., 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 13 (Fairfax County Jan. 21, 2021). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Discrimination.  Because the power to protect students and employees from discrimination in the public school system is a power fairly implied from the express grant of authority to school boards under Article VIII, § 7 of the Constitution of Virginia and from the specific authority granted to boards by the General Assembly in §§ 22.1-28, 22.1-78 and 22.1-253.13:7, the Dillon Rule does not prevent school boards from amen ding their antidiscrimination policies to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Adam P. Ebbin, Member, Senate of Virginia, No. 14-080, 2015 Va. AG LEXIS 9 (3/4/15) . School safety.  Virginia law authorizes school resource officers and certain school security officers to possess firearms on public school grounds as school safety personnel, but such authority is not extended to teachers and administrators. See opinion of Attorney General to Ms. Shannon Dion, Director, Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services, 18-042, (8/28/2018). Freedom of Information Act requests.  A School Boards policy, which states that if considerable work or time is required to generate information requested from the administration by a Board Me mber, then the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (VFOIA) request must be denied unless the full Board endorses the request, is in conflict with VFOIA.

Chapter 2 Potential Jurisdiction. § 2.03 Courts. Bryson. CASE NOTES Exhaustion of administrative remedy.  In a suit in behalf of black school children to enjoin a local school board from enforcing racial segregation, it was held that the administrative remedy provided by statute, if applicable, had been exhausted, where applications had been made to the school board without result by counsel acting in behalf of the plaintiffs. School Bd. v. Allen, 240 F.2d 59, 1956 U.S. App. LEXIS 4264 (4th Cir. 1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 910, 77 S. Ct. 667, 1 L. Ed. 2d 664, 1957 U.S. LEXIS 1149 (1957) (decided under prior law). Limita tion period not adopted for federal EAHCA actions.  While judicial review under this section is sufficiently analogous to a federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) action under 20 U.S.C. § 145 1 et seq. to warrant adopting the limitation period of this section, the 30-day limitation period of this section is inconsistent with the policies underlying the EAHCA. For this reason, the limitation period in this section is not adopted for EAHCA acti ons. Kirchgessner ex rel. Kirchgessner v. Davis, 632 F. Supp. 616, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26840 (W.D. Va. 1986). Parental notification is an issue best addressed by state law, not a constitutional ruling.  Court dismissed the mothers claim that schools failure to notify her while questioning her daughter for allegedly having a gun at school, violated her rig hts to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment because state law and school board rules provide rights and remedies that bear on this question. Wofford v. Evans, 390 F.3d 318, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 24181 (4th Cir. 2004). Due process in stu dent disciplinary proceedings.  School board did not act arbitrarily in school disciplinary proceedings, in violation of a students due process rights, because the assistant principals o ral description of the facts known to school personnel, coupled with the principals letter and the discipline packet, notified the student of the allegations against the student. Furthermore, as the students own testimony confirmed, the student k new of the schools prohibition against improper touching of another person before the student engaged in the students conduct. Fairfax Cty. Sch. Bd. v. S.C., 297 Va. 363, 827 S.E.2d 592, 2019 Va. LEXIS 49 (2019). Court assumed without deciding that the student had some liberty or property interest implicated by her disciplinary transfer from one school to another, but even so, she received all process she was due; hearing officers finding that she sexually touched other students without their consent, thus violating the school policy prohibition against improper touching of another, fit within Offensive Touching A gainst Student, a generic reporting code required by statute. The student knew of the prohibition and the school board did not act arbitrarily. Fairfax County Sch. Bd. v. S.C., 2019 Va. LEXIS 169 (Va. May 30, 2019). Standing.  In a case regarding whether a student at a public high school, by and through his parents as next friends, had standing to sue a school board based on his alleged distress over potential repercussions from the school boards expansion of its anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policy, the circuit court concluded that the complaint failed to set forth an actual controversy. Plaintiffs did not articulate uni que injuries compared to that of the general public and thus could not claim taxpayer standing. Lafferty v. Sch. Bd. of Fairfax Cnty., 293 Va. 354, 798 S.E.2d 164, 2017 Va. LEXIS 58 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Evidentiary basis suppor ting board decision.  School boards transfer of a student from one school to another pursuant to its authority under subdivision 4 of § 22.1-79 as a result of an altercation was upheld under § 22.1-87 because there was an evidentiary basis for the boards decision; based on an eyewitness account, the students self-defense claim was debatable. Carney v. City of Richmond, 72 Va. Cir. 250, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 310 (Richmo nd Nov. 13, 2006). School board had authority to make boundary adjustments.  Because a school board had authority to make the boundary adjustments at issue, and because the board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously or abuse the board s discretion, the parents § 22.1-87 petition for review was denied. Pascale v. Fairfax County Sch. Bd., 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 80 (Fairfax County July 28, 2008). Boundary adjustments were proper.  Parents of elementary school students who sued the school board were unsuccessful in their attempt to annul its adoption of new school attendance zones, as they f ailed to meet their burden under § 22.1-87 to prove the boards redistricting decision affecting their children was arbitrary, capricious, or done in bad faith. Hunn v. Loudoun County Sch. Bd., 98 Va. Cir. 418, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 63 (Loudoun Count y Aug. 20, 2012). Standing.  Parents of elementary school children had standing to appeal a school boards adoption of new school attendance zones; as the change in school boundaries would have a direct and immediate effect on the delivery of educational services to petitioners children, petitioners were aggrieved under § 22.1-87. Hunn v. Loudoun County Sch. Bd., 98 Va. Cir. 418, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 63 (Loudoun County Aug. 20, 2012). Language of this statute restricts its application to parents or custodians/guardians of a child attending the school system at issue. Therefore, a parent did not have standing to file a lawsuit against a city school board under this statute because her child no longer was a student there; moreover, the parent did not fall within an exception to the mootness and standing bar because she did not show that she woul d have been subjected to the alleged illegality again. Jones v. Sch. Bd. of Richmond, 91 Va. Cir. 449, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Richmond Jan. 4, 2016). General Assembly determined that the class of plaintiffs would be exclusive, parent, custodian or legal guardian of a pupil; if the class of plaintiffs was not so limited, then the field of plaintiffs would be wide open to anyone who disagreed with what the school board had done, even if that person was not a parent, custodian or legal guardian. Martinson v. Evans, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Fairfax County Feb. 15, 2018). General Assembly created a thirty-day statute of limitations for the limited class of plaintiffs to bring an action, and while this may seem harsh or unduly restr ictive, it is within the authority of the General Assembly to create a truncated time period; it is not within the courts authority to change the time period or to create exceptions; the General Assembly determined that schools function most efficien tly when perceived wrongs are promptly brought to the attention of the school boards. Martinson v. Evans, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Fairfax County Feb. 15, 2018). Citizens did not have legal standing under Virginia Code Title 22.1 to pursue their action against a school board and board members because the citizens comme nced the lawsuit more than thirty days after the boards action, and they did not allege standing pursuant to any other section of Title 22.1. Martinson v. Evans, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Fairfax County Feb. 15, 2018). Proper defendant.  Demurrers of a school board and its superintendent were sustained since all that was required for the vote was that it be held in an open meeting and it not be se cret, and the claims against the superintendent were not sufficiently pled to show how he acted unlawfully by implementing the policies of the School Board, and a party was allowed to file suit only against a school board, not the superintendent.

Jackson v. Hartig, 274 Va. 219, 645 S.E.2d 303, 2007 Va. LEXIS 96 (2007). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Malfeasance.  School board was not subject to any civil cause of action based on malfeasance because to the extent that the statute prohibits expenditure of any sum of money in excess of funds available for school purposes, no civil liability attached to any member of the school board or division officer for malfeasance in office.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Power of federal court.  A federal court ordinarily has no right or power to interfere with appropriations made by a city council for use by the school board. There is, however, an except ion to this rule where the purpose and intent of council is clearly to flaunt the law of the land and avoid the effect of lawful court orders by participating in a scheme or device to attain its objective. James v. Duckworth, 170 F. Supp. 342, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3722 (D. Va.), aff'd, 267 F.2d 224, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 3861 (4th Cir. 1959). Withholding of funds from certain schools and grades.  The appropriation ordinance of the City of Norfolk for the year 1959 made appropriations for the public schools on a tentative basis, as authorized by former § 22-127 as amended in 1956 and before its amendment in 1959, and provided that no part of the funds so appropriated should be available to the school board except as the council might by resolution authorize. A subsequent resolution authorized the transf er of a certain sum to the school board but stipulated that no part of said sum shall be disbursed for the normal daytime operation of the schools now under the control of the Governor of Virginia without his prior approval. A second resolution d eclared that the council would not thereafter authorize the transfer to the school board for the maintenance and operation of any grade higher than the sixth grade of any part of the funds tentatively appropriated. The federal district court enjoined the enforcement of the ordinance and resolutions, holding that the action of the council in adopting them was tantamount to an evasive scheme or device seeking to perpetuate the program of massive resistance in the public schools of the city, and that they violated the laws of Virginia, as well as the laws and Constitution of the United States.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Malfeasance.  School board was not subject to any civil cause of action based on malfeasance because the statute related to the governing body not the school board, and to the extent it referred to the governing body funding by total only or by major classifications, the funding was by the total.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Consolidation of school board and county administrative functions.  A school board is solely responsible for the decision whether and how to consolidate schools, and a county board of supervisors may not instruct the school board to consolidate schools or how to consolidate schools, but may make a recommendation. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Terry C. Kilgore, Member, House of Delegates, 10-118, (12/08/10). Use of lump sum appropriation.  If the local governing body made a lump sum appropriation to the school board for fiscal year 2011-2012 and a surplus resulted from debt service savings, then the school board may reallocate and spend those savings for other school needs. The question of whether a lump sum appropriation was made to the local school board depends upon the interpretation of a local ordinance, a practice from which this office has t raditionally abstained.

For the pur poses of this section:Declared state of emergency means the declaration of an emergency before or after an event, by the Governor or by officials in a locality, that requires the closure of any or all schools within a school division.Severe weather conditions or other emer gency situations means those circumstances presenting a threat to the health or safety of students that result from severe weather conditions or other emergencies, including n atural and man-made disasters, energy shortages, or power failures. B. Except as p rovided in this section: 1. The l ength of every schools term in every school division shall be at least 180 teaching days or 990 teaching hours in any school year; and 2. If the length of the term of any school or the schools in a school division shall be less than 180 teaching days or 990 teaching hours in any school year, the amount paid by the Common wealth from the Basic School Aid Fund shall, except as otherwise hereinafter provided or as otherwise provided by law, be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the school term has been reduced in any school or the schools in the school division from 180 teaching days or 990 teaching hours. C. Notwithstan ding the requirements of subsection B, in any case in which severe weather conditions or other emergency situations result in the closing of a school or the schools in a school division or in an unscheduled remote learning day for a school or the schools in a school division, the amount paid by the Commonwealth from the Basic School Aid Fund shall not be reduced if one of the following methods of make-up days, make-up hours, or unscheduled remote learning days, as appropriate in the circumstances, is fo llowed: 1. When severe weather conditions or other emergency situations have resulted in the closing of a school or the schools in a school division for five or fewer days, the school or the schools in the school division shall make up all missed days by adding teaching days to the school calendar or extending the length of the school day; 2. When severe weather conditions or other emergency situations have resulted in the closing of a school or the schools in a school division for six days or more, the school or the school s in the school division shall make up the first five days plus one day for each two days missed in excess of the first five by adding teaching days to the school calendar or extending the length of the school day; 3. When severe weather conditions or other emergency situations have resulted in the closing of any school in a school division and such school has been unable to meet the 180 teaching da y requirement, the school division may make up the missed teaching days by providing its students with instructional hours equivalent to such missed teaching days to meet the minimum 990 teaching hour requirement; or 4. When severe weather conditions or other emergency situations have resulted in the closing of any school in a school division for in-person instruction, the school division may declare an unscheduled remote learning day whereby the school provides instruction and student services that are consistent with guidelines established by the Department of Education to ensure the equitable provision of such services. No school division shall cl aim more than 10 unscheduled remote learning days in a school year unless the Superintendent of Public Instruction grants an extension. D. The local a ppropriations for educational purposes necessary to fund 180 teaching days or 990 teaching hours shall also not be proportionally reduced by any local governing body because of any reduction in the length of the term of any school or the schools in a sch ool division authorized by subsection C. E. The foregoi ng provisions of this section notwithstanding, the Board of Education may waive the requirement that school divisions provide additional teaching days or teaching hours to compensate for school closings resulting from a declared state of emergency or sev ere weather conditions or other emergency situations. If the local school board desires a waiver, it shall submit a request to the Board of Education. The request shall include evidence of efforts that have been made by the school division to reschedule as many days as possible and certification by the division superintendent and chairman of the local school board that every reasonable effort for making up lost teaching days or teaching hours was exhausted before requesting a waiver of this requirement. If the waiver is denied, the school division shall make up the missed instructional time in accordance with this section.If the Board grants such a waiver, there shall be no proportionate reduction in the amount paid by the Commonwealth from the Basic S chool Aid Fund. Further, the local appropriations for educational purposes necessary to fund 180 teaching days or 990 teaching hours shall not be proportionally reduced by any local governing body due to any reduction in the length of the term of any sch ool or the schools in a school division permitted by such waiver. F. Notwithstan ding the provisions of this section, the Board of Education shall waive the requirement that school divisions provide additional teaching days or teaching hours to compensate for school closings resulting from an evacuation directed and compelled by the Governor pursuant to § 44-146.17 for up to five teaching days. If the local school board desires such a waiver, it shall notify the Board of Education and provide evidence of efforts that have been made by the school division to reschedule as many day s as possible and certification by the division superintendent and chairman of the local school board that every reasonable effort for making up lost teaching days or teaching hours was exhausted. After receiving such notification, the Board shall grant the waiver and there shall be no proportionate reduction in the amount paid by the Commonwealth from the Basic School Aid Fund. Further, the local appropriations for educational purposes necessary to fund 180 teaching days or 990 teaching hours shall not be proportionally reduced by any local governing body due to any reduction in the length of the term of any school or the schools in a school division permitted by such waiver. G. If the prof essional personnel of any such school division actually render service for less than the contracted period for such school year and their compensation is reduced because of insufficient funds or other reason, the proportionate amount paid by the Commonwe alth for the personnel component of the Basic School Aid Fund for such school year shall be reduced pro rata.Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the school board of any school division in which the length of the term for any school or f or the schools in the school division is reduced as provided in this section may pay its professional personnel such salary as they would have received if the term had not been so reduced. H. In developi ng the school calendar as provided for in § 22.1-79.1, each local school board shall establish such calendars and teaching contracts in accordance with applicable regulations of the Board of Education to include contingencies for making up teaching da ys and teaching hours missed for emergency situations described in this section. Historical data shall be used to determine the needs of the locality including scheduled holidays and breaks and work days. I. The Board o f Education may authorize the Superintendent of Public Instruction to approve, in compliance with this section, reductions in the school term for a school or the schools in a school division without a proportionate reduction in the amount paid by the Com monwealth from the Basic School Aid Fund. J. With the ex ception of the Basic School Aid Fund as provided for above, the Commonwealth shall not distribute funds to a locality for costs not incurred when the school term is reduced below 180 teaching days or 990 teaching hours. K. As part of the annual report required by § 22.1-81, the division superintendent and local school board chairman shall certify the total number of teaching days and teaching hours each year.

CASE NOTES Supervision of schools v ested in school board.  Summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs was reversed as the city could not be required to fund a federal court order mandating the system-wide retrofitting of cit y schools, under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 12131-34, without any determination that the city discriminated against or otherwise excluded plaintiffs from its services and activities; to impose a funding ob ligation on the city in the absence of any underlying finding of liability disrespected the long-standing structure of local government and impaired the Commonwealths ability to structure its state institutions and run its schools. The settlement ter ms ultimately reached by plaintiffs and the school board as a result of arms-length negotiation were obligations on the school boards part and it could present whatever ADA duties it had, not only to the city, but also to other funding entities.

Immunity of school board f rom tort liability.  In permitting a concert to be given on school property, the school board was acting pursuant to the authority granted by statute and was engaged in a governmental function. It therefore partook of the sovereignty of the State with regard to immunity from tort liability. Kellam v. School Bd., 202 Va. 252, 117 S.E.2d 96, 1960 Va. LEXIS 214 (1960). A school auditorium, which has effectively been partially dedicated for First Amendment uses, may be used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens and discussing public questions. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). A school boards repeated exercise of its discretionary authority to rent a high school auditorium for a nominal fee during nonschool hours to public and priva te groups for public and private meetings on a first-come first-served basis, to the extent that the auditorium is not needed for school purposes and that nonschool uses will not endanger the property, constitutes an effective dedication of the auditoriu m for the exercise of the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech, association and assembly. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). Such auditorium is indistinguishable from streets and parks as public place.  Partial dedication as a forum for the exercise of First Amendment rights makes a school auditorium conceptually indistinguishable for First Amendment purposes as a public place from streets and parks, which, too, are acquired and maintained at public expense. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). The use of facilities partially dedicated as a public forum for the expression of diverse views does not amount to state espousal of racist views, whether they are merely expressed or whether they are expressed by a group which implements them by racist membership policies. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). The state action doctrine of the Fourteenth Amendment is not applicable where a group seeks to exercise First Amendment rights in a public forum dedicated to that purpose. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). If a high school auditorium is made available to all groups, the very diversity and comp lexity of the views expressed, taken in bulk, will cure any incidental official identification attendant upon the use of the building for the articulation of extreme or abusive speech. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010, 19 73 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). First Amendment prohibits State from denying generally provided public forum.  The First Amendment prohibits Virginia from hampering its citizens in the exercise of their right to speak and assemble freely by denying a generally provided pub lic forum. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). While limitations may be sustained on use of a school auditorium as a forum to permit it to serve its prime function of school purposes, to serve the general comf ort and convenience, and to preserve peace and good order, including the protection of property, regulation which limits the exercise of First Amendment guarantees should be stricken down. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010 , 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). Denial because of requestors discriminatory membership policies is invalid prior restraint.  A school boards denial of the use of a public forum because of the requestors discriminatory membership policies constitutes as much of an invalid prior r estraint as if it had denied the requestors use of the forum on the basis of the controversial beliefs which the requestor would express at that place. National Socialist White People's Party v. Ringers, 473 F.2d 1010, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 11833 (4th Cir. 1973). § 22.1-131.1. Certain school board property; establishment of gun-free zone permitted. Text Notwithstanding the provisions of § 15.2-915, in addition to ensuring compliance with the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U.S.C. § 922(q), any schoo l board may deem any building or property that it owns or leases where employees of such school board are regularly present for the purpose of performing their official duties, outside of school zones, as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 921, as a gun-free zone and may prohibit any individual from knowingly purchasing, possessing, transferring, carrying, storing, or transporting firearms, ammunition, or components or combination thereof while such individual is upon such property. Such prohibition shall not apply to (i) any law-enforcement officer; (ii) any retired law-enforcement officer qualified to carry firearms pursuant to subsection C of § 18.2-308.016; (iii) any individual who possesses an unloaded firearm that is in a closed container in or upon a motor vehicle or an unloaded shotgun or rifle in a firearms rack in or upon a motor vehicle; or (iv) any individual who has a valid concealed handgun permit and possesses a concealed handgun while in a motor vehicle in a parking lot, traffic circle, or other means of vehicular ingress to or egress from the school board property.

Integrated pest management on school property. Text The Department of Education shall make information available to school boards on integrated pest management programs that appropriately address the application of chemi cal pesticides and other pest control measures on school property. For purposes of this section, integrated pest management shall mean a managed pest control and suppression program that uses various integrated methods to keep pests from causing economic, health-related, or aesthetic injury and minimizes the use of pesticides and the risk to human health and the environment associated with pesticide applications. Methods may include the utilization of site or pest inspections, pest population mo nitoring, evaluation of control requirements, and the use of one or more pest control methods including sanitation, structural repair, nonchemical methods, and pesticides when nontoxic options produce unsatisfactory results or are impractical. Each local school division shall maintain documentation of any pesticide application that includes the target pest, the formulation applied, and the specific location of the application. The guidelines and programs adopted pursuant to this section shall permit the immediate application of pesticides or other effective control measures to eradicate pest infestations that pose an acute danger to students and staff.

Simpson v. Thorsen, 84 Va. Cir. 252, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 7 (Suffolk Jan. 31, 2012). School board and its employees did not enjoy sovereign immunity as to a students gross negligence claims based on injuries he allegedly suffered due to toxic mold infestation of an elementary school, as the board owed a duty to him to operate the school to which he was assigned, and the boards employees had a direct responsibility to the board for maintenance of the facilities, and owed duties to the stud ent that were derivative of their duties to the board.

The governing body of any county, city, or town, if the town constitutes the school division, in which the local school board has borrowed money from the Authority shall include in its levies, and appropriate to the local school board, a fund sufficient to meet the liabilities of the local school board on such loan if and to the extent such liabilities are not otherwise provided for by the General Assembly. The governing body of any county in which the local school board has borrowed money from the Authority for capital projects located in a town in such county constituting a separate school division shall have authority to include, in its levies for such town, a levy sufficient to meet the liabilities of the local school board on such loan if and to the extent such liabilities are not otherwise provided for by the General Assembly and shall levy a separate tax in the rest of the county to meet its liabilities on any contract for c apital projects outside such town. In the event that such local school board shall fail to pay any installment of interest or principal promptly, upon notice in writing to that effect from the State Treasurer, the county, city, or town treasurer shall pa y to the State Treasurer any such past due installment of interest or principal out of the funds in his hands belonging to such county, city, or town. The failure of such governing body to provide for the payment of such loan or the interest thereon when and as due shall be deemed a cause for removal of the members thereof from office on motion before the circuit court having jurisdiction in such county, city, or town, instituted by the attorney for the Commonwealth of such county or city or by the Atto rney General where the attorney for the Commonwealth refuses or neglects to act after demand on him to proceed. E. The local school board of any school division composed of part or all of a county, with the approval of the governing body of the county, is authorized to borrow from the Authority for the purpose of financing capital projects in such county to serve a portion of such county. Taxes on property in the magisterial districts served by such capital projects shall be levied by the governing body of the county and collected for the purpose of repaying such loan; for the purposes of this section, a magisterial district shall not include a town constituting a separate school division but the governing body of the county may levy a separate tax on property in a town in such county constituti ng a separate school division to repay money borrowed by such county from the Authority for the purpose of financing capital projects in such town. Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, all other provisions of law relating to loans from the Au thority shall apply to a loan authorized by this subsection. F. Any local school board which is indebted for any money borrowed from the Authority may anticipate the payment of the principal amount of any such loans, or any part thereof, by the pay ment of such principal amount with interest thereon to the date of such anticipated payment and may borrow money and issue bonds for the purpose of raising funds to pay any notes or other obligations of the local school board now and hereafter held by th e Authority.

In the even t the Authority refunds any bonds previously issued to finance the purchase of local school bonds, the Authority shall pass-through to the issuers of such local school bonds, an allocable share of any savings realized. Such pass-through shall be accompli shed, at the option of the Authority, by means of a debt service reduction over the remaining term of the local school bonds, by a lump sum payment of the present value of such allocable share of the savings, or by such other method as the Authority shal l determine to be in the mutual best interests of the issuers of the local school bonds and the Authority. B. For the pur poses of this section, savings means the net reduction in debt service, if any, to be realized by the Authority, after subtracting the total costs, expenses, and equity contributions associated with the refunding and with the pass-through of such savings to the issuers of the local school bonds and of any Authority funds transferred, or required to be transferred, by mandate of the General Assembly, other than to the issuers of the local school bonds.Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no savings shall be passed-through to the issuers of local school bonds for which an interest rate sub sidy has been paid or which were issued at below market interest rates. The savings in connection with the refunding of bonds issued by the Authority and allocable to local school bonds for which an interest rate subsidy has been paid, to the extent such subsidy was paid from the Literary Fund, shall be transferred to the Literary Fund and used exclusively for Literary Fund loans to local school boards pursuant to Chapter 10 (§ 22.1-142 et seq.) of Title 22.1. C. This sectio n shall have no application if it conflicts with a preexisting trust indenture. D. Whenever th e Authority shall defease its bonds previously issued to finance the purchase of local school bonds, the Authority may, consistent with the provisions of this section respecting the return of savings to the issuers of the related local school bonds, desi gnate to such issuers of local school bonds which issues, series and maturities with which interest rates shall be deemed by the Authority to have been paid. Immediately upon such designation, the local school bonds so designated shall likewise be deemed defeased and no longer outstanding, the same as if the defeasance had occurred in accordance with the provisions of § 15.2-2623. Such defeasance shall not require any action by the issuer of the affected local school bonds, shall be effective immedia tely, and shall be duly noted on the records of the Authority which shall no longer have any right to payment with respect to the issues, series and maturities so deemed by the Authority to have been paid. The elected officials and financial officers of the affected locality are hereby authorized to execute and deliver such federal tax forms, certificates, and other documents as the Authority may request in connection with the defeasance of its local school bonds and the bonds of the Authority.

Linhart v. Lawson, 261 Va. 30, 540 S.E.2d 875, 2001 Va . LEXIS 23 (2001). This section abrogated a school boards sovereign immunity up to the limits of its coverage under a self-insurance pool operated by the Virginia School Board A ssociation, and the trial court properly held that a minor who was injured in a school bus accident and the minors mother were not barred from suing the school board for negligence, and that the school boards liability for damages was not limited to $50,000 under subsection A of § 22.1-190 because the school board had not obtained a certificate of self-insurance from the Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, pursuant to subsection D of § 22.1-190. Frederick County Sch. Bd. v. Hannah, 267 Va. 231, 590 S.E.2d 567, 2004 Va. LEXIS 20 (2004). School boards liable for sim ple negligence.  In enacting this section, the general assembly created an exception to the common law principle that the liabilities of principals and agents are coterminous and imposed liability on a school board for simple negligence, even if its employee is liable only for acts of gross negligence. Linhart v. Lawson, 261 Va. 30, 540 S.E.2d 875, 2001 Va. LEXIS 23 (2001). Immunity of individual emp loyees preserved.  Governmental employees have always been subject to suit for gross negligence and the language in the statute authorizing a suit against an employee and school boa rd jointly does no more than recognize that such an employee is amenable to suit; without more, the language of the statute is insufficient to convey a plainly manifest intent to abrogate a governmental employees immunity for acts of simple negligenc e.

School districts ability to contract for more than statutory minimum.  School district had $1 million in uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist coverage, rather than the statutory minimum of $50,000, because (1) the school district so contracted with a risk pool, (2) neither the statutory minimum nor the provisions of other statutes barred such a contract, (3) the school district had the freedom to so contract, and (4) such insurance was valid and collectible. VACORP v. Yo ung, 298 Va. 490, 840 S.E.2d 334, 2020 Va. LEXIS 34 (2020). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No insurance coverage.  Even if the court were to accept the students argument that the accident occurred during the unloading process, based on the facts, the Powell test, and other cases, the accident did not result from the ownership, maintenance, or use of the bus; the accident occurred after the bus driver removed the student from the bus, when he was on the sidewalk. The bus, at best, was merely the situs of the accident; ther efore, there was no valid and collectible insurance in force to cover the injury complained of under § 22.1-194 and the county school board retained its immunity.

The school boards plan for such program shall be furnished to the Board of Education and shall include the following: 1. A sta tement of purpose and objectives of the kindergarten program that reflects consideration of the different readiness and maturity levels of children in the program; 2. A description of the organization, scheduling and staffing of the program that reflects a responsiveness to the needs of the children of the age span to be served in the program; 3. Evidence that the program plan was developed by a committee that included early childhood specialists, parents, teachers and administrators; 4.

Section 22-218.1:1, from which this section is derived, was amended by Acts 1980, c. 570. The change made by the 1980 amendment in § 22-218.1:1 was incorporate d in this section as enacted by Acts 1980, c. 559. § 22.1-199.1. Programs designed to promote educational opportunities. Text A. The General Assembly finds that Virginia educational research supports the conclusion that poor children are more at risk of educational failure than children from more affluent homes and that reduced pupil/teacher ratios and class sizes result in improved academic performance among young children; to this end, the General Assembly establishes a long-term goal of reducing pupil/teacher ratios and class sizes for grades K through three in those schools in the Commonwealth with high or moderate concentrations of at- risk students. With such funds as are provided in the appropriation act for this purpose, there is hereby established the statewide voluntary pupil/teacher ratio and class size reduct ion program for the purpose of reaching the long-term goal of statewide voluntary pupil/teacher ratio and class size reductions for grades K through three in schools with high or moderate concentrations of at-risk students, consistent with the provisions provided in the appropriation act. In order to facilitate these primary grade ratio and class size reductions, the Department shall calculate the state funding of these voluntary ratio and class size red uctions based on the incremental cost of providing the lower class sizes according to the greater of the division average per-pupil cost of all divisions or the actual division per-pupil cost. Localities shall provide matching funds for these voluntary r atio and class size reductions based on the composite index of local ability to pay. School divisions shall notify the Department of their intention to implement the reduced ratios and class sizes in one or more of their qualifying schools by August 1 of each year. By March 31 of each year, school divisions shall forward data substantiating that each participating school has a complying pupil/teacher ratio. In developing each proposed biennium budget for public education, the Board shall include funding for these ratios and class sizes. These ratios and class sizes shall b e included in the annual budget for public education. B. The General Assembly finds that educational technology is one of the most important components, along with highly skilled teachers, in ensuring the delivery of quality public school education throughout the Commonwealth. Therefore, the Board shall strive to incorpo rate technological studies within the teaching of all disciplines. Further, the General Assembly notes that educational technology can only be successful if teachers and administrators are provided adequate training and assistance. To this end, the follo wing program is established. With such funds as are appropriated for this purpose, the Board shall award to the several school divisions grants for expanded access to educational technology. Fundin g for educational technology training for instructional personnel shall be provided as set forth in the appropriation act. Funds for improving the quality and capacity of educational technology shall also be provided as set forth in the appropriation act, including (i) funds for providing a technology resource assistant to serve every elementary school in this Commonwealth and (ii) funds to maintain the currency of career and technical education programs. Any local school board accepting funds to hire technology resource assistants or main tain currency of career and technical education programs shall commit to providing the required matching funds, based on the composite index of local ability to pay. Each qualifying school board shall establish an individualized technology plan, which shall be approved by the Superintendent, for integrating technology into the class room and into schoolwide instructional programs, including career and technical education programs. The first priority for funding shall be consistent with those components of the Boards revised six-year technology plan that focus on (i) retrofitting and upgrading existing school buildings to efficiently use educational technology; (ii) providing (a) one network-ready multimedia microcomputer for each classroom, (b) a five-to-one ratio of pupils to network-ready microcomputers, (c) graphing calculat ors and relevant scientific probes/sensors as required by the Standards of Learning, and (d) training and professional development on available technologies and software to all levels and positions, including professional development for personnel delive ring career and technical education at all levels and positions; and (iii) assisting school divisions in developing integrated voice-, video-, and data-connectivity to local, national and international resources. This funding may be used to implement a local school divisions long-range technology plan, at the discretion of the relevant school board, if the local plan meets o r exceeds the goals and standards of the Boards revised six-year technology plan and has been approved by the Superintendent. The Department of Education, the Department of General Services, and the Virginia Information Technologies Agency shall coordinate master contracts for the purchase by local school boards of the aforementioned educational technologies and reference materials. A technology replacement program shall be, with such funds as may be appropriated for this purpose, implemented to replace obsolete educational hardware and software. A s provided in subsection D of § 22.1-129, school boards may donate obsolete educational technology hardware and software that are being replaced. Any such donations shall be offered to other school divisions and to preschool programs in the Commonweal th or to public school students as provided in guidelines to be promulgated by the Board. Such guidelines shall include criteria for determining student eligibility and need, a reporting system for the compilation of information concerning the number and socioeconomic characteristics of recipient students, and notification of parents of the availability of such donations of obsolete educational hardware and software. C. The General Assembly finds that local autonomy in making decisions on local educational needs and priorities results in effective grassroots efforts to improve education in the Commonwealths public schools only when coupled with sufficient state funding; to thi s end, the following block grant program is hereby established. With such funds as are provided in the appropriation act, the Department shall distribute block grants to localities to enable compliance with the Commonwealths requirements for school d ivisions in effect on January 1, 1995. Therefore, for the purpose of such compliance, the block grant herein established shall consist of a sum equal to the amount appropriated in the appropriation act for the covered programs, including the at-risk add- on program; dropout prevention, specifically Project YES; Project Discovery; English as a second language programs, including programs for overage, nonschooled students; Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID); the Homework Assistance Program; pr ograms initiated under the Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program, except that such funds shall not be used to pay any expenses of participating students at institutions of higher education; and school/community health centers. Each school board may use any funds received through the block grant to implement the covered programs and other programs designed to save the Commonwealths children from educational failure. D. In order to reduce pupil/teacher ratios and class sizes in elementary schools, from such funds as may be appropriated for this purpose, each school board may ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_22.1-200"><akn:num>§ 22.1-200</akn:num><akn:heading>Subjects taught in elementary grades</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

The Board o f Education shall establish for the public school system a standardized program of driver education in the safe operation of motor vehicles. Such program shall consist of classroom training and behind-the-wheel driver training. However, any student who p articipates in such a program of driver education shall meet the academic requirements established by the Board, and no student in a course shall be permitted to operate a motor vehicle without a license or other document issued by the Department of Moto r Vehicles under Chapter 3 (§ 46.2-300 et seq.) of Title 46.2, or the comparable law of another jurisdiction, authorizing the operation of a motor vehicle upon the highways. 1. The d river education program shall include (i) instruction concerning (a) alcohol and drug abuse; (b) aggressive driving; (c) the dangers of distracted driving and speeding; (d) motorcycle awareness; (e) organ and tissue donor awareness; (f) fuel-efficient dr iving practices; and (g) traffic stops, including law-enforcement procedures for traffic stops, appropriate actions to be taken by drivers during traffic stops, and appropriate interactions with law-enforcement officers who initiate traffic stops, and (i i) an additional minimum 90-minute parent/student driver education component as part of the classroom portion of the driver education curriculum. However, no student who is (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) an emancipated minor, or (3) an unaccompanied m inor who is not in the physical custody of his parent or guardian shall be required to participate in the parent/student driver education component. 2. The parent/student driver education component shall be administered as part of the classroom portion of the driver education curriculum. In Planning District 8, the parent/student driv er education component shall be administered in-person. Outside Planning District 8, the parent/student driver education component may be administered either in-person or online by a public school or a driver training school that is licensed as a compute r-based driver education provider. The participation of the students parent or guardian in the parent/student driver education component shall be required in Planning District 8 unless the student is otherwise exempted from participation in the paren t/student driver education component pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 1. Outside Planning District 8, the participation of the students parent or guardian in the parent/student driver education component shall be encouraged, but shall not be required. The program shall emphasize (i) parental responsibilities regarding juvenile driver behavior, (ii) juvenile driving restrictions pursuant to this Code, (iii) the dangers of driving while intoxicated and underage consumption of alcohol, and (iv ) the dangers of distracted driving. Such instruction shall be developed by the Department in cooperation with the Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program, the Department of Health, and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, as ap propriate. Nothing in this subdivision precludes any school division from including a program of parental involvement as part of a driver education program in addition to the minimum 90-minute parent/student driver education component. 3. Any driver education program shall require a minimum number of miles driven during the behind-the-wheel driver training. B. The Board s hall assist school divisions by preparation, publication and distribution of competent driver education instructional materials to ensure a more complete understanding of the responsibilities and duties of motor vehicle operators. C. Each school board shall determine whether to offer the program of driver education in the safe operation of motor vehicles and, if offered, whether such program shall be an elective or a required course. In addition to the fee approved by the Board of Education pur suant to the appropriation act that allows local school boards to charge a per pupil fee for behind-the-wheel driver education, the Board of Education may authorize a local school boards request to assess a surcharge in order to further recover progr am costs that exceed state funds distributed through basic aid to school divisions offering driver education programs. Each school board may waive the fee or the surcharge in total or in part for those students it determines cannot pay the fee or surchar ge. Only school divisions complying with the standardized program and regulations established by the Board of Education and the provisions of § 46.2-335 shall be entitled to participate in the distribution of state funds appropriated for driver educat ion. Each school board shall make the 90-minute parent/student driver education component available to all students and their parents or guardians who are in compliance with § 22.1-254. D. The actual initial driving instruction shall be conducted, with motor vehicles equipped as may be required by regulation of the Board of Education, on private or public property removed from public highways if practicable; if impracticable, then, at the request of the school board, the Commissioner of Highways shall designate a suitable section of road near the school to be used for such instruction. Such section of road shall be marked with signs, which the Commissioner of Highways shall supply, giving notice of its use for driving instruction. Such signs shall be removed at the close of the instruction period. No vehicle other than those used for driver training shall be operated between such signs at a speed in excess of 25 miles per hour. Violation of this li mit shall be a Class 4 misdemeanor. E. The Board o f Education may, in its discretion, promulgate regulations for the use and certification of paraprofessionals as teaching assistants in the driver education programs of school divisions. F. The Board o f Education shall approve correspondence courses for the classroom training component of driver education. These correspondence courses shall be consistent in quality with instructional programs developed by the Board for classroom training in the public schools. Students completing the correspondence courses for classroom training, who are eligible to take behind-the-wheel driver training, may receive behind-the-wheel driver training (i) from a public school, upon payment of the required fee, if the sc hool division offers behind-the-wheel driver training and space is available, (ii) from a driver training school licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles, or (iii) in the case of a home schooling parent or guardian instructing his own child who meets the requirements for home school instruction under § 22.1-254.1 or subdivision B 1 of § 22.1-254, from a behind-the-wheel training course approved by the Board.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Discrimination.  Because the power to protect students and employees from discrimination in the public school system is a power fairly implied from the express grant of authority to school boards under Article VIII, § 7 of the Constitution of Virginia and from the specific authority granted to boards by the General Assembly in §§ 22.1-28, 22.1-78 and 22.1-253.13:7, the Dillon Rule does not prevent school boards from amen ding their antidiscrimination policies to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.

CASE NOTES Proper standard to be employed by the circuit court is to determine, based on a preponde rance of the evidence, whether the substance of the proposed individualized educational program is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits; however, due weight must be given by the trial court to the administrative proce edings.

Definition of parent. Text A. Parent,  for purposes of this article and regulations promulgated thereto, means: 1. A bio logical or adoptive parent of a child; 2. A foster parent, even if the biological or adoptive parents rights have not been terminated, but subject to subsection B; 3. A guardian generally authorized to act as the childs parent, or authorized to make educational decisions for the child (but not the Commonwealth if the child is a ward of the Commo nwealth); 4.

The Board o f Education shall prepare and supervise the implementation by each school division of a program of special education designed to educate and train children with disabilities between the ages defined in § 22.1-213 and may prepare and place in operation such program for such individuals of other ages. The program developed by the Board of Education shall be designed to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free and appropriate education, including specially designed instru ction to meet the unique needs of such children. The program shall require (i) that the hearing of each disabled child be tested prior to placement in a special education program and (ii) that a complete audiological assessment, including tests that will assess inner and middle ear functioning, be performed on each child who is deaf or hard of hearing or who fails the test required in clause (i). The school boards of the several school divisions, the Department for the Blind and Vision Impaired, the Dep artment for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing, the Department of Health, and other state and local agencies that can or may be able to assist in providing educational and related services shall assist and cooperate with the Board of Education in the developme nt of such program. B. The Board o f Education shall prescribe procedures to afford due process to children with disabilities and their parents or guardians and to school divisions in resolving disputes as to program placements, individualized education programs, tuition eligibility and o ther matters as defined in state or federal statutes or regulations. These procedures shall encourage the use of mediation as an informal means of resolving such disputes. Mediation shall not, however, be used to deny or delay the due process rights of p arents or guardians. The procedures shall require that all testimony be given under oath or affirmation administered by the hearing officer. C. The Board o f Education may provide for final decisions to be made by a hearing officer. The parents and the school division shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel or other representative before such hearing officer without being in violation of the provisions of § 54.1-3904. D. Any party a ggrieved by the findings and decision made pursuant to the procedures prescribed pursuant to subsections B and C may, within 180 days of such findings and decision, bring a civil action in the circuit court for the jurisdiction in which the school divisi on is located. In any such action, the court shall receive the records of the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as t he court determines appropriate. D1. In any act ion brought pursuant to subsection D, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorney fees as part of the costs (i) to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability; (ii) to a prevailing party who is the Board of Education or a local school division against the attorney of a parent who files a complaint or a subsequent cause of action that is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, or against the attorney of a parent who continued to litigate after the litigation clearly became frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation; or (iii) to a prevailing party who is the Board of Education or a local school division against the attorney of a parent, or against the parent, if the parents complaint or subsequent cau se of action was presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to needlessly increase the cause of litigation.Attorney fees may not be awarded relating to any meeting of the individualized education program (IEP) t eam unless such meeting is convened as a result of an administrative proceeding or judicial action, or, at the discretion of the State, for a mediation described in subsection B. E. Whenever th e Board of Education, in its discretion, determines that a school division fails to establish and maintain programs of free and appropriate public education that comply with regulations established by the Board, the Board may withhold all special educati on moneys from the school division and may use the payments that would have been available to such school division to provide special education, directly or by contract, to eligible children with disabilities in such manner as the Board considers appropr iate. F. The Board o f Education shall supervise educational programs for children with disabilities by other public agencies and shall ensure that the identification, evaluation, and placement of children with disabilities and youth in education programs by other public age ncies, as appropriate, are consistent with the provisions of the Board of Educations special education regulations. G. The Board o f Education shall prescribe regulations to provide a range of assessment procedures for the evaluation of children with disabilities. These regulations shall include provision for parents to participate, if they so request, in the consideration of the as sessment components to be used. However, such regulations shall not require any local school board to exceed the requirements of federal law or regulations for the identification and evaluation of children with disabilities.

Determination of n eed for residential placement.  Analysis of the issue of residential placement must focus on whether full-time placement may be considered necessary for educational purposes, or whether the resi dential placement is a response to medical, social or emotional problems that are segregable from the learning process. The relevant inquiry is whether a residential placement is a necessary ingredient for learning. Martin v. School Bd., 3 Va. App. 197, 348 S.E.2d 857, 3 Va. Law Rep. 772, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 352 (1986). Residential placement not required where progress made in special education classes.  Where the childs disability manifested itself in emotional outbursts and occasional acts of violence at school and at home, his emotional disability intruded on the learning process and frustrated the instructional efforts outlined in various individualized education programs, making it possible to conclude that a residential placement would provide greater educational benefit than he received in the special education classes, but he made significant progress in the special education classes, and the court could not conclude from the record that this case presented a situation in which a residential setting was the only educational placement reasonably c alculated to enable (the child) to receive educational benefits, residential placement was not required.

Instructional programs supporting the Standards of Learning a nd other educational objectives. Text A. The General Assembly and the Board of Education believe that the fundamental goal of the public schools of the Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that are necessary for success in school, preparation for life, and reaching their full potential. The General Assembly and the Board of Education find that the quality of education is dependent upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to ensure the availability of high-quality instruct ional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning environment designed to promote student achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and the United States of America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the General Assembly shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII, § 1 of the Constitution of Virginia. B. The Board o f Education shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall form the core of Virginias educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to ensure the development of the skills t hat are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in § 2.2-4001. The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include , but not be limited to, the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and critical reasoning, including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of computers and related technology; compute r science and computational thinking, including computer coding; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make sound financial decisions. The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade three shall be based on components of effective reading instruction, to include, at a minimu m, phonemic awareness, systematic phonics, fluency, vocabulary development, and text comprehension. The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning. The Board of Education shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a more frequent basis. To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board of Education shall conduct public hearings prior to e stablishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other persons requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning. In addition, the Department of Education shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through an existing website utilized by the Department of Edu cation, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school educators to submit recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review by the Board according to its established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to this chapter. Such website shall facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators. School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school divisions that are equivalent to or exceed the Boards r equirements. Students shall be expected to achieve the educational objectives established by the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the Standards of Learning. The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of contributions to society of diverse people. For the purpos es of this subsection, diverse includes consideration of disability, ethnicity, race, and gender. The Board of Education shall include in the Standards of Learning for health instruction in emergency first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of an automa ted external defibrillator, including hands-on practice of the skills necessary to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Such instruction shall be based on the current national evidence-based emergency cardiovascular care guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an automated external defibrillator, such as a program developed by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross. No teacher who is in compliance with subdivision D 3 of § 22.1-298.1 shall be required to be cer tified as a trainer of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to provide instruction for non-certification. With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the competencies for career and technical education programs to requ ire the full integration of English, mathematics, science, and history and social science Standards of Learning. Career and technical education programs shall be aligned with industry and professional standard certifications, where they exist. The Board shall establish content standards and curriculum guidelines for courses in career investigation in elementary school, middle school, and high school. Each sch ool board shall (i) require each middle school student to take at least one course in career investigation or (ii) select an alternate means of delivering the career investigation course to each middle school student, provided that such alternative is eq uivalent in content and rigor and provides the foundation for such students to develop their academic and career plans. Any school board may require (a) such courses in career investigation at the high school level as it deems appropriate, subject to Boa rd approval as required in subsection A of § 22.1-253.13:4, and (b) such courses in career investigation at the elementary school level as it deems appropriate. The Board shall develop and disseminate to each school board career investigation resource materials that are designed to ensure that students have the ability to further explore interest in career and technical education opportunities in middle and high school. In developing such resource materials, the Board shall consult with representativ es of career and technical education, industry, skilled trade associations, chambers of commerce or similar organizations, and contractor organizations.

As used in this subsection, attend includes participation in educational programs and courses at a site remote from the school with the permission of the school and in conformity with applicable requirements. Except as otherwise provided in this article, every parent, guardian, or other person in the Commonwealth having control or charge of any child who will have reached th e fifth birthday on or before September 30 of any school year and who has not passed the eighteenth birthday shall, during the period of each year the public schools are in session and for the same number of days and hours per day as the public schools, cause such child to attend a public school or a private, denominational, or parochial school or have such child taught by a tutor or teacher of qualifications prescribed by the Board and approved by the division superintendent, or provide for home instru ction of such child as described in § 22.1-254.1. As prescribed in the regulations of the Board, the requirements of this section may also be satisfied by causing a child to attend an alternative program of study or wo rk/study offered by a public, private, denominational, or parochial school or by a public or private degree-granting institution of higher education. Further, in the case of any five-year-old child who is subject to the provisions of this subsection, the requirements of this section may be alternatively satisfied by causing the child to attend any public educational pre-kindergarten program, including a Head Start program, or in a private, denominational, or parochial educational pre-kindergarten progra m. Instruction in the home of a child or children by the parent, guardian, or other person having control or charge of such child or children shall not be classified or de fined as a private, denominational or parochial school. The requirements of this section shall apply to (i) any child in the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice or the Department of Corrections who has not passed h is eighteenth birthday and (ii) any child whom the division superintendent has required to take a special program of prevention, intervention, or remediation as provided in subsection C of § 22.1-253.13:1 and in § 22.1-254.01. The requirements of t his section shall not apply to (a) any person 16 through 18 years of age who is housed in an adult correctional facility when such person is actively pursuing the achievement of a passing score on a high school equivalency examination approved by the Boa rd but is not enrolled in an individual student alternative education plan pursuant to subsection E, and (b) any child who has obtained a high school diploma or its equivalent, a certificate of completion, or has achieved a passing score on a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board, or who has otherwise complied with compulsory school attendance requirements as set forth in this article. B. A school bo ard shall excuse from attendance at school: 1. Any p upil who, together with his parents, by reason of bona fide religious training or belief is conscientiously opposed to attendance at school. For purposes of this subdivision, bona fide religious training or belief does not include essentially pol itical, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code; and 2. On the recommendation of the juvenile and domestic relations district court of the county or city in which the pupil resides and for such period of time as the court deems appropriate, any pupil who, together with his parents, is opposed to attendance at a school by reason of concern for such pupils health, as verified by competent medical evidence, or by reason of such pupils reasonable apprehension for personal safety when s uch concern or apprehension in that pupils specific case is determined by the court, upon consideration of the recommendation of the principal and division superintendent, to be justified. C. Each local school board shall develop policies for excusing students who are absent by reason of observance of a religious holiday. Such policies shall ensure that a student shall not be deprived of any award or of eligibility or opportunity to compete for any awar d, or of the right to take an alternate test or examination, for any which he missed by reason of such absence, if the absence is verified in a manner acceptable to the school board. D. A school bo ard may excuse from attendance at school: 1. On re commendation of the principal and the division superintendent and with the written consent of the parent or guardian, any pupil who the school board determines, in accordance with regulations of the Board, cannot benefit from education at such school; or 2.

E. Local schoo l boards may allow the requirements of subsection A to be met under the following conditions: For a student who is at least 16 years of age, there shall be a meeting of the student, the students parents, and the principal or his designee of the school in whi ch the student is enrolled in which an individual student alternative education plan shall be developed in conformity with guidelines prescribed by the Board, which plan must include: 1. Career guidance counseling; 2. Mandatory enrollment and attendance in a preparatory program for passing a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board or other alternative education program approve d by the local school board with attendance requirements that provide for reporting of student attendance by the chief administrator of such preparatory program or approved alternative education program to such principal or his designee; 3.

Successful completion of the course in economics and personal finance required to earn a Board-approved high school diploma; 5. Counseling on the economic impact of failing to complete high school; and 6. Procedures for reenrollment to comply with the requirements of subsection A. A student for whom an individual student alternative education plan has been granted pursuant to this subsection and who fails to comply with the conditions of such pla n shall be in violation of the compulsory school attendance law, and the division superintendent or attendance officer of the school division in which such student was last enrolled shall seek immediate compliance with the compulsory school attendance la w as set forth in this article. Students enrolled with an individual student alternative education plan shall be counted in the average daily membership of the school division. F. A school bo ard may, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 3 (§ 22.1-276.01 et seq.) of Chapter 14 and upon a finding that a school-age child has been (i) charged with an offense relating to the Commonwealths laws, or with a violation of scho ol board policies, on weapons, alcohol or drugs, or intentional injury to another person; (ii) found guilty or not innocent of a crime that resulted in or could have resulted in injury to others, or of an offense that is required to be disclosed to the s uperintendent of the school division pursuant to subsection G of § 16.1-260; (iii) suspended pursuant to § 22.1-277.05; or (iv) expelled from school attendance pursuant to § 22.1-277.06 or 22.1-277.07 or subsection C of § 22.1-277, require th e child to attend an alternative education program as provided in § 22.1-209.1:2 or 22.1-277.2:1. G. Whenever a court orders any pupil into an alternative education program, including a program preparing students for a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board, offered in the public schools, the local school board of the school division in which th e program is offered shall determine the appropriate alternative education placement of the pupil, regardless of whether the pupil attends the public schools it supervises or resides within its school division. The juvenile and domestic relations district court of the county or city in which a pupil resides or in which charges are pending against a pupil, or any court in which charges are pending against a pupil, may require the pupil who has been charged with (i) a crime that resulted in or could have resulted in injury to others, (ii) a violation of Article 1 (§ 18.2-77 et seq.) of Chapter 5 of Title 18.2, or (iii) any o ffense related to possession or distribution of any Schedule I, II, or III controlled substances to attend an alternative education program, including, but not limited to, night school, adult education, or any other education program designed to offer in struction to students for whom the regular program of instruction may be inappropriate.

Where no at tendance officer is appointed by the school board, the division superintendent or his designee shall act as attendance officer. Whenever any pupil fails to report to school on a regularly scheduled school day and no indication has been received by school personnel that the pupils parent is a ware of and supports the pupils absence, a reasonable effort to notify by telephone the parent to obtain an explanation for the pupils absence shall be made by either the school principal or his designee, the attendance officer, other school pers onnel, or volunteers organized by the school administration for this purpose. Any such volunteers shall not be liable for any civil damages for any acts or omissions resulting from making such reasonable efforts to notify parents and obtain such explanat ion when such acts or omissions are taken in good faith, unless such acts or omissions were the result of gross negligence or willful misconduct. This subsection shall not be construed to limit, withdraw, or overturn any defense or immunity already exist ing in statutory or common law or to affect any claim occurring prior to the effective date of this law. School divisions are encouraged to use noninstructional personnel for this notice. Whenever any pupil fails to report to school for a total of five scheduled school days for the school year and no indication has been received by school personnel that the pupils parent is aware of and supports the pupils absence, and a reasonable effort to notify the parent has failed, the school principal or his designee shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that direct contact is made with the parent in p erson, through telephone conversation, or through the use of other communications devices to obtain an explanation for the pupils absence and to explain to the parent the consequences of continued nonattendance. The school principal or his designee, the pupil, and the pupils parent shall jointly develop a plan to resolve the pupils nonattendance. Such plan shall include documentation of the reasons for the pupils nonattendance. If the pupil is absent for more than one additional day after direct contact with the pupils parent, and school personnel have received no indication that the pupil s parent is aware of and supports the pupils absence, the school principal or his designee shall schedule a conference with the pupil, his parent, and school personnel. Such conference may include the attendance officer and other community servic e providers to resolve issues related to the pupils nonattendance. The conference shall be held no later than 10 school days after the tenth absence of the pupil, regardless of whether his parent approves of the conference. The conference team shall monitor the pupils attendance and may meet again as necessary to address concerns and plan additional interventions if attendance does not improve. In circumstances in which the parent is intentionally noncompliant with compulsory attendance requirem ents or the pupil is resisting parental efforts to comply with compulsory attendance requirements, the principal or his designee shall make a referral to the attendance officer. The attendance officer shall schedule a conference with the pupil and his pa rent within 10 school days and may (i) file a complaint with the juvenile and domestic relations district court alleging the pupil is a child in need of supervision as defined in § 16.1-228 or (ii) institute proceedings against the parent pursuant to § 18.2-371 or 22.1-262. In filing a complaint against the student, the attendance officer shall provide written documentation of the efforts to comply with the provisions of this section. In the event that both parents have been awarded joint physical custody pursuant to § 20-124.2 and the school has received notice of such order, both parents shall be notified at the last known addresses of the parents.

The Board o f Education shall promulgate regulations for the voluntary participation of school divisions in programs to allow each school-age child to receive educational services at another public school, either in the division in which the child resides or in anot her division, as selected by the childs parent or guardian. Each public school in a school division participating in an alternative attendance program shall be eligible to participate in an alternative attendance program unless exceptional circumsta nces, as defined by the Board of Education, render the participation of the school contrary to public interest. B. The Board s regulations shall be promulgated under the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) and shall include, but shall not be limited to, provisions which address the following: the required acknowledgement by a local school of its decision to participate in an alternative attendance program, including school board resolutions for intradistrict programs and agreements between divisions participating in interdistrict programs; the equitable allocation of places to accommodate students when there are insufficient places to serve such students; transportation and school bus scheduling needs within the local school divisions; school enrollment capacity, class size, pupil-teacher ratios, and staffing levels for related instructi onal, administrative, and supervisory personnel as required by the Standards of Quality and the Standards for Accrediting Public Schools; the adequacy of school resources to accommodate an increase in student enrollment, grade level designations, and cou rse offerings; the enrollment of students whose education is subject to an individualized education plan (I.E.P.) as required under P.L. 94-142 as amended; the preservation of the uniqueness of schools established for particular educational purposes; the fiscal impact of accommodating parental preference on local school divisions; in the case of interdistrict attendance programs, the establishment of tuition charges authorized by § 22.1-5; and the need to maintain racial balance in the public schools . The regulations shall also establish the value of educational services, based on consideration of per pupil expenditures and state aid in the affected school. Any local school board which has been ordered by a state or federal court to achieve racial balance in its public schools shall maintain such racial balance when accommodating preference in the assignment of children to a school. C.

CASE NOTES Right to hearing.  Under due process considerations, failure on the part of school authorities to afford a hearing is not excused by later proof that the student is guilty of the of fense charged. Thus, the necessity of a prompt hearing is a constitutional prerequisite despite the fact that Virginias statutory law appears to allow suspensions to remain in effect for a period of up to 30 days pending decision by school board.

Ramsey, 121 F. Supp. 2d 911, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16986 (E.D. Va. 2000). Although the teacher argued that he did not injure student intentionally because the grabbing of the student by the teacher was accidental and done to maintain co ntrol, deference could not be accorded to the teachers version of events because substantial evidence in the form of bruises the student had on his body made it evident that the teachers touching of the student was not incidental, minor, or reaso nable, and was not within the permissible exceptions for corporal punishment.

Sup. Ct. R. 4:9 so that an expert cou ld use them in determining whether plaintiffs deficits were due to lead or other factors, such as the mothers education and intelligence. The records were not privileged under subsection A of § 22.1-287, and they were relevant and reasonably c alculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 4:1; however, non-medical records in the school records were to be kept under seal because of their sensitive nature and medical records in the school records excluded from p roduction because they did not contain information about the mothers intelligence or educational level.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Authority to deny access to a law-enforcement officer.  The provisions of § 22.1-287 may be reconciled with those of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The school superintendent possesses authori ty to rely upon FERPA provisions to deny access to a pupils records to a law-enforcement officer seeking information in the course of his duties.

Principals must have received training, provided pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:5, in the evaluation and documentation of employee performance, which evaluation and documentation shall include, but shall not be limited to, employee skills and knowledge and student academic progress, prior to submitting such recommendations. Assistant p rincipals and other supervisory personnel participating in the evaluation and documentation of employee performance must also have received such training in the evaluation and documentation of employee performance. D. A principal shall perform such other duties as may be assigned by the division superintendent pursuant to the rules and regulations of the school board. History History.

CASE NOTES Duties of high school principal and division superintendent compared.  When the duties of the division superintendent and the high school principal are compared, it is apparent that the principal is, for his school, essentially a cou nterpart of the superintendent. Although the fundamental authority of a high school principal is diminished and restricted, the function is very similar. Banks v. Sellers, 224 Va. 168, 294 S.E.2d 862, 1982 Va. LEXIS 279 (1982). A physical education teacher was immune from a negligence action for damages brought by a student who was injured while under the teachers supervision, because the governmental entity employing the teacher, the local school board, had official interest and direct involvement in the function of student instruction and supervision, and it exercised control and direction over the employee through the school principal. Lentz v. Morris, 236 Va. 78, 372 S.E.2d 608, 5 Va. Law Rep. 516, 1988 Va. LEXIS 103 (1988). Principa l not covered under local grievance procedure.  Even though subdivision 6 of § 22.1-79 provided a grievance procedure, that statute did not apply to the school principals suspension, as an exception to a pplication of that statute applied to him, and thus, he was not covered by it in a case where he sought a grievance hearing from his suspension as a high school principal. Tazewell County Sch. Bd. v. Brown, 267 Va. 150, 591 S.E.2d 671, 2004 Va. LEXIS 19 (2004). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Authority to make hiring decisions.  Subsection E of § 2.2-3119 can be harmonized with other statutes that require the school board to retain ultimate authority for hiring decisions. Subsection E of § 2.2-3119 does not require that the school board forfeit that authority; rather, it requires that the superintendent independently reaches a determination about the qualifications of an applicant who is married to or related to a school board memb er and to do so without any involvement of the school board in that hiring decision. Upon receiving the superintendents recommendation, the non-conflicted school board members then can vote on the applicant. The requirements of subsection E of § 2 .2-3119 are satisfied when a school board member recuses himself and certifies on the record that he had no involvement in the decision to hire his spouse or relative.

A person em ployed as a principal, assistant principal, or supervisor, including a person who has previously achieved continuing contract status as a teacher, shall serve a probationary term of three years in such position in the same school division before acquirin g continuing contract status as principal, assistant principal, or supervisor. With such funds as may be appropriated by the General Assembly for such purpose, school boards shall provide each probationary principal, except probationary principals who ha ve prior successful experience as principals, as determined by the local school board in a school division, a mentor, as described in guidelines developed by the Board, during the first year of the probationary period, to assist such probationary princip al in achieving excellence in administration. B. Each local school board shall adopt for use by the division superintendent clearly defined criteria for a performance evaluation process for principals, assistant principals, and supervisors that are consistent with the performance standards set forth in the Guidel ines for Uniform Performance Standards and Evaluation Criteria for Teachers, Principals, and Superintendents as provided in § 22.1-253.13:5 and that includes, among other things, an assessment of such administrators skills and knowledge; student a cademic progress and school gains in student learning; and effectiveness in addressing school safety and enforcing student discipline. The division superintendent shall implement such performance evaluation process in making employment recommendations to the school board pursuant to § 22.1-293. Principals and assistant principals who have achieved continuing contract status shall be formally evaluated at least once every three years and evaluated informally at least once each year that they are not f ormally evaluated. Probationary principals and assistant principals shall be evaluated each school year. The division superintendent shall consider such evaluations, among other things, in making recommendations to the school board regarding the nonrenew al of the probationary contract of any principal or assistant principal. C. Continuing contract status acquired by a principal, assistant principal, or supervisor shall not be construed (i) as prohibiting a school board from reassigning such principal, assistant principal, or supervisor to a teaching position if notice of reassignment is g iven by the school board by June 15 of any year or (ii) as entitling any such principal, assistant principal, or supervisor to the salary paid him as principal, assistant principal, or supervisor in the case of any such reassignment to a teaching positio n. D. No such sal ary reduction and reassignment, however, shall be made without first providing such principal, assistant principal, or supervisor with written notice of the reason for such reduction and reassignment and an opportunity to present his or her position at a n informal meeting with the division superintendent, the division superintendents designee, or the school board. Before recommending such reassignment, the division superintendent shall consider, among other things, the performance evaluations for su ch principal, assistant principal, or supervisor. The principal, assistant principal, or supervisor shall elect whether such meeting shall be with the division superintendent, the division superintendents designee, or the school board. The school boa rd, division superintendent, or the division superintendents designee shall determine what processes are to be followed at the meeting. The decision to reassign and reduce salary shall be at the sole discretion of the school board.The intent of this section is to provide an opportunity for a principal, assistant principal, or supervisor to discuss the reasons for such salary reduction and reassignment with the division superintendent, his designee, or the school board, and the provisions of this sec tion are meant to be procedural only. Nothing contained herein shall be taken to require cause, as defined in § 22.1-307, for the salary reduction and reassignment of a principal, assistant principal, or supervisor. E. As used in this section, supervisor means a person who holds an instructional supervisory position as specified in the regulations of the Board of Education and who is required to hold a license as prescribed by the Board of Education.

CASE NOTES This section deals exclusively with principals, assistant principals, and supervisors, w hile § 22.1-303 deals exclusively with teachers. Lee-Warren v. School Bd., 241 Va. 442, 403 S.E.2d 691, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2276, 1991 Va. LEXIS 61 (1991). No provision of this section permits transfer of continuing status.  The requirement for three years service in the same school division expressly limits the continuing contract rights of principals. Lee-Warren v. Schoo l Bd., 241 Va. 442, 403 S.E.2d 691, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2276, 1991 Va. LEXIS 61 (1991). A school principal with continuing contract status as a teacher did not retain that status upon accepting a job as principal in another school division within Vir ginia; therefore, principal had no protectable property interest and her termination neither violated her constitutional right to due process nor breached her employment contract. Lee-Warren v. School Bd., 792 F. Supp. 472, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20357 (W .D. Va. 1991). Good cause need not be sho wn for reassignment.  Continuing contract status for principals, as statutorily defined, does not encompass a requirement that good cause be shown for reassignment. Wooten v. C lifton Forge Sch. Bd., 655 F.2d 552, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 11181 (4th Cir. 1981). No deprivation shown.  In a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 case in which three public school administrators had obtained continuing contract status by virtue of Virginia law, they unsuccessfully asserted that a county school board, members of the board, and a superintendent violated the Fourteenth Amendment by depriving them of their constitutionally protected right to a continuing contract. Since the contract dispute began, they had worked in their positions and they had been paid; they had not suffered a deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest because their right was to continued employment itself, not a particular job or job title. Hibbitts v. Buchanan County Sch. Bd., 685 F. S upp. 2d 599, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15949 (W.D. Va. 2010). Where a school employee was demoted and the employees employment contract was not renewed after the employee sought to marry a subordinate, the employees procedural due process claim failed because, even assuming that the employee had a protected property interest in continued employment, the first amended complaint was devoid of any allegations of procedural deficiencies related to the employees term ination.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Not a supervisor under the statute.  Teacher failed to state a claim under § 22.1-294 as: (1) under § 22.1-1, the terms Board, State Board, and Board of Education were i nterchangeable, so a requirement for licensure had to flow from the Virginia State Board of Education; (2) the Virginia State Board of Education did not require a license for an Instructional Technology Specialist position; (3) a county board of educatio ns vacancy announcement did not require a license; (4) a teacher was not a supervisor under § 22.1-294; and (5) the continuing contract provisions of § 22.1-294 did not apply to the teacher.

Such policies shall include, but need not be limited to, incentives for excellence in teaching, including financial support for teachers attending professional development seminars or those seeking and obtaining national certification. C. School boar ds shall develop a procedure for use by division superintendents and principals in evaluating teachers that is appropriate to the tasks performed and addresses, among other things, student academic progress and the skills and knowledge of instructional p ersonnel, including, but not limited to, instructional methodology, classroom management, and subject matter knowledge.Teachers employed by local school boards who have achieved continuing contract status shall be formally evaluated at least once every t hree years and more often as deemed necessary by the principal, and they shall be evaluated informally during each year in which they are not formally evaluated. Any teacher who has achieved continuing contract status who receives an unsatisfactory forma l evaluation and who continues to be employed by the local school board shall be formally evaluated in the following year.

For annual survey article, Education Law, see 48 U. Rich. L. Rev. 103 (2013). CASE NOTES Employment of particular teacher is discretionary.  Teachers holding certificates qualifying them to teach in the public schools are not entitled by reason of that fact alone to contracts to teach in the public sch ools of the State; for whether any particular one of them shall be employed to teach is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the school authorities.

Role of superintendent.  This section appears to contemplate for the superintendent a role in the screening of all applicants to ensure that everyone considered by the school board posses ses suitable qualifications and moral character. The superintendent has no power to hire or fire. As § 22.1-313 makes clear, the school board shall retain its exclusive final authority over matters concerning employment and supervision of its personne l, including dismissals, suspensions and placing on probation.

See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable G. Glenn Oder and The Honorable Marty G. Eubank, Treasurer, City of Newport News, 11-003, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 14 (2/25/1 1). § 22.1-296.1. Data on convictions for certain crimes and child abuse and neglect required; penalty. Text A. As a condit ion of employment for all of its public school employees, whether full-time or part-time, permanent, or temporary, every school board shall require on its application for employment certification of whether the applicant has been convicted of any violent felony set forth in the definition of barrier crime in subsection A of § 19.2-392.02; any offense involving the sexual molestation, physical or sexual abuse, or rape of a child; or any crime of moral turpitude. Any individual making a materially fals e statement regarding any such offense is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor and, in the case of a teacher, upon conviction, the fact of such conviction is grounds for the Board to revoke his license to teach. B. No school b oard shall employ any individual who has been convicted of any violent felony set forth in the definition of barrier crime in subsection A of § 19.2-392.02 or any offense involving the sexual molestation, physical or sexual abuse, or rape of a child. C. Any school board may employ any individual who has been convicted of any felony or crime of moral turpitude that is not set forth in the definition of barrier crime in subsection A of § 19.2-392.02 and does not involve the sexual molestation, physical or sexual abuse, or rape of a child, provided that in the case of a felony conviction, such individual has had his civil rights restored by the Governor. D. Every schoo l board shall also require on its application for employment, as a condition of employment requiring direct contact with students, whether full-time or part-time, permanent, or temporary, certification that the applicant has not been the subject of a fou nded case of child abuse and neglect. Any person making a materially false statement regarding a finding of child abuse and neglect is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor and upon conviction, the fact of said conviction is grounds for the Board of Education to revoke such persons license to teach. E. As a condit ion of awarding a contract for the provision of services that require the contractor or his employees to have direct contact with students on school property during regular school hours or during school-sponsored activities, the school board shall requir e the contractor to provide certification of whether any individual who will provide such services has been convicted of any violent felony set forth in the definition of barrier crime in subsection A of § 19.2-392.02; any offense involving the sexual molestation, physical or sexual abuse, or rape of a child; or any crime of moral turpitude.Any individual making a materially false statement regarding any such offense is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor and, upon conviction, the fact of such conviction is grounds for the revocation of the contract to provide such services and, when relevant, the revocation of any license required to provide such services. School boards shall not be liable for materially false statements regarding the certifications re quired by this subsection.This subsection shall not apply to a contractor or his employees providing services to a school division in an emergency or exceptional situation, such as when student health or safety is endangered or when repairs are needed on an urgent basis to ensure that school facilities are safe and habitable, when it is reasonably anticipated that the contractor or his employees will have no direct contact with students. F.

(For Expiration Date, see Acts 2022, cc. 549, 550, cl. 2) Regulations governing licensure. Text A. As used in this section: Alternate route to licensure means a nontraditional route to teacher licensure availab le to individuals who meet the criteria specified in the guidelines developed pursuant to subsection N or regulations issued by the Board of Education. Industry certification credential means an active career and technical education crede ntial that is earned by successfully completing a Board of Education-approved industry certification examination, being issued a professional license in the Commonwealth, or successfully completing an occupational competency examination. Licensure by reciprocity means a process used to issue a license to an individual comi ng into the Commonwealth from another state when that individual meets certain conditions specified in the Board of Educations regulations. Professional teachers assessment means those tests mandated for licensure as presc ribed by the Board of Education. Provisional license means a nonrenewable license issued by the Board of Education for a specified period of time, not to exceed three years, to an individual who may be employed by a school division in the Commonwealth and who generally meets the requirements specified in the Board of Educations regulations for licensure, but who may need to take additional coursework, pass additional assessments, or meet alternative evaluation standards to be fully licensed with a renewable license. Renewable license means a license issued by the Board of Education for 10 years to an individual who meets the requirements specified in the Board of Educations regulations. B. The Board o f Education shall prescribe, by regulation, the requirements for the licensure of teachers and other school personnel required to hold a license. Such regulations shall include procedures for (i) the denial, suspension, cancellation, revocation, and rein statement of licensure; (ii) written reprimand of license holders on grounds established by the Board, in accordance with law, notice of which shall be made by the Superintendent of Public Instruction to division superintendents or their designated repre sentatives; and (iii) the immediate and thorough investigation by the division superintendent or his designee of any complaint alleging that a license holder has engaged in conduct that may form the basis for the revocation of his license. At a minimum, such procedures for investigations contained in such regulations shall require (a) the division superintendent to petition for the revocation of the license upon completing such investigation and finding that there is reasonable cause to believe that the license holder has engaged in conduct that forms the basis for revocation of a license; (b) the school board to proceed to a hearing on such petition for revocation within 90 days of the mailing of a copy of the petition to the license holder, unless th e license holder requests the cancellation of his license in accordance with Board regulations; and (c) the school board to provide a copy of the investigative file and such petition for revocation to the Superintendent of Public Instruction at the time that the hearing is scheduled. The Board of Education shall revoke the license of any person for whom it has received a notice of dismissal or resignation pursuant to subsection F of § 22.1-313 and, in the case of a person who is the subject of a foun ded complaint of child abuse or neglect, after all rights to any administrative appeal provided by § 63.2-1526 have been exhausted. Regardless of the authority of any other agency of the Commonwealth to approve educational programs, only the Board of Education shall have the authority to license teachers to be regularly employed by school boards, including those teachers employed to provide nursing education. The Board of Education shall prescribe by regulation the licensure requirements for teachers who teach only online courses, as defined in § 22.1-212.23. Such license shall be valid only for teaching online courses. Teachers who hold a 10-year renewable license issued by the Board of Education may teach online courses for which they are properly endorsed. C. The Board o f Educations regulations shall include requirements that a person seeking initial licensure: 1. Demon strate proficiency in the relevant content area, communication, literacy, and other core skills for educators by achieving a qualifying score on professional assessments or meeting alternative evaluation standards as prescribed by the Board; 2.

Every person seeking initial licensure and persons seeking licensure renewal as teachers who have not completed such study shall complete study in child abuse recognition and intervention in accordance with curriculum guidelines developed by the Board of Educ ation in consultation with the Department of Social Services that are relevant to the specific teacher licensure routes; 2. Every person seeking renewal of a license shall complete all renewal requirements, including professional development in a manner prescribed by the Board, except that no person seeking renewal of a license shall be required to satisfy any such requirement by completing coursework and earning credit at an institution of higher education; 3. Every person seeking initial licensure or renewal of a license shall provide evidence of completion of certification or training in emergency first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of automated external defibrillators. The certification or training program shall (i) be based on the current national evidence-based emergency cardiovascular care guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an automated exter nal defibrillator, such as a program developed by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross, and (ii) include hands-on practice of the skills necessary to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The Board shall provide a waiver for this req uirement for any person with a disability whose disability prohibits such person from completing the certification or training; 4. Every person seeking licensure with an endorsement as a teacher of the blind and visually impaired shall demonstrate proficiency in reading and writing Braille; 5. Every teacher seeking an initial license in the Commonwealth with an endorsement in the area of career and technical education shall have an industry certification credential in the ar ea in which the teacher seeks endorsement. If a teacher seeking an initial license in the Commonwealth has not attained an industry certification credential in the area in which the teacher seeks endorsement, the Board may, upon request of the employing school division or educational agency, issue the teacher a provisional license to allow time for the teacher to attain such credential; 6. Every person seeking initial licensure or renewal of a license shall complete awareness training, provided by the Department, on the indicators of dyslexia, as that term is defined by the Board pursuant to regulations, and the evidence-based interventions and accommodations for dyslexia; 7. Every person seeking initial licensure or renewal of a license with an endorsement as a school counselor shall complete training in the recognition of mental health disorder and behavi oral distress, including depression, trauma, violence, youth suicide, and substance abuse; 8.

E. No teacher who seeks a provisional license shall be required to meet any requirement set forth in subdivision D 1, 3, 6, or 8 as a condition of such licensure, but each such teacher shall complete each such requirement during the first year of provisional licensure .

The Board shall extend for at least one additional year, but for no more than two additional years, the three-year provisional license of a teacher employed in an accredited private el ementary or secondary school or a school for students with disabilities that is licensed pursuant to Chapter 16 (§ 22.1-319 et seq.) upon receiving from the school administrator of such school (i) a recommendation for such extension and (ii) satisfact ory performance evaluations for such teacher for each year of the original three-year provisional license. C. In accordan ce with regulations prescribed by the Board, a person not meeting the requirements for a license or provisional license may be employed and paid from public funds by a school board temporarily as a substitute teacher to meet an emergency.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Although § 22.1-299 prohibits a school board from regularly employing a teacher not licensed by the Board of Education, except as a substitute, that section do es not guarantee that every person licensed by the Board of Education is eligible to be hired as a teacher because, by its clear terms subsection A of § 22.1-296.1 applies not only to regular teachers, but all school board employees, whether full-time or part-time, permanent, or temporary; thus, § 22.1-299 does not constrain subsection A of § 22.1-296.1.Butler v.

A probation ary term of service of three years in the same school division shall be required before a teacher is issued a continuing contract. School boards shall provide each probationary teacher except probationary teachers who have prior successful teaching exper ience, as determined by the local school board in a school division, a mentor teacher, as described by Board guidelines developed pursuant to § 22.1-305.1, during the first year of the probationary period, to assist such probationary teacher in achiev ing excellence in instruction. During the probationary period, such probationary teacher shall be evaluated annually based upon the evaluation procedures developed by the employing school board for use by the division superintendent and principals in eva luating teachers as required by subsection C of § 22.1-295. A teacher in his first year of the probationary period shall be evaluated informally at least once during the first semester of the school year. The division superintendent shall consider suc h evaluations, among other things, in making any recommendations to the school board regarding the nonrenewal of such probationary teachers contract as provided in § 22.1-305. Any teacher hired on or after July 1, 2001, shall be required, as a condition of achieving continuing contract status, to have successfully completed training in instru ctional strategies and techniques for intervention for or remediation of students who fail or are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments. Local school divisions shall be required to provide said training at no cost to teachers employed in their division. In the event a local school division fails to offer said training in a timely manner, no teacher will be denied continuing contract status for failure to obtain such training. B. Once a cont inuing contract status has been attained in a school division in the Commonwealth, another probationary period need not be served in any other school division unless such probationary period, not to exceed two years, is made a part of the contract of emp loyment. Further, when a teacher has attained continuing contract status in a school division in the Commonwealth and separates from and returns to teaching service in a school division in Virginia by the beginning of the third year, such teacher shall b e required to serve a probationary period not to exceed two years, if made a part of the contract for employment. C. For the pur pose of calculating the years of service required to attain continuing contract status, at least 160 contractual teaching days during the school year shall be deemed the equivalent of one year in the first year of service by a teacher.

Except as provided in § 22.1-305 and except in the case of a reduction in force as provide d in subsection F, written notice of nonrenewal of the probationary contract must be given by the school board on or before June 15 of each year. If no such notice is given a teacher by June 15, the teacher shall be entitled to a contract for the ensuing year in accordance with local salary stipulations including increments. B. Teachers em ployed after completing the probationary period shall be entitled to continuing contracts during good behavior and competent service. Written notice of noncontinuation of the contract by either party must be given by June 15 of each year; otherwise the c ontract continues in effect for the ensuing year in conformity with local salary stipulations including increments. C. A teacher m ay resign after June 15 of any school year with the approval of the local school board or, upon authorization by the school board, with the approval of the division superintendent.

Before a di vision superintendent recommends to the school board nonrenewal of the contract of a teacher who has not achieved continuing contract status, the division superintendent shall consider, among other things, the performance evaluations for such teacher req uired by § 22.1-303 and shall notify the teacher of the proposed recommendation. Upon written request of the teacher within five working days after receipt of such notice, the division superintendent or his designee shall orally provide the specific r easons, if any, for such recommendation, along with supporting documentation, including such performance evaluations, to the teacher and, if requested by the teacher, to his or her representative. Within 10 days after receiving such reasons, the teacher may request, by notification in writing to the division superintendent, a conference before the division superintendent. Upon such request, the division superintendent shall set a date for the conference, which shall be within 30 days of the request, and shall give the teacher at least 15 days notice of the time and place of the conference. B. The confere nce shall be before the division superintendent or his designee. No such designee shall have recommended to the division superintendent the nonrenewal of the teachers contract. The teacher and the person or persons who recommended the nonrenewal of t he teachers contract to the division superintendent, or a representative of either or both, shall be allowed to participate in the conference, but no such representative shall be an attorney. C. If the conf erence is before a designee of the division superintendent, the designee shall communicate his recommendations to the division superintendent and to the teacher. D. The divisio n superintendent shall notify the teacher, in writing, of his intention with respect to the recommendation within 10 days after the conference. E. In any case in which a teacher requests reasons for the recommendation as provided in this section, written notice of nonrenewal of the contract by the school board must be given either within 10 days after the time for requesting a conference has expired and the t eacher has not made a timely request for a conference or, if a conference is requested, within 30 days after the division superintendent notifies the teacher of his intention with respect to the recommendation and the provisions of § 22.1-304 requirin g such notice on or before June 15 shall not be applicable. F. The confere nce shall be confidential and no written or oral communication of such conference shall be made to anyone other than the school board, in executive session, and employees of the school division having an interest therein; however, both the teacher and th e division superintendent, upon request, may provide the reasons for the nonrenewal to a potential employer of the teacher. G. The provisi ons of this section shall be inapplicable when a decrease in enrollment or the abolition of a particular subject or reduction in the number of classes offered in a particular subject causes a reduction in the number of teachers; however, a statement to t hat effect shall be placed in the personnel file of each teacher whose contract is nonrenewed for any such reason. H. The intent of this section is to provide an opportunity for a probationary teacher to discuss the reasons for nonrenewal with the division superintendent or his designee, and the provisions of this section are meant to be procedural only. Nothing contained herein s hall be taken to require cause, as defined in § 22.1-307, for the nonrenewal of the contract of a teacher who has not achieved continuing contract status nor shall the failure of the school board or the division superintendent to comply with any time requirement herein constitute a basis for continued employment of the teacher.

Dennis v. County School Bd., 582 F. Supp. 536, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19101 (W.D. Va. 1984). Violation of substantive due process rights of nontenured teacher.  If there is a charge by a nontenured teacher that some substantive due process right has been violated in his dismissal, a full exploration of the constitutional issue is required. United States v. Nansemond County Sch. Bd., 351 F. Supp. 196, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10961 (E.D. Va. 1972), rev'd, 492 F.2d 919, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10014 (4th Cir. 1974). Procedural due process requirements are inapplicable to teachers without tenure or some implied promise of continued employment. United States v. Nansemond County Sch. Bd., 351 F. Supp. 196, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10961 (E.D. Va. 1972), rev'd, 492 F.2d 919, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10014 (4th Cir. 1974). A showing of sufficient cause is not a prerequisite for dismissal of a teacher without t enure or some implied promise of continued employment, since the teacher has no property interest in the job itself. United States v. Nansemond County Sch. Bd., 351 F. Supp. 196, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10961 (E.D. Va. 1972), rev'd, 492 F.2d 919, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10014 (4th Cir. 1974). A probationary teacher may be estopped to assert that the school board failed to comply with the procedural requirements for nonrenewal of the teachers contract where the teachers actions prevented the board from complying with the statutory requirements. Thurston v. Roanoke City Sch. Bd., 26 F. Supp. 2d 882, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1 7821 (W.D. Va. 1998). Subsec tion H applicable only when conference requested.  By its explicit terms, subsection H is applicable only when a probationary teacher invokes the right to a conference spelled out in this section. This is evident by the use of the phrases [t]he intent of this section, the provisions of this section, [n]othing contained herein and any time requirement herein, in the language of subsection H. For these reasons, the above-quoted statu tory language, plainly applicable to this section, is not equally applicable to § 22.1-304.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Teacher can be denied renewa l for any reason.  Circuit court did not have the authority to exercise jurisdiction over a substitute teachers requests for declaratory relief because there was no statutory av enue for the teacher to challenge a nonrenewal of her contract; under the statute, the teacher could have been denied renewal of her contract for any reason, at any time, or for no reason at all.

The Board o f Education shall establish, from such funds as may be appropriated by the General Assembly, mentor teacher programs utilizing specially trained public school teachers as mentors to provide assistance and professional support to teachers entering the pro fession and to improve the performance of experienced teachers who are not performing at an acceptable level.The Board shall issue guidelines for such mentor teacher programs and shall set criteria for beginning and experienced teacher participation, inc luding self-referral, and the qualifications and training of mentor teachers. Such guidelines shall provide that the mentor programs be administered by local school boards, with the assistance of an advisory committee made up of teachers, principals, and supervisors, and that mentors (i) be classroom teachers who have achieved continuing contract status and who work in the same building as the teachers they are assisting or be instructional personnel who are assigned solely as mentors; (ii) be assigned a limited number of teachers at one time; however, instructional personnel who are not assigned solely as mentors should not be assigned to more than four teachers at one time; and (iii) guide teachers in the program through demonstrations, observations, and consultations to promote instructional excellence. Local school boards shall strive to provide adequate release time for mentor teachers during the contract day. B.

Whenever the last day for performing an act required by this article falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the act may be performed on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Dismissal means the dismissal of any teacher during the term of such teachers cont ract. Grievance means a complaint or dispute by a teacher relating to his employment, includ ing (i) disciplinary action including dismissal; (ii) the application or interpretation of (a) personnel policies, (b) procedures, (c) rules and regulations, (d) ordinances, and (e) statutes; (iii) acts of reprisal against a teacher for filing or process ing a grievance, participating as a witness in any step, meeting, or hearing relating to a grievance, or serving as a member of a fact-finding panel; and (iv) complaints of discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, political affiliatio n, disability, age, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or military status. Each school board shall have the exclusive right to manage the affairs and operations of the school division. Accordingly, the term grievance shall not include a complaint or dispute by a teacher relating to (a) establishment and revision of wages or salaries, position classifications, or general benefits; (b) suspension of a teac her or nonrenewal of the contract of a teacher who has not achieved continuing contract status; (c) the establishment or contents of ordinances, statutes, or personnel policies, procedures, rules, and regulations; (d) failure to promote; (e) discharge, l ayoff, or suspension from duties because of decrease in enrollment, decrease in enrollment or abolition of a particular subject, or insufficient funding; (f) hiring, transfer, assignment, and retention of teachers within the school division; (g) suspensi on from duties in emergencies; (h) the methods, means, and personnel by which the school divisions operations are to be carried on; or (i) coaching or extracurricular activity sponsorship. While these management rights are reserved to the school board, failure to apply, where applicable, the rules, regulations, policies, or procedures as written or establ ished by the school board is grievable. Military status means status as (i) a member of the uniformed forces, as defined in 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(5), of the United States or a reserve component thereof named under 10 U.S.C. § 10101, (ii) a veteran as defined in 38 U.S.C. § 101(2), or (iii) a dependent as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 3911(4) except that the support provided b y the service member to the individual shall have been provided 180 days immediately preceding an alleged action that if proven true would constitute unlawful discrimination under this section instead of 180 days immediately preceding an application for relief under 50 U.S.C. Chapter 50. Religion includes any outward expression of religious faith, including adherence to re ligious dressing and grooming practices and the carrying or display of religious items or symbols.

Where two public school teachers objected to their involuntary transfers from one school to another, and where the teachers alleged that the school board failed t o apply applicable rules, regulations, policies, and procedures as established by the school board, the trial court erred in ruling that the teachers assertions were grievable within the meaning of this section.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS School boards violation of own regulations grounds for grievance.  Because a local school board violated the boards own regulation by denying a teacher the right to use the grievance process to challenge the substance of the teachers performance evaluation by the principal, the teacher was able to grieve the boards actions under § 22.1-306, even though the substance of the appeal was expressly excluded by other provisions of § 22.1-306.

The fact of such finding, after all rights to any administrative appeal provided by § 63.2-1526 have been exhausted, shall be grounds for the local sc hool division to recommend that the Board of Education revoke such persons license to teach.

CASE NOTES Discretion of school boards.  School boards, as well as other administrative agencies, should have wide discretion in deciding whether or not to continue employment of their personnel. Discret ion, however, means exercise of judgment, not bias or capriciousness. Thus, such a decision must be based upon fact and supported by reasoned analysis. Gwathmey v. Atkinson, 447 F. Supp. 1113, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12844 (E.D. Va. 1976) (decided under pr ior law). Because subsection A of § 22.1-296.1 clearly expresses the legislatures direction that those who have already been convicted of a felony when they apply fo r employment by a school board may not be hired, it is the legislatures prerogative to allow a school board to consider the service record of an employee who is subsequently convicted of a felony after the employee was hired and to then decide whethe r termination is appropriate. Butler v. Fairfax Cnty. Sch. Bd., 291 Va. 32, 780 S.E.2d 277, 2015 Va. LEXIS 173 (2015). Law in existence when plaintiff entered into contract of employment became a part of her teaching contract, and, therefore, the statutory provision that the board could dismiss plaintiff at any time for certain causes was a part of her contract. County School Bd. v. McConnell, 215 Va. 603, 212 S.E.2d 264, 1975 Va. LEXIS 197 (1975) (decid ed under prior law). Teacher employed under continuing contract has a property interest in not having employment suspended. The interest can be grounded in either this section or § 22.1-315. The property interest in continued employment provided by this section includes a right not to have such employment interrupted by a suspension. Thus, the continuing contract statute provides an alternative source of plaintiffs property interest in not being suspended, which interest is more explicitly established in § 22.1-315. Wilkinson v. School Bd., 566 F. Supp. 766, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15939 (E.D. Va. 1 983). Same counsel may both present case for dismissal and advise school board.  A school board may rely on its counsel who both presents the superintendents case for dismissal of a school teacher and acts as advisor to the school board it self, which must make an independent assessment of the dismissal decision. As a matter of law, a school boards reliance on its attorney who also presents the case for the superintendent does not violate a teachers right to constitutional due proc ess. Breitling v.

Dismissal upheld.  In dismissing plaintiff on the grounds that he intermixed his private business affairs and his public responsibilities to the serious detriment of the school system, and . . . improperly hired and placed at least one teacher in his position as chairman of the special task force for minority hiring which greatly endangered the success of that program, the school board acted well within the limits of its di scretion and had ample evidentiary support for its action.

CASE NOTES Grievance procedure applies solely to teachers.  School principal was covered by both of two articles in subdivision 6 of § 22.1-79, and thus, an exception applied, which meant he was not entitled to use the grievance procedure in that stature; rather, he had to look to the grievance procedure rights available under § 22.1-308, and since that provision only applied to the suspension of teachers, his suspension from his position as a school principal did n ot involve a grievable matter.

Hearing requir ed for teacher accused of child abuse.  Defendants argument that plaintiffs child abuse relieved it of any obligation to abide by contractual terms, based on state common law, could not prevail, given that the Virginia Code expressly contemplates that continuing contract teachers who are accused of bad behavior must be granted a hearing upon demand. Williams v. Charlottesville Sch. Bd., 940 F. Supp. 143, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15157 (W.D. Va. 19 96), aff'd, 149 F.3d 1172, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 22944 (4th Cir. 1998). Substantial compliance with section found.  Where school board provided plaintiff a hearing to which she was entitled the first time the superintendent recommended her dismissal (before the findings of abus e made by the Department of Social Services (DSS) were affirmed), and then provided plaintiff with yet another hearing, after the DSS affirmed the findings of abuse below, the spirit of this section was complied with. An additional hearing under this sec tion would not have changed the outcome  termination  in this case. Hence, plaintiff suffered no injury because she was deprived of an additional opportunity to appear before the school board. Williams v. Charlottesville Sch. Bd., 940 F. Supp. 143, 1996 U.S. Dist.

Before the school board suspended plaintiff without pay, it conducted a hearing on the matter (after already having conducted an extraordinarily long hearing prev iously). Therefore, the school boards failure to grant plaintiff a hearing when it concluded that plaintiff would be dismissed, although technically contrary to the Virginia Code, had no effect on plaintiffs suspension without pay, since a hearin g preceded this decision.

In the event of a hearing before a hearing officer, the school board may make its decision upon the record or recording of such hearing, pursuant to § 22.1-313, or t he school board may elect to conduct a further hearing to receive additional evidence by giving written notice of the time and place to the teacher and the division superintendent within 10 business days after the board receives the record or recording o f the initial hearing. Such notice shall also specify each matter to be inquired into by the school board. C. Each school board may elect for a three-member fact-finding panel to conduct hearings pursuant to this section. The teacher and the division superintendent shall each select one panel member, and the two panel members so selected shall select an impartial hearing o fficer to serve as the chairman of the panel. The fact-finding panel shall schedule and preside over such hearings and shall create a record or recording of such proceedings. The fact-finding panel shall make a written recommendation to the school board, a copy of which shall be provided to the teacher. The fact-finding panel shall transmit the recommendation and the record or recording of the hearing to the school board as soon as practicable but in no case more than 10 business days after the hearing. In the event of a hearing before a fact-finding panel, the school board may make its decision upon the record or recording of such hearing, pursuant to § 22.1-313, or the school board may elect to conduct a further hearing to receive additional evide nce by giving written notice of the time and place of the hearing to the teacher and the division superintendent within 10 business days after the board receives the record or recording of the initial hearing. Such notice shall also specify each matter t o be inquired into by the school board. D. A record or recording of any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be made. The parties shall share the cost of the recording equally. In proceedings concerning grievances not related to dismissal, the recording may be dispensed with entirely by mutual c onsent of the parties. In such proceedings, if the recording is not dispensed with, the two parties shall share the cost of the recording equally; if either party requests a transcript, that party shall bear the expense of its preparation. In cases of di smissal, the record or recording shall be preserved for a period of six months. If the school board requests that a transcript be made at any time prior to expiration of the six-month period, it shall be made and copies shall be furnished to both parties . The school board shall bear the cost of the transcription. E. Witnesses w ho are employees of the school board shall be granted release time if the hearing is held during the school day. The hearing shall be held at the school in which most witnesses work, if feasible. History History.

Substantial compliance with section found.  Where school board provided plaintiff a hearing to which she was entitled the first time the superintendent recommended her dismissal (before the findings of abus e made by the Department of Social Services (DSS) were affirmed), and then provided plaintiff with yet another hearing, after the DSS affirmed the findings of abuse below, the spirit of § 22.1-309 was complied with. An additional hearing under § 22 .1-309 would not have changed the outcome  termination  in this case. Hence, plaintiff suffered no injury because she was deprived of an additional opportunity to appear before the school board. Williams v. Charlottesville Sch. Bd., 940 F . Supp. 143, 1996 U.S. Dist.

Hearing requir ed for teacher accused of child abuse.  Where defendant argued that plaintiffs child abuse relieved it of any obligation to abide by contractual terms, this argument (based on state common law) coul d not prevail, given that the Virginia Code expressly contemplates that continuing contract teachers who are accused of bad behavior must be granted a hearing upon demand. Williams v. Charlottesville Sch. Bd., 940 F. Supp. 143, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1515 7 (W.D. Va. 1996), aff'd, 149 F.3d 1172, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 22944 (4th Cir. 1998). Liability of school board and fact-finding panel.  The members of a school board and a fact-finding panel enjoy limited good-faith immunity. In performing discretionary functions, these defendants are generally sh ielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known. For the plaintiff to recover damages, therefore, there must be both a finding of a constitutional violation and a finding that the officials decision was objectively unreasonable. Lee v. Albemarle County Sch. Bd., 648 F. Supp. 744, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18423 (W.D. Va. 1986), aff'd, 829 F.2d 1120, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12212 (4th Cir. 1987) (decided under former § 22.1-312). Panel fact-findings not entitled to same weight given jury verdicts.  Panel fact-findings were not entitled to the same weight given jury verdicts and were thus not binding on a local school board since the fact-finding panel provid ed for in § 22.1-310 and this section bears no proper relationship to juries and a school boards power to discharge employees is rooted in the Va. Const., Art. VIII, § 7 and § 22.1-313 plainly contemplates that a local school board can and w ill, on occasion, disagree with the recommendations of a fact-finding panel.

CASE NOTES Role of superintendent.  Section 22.1-295 appears to contemplate for the superintendent a role in the screening of all applicants to ensure that everyone considered by the school board po ssesses suitable qualifications and moral character. The superintendent has no power to hire or fire. As this section makes clear, the school board shall retain its exclusive final authority over matters concerning employment and supervision of its perso nnel, including dismissals, suspensions and placing on probation. Dennis v. County School Bd., 582 F. Supp. 536, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19101 (W.D. Va. 1984). The federal district court must limit its review of the evidence before the school board with regard to a teachers competence to a determination whether or not a reasoned analysis of the evidence supports the boards adverse finding. Gwathmey v. Atkinson, 447 F. Supp. 1113, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12844 (E.D. Va. 1976) (decided under p rior law). The fact that the evidence tendered to the board is in the nature of opinion based upon fact rather than primary facts themselves does not detract from its validity. Gwathmey v. Atkinson, 447 F. Supp. 1113, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12844 (E.D. Va. 1976) (decided under prior law). When notice is required under subsection D.  The notice requirement of subsection D of this section would be triggered only if the school board were to hear evidence beyond the transcript, findings, and reco mmendations of the fact-finding panel. A contrary interpretation would grant the grievant an automatic second hearing, which subsection C of § 22.1-310 specifically forbids. Lee v. Albemarle County Sch. Bd., 648 F. Supp. 744, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184 23 (W.D. Va. 1986), aff'd, 829 F.2d 1120, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12212 (4th Cir. 1987). Notice not required.  Where the school board considered only the transcript, findings, and recommendations of the fact-finding panel at its meeting, this meeting of the school board to consider and act upon the recommendations of the fact-finding panel was not in itself a further hearing under the statute. Therefore, plaintiff was not entitled to notice of this meeting and the lack of notice did not violate his due process rights. Lee v. Albemarle County Sch. Bd., 648 F. Supp. 744, 1986 U.S. Dist.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Authority to make hiring decisions.  Subsection E of § 2.2-3119 can be harmonized with other statutes that require the school board to retain ultimate authority for hiring decisions. Subsection E of § 2.2-3119 does not require that the school board forfeit that authority; rather, it requires that the superintendent independently reaches a determination about the qualifications of an applicant who is married to or related to a school board memb er and to do so without any involvement of the school board in that hiring decision. Upon receiving the superintendents recommendation, the non-conflicted school board members then can vote on the applicant. The requirements of subsection E of § 2 .2-3119 are satisfied when a school board member recuses himself and certifies on the record that he had no involvement in the decision to hire his spouse or relative.

The school board shall reach its decision only after allowing the school division administration and the grievant opportunity to present written or oral arguments regarding grievability. The de cision as to whether the arguments shall be written or oral shall be in the discretion of the school board. Decisions of the school board may be appealed to the circuit court having jurisdiction in the school division for a hearing on the issue of grieva bility. Proceedings for review of the decision of the school board shall be instituted by filing a notice of appeal with the school board within 10 business days after the date of the decision and giving a copy thereof to all other parties. Within 10 business days thereafter, the school board shall transmit to the clerk of the court to which the appeal is taken a copy of its decision, a copy of the notice of appeal, and the ex hibits. The failure of the school board to transmit the record within the time allowed shall not prejudice the rights of the grievant. The court, on motion of the grievant, may issue a writ of certiorari requiring the school board to transmit the record on or before a certain date. Within 10 business days of receipt by the clerk of such record, the court, sitting without a jury, shall hear the appeal on the record transmitted by the school board and such additional evidence as may be necessary to resolv e any controversy as to the correctness of the record. The court, in its discretion, may receive such other evidence as the ends of justice require. The court may affirm the decision of the school board or may reverse or modify the decision. The decision of the court shall be rendered no later than the fifteenth day from the date of the conclusion of the hearing. Such determination of grievability shall be made subsequent to the reduction of the grievance to writing but prior to any hearing or the right to such determination shall be deemed to have been waived.

CASE NOTES Trial courts subject mat ter jurisdiction.  Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to review the school boards determination concerning the school principals suspension from his position as a h igh school principal, and since a suspension was not a grievable matter, the trial court should have entered judgment for the school board on the grievability issue.

Williams v. Northampton County Sch. Bd., 58 Va. Cir. 158, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 138 (Accomack County Jan. 11, 2002). Timeliness of decisions.  A school board erred in finding that the termination of a coachs one-year coaching contract was not grievable; § 22.1-314 stated in relevant part that deci sions regarding whether or not a matter was grievable had to be made by the school board and such decision had to be made within 10 days of such request. The school boards decision in the instant action was not made within this 10-day period, and the coach did not waive the 10-day decision requirement, so the decision by the school board that the complaint was not grievable was not timely, and the coach had to be allowed to proceed with the grievance process.

A teacher o r other public school employee, whether full-time or part-time, permanent, or temporary, may be suspended for good and just cause when the safety or welfare of the school division or the students therein is threatened or when the teacher or school employ ee has been charged by summons, warrant, indictment or information with the commission of a felony; a misdemeanor involving (i) sexual assault as established in Article 7 (§ 18.2-61 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 18.2, (ii) obscenity and related offen ses as established in Article 5 (§ 18.2-372 et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 18.2, (iii) drugs as established in Article 1 (§ 18.2-247 et seq.) of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2, (iv) moral turpitude, or (v) the physical or sexual abuse or neglect of a chil d; or an equivalent offense in another state. Except when a teacher or school employee is suspended because of being charged by summons, warrant, indictment or information with the commission of one of the above-listed criminal offenses, a division super intendent or appropriate central office designee shall not suspend a teacher or school employee for longer than sixty days and shall not suspend a teacher or school employee for a period in excess of five days unless such teacher or school employee is ad vised in writing of the reason for the suspension and afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the school board in accordance with §§ 22.1-311 and 22.1-313, if applicable. Any teacher or other school employee so suspended shall continue to rece ive his or her then applicable salary unless and until the school board, after a hearing, determines otherwise. No teacher or school employee shall be suspended solely on the basis of his or her refusal to submit to a polygraph examination requested by t he school board. B. Any school employee suspended because of being charged by summons, warrant, information or indictment with one of the offenses listed in subsection A may be suspended with or without pay. In the event any school employee is suspended without pay, an amount equal to his or her salary while on suspended status shall be placed in an interest-bearing demand escrow account. Upon being found not guilty of one of the offenses listed in subsection A or upon the dismissal or nolle prosequi of the charge, such school employ ee shall be reinstated with all unpaid salary and accrued interest from the escrow account, less any earnings received by the school employee during the period of suspension, but in no event shall such payment exceed one years salary.

Substantial compliance found.  Before the school board suspended plaintiff without pay, it conducted a hearing on the matter (after already having conducted an extraordinarily long hearing prev iously). Therefore, the school boards failure to grant plaintiff a hearing when it concluded that plaintiff would be dismissed, although technically contrary to the Virginia Code, had no effect on plaintiffs suspension without pay, since a hearin g preceded this decision.

Hearing before school board.  Fact that school principal did not have a grievable case based on his suspension from his position as a high school principal did not mean that he had no remedy a t all; indeed, he was given the right to schedule a hearing before the school board, according to § 22.1-315, and declined to pursue that remedy.

Wilkinson v. School Bd., 566 F. Supp. 766, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15939 (E.D. Va. 1983).

Bd., 288 Va. 432, 764 S.E.2d 40, 2014 Va. LEXIS 151 (2014). Teacher employed under continuing contract has a property interest in not having employment suspended. The interest can be grounded in either § 22.1-307 or this section. The property interest in continued employment provided by § 22.1-307 includes a right not to have such employment interrupted by a suspension. Thus, the continuing contract statute provides an alternative source of plaintiffs property interest in not being suspended, which interest is more explicitly established in this section.

Purpose, Findings, and Policy. A. The s tates party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooper ation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for th e development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achi eve that end. B. The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualif y in other states. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel without reference to their states of origin can increase the available educational resources. Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower. Article II. Definitions. As used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: 1. E ducational personnel means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs. 2. Designated state official means the educational official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of his state, contracts pursuant to this agree ment. 3. Accept or any variant thereof means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state. 4. State means a state, territory, or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 5. Originating state means a state or subdivision thereof whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acc eptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III. 6. Receiving state means a state or subdivision thereof which accepts educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III of this section . Article III. Interstate Educational Personnel Contracts. A. The d esignated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of his state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel. Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicabl e to and binding on the states whose designated state officials enter into it and the subdivisions of those states with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement. A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to thi s article only with states in which he finds that there are programs of education, licensure standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable even though not identical to that prevailing in his own state. B. Any such contract shall provide for: 1. Its duration. 2. The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state. 3. Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards. 4. Any other necessary matters. C.

The licensure or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or b een terminated. Any license or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a license or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state. F. A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of impro ving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states. Article IV. Approved and Accepted Programs. A. Nothi ng in this agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that st ate. B. To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of ed ucational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract. Article V. Interstate Cooperation. The party states agree that: 1. They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multilateral contracts pursuant to Article III of this agreement. 2. They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in interstate licensure and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, or ganizations, and associations interested in licensure and other elements of educational personnel qualification.

The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of wi thdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms. Article IX. Construction and Severability. This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable; and if any phrase, clause, se ntence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or if the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.
