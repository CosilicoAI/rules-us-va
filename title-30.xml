CASE NOTES This section is valid, as the General Assembly may well determine what conditions will b est enable its membership to perform their official duties and private responsibilities while engaged in public service. Hudgins v. Hall, 183 Va. 577, 32 S.E.2d 715, 1945 Va. LEXIS 204 (1945). It contains all the statutory law on the subject. Rosenberger v. Commonwealth, 159 Va. 95 3, 166 S.E. 464, 1932 Va. LEXIS 232 (1932); Hudgins v. Hall, 183 Va. 577, 32 S.E.2d 715, 1945 Va. LEXIS 204 (1945). And it has an interesting history which shows the consideration the statute has received at the hands of the General Assembly. Hudgins v. Hall, 183 Va. 577, 32 S.E.2d 715, 1945 Va. LEXIS 204 (1945). This section cannot extend 7 U.S.C. § 2023(a)s limitation period since the inflex ible 30-day period for filing provided by 7 U.S.C. § 2023(a) trumps any longer period that this section may provide. Shoulders v. USDA, 878 F.2d 141, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 8937 (4th Cir. 1989). It is peremptory and designed to prevent embarrassment and conflict to a member of the G eneral Assembly in the performance of his public and private duties. Hudgins v. Hall, 183 Va. 577, 32 S.E.2d 715, 1945 Va. LEXIS 204 (1945). And it needs no construction or interpretation, as its language is clear, absolute and u nequivocal. Hudgins v. Hall, 183 Va. 577, 32 S.E.2d 715, 1945 Va. LEXIS 204 (1945). Time for making motion.  As a general rule, a motion for a continuance should be timely made, but there is no such limitation in this section. Rice v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 778, 188 S.E.2 d 196, 1972 Va. LEXIS 266 (1972) (decided under this section as it stood before the passage of the first 1973 amendment, which added clause (ii) to the first sentence). Member of General Assembly is entitled to continuance as matter of right.  Under the plain language of this section a member of the General Assembly was entitled to a continuance as a matter of right, and the failure of the trial court to grant his motion constituted reversible error. Rice v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 778, 188 S.E.2d 196, 1972 Va. LEXIS 266 (1972). Section makes no distinction between regular and special sessions.  But, whether the session is regular or special, the statute authorizes the filing extension for a particular session and limits that extension to 30 days after an y such session. It makes no provision for extending the filing time for a pleading required to be filed prior to commencement of the session. Upshur v. Haynes Furn. Co., 228 Va. 595, 324 S.E.2d 653, 1985 Va. LEXIS 150 (1985). This section exempts no proceeding before a commission covered by the statute. Howell v. Catterall, 212 Va. 525, 186 S.E.2d 28, 1972 Va. LEXIS 193 (1972). Section covers proceedings before State Corporation Commission.  Since the State Corporation Commission has judicial or quasi-judicial powers and jurisdiction, proceedings before that Commission are covered by this section. How ell v. Catterall, 212 Va. 525, 186 S.E.2d 28, 1972 Va. LEXIS 193 (1972). The State Corporation Commission being covered, this section applies to its proceedings, whether the Commission is exercising a judicial or quasi-judicial functio n or a legislative function. Howell v. Catterall, 212 Va. 525, 186 S.E.2d 28, 1972 Va. LEXIS 193 (1972). As to time for filing notice of appeal and assignments of error, see Hartsock v. Powell, 199 Va. 320, 99 S.E.2d 581, 1957 Va. LEXIS 193 (1957). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  An injured partys motion for judgment in a personal injury case was timely filed, because § 30-5, which provided that any pleading or the performance of an y act relating thereto required to be filed or performed by any statute or rule during the period beginning 30 days prior to the commencement of the General Assembly session and ending 30 days after any such session would be extended until not less than 30 days after any such session, applied, as the injured partys attorney was a member of the General Assembly. Ellis v. Lupica, 56 Va. Cir. 281, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 459 (Norfolk July 30, 2001). Filings affected.  Legislature intended this section to touch every type of filing, not merely those specifically relating to continuances. Rich-McGhie v. City of Portsmouth, 62 Va. Cir. 518, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 446 (Norfolk July 11, 2002). In a wrongful death case, when plaintiffs attorney, a member of the general assembly, filed a motion for judgment, this section extended the statute of limita tions until 30 days after adjournment, which did not occur until after the date of filing; therefore, plaintiffs motion for judgment was timely filed. Rich-McGhie v. City of Portsmouth, 62 Va. Cir. 518, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 446 (Norfolk July 11, 2002) . Continuance.  Although a General Assembly member made a motion within 21 days from the time an order was signed, the order was not changed during the 21-day modification period and, as he was not a counsel of record during the case, statutory continuance was unavailable. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 56 Va. Cir. 476, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 488 (Norfolk Sept. 28, 2001). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Member of the General Assembly who is an officer of a corporation holding an ABC license that is the subject of a hearing before an administrative board is a party under this section.

Power of legislative committee is subject to constitutional restraints.  While a legislative committee has broad powers in calling for the production of relevant evidence, such power is subject to constitutional restraints designed for the protection of the rights of the individual. NAACP v. Committee on Offenses Against Admin. of Justice, 199 Va. 665, 101 S.E.2d 631, 1958 Va. LEXIS 111, vacated, 358 U.S. 40, 79 S. Ct. 24, 3 L. Ed. 2d 46, 1958 U.S. LEXIS 332 (1958). But production of papers may not be refused merely because they are private.  The investigation by a legislative committee within the scope of its prescribed duties is universally recognized as a reasonable exercise of such police power. Co nsequently, the production of papers material to such an inquiry may not be refused merely because they are private. NAACP v.

Text Whenever any legislative bill requiring a net additional expenditure by any county, city, or town, or whenever any legislative bill requiring a net reduction of revenue s by any county, city, or town, is filed during any session of the General Assembly, the Commission on Local Government shall investigate and prepare an estimate setting forth, to the extent practicable, the additional expenditures or reduction of revenu es, if any, to be required of the affected localities in event of enactment of such legislation. A bill shall be deemed to require an expenditure if it has the effect of requiring any county, city, or town to (i) perform or administer a new or expanded program or s ervice, (ii) maintain an existing program or service at a specified level of spending or delivery, (iii) assume or incur administrative costs in support of a state or state-related program, or (iv) furnish capital facilities for state or state-related ac tivities. For purposes of this section, net additional expenditure means the cost anticipated to be incurred annually, less any revenues receivable on account of the prog ram or service from fees charged recipients of the program or service, state or federal aid paid specifically and categorically in connection with the program or service, new or increased local sources of revenue authorized and designated specifically to offset the cost of the program or service, and any offsetting savings resulting from the reduction or elimination of any program or service directly attributable to the performance of the required program or service.

Upon completion of the assessment by the Bureau and the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the Commission may make a recommendation regarding its support of or opposition to the enactment of the proposed mandate. The Commissions recommendation may address whether the proposed mandate should be provided under health care plans offered through a health benefit exchange or outside a health benefit exchange.The Commission shall be given a period of 24 months to complete and submit its assessment.
