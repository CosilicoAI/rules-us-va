Whenever the words Department of Taxa tion, or other words denoting that Department, appear in any provision of law or in any legal or other proceeding or in any other manner, the same shall be construed to mean the Tax Commissioner. When any provision of law imposes a duty upon, or vest s power in, the Department, such duty shall be performed and such power shall be exercised by the Tax Commissioner. Resident for purposes of taxation, except as to Chapter 3 (§ 58.1-300 et seq.) of t his title or as otherwise specifically provided, includes every person domiciled in the Commonwealth on the first day of any tax year, and every other person who has had his place of abode in the Commonwealth for the longer portion of the twelve months n ext preceding January 1 in each year, unless on or before that day he has changed his place of abode to a place outside the Commonwealth with the bona fide intention of continuing actually to abide permanently outside the Commonwealth. The fact that a person who has so changed his place of abode, within six months from so doing, again abides within the Commonwealth shall be prima facie evidence that h e did not intend permanently to have his actual place of abode outside the Commonwealth. Such person so changing his actual place of abode and not intending permanently to continue it outside the Commonwealth and not having listed his property for taxati on as a resident of the Commonwealth for the purpose of having his personal property listed for taxation in the Commonwealth, shall be deemed to have resided on the day when such property should have been listed, at his last place of abode in the Commonw ealth. The fact that a person whose place of abode during the greater portion of such twelve months has been in the Commonwealth does not claim or exercise the right to vote at public elections in the Commonwealth shall not, of itself, constitute him a n onresident of the Commonwealth within the meaning of this term. Tax Commissioner means the chief executive officer of the Department of Taxation or hi s delegate. Tax day or date of assessment, except as otherwise specifically provided, is January 1 of each year. Tax exempt organization or an organization exempt from taxation under § 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code means any corporation, partnership, organization or trust which has rec eived written notice of its exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service, if such notice is required by the Internal Revenue Service to obtain exempt status. Tax year, except when otherwise specifically provided, begins on January 1 of each yea r and ends on December 31 of each year. Taxes and levies as used in this title are synonymous. The terms taxes and levies, however, shall not include the assessments for local improvements provided for in Article 2 (§ 15.2-2404 et seq.) of Chapter 24 of Title 15.2 or the charter of any city or town. Taxpayer includes every person, corporation, partnership, organization, trust or estat e subject to taxation under the laws of this Commonwealth, or under the ordinances, resolutions or orders of any county, city, town or other political subdivision of this Commonwealth.

House Joint Resolution 291 of the 1981 Session directed the Code Commission to make a study of the organization of Title 58 and report its findings to the Governo r and the General Assembly in the form of a recodification of that title. In January, 1984, its report, containing a proposed revision of Title 58, was sent to the Governor and the General Assembly. The report was published as House Document No. 16 of th e 1984 Session and served as the basis for this title, which was enacted by Acts 1984, c. 675, effective January 1, 1985. In addition to its revision by Acts 1984, c. 675, former Title 58 was amended by certain other acts during the 1984 Session. These amendments have been incorporat ed, as appropriate, into comparable provisions of this title, pursuant to § 30-152 and Acts 1984, c. 675, cl. 5. Acts 1984, c. 675, cl. 2, 3, 4 and 6 provide: 2. That whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section, article or chapter of Title 58 or any other title of this Code as such titles existed prior to January 1, 1985, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section, article or chapter of this title or any other title of this Code and whenever any such former section, article or chapter is given a new number in this or any other title, all references to any such former section, article or chapter of Title 58 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article or chapter containing such conditions, requi rements, provisions, contents or portions thereof. 3. That the rules and regulations of the Department of Taxation in effect on the effective date of this act shall continue in effect to the extent that they a re not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated under this act. 4. That this recodification of Title 58 and Title 58.1 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any member of a board, council, c ommittee or other appointed body referred to in Title 58.1, and each such officer and member shall continue to serve the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 58. 6. That the repeal by this act of any law validating any prior conveyance, contract, loan or other action or agreement shall not be construed as invalidating such conveyance, contract, loan or other action or agreement. Cross references.

CASE NOTES Prior rulings afforded no deference.  Circuit court did not err in refusing to defer to the Tax Commissioners ruling simply because the Tax Commissioner had issued prior rulings pertaining to the issue since those prior rulings were not expressed in regulations and were, therefore, afforded no deference and entitled to no weight. Nielsen Co. (US), LLC v. County Bd. of Arlington County, 289 Va. 79, 767 S.E.2d 1, 2015 Va. LEXIS 6 (2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Assessments prima facie correct.  When a taxpayer contested an assessment on assets it purchased from an entity at a foreclosure sale, for taxes due from that entity, the Commonwealth Department o f Taxation did not have the burden of proving the taxpayer did not withhold required funds from the assets purchase price because: (1) by its plain language, § 58.1-629 imposed a withholding requirement of the taxpayer until the previous owner pro vided a receipt showing that taxes on the assets had been paid or were no longer due; (2) § 58.1-205 stated that assessments by the Department of Taxation were prima facie correct; (3) subsection D of § 58.1-1825 put the burden of proof on a taxpay er wishing to contest an assessment; and (4) the taxpayer was in control of the documents proving whether a withholding from the purchase price required by § 58.1-629 was made.

Whenever a Virginia resident has become liable to another state for income tax on any earned or business income or any gain on the sale of a capital asset (within the meaning of § 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code), not including an asset used in a trade or busi ness, to the extent that such gain is included in federal adjusted gross income, for the taxable year, derived from sources outside the Commonwealth and subject to taxation under this chapter, the amount of such tax payable by him shall, upon proof of su ch payment, be credited on the taxpayers return with the income tax so paid to the other state. However, no franchise tax, license tax, excise tax, unincorporated business tax, occupation tax or any tax characterized as such by the taxing jurisdiction, although ap plied to earned or business income, shall qualify for a credit under this section, nor shall any tax which, if characterized as an income tax or a commuter tax, would be illegal and unauthorized under such other states controlling or enabling legisla tion qualify for a credit under this section. The credit allowable under this section shall not exceed: (i) such proportion of the income tax otherwise payable by him under this chapter as his income upon which the tax imposed by the other state was computed bears to his Virginia taxable income upon which the tax imposed by this Commonwealth was computed or (ii) the income tax otherwise payable under this chapter in the event that the income upon which the tax imp osed by the other state is computed is less than the Virginia taxable income upon which the tax imposed by this Commonwealth is computed and all income derived from sources outside the Commonwealth and subject to taxation under this chapter is earned inc ome or business income reported on federal form Schedule C from a single state contiguous to Virginia. The credit provided for by this section shall not be granted to a resident individual when the laws of another state, under which the income in questio n is subject to tax assessment, provide a credit to such resident individual substantially similar to that granted by subsection B of this section.

CASE NOTES Local income tax imposed by former Md. Ann. Code (1957), Art. 81, § 283, is not an income tax to the state within the meaning of this section and therefore does not qualify for the credit against Virginia income taxes provided by this section.

District of Columbias tax on the net income of unincorporated businesses is an incom e tax; and a Virginia resident, who does business in the District of Columbia and pays the tax there, is entitled to credit against his Virginia income taxes for the amount paid to the District of Columbia.

The District tax on plaintiffs was illegal and unauthorized under the federal Home Rule Act for purposes of qualifying for a credit under this section, since the Home Rule Act prohibits the imposition of any tax on the whole or any portion of the personal income of any individual not a resident of the District. Mathy v.

Credit for taxes paid to a foreign country on retirement income. Text A. Whenever a Virginia resident has become liable to a foreign country for income tax paid on any pension or retirement income to the extent that such income is included in federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year, derived from foreign sources as a result of past employment in a foreign country and subject to taxation under this chapter, the amount of such tax payable by him shall, upon proof of such payment, be credited on the taxpayers return with the income tax so paid to the foreign country. The cre dit allowable under this section shall not exceed: (i) such proportion of the income tax otherwise payable by him under this chapter as his income upon which the tax imposed by the foreign country was computed bears to his Virginia taxable income upon wh ich the tax imposed by this Commonwealth was computed or (ii) the income tax otherwise payable under this chapter, in the event that the income upon which the tax imposed by the foreign country is computed is less than the Virginia taxable income upon wh ich the tax imposed by this Commonwealth is computed. B. For purpose s of determining this credit, the foreign currency must be translated into United States dollars using the prevailing rate of exchange which most nearly reflects the value of the foreign currency at the time the taxes were actually paid to the foreign co untry. C. As used in this section, a foreign country shall include all possessions of the United States. Any foreign country which does not qualify for the federal foreign tax credit under § 901(j) of the Internal Revenue Code will also be disqualified for the credit allo wed under this section.

If a taxpayers method of accounting is changed, other than from an accrual to an installment me thod, any additional tax which results from adjustments determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change shall not be greater than if such adjustments were ratably allocated and included for the taxable year of the change and the preceding taxab le years, not in excess of two, during which the taxpayer used the method of accounting from which the change is made. If a taxpayers method of accounting is changed from an accrual to an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such ch ange of method and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the receipt of installment payments properly accrued in a prior year, shall be reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to the accrual of such installment pa yments, in accordance with regulations of the Department. E. In computin g a taxpayers Virginia taxable income for any taxable year under a method of accounting different from the method under which the taxpayers Virginia taxable income was computed, there shall be taken into account those adjustments which are determ ined, under regulations prescribed by the Department, to be necessary solely by reason of change in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. F. Notwithstan ding any of the other provisions of this section, any accounting adjustments made for federal income tax purposes for any taxable year shall be applied in computing the taxpayers taxable income for such year.

It was in Commonwealths Attorneys discretion whether to prosecute appellant unde r § 18.2-95, the grand larceny statute, or to prosecute him under this section. Brown v. Commonwealth, 30 Va. App. 243, 516 S.E.2d 678, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 461 (1999). Claim of right defense inapplicable.  A trial court did not err in refusing a defendants instructions that the claim of right defense applied to tax matters; that defense is only applicable to cri mes of trespassory taking or entering upon the property of another and did not apply to the defendants claim that he was exempt from the duty to comply with the tax statutes. Burkholder v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 57 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 6, 20 01). § 58.1-348.1. Fraudulent assistance; penalty. Text Any income tax return preparer, as defined in § 58.1-302, who knowingly and willfully aids or assists in, counsels or advises the preparation or presentation of a re turn, affidavit, claim or other document required by this chapter that he knows is fraudulent or false as to any material matter, is guilty of a Class 6 felony.

Rev. 291 (2005). CASE NOTES Sufficient evidence.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant because the record showed that defendant spoke with each taxpayer about his or her income and possible deductions, he collected relevant information, he accepted a fee, and he delivered prepared returns, which claimed deductions that were disallowed. Brailey v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. App. 435, 686 S.E.2d 546, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 570 (2009). § 58.1-348.2. Authority to enjoin income tax return preparers. Text A. The Departm ent may commence a civil action to enjoin any person who is an income tax return preparer from further engaging in any conduct described in subsection B or from further action as an income tax return preparer. The venue for any action under this section shall be brought in the circuit court in the circuit where the income tax return preparer resides or has his principal place of business or in the jurisdiction in which the taxpayer with respect to whose income tax return the action is brought resides. T he court may exercise its jurisdiction over such action separate and apart from any other administrative or judicial action brought by the Commonwealth against such income tax return preparer or any taxpayer. B. In any acti on under subsection A, the court may enjoin the income tax return preparer from further engaging in any conduct specified in this subsection if the court finds that injunctive relief is appropriate to prevent the recurrence of such conduct. The court may enjoin conduct when an income tax return preparer has: 1. Engag ed in any conduct subject to penalty under § 6694 or 6695 of the Internal Revenue Code, or subject to any criminal penalty provided by the Internal Revenue Code or this title; or 2. Engaged in any other fraudulent or deceptive conduct that substantially interferes with the proper administration of the tax laws of the Commonwealth. C. If the cour t finds that an income tax return preparer has continually or repeatedly engaged in any conduct described in subsection B and that an injunction prohibiting such conduct would not be sufficient to prevent such persons interference with the proper adm inistration of the tax laws of the Commonwealth, the court may enjoin such person from acting as an income tax return preparer. The fact that that person has been enjoined from preparing income tax returns for the United States or any other state in the five years preceding the petition for an injunction shall establish a prima facie case for an injunction under this section. D. 1. The Department may bar or suspend any income tax return preparer, without resort to the injunctive remedies described in this section, from filing returns with the Department for repeated violations of § 58.1-348.4. Such disbarment or suspension shall be subject to appeal pursuant to the procedures described in subdivision D 2. 2. a. Any income tax preparer barred or suspended pursuant to subdivision D 1 may, within 30 days from the date of such barring or suspension, apply for relief to the Commissioner or appeal directly to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. Such application s hall be in the form prescribed by the Department, and shall fully set forth the grounds upon which the tax preparer relies and all facts relevant to the tax preparers contention. The Commissioner may also require such additional information, testimon y, or documentary evidence as he deems necessary to a fair determination of the application. b. Any income tax preparer barred or suspended against whom an order or decision of the Commissioner has been adversely rendered pursuant to subdivision D 2 a may, within fifteen day s of such order or decision, appeal from such order or decision to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. c. Any income tax preparer barred or suspended shall not file any Virginia income tax returns pending application for relief to the Commissioner and appeal to the Circuit Court of th e City of Richmond.

Rich. L. Rev. 291 (2005). § 58.1-348.3. Requirement that income tax return preparers use identification numbers. Text A. As used in this section, PTIN means the Preparer Tax Identification Number that the Internal Revenue Service uses to identify tax return preparers pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 6109. B. For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2019, the Department shall require any income tax return preparer to include his PTIN on any tax return that he prepares or assists in preparing. C. The Departm ent shall promulgate regulations for using the PTIN as an oversight mechanism to assess returns and to identify high error rates, patterns of suspected fraud, and unsubstantiated bases for tax positions by income tax return preparers. D. 1. The Department shall establish formal and regular communication protocols with the I nternal Revenue Service to share and exchange PTIN information on income tax return preparers who are suspected of fraud, who are disciplined, or who are barred from filing tax returns with the Department or the Internal Revenue Service. 2. The Department may establish communication protocols with other states to exchange the enforcement and discipline information described in subdivision D 1. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 58.1-3 or any other provision of this title, the Department is authorized to provide to the Internal Revenue Service and other state tax or reven ue agencies for their confidential use preparer and return data, including PTIN information, taxpayer names, taxpayer identification numbers, and other information as necessary to enforce the provisions of this section and §§ 58.1-348.2 and 58.1-34 8.4. E. The failure of an income tax return preparer to include his PTIN on a tax return shall not be used by the Department as a basis for rejecting such return as improperly filed. History History. 2018, c. 150. § 58.1-348.4. Failure to provide identification number; civil penalty. Text A. No income t ax return preparer may provide tax preparation services for Virginia income tax returns unless he provides his PTIN, as defined in § 58.1-348.3, when submitting a return and signing as an income tax return preparer. B. In addition to all other penalties provided by law, any person who violates subsection A shall pay a civil penalty to the Department in the amount of $50 per offense, but not to exceed $25,000 per calendar year. No penalty shall be imposed if the violation is reaso nable and unintentional as determined by the Department.

If a taxpayers method of accounting is changed from an accrual to an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such ch ange of method and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the receipt of installment payments properly accrued in a prior year, shall be reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to the accrual of such installment pa yments, in accordance with regulations of the Department. E. In computin g a taxpayers Virginia taxable income for any taxable year under a method of accounting different from the method under which the taxpayers Virginia taxable income was computed, there shall be taken into account those adjustments which are determ ined, under regulations prescribed by the Department of Taxation, to be necessary solely by reason of change in order to prevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. F. Notwithstan ding any other provisions of this section, any accounting adjustments made for federal income tax purposes for any taxable year shall be applied in computing the taxpayers taxable income for such year.

Such election shal l be made on or before a date to be determined by the Department, which shall be set no earlier than one year after the extended due date for filing the applicable return. Notwithstanding §§ 58.1-1812 and 58.1-1833, no interest shall accrue on unde rpayments or overpayments solely attributable to such election. 2. For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2022, but before January 1, 2026, a qualifying pass-through entity may make an annual election, on its timely filed return pursuant to § 58.1-392, to pay the tax levied by this section at the entity level for the taxable period covered by such return. Such election shall be made on or before the due date for filing the applicable return, including any extensions that have been gra nted. B. A tax at th e rate of 5.75 percent is hereby annually imposed on the Virginia taxable income, as calculated pursuant to § 58.1-391, for each taxable year of every qualifying pass-through entity that makes the election provided under subsection A. C. A qualifyin g pass-through entity that elects to pay the tax levied by subsection B shall be eligible for all credits, deductions, or other adjustments to taxable income under § 58.1-391, provided that a qualifying pass-through entitys taxable income shall be adjusted to eliminate any federal deduction for state and local income taxes. D. Any person that is subject to the tax imposed under § 58.1-320 or 58.1-360 and is an owner of a qualifying pass-through entity making the election pursuant to this section shall be entitled to a credit against the tax imposed, provided that taxable income has be en adjusted to add back any deduction for state and local income taxes paid by the qualifying pass-through entity. Such credit shall be in an amount equal to such persons pro rata share of the tax paid under this section by any qualifying pass-throug h entity of which such person is an owner. If the amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this subsection exceeds such persons tax liability for the tax imposed under § 58.1-320 or 58.1-360, as applicable, such excess shall be treated as an overp ayment and refundable pursuant to § 58.1-499. E. If any qual ifying pass-through entity makes an election pursuant to this section, the Department shall assess and collect tax, interest, and penalties as if such tax is a corporate income tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of Article 10 (§ 58.1-400 et seq.).

CASE NOTES Section does not apply to pass-through telecommunications companies.  Trial court erred in finding that the minimum tax imposed upon telecommunications companies pursuant to § 58.1-400.1 was applicable to all telecommunications c ompanies, whether such companies were corporations or pass-through entities, because the plain language of §§ 58.1-400 and 58.1-400.1 indicated that the minimum tax was not intended to apply to pass-through telecommunications companies, which were not required to pay a corporate tax; because the minimum tax is to be paid instead of the corporate tax, it is implied that the minimum tax imposed by § 58.1-400.1 only applies to corporations.

Trial court erred in finding that the minimum tax imposed upon telecommunications companies pursuant to § 58.1-400.1 was applicable to all telecommunications c ompanies, whether such companies were corporations or pass-through entities, because the plain language of §§ 58.1-400 and 58.1-400.1 indicated that the minimum tax was not intended to apply to pass-through telecommunications companies, which were not required to pay a corporate tax; the trial court erred in upholding the validity of 23 VAC 10-120-89, a regulation promulgated by the Virginia Department of Taxation, because 23 VAC 10-120-89 was inconsistent with § 58.1-400.1 to the extent that i t imposed the minimum tax provided for under § 58.1-400.1 upon pass-through entities.

Minimum income tax applicable to corporations not partnerships or pass through entities.  Trial court erred in finding that the minimum tax imposed upon telecommunications companies pursuant to § 58.1-400.1 was applicable to all telecommunications c ompanies, whether such companies were corporations or pass-through entities, because the plain language of §§ 58.1-400 and 58.1-400.1 indicated that the minimum tax was not intended to apply to pass-through telecommunications companies, which were not required to pay a corporate tax; the income tax imposed by § 58.1-400 is an income tax for corporations only and is not an income tax on partnerships or pass-through entities.

This addition shall not be required for any portion of the intangible expenses and costs if one of the f ollowing applies: (1) The corresponding item of income received by the related member is subject to a tax based on or measured by net income or capital imposed by Virginia, another state, or a foreign government that has entered into a comprehensive tax treaty wi th the United States government; (2) The related member derives at least one-third of its gross revenues from the licensing of intangible property to parties who are not related members, and the transact ion giving rise to the expenses and costs between the corporation and the related member was made at rates and terms comparable to the rates and terms of agreements that the related member has entered into with parties who are not related members for the licensing of intangible property; or (3) The corporation can establish to the satisfaction of the Tax Commissioner that the intangible expenses and costs meet both of the following: (i) the related member du ring the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued or incurred such portion to a person who is not a related member, and (ii) the transaction giving rise to the intangible expenses and costs between the corporation and the related member did not have as a principal purpose the avoidance of any portion of the tax due under this chapter. b.

If the corporation can demonstrate to the Tax Commissioners sole satisfaction, by clear and convincing evidence, that the transaction or transactions between the co rporation and a related member or members resulting in such increase in taxable income pursuant to subdivision a had a valid business purpose other than the avoidance or reduction of the tax due under this chapter, the Tax Commissioner shall permit the c orporation to file an amended return. For purposes of such amended return, the requirements of subdivision a shall not apply to any transaction for which the Tax Commissioner is satisfied (and has identified) that the transaction had a valid business pur pose other than the avoidance or reduction of the tax due under this chapter.

CASE NOTES In determining the constitutional validity of the statutory taxing formula, the court mu st compare the percentage of total taxable income produced by the formula in question with the percentage of total taxable income produced by the taxpayers proposed method. Unless a gross disparity in percentages results, the statutory formula must b e upheld. Commonwealth, Dep't of Taxation v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 217 Va. 121, 225 S.E.2d 870, 1976 Va. LEXIS 251 (1976).

Lucky St ores, Inc., 217 Va. 121, 225 S.E.2d 870, 1976 Va. LEXIS 251 (1976). Ap portionment method satisfied constitutional standard.  Virginias apportionment method satisfies the constitutional standard; Virginias apportionment method for taxing sales of services satisfies the requiremen ts of existing precedent from the United States Supreme Court because Virginias taxation scheme reasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being taxed, nothing more is required. Corp. Exec. Bd. Co. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 297 Va. 57 , 822 S.E.2d 918, 2019 Va. LEXIS 6 (2019). Apportionment of incom e not unconstitutional.  Taxpayer did not suffer from an unconstitutional apportionment of its income because it did not reach beyond the portion of value fairly attributable to economic activity within the State; the content for the taxpayers core product was developed by its employees working in Virginia, the servers on which the product resided were located in Virginia, each time a customer used the core product, the customer reac hed into Virginia to consult materials developed in Virginia and stored there. Corp. Exec. Bd. Co. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 297 Va. 57, 822 S.E.2d 918, 2019 Va. LEXIS 6 (2019). Virginia Apportionment formula did not create a grossly distorted result because the tax imposed on a taxpayers services rested upon the labor of empl oyees in Virginia who developed the product the taxpayer sold, which was located in servers stored in Virginia.

No taxation of capital gains corporation received from sale of stock.  The Virginia Department of Taxation could not tax, consistent with due process, the capital gains and interest income that corporation received from the sale of a corporations stock in which it owned a significant interest; the factors of profitability arising from the operation of the business as a whole did not evidence the operation of a unitary business between the two corporations.

CASE NOTES Ap portionment method satisfied constitutional standard.  Taxpayer did not suffer from an unconstitutional apportionment of its income because it did not reach beyond the portion of value fairly attributable to economic activity within the state; the content for the taxpayers core product was developed by its employees working in Virginia, the servers on which the product resided were located in Virginia, each time a customer used the core product, the customer reac hed into Virginia to consult materials developed in Virginia and stored there. Corp. Exec. Bd. Co. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 297 Va. 57, 822 S.E.2d 918, 2019 Va. LEXIS 6 (2019). Virginia Apportionment formula did not create a grossly distorted result because the tax imposed on a taxpayers services rested upon the labor of empl oyees in Virginia who developed the product the taxpayer sold, which was located in servers stored in Virginia. Corp. Exec. Bd. Co. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 297 Va. 57, 822 S.E.2d 918, 2019 Va. LEXIS 6 (2019). Virginias apportionment method satisfies the constitutional standard; Virginias apportionment method for taxing sales of services satisfies the requiremen ts of existing precedent from the United States Supreme Court because Virginias taxation scheme reasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being taxed, nothing more is required. Corp. Exec. Bd. Co. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 297 Va. 57 , 822 S.E.2d 918, 2019 Va. LEXIS 6 (2019). The corporate income taxpayer under this section has no absolute right to use an alternative method of allocation and apportionment. Commonwealth, Dep't of Taxation v. Lucky Stores, Inc., 217 Va. 121, 225 S.E.2d 870, 1976 Va. LEXIS 251 (1976) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statutory method properly applied.  Tax Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in applying the statutory method to a taxpayers income activities because no direct evidence or reasonable infer ence showed the extent to which any of the taxpayers customers actually operated or used the data or information within its billing address, or the extent, if any, to which the data and information were accessed; the information and data were created , developed, improved, and maintained in Virginia.

Request to r eplace statutory method properly denied.  Tax Commissioner did not abuse his discretion because he properly considered and denied the taxpayers request to replace the statutory method since it failed to prove it was subject to taxation on a greater portion of its Virginia taxable income than was reasonably attributable to its business or sources within the Commonwealth; the record was void of evidence that, were an inequity to exist, it was attributa ble to Virginia rather than to another unique method used in some other states. Corp. Exec. Bd. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 96 Va. Cir. 287, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 151 (Arlington County Sept. 1, 2017), aff'd, 297 Va. 57, 822 S.E.2d 918, 2019 Va. LEXIS 6 (2019 ). Apportionment method constitutional.  Allocation of gross receipts entirely to Virginia under the apportionment formula did not violate the Due Process and Commerce Clauses because a taxpayer could no t meet its burden of proof under the External Consistency Test; almost all the work on the information and content that encompassed a subscription service was performed within Virginia, and the maintenance, development, and improvement of the core produc t occurred in Virginia. Corp. Exec. Bd. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 96 Va. Cir. 287, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 151 (Arlington County Sept. 1, 2017), aff'd, 297 Va. 57, 822 S.E.2d 918, 2019 Va. LEXIS 6 (2019). Stat utory method did not lead to grossly distorted result.  Statutory method did not lead to a grossly distorted result because a taxpayer was not double taxed; while other states could use market benefit to their states o r another method to impose a tax for the taxpayers activities in those states, Virginia simply did not consider such methods in its taxing formula, and the taxpayer did not meet its burden of proof to show a grossly distorted result.

For taxable years beginning on or after July 1, 2011, the Virginia taxable income of a manufacturing company, excluding income allocable under § 58.1-407, may be apportioned within and without the Commonwealth as provided in § 58.1-408 or as follows: 1. From July 1, 2011, until July 1, 2013, by multiplying such income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus triple the sales factor and the denominator of which is five, except when the sales factor does not exi st, the denominator of the fraction shall be the number of existing factors, and when the sales factor exists but the payroll factor or property factor does not exist, the denominator of the fraction shall be the number of existing factors plus two; 2.

From July 1, 2014, and thereafter, by multiplying such income by the sales factor. B. If the taxp ayer makes one or more of the elections described in subdivision A 1, A 2, or A 3, the taxpayer may not revoke the election for a period of three taxable years.In addition, the taxpayer shall certify to the Department that the average weekly wage of its full-time employees is greater than the lower of the state or local average weekly wages for the taxpayers industry. C. If the aver age annual number of full-time employees of a manufacturing company for the first three taxable years (in which the manufacturing company used the alternative apportionment set forth in this section) is less than 90 percent of the base year employment, o r the average wage of its full-time employees as certified by the taxpayer is not greater than the lower of the state or local average weekly wage, then the Department of Taxation shall assess the manufacturing company with additional taxes pursuant to t his article computed as the difference between (i) the taxes that would have been due under the apportionment formula provided under § 58.1-408 for such three taxable years, minus (ii) the taxes due under the alternative apportionment provided under t his section for such three taxable years. Interest shall accrue and shall be assessed on such additional taxes at the rate prescribed under § 58.1-15, with such interest accruing from the original due date for filing of the income tax return to the da te of payment of such additional taxes.Such additional taxes and interest are hereby imposed on manufacturing companies using the alternative apportionment set forth in this section. D. As used in this section, unless the context requires another meaning:Base year employment means the average number of full-time employees employed by the manufacturing company in the Commonwealth in the taxable year that ended immediately prior to the first taxable year in which the manufacturing company used the alternative apportionment set forth in this sec tion.Full-time employee means an employee of a manufacturing company who is employed for an indef inite duration in the Commonwealth for which the standard fringe benefits are paid by the manufacturing company, for which employment requires a minimum of either (i) 35 hours of an employees time per week for the entire normal year of such manufactu ring companys operations, which normal year shall consist of at least 48 weeks, or (ii) 1,680 hours per year.Manufacturing company means a domestic or foreign corporation primarily engaged in activities that, in accordance with the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), United States Manual, United States Office o f Management and Budget, 1997 Edition, would be included in Sector 11, 31, 32, or 33. E. The General Assembly of Virginia finds that job creation is essential to the continued fiscal health of the Commonwealth. In this modern economy, states often compete for quality manufacturing jobs. Accordingly, the provisions of this section relating to manufactur ing companies that increase their employment in Virginia are integral to the purpose of the election allowed pursuant to this section. If any provision of this section is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall not be deemed severable. F. Any eligibl e company, as defined in § 58.1-405.1, that elects to apportion its income pursuant to subsection A may subtract the value of its sales in the Commonwealth during the taxable year from the numerator of the ratio in subdivision A 3. Such eligible compa ny may make such modification for the taxable year in which it first becomes eligible and for the six subsequent, consecutive taxable years, except for any year in which the eligible companys (i) total, cumulative new capital investment falls below t he applicable initial threshold or (ii) number of new jobs falls below the applicable initial threshold.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no electricity generator shall be allowed more than a $3-per-ton coal tax credit and shall be subject to all limitations set forth in § 58.1-400.2. In no event shall the credit allowed hereunder exceed the total amount of tax liability of such taxpayer.

The allocation of the $3-per-ton credit may be provided in the contract between such parties for the sale of such coal. Such allocation may be amended by th e execution of a written instrument by the parties prior to December 31 of the year of purchase of such coal. Such contracts and written instruments shall be subject to audit by the Department of Taxation to ensure the proper application of credits.In no case shall the credit allocated for each such ton of coal among such electricity generators and such persons with an economic interest in coal exceed $3 per ton.All credits earned on or after January 1, 2006, but before January 1, 2022, that are allocat ed to persons with an economic interest in coal as provided under this subsection may be used as tax credits by such persons against the tax imposed by § 58.1-400 and any other tax imposed by the Commonwealth.

The portion of the $1,000 credit earne d with respect to any qualified full-time employee who is employed in the Commonwealth for less than 12 full months during the credit year will be determined by multiplying the credit amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full mon ths that the qualified full-time employee worked for the major business facility in the Commonwealth during the credit year, and the denominator of which is 12. A separate credit year and a three-year allowance period shall exist for each distinct major business facility of a single taxpayer, except for credits allowed for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, when a two-year allowance period shall exist for each distinct major business facility of a single taxpayer. H. The amount of credit allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed the tax imposed for such taxable year. Any credit not usable for the taxable year the credit was allowed may be, to the extent usable, carried over for the next 10 succeeding taxable years. No c redit shall be carried back to a preceding taxable year. In the event that a taxpayer who is subject to the tax limitation imposed pursuant to this subsection is allowed another credit pursuant to any other section of the Code of Virginia, or has a credi t carryover from a preceding taxable year, such taxpayer shall be considered to have first utilized any credit allowed which does not have a carryover provision, and then any credit which is carried forward from a preceding taxable year, prior to the uti lization of any credit allowed pursuant to this section. I. No credit s hall be earned pursuant to this section for any employee (i) for whom a credit under this section was previously earned by a related party as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 267(b) or a trade or business under common control as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 52(b); (ii) who was previously employed in the same job function in Virginia by a related party as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 267(b) or a trade or business under common control as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 52(b); (iii) whose job function was previously performed at a different location in Virginia by an employee of the taxpayer, a related party as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 267(b), or a trade or business under common control as defined by Internal Reve nue Code § 52(b); or (iv) whose job function previously qualified for a credit under this section at a different major business facility on behalf of the taxpayer, a related party as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 267(b), or a trade or business under common control as defined by Internal Revenue Code § 52(b). J. Subject to the provisions of subsections K or L, recapture of this credit, under the following circumstances, shall be accomplished by increasing the tax in any of the five years succeeding the taxable year in which a credit has been earned pursuant to this section if the number of qualified full-time employees decreases below the average number of qualified full-time employees employed during the credit year. Such tax increase amount shall be determined by (i) recomputing the credit which would have been earned f or the original credit year using the decreased number of qualified full-time employees and (ii) subtracting such recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously earned. In the event that the average number of qualifying full-time employees employ ed at a major business facility falls below the threshold amount in any of the five taxable years succeeding the credit year, all credits earned with respect to such major business facility shall be recaptured. No credit amount will be recaptured more th an once pursuant to this subsection. Any recapture pursuant to this section shall reduce credits earned but not yet allowed, and credits allowed but carried forward, before the taxpayers tax liability may be increased. K. In the even t that a major business facility is located in an economically distressed area or in an enterprise zone as defined in Chapter 49 (§ 59.1-538 et seq.) of Title 59.1 during a credit year, the threshold amount required to qualify for a credit pursuant to this section and to avoid full recapture shall be reduced from 50 to 25 for purposes of subdivision C 1 and subsection J. An area shall qualify as economically distressed if it is a city or county with an unemployment rate for the preceding year of at l east 0.5 percent higher than the average statewide unemployment rate for such year.

For purposes of this section, (i) Virginia tax basis means the aggregate adjusted boo k basis less the aggregate adjusted tax basis of such assets as recorded on the companys books of accounts as of the last day of the tax year immediately preceding the adjustment date and (ii) adjustment date means the first day of the tax ye ar in which such pipeline distribution company, gas utility, gas supplier or electric supplier becomes subject to the tax imposed by § 58.1-400.2 A.

Gain or loss on the disposition or retirement of any such asset shall be computed using its adjusted federal tax basis, and the amortization of the Virginia tax basis shall continue thereafter withou t adjustment. The Department of Taxation shall promulgate regulations describing a reasonable method of allocating the Virginia tax basis in the event that a portion of the operations of a pipeline distribution company, gas utility, gas supplier or elect ric supplier are separated, spun-off, transferred to a separate company or otherwise disaggregated. For gas suppliers, pipeline distribution companies or gas utilities which are required to file an income tax return for a short taxable year pursuant to s ubsection E of § 58.1-400.2, a portion of the amortized Virginia tax basis will be disallowed based on the proration in computing Virginia taxable income. Such portion will be recovered as a deduction in the first taxable year after which this deducti on is no longer applicable. For rate-making and accounting purposes, the State Corporation Commission shall not require a pipeline distribution company or gas utility to amortize these deferred ta xes over a period other than the thirty-year period prescribed herein, nor shall the State Corporation Commission require the treatment of accelerated depreciation different from that allowed for federal income taxes.

CASE NOTES Fatal variance did not exist in embezzlement prosecution based on failure to pay over withheld taxes.  Although an appeals court erred in concluding that defendant had waived a variance claim, because the record showed that defendant sufficiently raised the issue i n the trial court, the error was harmless because no fatal variance existed in defendants case: (1) defendant was convicted of embezzlement under § 18.2-111 based on evidence showing that he had withheld taxes from his employees paychecks but he had not paid over the withheld amount to the Commonwealth of Virginia, as required by § 58.1-472; (2) defendant claimed a variance existed because his indictments defined the crime as embezzling funds belonging to the Commonwealth, but a jury instr uction defined the crime as embezzling funds belonging to the employees; (3) the jury instruction merely identified the funds at issue and did not contradict the indictments allegation as to the statutory owner of the withheld taxes, i.e., the Common wealth; and (4) no fatal variance occurred because the ownership of the funds was not a matter for jury determination in defendants case. George v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 767, 667 S.E.2d 779, 2008 Va. LEXIS 125 (2008). Failure to pay over withheld taxes can support embezzlement conviction.  Defendants evidentiary insufficiency challenge to his § 18.2-111 embezzlement convictions was properly rejected: (1) the Commonwealth of Virginia showed th at defendant placed taxes withheld from his employees wages in the bank account that he used for paying his personal and business expenses, that he failed to pay over the withheld taxes to the Commonwealth as required by § 58.1-472, and that at ti mes the balance in defendants bank account was less than the amount of the withheld taxes; (2) defendant argued that § 18.2-111 required proof that he lawfully acquired possession of anothers property and then wrongfully converted it to his ow n use, but that the funds at issue were his own funds and that he had merely a debtor-creditor relationship with the Commonwealth with regard to the withheld taxes; (3) § 58.1-474 was similar to 26 U.S.C.S. § 7501, which the U.S. Supreme Court had held created a statutory trust on behalf of the federal government and deprived employers of any equitable interest that they might claim in taxes that were withheld from their employees salaries; (4) there was nothing that limited § 58.1-474 to c ivil matters or prevented the Commonwealth from relying on that statute to criminally prosecute an employer who failed to pay over the withheld taxes; and (5) because § 58.1-474 imposed a statutorily-created trust on the funds that defendant withheld from his employees wages for state income tax liability purposes, and those funds were considered to be held in trust for the benefit of the Commonwealth and were not defendants property, his receipt of the withheld taxes could be used to prove t hat he had received money for another, which was a required element of embezzlement under § 18.2-111.

Annotations CASE NOTES Property held in trust for t he Commonwealth.  Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction for general embezzlement under § 18.2-111 for not paying state withholding tax that defendant with held from defendants employees in defendants bank account. Pursuant to § 58.1-474, defendant was not merely a debtor of the Commonwealth when defendant withheld that money, but, instead, defendant held the property of another because that stat ute said that defendant held that money in trust for the Commonwealth. George v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 137, 655 S.E.2d 43, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 12, aff'd, 276 Va. 767, 667 S.E.2d 779, 2008 Va. LEXIS 125 (2008). Thus, failure to pay over withheld taxes can be used to prove embezzlement.  This section imposes a statutorily-created trust on funds withheld by employers from employees wages for state income tax liability purposes. Because such fun ds are held in trust for the benefit of the Commonwealth of Virginia and are not the property of the employer, an employers retention of such funds can give rise to a criminal prosecution for embezzlement under § 18.2-111, which requires the fraud ulent use, disposition, concealment or embezzlement of money received for another by virtue of ones employment.

For 2007 annual survey article, Taxation, see 42 U. Rich. L. Rev. 515 (2007). § 58.1-486.2. Withholding tax on Virginia source income of nonresident owners. Text A. For the pri vilege of doing business in the Commonwealth, a pass-through entity that has taxable income for the taxable year derived from or connected with Virginia sources, any portion of which is allocable to a nonresident owner, shall pay a withholding tax under this section, except as provided in subsection C. B. 1. The amount of withholding tax payable by any pass-through entity under this article shall be equal to five percent of the nonresident owners share of income from Virginia sources of all nonresident owners as determined under this chapter, which may lawfully be taxed by the Commonwealth and which is allocable to a nonresident owner. 2. When determining the amount of withholding tax due under this section, the pass-through entity may apply any tax credits allowable under the Code of Virginia to the pass-through entity that pass through to nonresident owners; provided that in no event may the application of any credit or credits reduce the tax liability of any nonresident owner under this article to less than zero. C. Withholding shall not be required: 1. For a ny nonresident owner, other than a nonresident corporation, who is exempt from the tax imposed by this article. An owner shall be exempt from the tax imposed by this article only if the owner is, by reason of the owners purpose or activities, exempt from paying federal income taxes on the owners Virginia source income. The pass-through entity may rely on the written statement of the owner claiming to be exempt from the tax imposed by this article provided the pass-through entity discloses the na me and federal taxpayer identification number for all such owners in its return for the taxable year filed under § 58.1-392; 2. For any nonresident owner that is a corporation that is exempt from the tax imposed by Article 10 (§ 58.1-400 et seq.). For purposes of this subdivision, a corporation is exempt fro m the tax imposed by Article 10 only if the corporation, by reason of its purpose or activities, is exempt from paying federal income taxes on the corporations Virginia source income. The pass-through entity may rely on the written statement of the p erson claiming to be exempt from the tax imposed by Article 10 provided the pass-through entity discloses the name and federal taxpayer identification number for all such corporations in its return for the taxable year filed under § 58.1-392; 3. When compliance will cause undue hardship on the pass-through entity. However, no pass-through entity shall be exempt under this subdivision from complying with the withholding require ments of this section unless the Tax Commissioner, in his discretion, approves in writing the pass-through entitys written petition for exemption from the withholding requirements of this section based on undue hardship. The Tax Commissioner may pres cribe the form and contents of such a petition and specify standards for when a pass-through entity will not be required to comply with the withholding requirements of this section due to undue hardship. The standards for undue hardship, determined by th e Tax Commissioner in his discretion, shall take into account (among other relevant factors) the ability of a pass-through entity to comply at reasonable cost with the withholding requirements of this section and the cost to the Commonwealth of collectin g the tax directly from a nonresident owner who does not voluntarily file a return and pay the amount of tax due under this chapter with respect to his allocable Virginia taxable income; or 4. For any nonresident person of the Commonwealth when the pass-through entity owns and leases four or fewer dwelling units in the Commonwealth, provided the pass-through entity discloses the name and federal taxpayer identification number for all such owners in its return for the taxable year filed under § 58.1-392. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term person shall mean the same as that term is defined in § 55.1- 1200. D. 1. Each pass-through entity required to withhold tax under this section shall pay the a mount required to be withheld to the Tax Commissioner at the same time that the return under Article 9 (§ 58.1-390.1 et seq.), if required, is to be filed. 2. An extension of time for filing the return under § 58.1-393.1 shall not extend the time for paying the amount of withholding tax due under this section. In cases of an extension of time for filing, the pass-through entity shall pay, by the due date specified in subsection A of § 58.1-392, at least 90 percent of the withholding tax due for the taxable year or 100 percent of the tax paid under this section for the prior taxable ye ar, if that taxable year was a taxable year of 12 months and tax was paid under this section for that taxable year. The remaining portion of the tax due under this section, if any, shall be paid at the time the pass-through entity files the return requir ed under § 58.1-392. If the balance due is paid by the last day of the extension period for filing such return and the amount of tax due with that return is 10 percent or less of the tax due under this section for the taxable year, no penalty shall be imposed with respect to the balance so remitted. In addition to interest, if the underestimation of the balance of tax due exceeds 10 percent of the actual tax liability, there shall be added to the tax as a penalty an amount equal to two percent per mo nth of the balance of tax due for each month or fraction thereof from the original due date for the filing of the withholding tax return to the date of payment. If the amount of withholding tax due under this section for the taxable year is less than the estimated withholding taxes paid for the taxable year by the pass-through entity, the excess shall be refunded to the pass-through entity or, at its election, established as a credit against withholding tax due under this section for the then current ta xable year. 3. The Tax Commissioner may, if he believes it necessary for the protection of trust fund moneys due the Commonwealth, require any pass-through entity to pay over to the Tax Commissioner the tax deducted and withheld under this section at any earlier time or times. E. 1. Each nonresident owner shall be allowed a credit for that owners share of the ta x withheld by the pass-through entity under this section; provided, that when the distribution is to a corporation taxable under Article 10 (§ 58.1-400 et seq.), the credit allowed by this subsection shall be applied against the corporations liabi lity for tax under this chapter. 2. A nonresident owners share of any withholding tax paid by the pass-through entity shall be treated as distributed to such nonresident owner on the earlier of (i) the day on which s uch tax was paid to the Tax Commissioner by the pass-through entity or (ii) the last day of the taxable year for which such tax was paid by the pass-through entity. F. 1. Every pass-through entity required to deduct and withhold tax under this section sha ll furnish to each nonresident owner a written statement, as prescribed by the Tax Commissioner, showing (i) the amount of its allocable Virginia taxable income, whether or not distributed for federal income tax purposes by such pass-through entity to su ch nonresident owner; (ii) the amount deducted and withheld as tax under this section; and (iii) such other information as the Tax Commissioner may require. 2. A copy of the written statements required by this subsection shall be filed with the Virginia return filed under § 58.1-392 by the pass-through entity for its taxable year to which the distribution relates. The written statement shall be furnished to each nonresident owner on or before the due date of the pass-through entitys return under § 58.1-392 for the taxable year, including extensions of time for filing such return, o r a later date as may be allowed by the Tax Commissioner. G. Every pass- through entity required to deduct and withhold tax under this section is hereby made liable for the payment of the tax due under this section for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2008.

In the case of married individuals, a single declaration under this section may be made by them jointly, in which case the liability with respect to the estimated tax shall be joint and several.

The amount of such addition to the tax shall be reported and paid at the time of filing the individual income tax return or the fiduciary income tax return for the taxable year.The amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of: 1. The a mount of the installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to ninety percent (sixty-six and two-thirds percent in the case of an individual referred to in § 58.1-490 F, relating to income from farming) of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year, or if no return was filed, ninety percent (sixty-six and two-thirds percent in the case of individuals referred to in § 58.1-490 F, relating to income from farming) of the tax for such year; or 100 percent of the t ax shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, whichever is less, over 2.

Deeds of Easement to Local Government for Natural Open Space, Conservation or Rural Preservation, et seq. CASE NOTES Conservation easement interpretati on.  By leaving the strict construction principle in force with the passage of the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, the legislature must have viewed this principle as an appropriate additional incentive for those who draft the conservation easements to achieve clarity in light of the fact that they are subject to enforcement in perpetuity, and this is equally true of the constitutional policy to protect the environ ment, the Open Space Land Act, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, and the Virginia Land Conservation Incentives Act of 1999; like the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, none of these provisions address in any way the interpretive principles to be applied to a conservation easement.

For such conveyances made on or after January 1, 2007, the tax credit shall be 40 percent of the fair market value of the land or interest in land so conveyed. 2. a. If the Commonwealth or an instrumentality thereof operates a facility on a conveyance, including charging fees for the use of such facility, such operation shall not disqualify the conveyance from eligibility for the tax credit, so long as any fees are used for conservation or preservation purposes. b. If the Commonwealth or an instrumentality thereof enters into an agreement with a third party to lease or manage a facility on a conveyance, the fact that such third party is oper ated primarily as a business with intent for profit shall not disqualify the conveyance from eligibility for the tax credit, so long as such agreement is for conservation or preservation purposes.

Any appraisal that, upon audit by the Department, is determined to be false or fraudulent, may be disregarded by the Department in determining the fair market value of the property and the amount of tax credit to be allowed under this sect ion.

The preservation, agricultural preservation, historic preservation or similar use and purpose of such property shall be assured in perpetuity. In the case of conveyances of a fee inter est to a charitable organization that is a holder as defined in § 10.1-1009, the credit shall not be allowed until the charitable organization agrees that subsequent conveyances of the fee interest in the property will be (i) subject to a prev ious conveyance in perpetuity of a conservation easement, as that term is defined in § 10.1-1009, or subject to the conveyance in perpetuity of an open-space easement, as that term is defined in § 10.1-1700, or (ii) conveyed to the Commonwealth of Virginia or to a federal conservation agency.

Any taxpaye r claiming a tax credit under this article shall not claim a credit under any similar Virginia law for costs related to the same project. To the extent a credit is taken in accordance with this article, no subtraction allowed for the gain on the sale of (i) land dedicated to open-space use or (ii) an easement dedicated to open-space use under subdivision 14 of § 58.1-322.02 shall be allowed for three years following the year in which the credit is taken. Any building which serves as the basis, in who le or in part, of a tax credit under this article shall not serve as the basis of the tax credit allowed under § 58.1-339.2 for a period of five years following the donation on which the credit is based; and any building which serves as the basis for the tax credit allowed under § 58.1-339.2 shall not serve as the basis, in whole or in part, for a tax credit under this article for a period of five years following the completion of the rehabilitation project on which the credit is based. B. Any tax cre dits that arise under this article from the donation of land or an interest in land made by a pass-through tax entity such as a trust, estate, partnership, limited liability company or partnership, limited partnership, subchapter S corporation or other f iduciary shall be used either by such entity if it is the taxpayer on behalf of such entity or by the member, manager, partner, shareholder or beneficiary, as the case may be, in proportion to their interest in such entity in the event that income, deduc tions and tax liability pass through such entity to such member, manager, partner, shareholder or beneficiary or as set forth in the agreement of said entity. Such tax credits shall not be claimed by both the entity and the member, manager, partner, shar eholder or beneficiary for the same donation. C. 1. Any taxpayer holding a credit under this article may transfer unused but otherwise a llowable credit for use by another taxpayer on Virginia income tax returns. A taxpayer who transfers any amount of credit under this article shall file a notification of such transfer to the Department in accordance with procedures and forms prescribed b y the Tax Commissioner. 2. A fee of two percent of the value of the donated interest shall be imposed upon any transfer arising from the sale by any taxpayer of credits under this article and upon the distributi on of a portion of credits under this article to a member, manager, partner, shareholder or beneficiary pursuant to subsection B. The two percent fee shall not apply to a distribution of credits to a nonresident owner of a pass-through entity when such c redits are applied by the pass-through entity to the withholding tax pursuant to subdivision B 2 of § 58.1-486.2. Revenues generated by such fees first shall be used by the Department of Taxation and the Department of Conservation and Recreation for t heir costs in implementing this article but in no event shall such amount exceed 50 percent of the total revenue generated by the fee on an annual basis. The remainder of such revenues shall be transferred to the Virginia Land Conservation Fund for distr ibution to the public or private conservation agencies or organizations, excluding federal governmental entities, that are responsible for enforcing the conservation and preservation purposes of the donated interests. Distribution of such revenues shall be made annually by the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation proportionally based on a three-year average of the number of donated interests accepted by the public or private conservation agencies or organizations, excluding federal governmental entitie s, during the immediately preceding three-year period. 3. If the individual taxpayer who originally earned the tax credit holds unused credit under this article, he may provide through a will, bequest, or other instrument of transfer that, up on his death, his unused credit shall be transferred to a designated beneficiary. If such taxpayer dies without a will, his unused credit shall be transferred to the next person who is eligible to receive according to the rules of intestate succession as described in § 64.2-200; however, if two or more persons are eligible to receive according to such rules, the administrator of the taxpayers estate shall choose one such person to whom to transfer such taxpayers unused credit. The two percent fee described in subdivision 2 shall not apply to a transfer of unused credits pursuant to this subdivision. The carryover period for such transferred credits shall not be extended; instead, such credits shall be subject to the original carryover period as determined pursuant to subdivision C 1 of § 58.1-512. D. To the exte nt included in and not otherwise subtracted from federal adjusted gross income pursuant to § 58.1-322.02 or federal taxable income pursuant to § 58.1-402, there shall be subtracted any amount of gain or income recognized by a taxpayer on the applic ation of a tax credit under this article against a Virginia income tax liability. E. The transfe r of the credit and its application against a tax liability shall not create gain or loss for the transferor or the transferee of such credit. F. A pass-thro ugh tax entity, such as a partnership, limited liability company or Subchapter S corporation, may appoint a tax matters representative, who shall be a general partner, member/manager or shareholder, and register that representative with the Tax Commissio ner. The Tax Commissioner shall be entitled to deal with the tax matters representative as representative of the taxpayers to whom credits have been allocated or transferred by the entity under this article with respect to those credits. In the event a p ass-through tax entity allocates or transfers tax credits arising under this article to its partners, members or shareholders and the allocated or transferred credits shall be disallowed, in whole or in part, such that an assessment of additional tax aga inst a taxpayer shall be made, the Tax Commissioner shall first make written demand for payment of any additional tax, together with interest and penalties, from the tax matters representative. In the event such payment demand is not satisfied, the Tax C ommissioner shall proceed to collection against the taxpayers in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18 (§ 58.1-1800 et seq.).

Annotations CASE NOTES Setoff pursuant to § 58.1-535.  Because § 58.1-535 permitted a claimant agency, in compliance with the provisions of that statute, to set off a monetary judgment debt, and the Setoff Debt Col lection Act, § 58.1-520 et seq., was not limited in application to tax refunds, the circuit court erred in failing to mark a judgment between a university, as the claimant agency, and a judgment debtor as satisfied when it was undisputed that the cred itor owed the university more than the amount of the judgment entered.

Within 30 d ays after the decision of the claimant agency upon a hearing pursuant to § 58.1-526 has become final, the debtor aggrieved thereby may secure judicial review thereof by commencing an action in the circuit court of the county or of the city, or if the city has no circuit court, then in the circuit court of the county in which such city is geographically located, in which the debtor resides or in which the principal office of the claimant agency is geographically located. In such action against the cla imant agency for review of its decision, the claimant agency shall be named a defendant in a petition for judicial review. This section shall not be construed to confer jurisdiction on the circuit court to review questions of federal income tax law when the claimant agency is the Internal Revenue Service. B. Such petiti on shall also state the grounds upon which review is sought and shall be served upon the head of the claimant agency or upon such person as the claimant agency may designate. With its answer, the claimant agency shall certify and file with the court all documents and papers and a transcript of all testimony taken in the matter, together with its findings of fact and decision therein. In any judicial proceedings under this article, the findings of the claimant agency as to the facts shall be sustained if supported by the evidence. Such actions and the questions so certified shall be heard in a summary manner at the earliest possible date. An appeal may be taken from the decision of such court to the Court of Appeals in conformity with the general law go verning appeals in equity cases. C. It shall no t be necessary in any proceeding under this section to enter exceptions to the rulings of the claimant agency, and no bond shall be required upon an appeal to any court. D. Notwithstan ding the other provisions of this section, if the claimant agency is otherwise subject to the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.), appeals of such agencys decision as it relates to the debtor shall be held in accordance with Article 5 (§ 2.2-4025 et seq.) of the Administrative Process Act.

Annotations Editors note. Acts 2019, cc. 815 and 816, cl. 4, and Acts 2019, c. 854, cl. 10, repealed Acts 2013, c. 766, cl. 7, which made former subdivision 5 contingent on the federal government enacting legislation that grants states that meet minimum simplification requirements specified in such legislation the authority to compel remote retailers to collect sales and use tax on sales made into the respective state. Acts 2019, cc. 815 and 816, cl. 5 provides: That nothing in this act shall be construed to appropriate or transfer any transportation revenues for non transpo rtation purposes pursuant to the twenty-second enactment of Chapter 896 of the Acts of Assembly of 2007 or the fourteenth enactment of Chapter 766 of the Acts of Assembly of 2013. Acts 2019, cc. 815 and 816, cl. 6 provides: That the provisions of this act requiring re-mote sales and use tax collection by remote sellers and marketplace f acilitators shall not apply to any retail sales transactions occurring before July 1, 2019; however, transactions occurring before July 1, 2019, may be included in the calculation of gross revenue or retail trans-actions pursuant to the provisions of sub divisions C 10 and 11 of § 58.1-612 of the Code of Virginia, as amended by this act.

Most of the cases below were decided under prior law. The primary purpose of the use tax is to prevent the sales tax from placing Virginia ret ailers at a competitive disadvantage with retailers outside Virginia. Commonwealth, Dep't of Taxation v. Miller-Morton Co., 220 Va. 852, 263 S.E.2d 413, 1980 Va. LEXIS 176 (1980). The only necessity for the use tax provisions is to include within the sales tax those sales transactions which occur outside of the state but are to be used within the State by the purchaser. United States v. Forst, 442 F. Supp. 920, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17855 (W.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 569 F.2d 811, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12934 (4th C ir. 1978). A sale is a necessary event before the sales and use tax can be imposed. United States v. Forst, 442 F. Supp. 920, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17855 (W.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 569 F.2d 811, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12934 (4th Cir. 1978). And the tax is imposed only on the purchaser of the sale. United States v. Forst, 442 F. Supp. 920, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17855 (W.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 569 F.2d 811, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12934 (4th Cir. 1978). The legal incidence of the Virginia sales and use tax is on the purchaser. Although the seller is legally obligated to collect the tax from the purchaser, the sta tute makes the tax the legal debt of the purchaser. United States v. Forst, 442 F. Supp. 920, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17855 (W.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 569 F.2d 811, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12934 (4th Cir. 1978). The sales and use tax was constitutionally assessed to a contractor of the federal government as purchaser of tangible personal property even though the United States held title after delivery, bore the risk before delivery and exercised substantial control over procurement under the contract, since only the credit of the contractor was pledged in the purchasing agreement. United States v. Forst, 442 F. Supp. 920, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17855 (W.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 569 F.2d 811, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12934 (4th Cir. 1978). In deciding whether the United States or its contractor was the purchaser of tangible personal property subjected to the sales and use tax, the key factor is whos e credit, between the United States and the contractor, was bound by the purchasing agreement with the seller. It was not critical who holds title to the purchased goods, nor was the degree of control over the contractor that the United States exercised with respect to the purchases critical. United States v. Forst, 442 F. Supp. 920, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17855 (W.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 569 F.2d 811, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12934 (4th Cir. 1978). Where private hospital operating for profit purchased bulk drugs from wholesalers and ma nufacturers for use in the performance of its service as a hospital, this constituted the first instance of use on which the tax was imposed. The tax attached when the hospital, as purchaser, took possession of the drugs within the State. Commonwealth, D ep't of Taxation v. Bluefield Sanitarium, Inc., 216 Va. 686, 222 S.E.2d 526, 1976 Va. LEXIS 186 (1976). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Use tax did not apply to services or fabrication.  Sale under § 58.1-602 was defined to include fabrication, and the Virginia state use tax did not apply to services or fabrication; the Commonwealth imp roperly assessed a use tax on a taxpayer relating to a transaction wherein the taxpayer arranged for a subcontractor to come to a building site to crush shot rock from the site into gravel for use in site preparation. Hardaway Constr. Corp. v. Commonweal th, 69 Va. Cir. 59, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 345 (Richmond July 8, 2005). Use tax improper as to deliverer of calcium chloride to department of transportation.  Because the legislature did not intend for § 58.1-604 to apply to a transaction where the company did not purchase or sell calcium chloride but was merely cont racted by the third party to deliver the calcium chloride, and the Department of Transportation was the purchaser of the calcium chloride, subsection B of § 58.1-610 was inapplicable.

Cir. 231, 200...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_58.1-605"><akn:num>§ 58.1-605</akn:num><akn:heading>To what extent and under what conditions cities and counties may levy local sales taxes; collection thereof by Commonwealth and return of revenue t o each city or county entitled thereto</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. No county, city or town shall impose any local general sales or use tax or any local general retail sales or use tax except as authorized by this section or § 58.1-605.1. B. The council of any city and the governing body of any county may levy a general retail sales tax at the rate of one percent to provide revenue for the general fund of such city or county. Such tax shall be added to the rate of the state sales tax imposed by § § 58.1-603 and 58.1-604 and shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations published with respect thereto. No discount under § 58.1-622 shall be allowed on a local sales tax. C. 1. The council of any city and the governing body of any county desiring to impose a lo cal sales tax under this section may do so by the adoption of an ordinance stating its purpose and referring to this section, and providing that such ordinance shall be effective on the first day of a month at least 60 days after its adoption. A certifie d copy of such ordinance shall be forwarded to the Tax Commissioner so that it will be received within five days after its adoption. 2. Prior to any change in the rate of any local sales and use tax, the Tax Commissioner shall provide remote sellers with at least 30 days notice. Any change in the rate of any local sales and use tax shall only become effective on the first day of a calendar quarter. Failure to provide notice pursuant to this section shall require the Commonwealth and the locality to apply the preceding effective rate until 30 days after notificatio n is provided. D. Any local s ales tax levied under this section shall be administered and collected by the Tax Commissioner in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as provided for the state sales tax. E. All local s ales tax moneys collected by the Tax Commissioner under this section shall be paid into the state treasury to the credit of a special fund which is hereby created on the Comptrollers books under the name Collections of Local Sales Taxes. Such local sales tax moneys shall be credited to the account of each particular city or county levying a local sales tax under this section. The basis of such credit shall be the city or county in which the sales were made as shown by the records of the Depa rtment and certified by it monthly to the Comptroller, namely, the city or county of location of each place of business of every dealer paying the tax to the Commonwealth without regard to the city or county of possible use by the purchasers. If a dealer has any place of business located in more than one political subdivision by reason of the boundary line or lines passing through such place of business, the amount of sales tax paid by such a dealer with respect to such place of business shall be treate d for the purposes of this section as follows: one-half shall be assignable to each political subdivision where two are involved, one-third where three are involved, and one-fourth where four are involved. F. As soon as practicable after the local sales tax moneys have been paid into the state treasury in any month for the preceding month, the Comptroller shall draw his warrant on the Treasurer of Virginia in the proper amount in favor of each city or county entitled to the monthly return of its local sales tax moneys, and such payments shall be charged to the account of each such city or county under the special fund created by this section. If errors are made in any such payment, or adjustments are otherwise necessar y, whether attributable to refunds to taxpayers, or to some other fact, the errors shall be corrected and adjustments made in the payments for the next two months as follows: one-half of the total adjustment shall be included in the payments for the next two months. In addition, the payment shall include a refund of amounts erroneously not paid to the city or county and not previously refunded during the three years preceding the discovery of the error. A correction and adjustment in payments described in this subsection due to the misallocation of funds by the dealer shall be made within three years of the date of the payment error. G. Such paymen ts to counties are subject to the qualification that in any county wherein is situated any incorporated town constituting a special school district and operated as a separate school district under a town school board of three members appointed by the tow n council, the county treasurer shall pay into the town treasury for general governmental purposes the proper proportionate amount received by him in the ratio that the school age population of such town bears to the school age population of the entire c ounty. If the school age population of any town constituting a separate school district is increased by the annexation of territory since the last estimate of school age population provided by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, such increase sh all, for the purposes of this section, be added to the school age population of such town as shown by the last such estimate and a proper reduction made in the school age population of the county or counties from which the annexed territory was acquired. H. One-half of such payments to counties are subject to the further qualification, other than as set out in subsection G, that in any county wherein is situated any incorporated town not constituting a separate special school district that has complied with its charte r provisions providing for the election of its council and mayor for a period of at least four years immediately prior to the adoption of the sales tax ordinance, the county treasurer shall pay into the town treasury of each such town for general governm ental purposes the proper proportionate amount received by him in the ratio that the school age population of each such town bears to the school age population of the entire county, based on the latest estimate provided by the Weldon Cooper Center for Pu blic Service. The preceding requirement pertaining to the time interval between compliance with election provisions and adoption of the sales tax ordinance shall not apply to a tier-city. If the school age population of any such town not constituting a s eparate special school district is increased by the annexation of territory or otherwise since the last estimate of school age population provided by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, such increase shall, for the purposes of this section, be a dded to the school age population of such town as shown by the last such estimate and a proper reduction made in the school age population of the county or counties from which the annexed territory was acquired. I. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection H, the board of supervisors of a county may, in its discretion, appropriate funds to any incorporated town not constituting a separate school district within such county that has not complied with the provisions of its c harter relating to the elections of its council and mayor, an amount not to exceed the amount it would have received from the tax imposed by this chapter if such election had been held; however, Charlotte County, Gloucester County, Halifax County, Henry County, Mecklenburg County, Northampton County, Patrick County, and Pittsylvania County may appropriate any amount to any such incorporated town. J. It is furth er provided that if any incorporated town which would otherwise be eligible to receive funds from the county treasurer under subsection G or H be located in a county that does not levy a general retail sales tax under the provisions of this law, such tow n may levy a general retail sales tax at the rate of one percent to provide revenue for the general fund of the town, subject to all the provisions of this section generally applicable to cities and counties. Any tax levied under the authority of this su bsection shall in no case continue to be levied on or after the effective date of a county ordinance imposing a general retail sales tax in the county within which such town is located.

The council of any city and the governing body of any county which has levied or may hereafter levy a city or county sales tax under § 58.1-605 may levy a city or county use tax at the rate of one percent to provide revenue for the general fund of such city or c ounty. Such tax shall be added to the rate of the state use tax imposed by this chapter and shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter, and all amendments thereof, and the rules and regulations published with respect thereto, except that no d iscount under § 58.1-622 shall be allowed on a local use tax. B. The council of any city and the governing body of any county desiring to impose a local use tax under this section may do so in the manner following: 1. If th e city or county has previously imposed the local sales tax authorized by § 58.1-605, the local use tax may be imposed by the council or governing body by the adoption of a resolution by a majority of all the members thereof, by a recorded yea and nay vote, stating its purpose and referring to this section, and providing that the local use tax shall become effective on the first day of a month at least 60 days after the adoption of the resolution. A certified copy of such resolution shall be forwarde d to the Tax Commissioner so that it will be received within five days after its adoption. The resolution authorized by this paragraph may be adopted in the manner stated notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any charter provision. 2. If the city or county has not imposed the local sales tax authorized by § 58.1-605, the local use tax may be imposed by ordinance together with the local sales tax in the manner set out in subsections B and C of § 58.1-605. C. Any local u se tax levied under this section shall be administered and collected by the Tax Commissioner in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as provided for the state use tax. D. The local u se tax authorized by this section shall not apply to transactions to which the sales tax applies, the situs of which for state and local sales tax purposes is the city or county of location of each place of business of every dealer paying the tax to the Commonwealth without regard to the city or county of possible use by the purchasers. However, the local use tax authorized by this section shall apply to tangible personal property purchased without this Commonwealth for use or consumption within the cit y or county imposing the local use tax, or stored within the city or county for use or consumption, where the property would have been subject to the sales tax if it had been purchased within this Commonwealth. The local use tax shall also apply to lease s or rentals of tangible personal property where the place of business of the lessor is without this Commonwealth and such leases or rentals are subject to the state tax. Moreover, the local use tax shall apply in all cases in which the state use tax app lies. E. Out-of-stat e dealers who hold certificates of registration to collect the use tax from their customers for remittance to this Commonwealth shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, in filing their monthly use tax returns with the Tax Commissioner, break down the ir shipments into this Commonwealth by cities and counties so as to show the city or county of destination. If, however, the out-of-state dealer is unable accurately to assign any shipment to a particular city or county, the local use tax on the tangible personal property involved shall be remitted to the Commonwealth by such dealer without attempting to assign the shipment to any city or county. F. Local use t ax revenue shall be distributed among the cities and counties for which it is collected, respectively, as shown by the records of the Department, and the procedure shall be the same as that prescribed for distribution of local sales tax revenue under § 58.1-605. The local use tax revenue that is not accurately assignable to a particular city or county shall be distributed monthly by the appropriate state authorities among the cities and counties in this Commonwealth imposing the local use tax upon the basis of taxable retail sales in the respective cities and counties in which the local sales and use tax was in effect in the taxable month involved, as shown by the records of the Department, and computed with respect to taxable retail sales as ref lected by the amounts of the local sales tax revenue distributed among such cities and counties, respectively, in the month of distribution. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Tax Commissioner shall develop a uniform method to distr ibute local use tax. Any significant changes to the method of local use tax distribution shall be phased in over a five-year period. Distribution information shall be shared with the affected localities prior to implementation of the changes. G. All local u se tax revenue shall be used, applied or disbursed by the cities and counties as provided in § 58.1-605 with respect to local sales tax revenue. History History.

All sales o r leases are subject to the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a sale, distribution, lease, or storage of tangible personal property is not taxable is upon the dealer unless he takes from the taxpayer a certificate to the e ffect that the property is exempt under this chapter. However, the sale or distribution of cigarettes shall be subject to the provisions of § 58.1-623.2 and require a cigarette exemption certificate issued pursuant to § 58.1-623.2. B. The certifi cate mentioned in this section shall relieve the person who takes such certificate from any liability for the payment or collection of the tax, except upon notice from the Tax Commissioner that such certificate is no longer acceptable. Such certificate s hall be signed by and bear the name and address of the taxpayer; shall indicate the number of the certificate of registration, if any, issued to the taxpayer; shall indicate the general character of the tangible personal property sold, distributed, lease d, or stored, or to be sold, distributed, leased, or stored under a blanket exemption certificate; and shall be substantially in such form as the Tax Commissioner may prescribe. If an exemption pertains to a nonprofit organization, other than a nonprofit church, that has qualified for a sales and use tax exemption under § 58.1-609.11, the exemption certificate shall be valid until the scheduled expiration date stated on the exemption certificate. C. If a taxpay er who gives a certificate under this section makes any use of the property other than an exempt use or retention, demonstration, or display while holding the property for resale, distribution, or lease in the regular course of business, such use shall b e deemed a taxable sale by the taxpayer as of the time the property or service is first used by him, and the cost of the property to him shall be deemed the sales price of such retail sale. If the sole use of the property other than retention, demonstrat ion, or display in the regular course of business is the rental of the property while holding it for sale, distribution, or lease, the taxpayer may elect to pay the tax on the amount of the rental charged, rather than the cost of the property to him. D. If a taxpay er gives a certificate under this section with respect to the purchase of fungible goods and thereafter commingles these goods with other fungible goods not so purchased, but of such similarity that the identity of the constituent goods in the commingled mass cannot be determined, sales or distributions from the mass of commingled goods shall be deemed to be sales or distributions of the goods so purchased until a quantity of commingled goods equal to the quantity of purchased goods so commingled has be en sold or distributed. E. If a taxpay er fails to give the dealer at the time of purchase an exemption certificate previously issued by the Department, no interest shall be paid on a subsequent refund claim for any period prior to the date the taxpayer makes a complete refund claim with the Department. This subsection shall not apply to transactions exempted under self-executing certificates of exemption not issued to a specific taxpayer by the Department. History History.

Whenever th e Tax Commissioner determines that any person has misused an exemption certificate, the Tax Commissioner, after giving such person 10-days notice in writing specifying the time and place of hearing and requiring him to show cause why the exemption sh ould not be suspended, may suspend the exemption held by such person.

No such authority shall be granted or exercised except upon application to the Tax Commission er and the issuance by the Tax Commissioner of a direct payment permit. If a direct payment permit is granted, then payment of the tax on all sales, distributions, and leases, including sales, distributions, leases, and storage of tangible personal prope rty and sales of taxable services for use known at the time thereof, shall be made directly to the Tax Commissioner by the permit holder.

The Tax Commissioner, upon written request by the permit holder, may grant a r easonable extension of time for making and filing returns and paying the tax. Interest on such tax shall be chargeable on every such extended payment at the rate determined in accordance with § 58.1-15. C. A permit gr anted pursuant to this section shall continue to be valid until surrendered by the holder or cancelled for cause by the Tax Commissioner. D. Persons who hold a direct payment permit which has not been cancelled shall not be required to pay the tax to the dealer as otherwise herein provided. Such persons shall notify each dealer from whom purchases or leases of tangible personal property are made of thei r direct payment permit number and that the tax is being paid directly to the Tax Commissioner. Upon receipt of such notice, such dealer shall be absolved from all duties and liabilities imposed by this chapter for the collection and remittance of the ta x with respect to sales, distributions, leases, or storage of tangible personal property to such permit holder. Dealers who make sales upon which the tax is not collected by reason of the provisions of this section shall maintain records in such manner t hat the amount involved and identity of each such purchaser may be ascertained. E. Upon the ca ncellation or surrender of a direct payment permit, the provisions of this chapter, without regard to this section, shall thereafter apply to the person who previously held such permit, and such person shall promptly so notify in writing dealers from who m purchases, leases, and storage of tangible personal property are made of such cancellation or surrender. Upon receipt of such notice, the dealer shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter, without regard to this section, with respect to all sal es, distributions, leases, or storage of tangible personal property thereafter made to such person.

The Funds share of such net revenue shall be computed as an estimate of the net revenue to be received into the state tr easury each month, and such estimated payment shall be adjusted for the actual net revenue received in the preceding month. All payments shall be made to the Fund on the last day of each month. B.

Such population estimate produced by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service of the University of Virginia shall account for persons who are domiciled in orphanages or charitable institutions or who are dependents living on a ny federal military or naval reservation or other federal property within the school division in which the institutions or federal military or naval reservation or other federal property is located. Such population estimate produced by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service of the University of Virginia shall account for members of the military services who are under 20 years of age within the school division in which the parents or guardians of such persons legally reside. Such population estimate produced by the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service of the University of Virginia shall account for individuals receiving services in state hospitals, state training centers, or mental health facilities, persons who are confined in state or federal correctional institutions, or persons who attend the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind within the school division in which the parents or guardians of such persons legally reside.

CASE NOTES Tax is on civil privilege.  A tax on the recordation of a deed is not a tax on property, but a tax on the civil privilege of being allowed to avail oneself of the benefits and advantages of the registration laws of the State. Pocahontas Consol. Collieries Co. v. Commonwealth, 113 Va. 108, 73 S.E. 446, 1912 Va. LEXIS 15 (1912) (decided under prior law). The tax is nonetheless a tax because the court thus characterized it as a tax upon a civil privilege. Federal Land Bank v. Hubard, 163 Va. 860, 178 S.E. 16, 1935 Va. LEXIS 247 (1935) (decided under prior law). A federal land bank is not subject to the tax imposed by the first paragraph of this sec tion. Federal Land Bank v. Hubard, 163 Va. 860, 178 S.E. 16, 1935 Va. LEXIS 247 (1935) (decided under prior law). Enforcement of tax.  Clerk of court lacked statutory standing to initiate lawsuit, in his official capacity, to enforce real estate transfer tax on recording of instruments imposed by §§ 58.1-801 and 58.1-812, as the legislature designated those taxes as state taxes to be enforced by the Virginia Department of Taxation, and no statute authorized the clerk of court to collect unpaid real estate transfer taxes by filing an enforc ement action.

Except as provided in this section, a recordation tax on deeds of trust or mortgages is hereby imposed at a rate of 25 cents on every $100 or portion thereof of the amount of bonds or other obligations secured thereby. In the event of an open, credit line, or revolving deed of trust, the amount of the obligation for purposes of this sec tion shall be the maximum amount secured that may be outstanding at any one time, regardless of the amount owed or outstanding at the time the instrument is recorded. 2. In any case in which the amount which may be secured under a deed of trust or mortgage is not ascertainable, or in which the obligations described are not fully secured because they ex ceed the fair market value of the property conveyed, the tax shall be based upon the fair market value of the property conveyed, determined as of the date of the deed of trust or mortgage. The fair market value of the property shall include the value of any realty required by the terms of the deed of trust or mortgage to be constructed thereon. B. On deeds of trust or mortgages upon the works and property of a railroad lying partly within the Commonwealth and partly without the Commonwealth, the tax shall be only upon such proportion of the amount of bonds, or other obligations secured thereby, as the number of miles of the line of such company in the Commonwealth bears to the whole number of miles of the line of such company conveyed by such deed of trust or mortgage.On a deed of trust or mortgage (i) that conveys (a) property lying partly within the Commo nwealth and partly outside the Commonwealth or (b) property within the Commonwealth to secure bonds or obligations secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on property outside the Commonwealth and (ii) that secures the entire amount of such bonds or obliga tions, the tax herein imposed shall be only upon such proportion of the bonds or obligations as the actual value of the property located within the Commonwealth, or which may be brought into the Commonwealth, bears to the actual value of the entire amoun t of property conveyed by such deed of trust or mortgage or to the entire amount of property conveyed by all of such deeds of trust or mortgages to secure the bonds or obligations, as applicable, subject to the limitations set forth in subdivision A 2. C. On deeds of trust or mortgages, which provide for an initial issue of bonds, to be followed thereafter by additional bonds, unlimited in amount, if such deed of trust or mortgage provides that as and when such additional bonds are issued a supplemental indenture sh all be recorded in the office in which the original deed of trust or mortgage is first recorded, which supplement shall contain a statement as to the amount of the additional bonds to be issued, then the tax shall be paid upon the initial amount of bonds when the original deed of trust is recorded and thereafter on each additional amount of bonds when the supplemental indenture relating to such additional bonds is recorded. D. 1. On deeds of trust, mortgages, or other instruments that are supplemental to, wrap ar ound, or modify the terms of an existing deed of trust or mortgage, on which the tax imposed hereunder has already been paid, the tax shall be paid only on that portion of the face amount of the bond or obligation secured thereby which is in addition to the amount of the original debt or obligation secured by the deed of trust or mortgage on which tax has been paid.

In the event of an open, credit line, or revolving deed of trust, the additional amount secured shall be the amount by which the original obligation secured by the sup plemental instrument exceeds the maximum obligation secured by the prior instrument, regardless of the amount owed or outstanding at the time those instruments were recorded. The instrument shall certify the amount of the original debt or obligation secu red, subject to the limitation set forth in subdivision A 2. 2. If the principal amount of the obligation secured by the prior instrument is increased by the supplemental instrument, the tax imposed under this section shall be paid only on the amou nt of the increase over the original amount secured by the prior instrument. If the bonds or other obligations secured by a prior instrument were not fully secured because they exceeded the fair market value of the property conveyed and the tax paid on t he prior instrument was based upon the fair market value of the property conveyed pursuant to subdivision A 2, then the foregoing tax shall be paid on the increase, if any, in the value of such property since the recordation of the prior instrument. 3. The supplemental instrument, or any cover sheet submitted with the supplemental instrument, shall include the original principal amount of the bonds or other obligations secured by the prior instrument, the deed book and page number or instrument number, as applicable, of the prior instrument, and, if applicable with regard to the calculation of the tax paid on the prior instrument, any increase in the fair market value of the propert y conveyed. E. 1. On deeds of trust or mortgages, the purpose of which is to secure the refinancing of an existing debt, which debt is secured by a deed of trust or mortgage on which the tax imposed hereunder has been paid, the tax shall be paid on the amount of the bond or other obligation secured thereby, subject to the limitation set forth in subdivis ion A 2, in accordance with the following schedule:On the first $10 million of value as determined pursuant to this section, 18 cents ($0.18) upon every $100 or portion thereof;On the next $10 million of value as determined pursuant to this section, 16 c ents ($0.16) upon every $100 or portion thereof;On the next $10 million of value as determined pursuant to this section, 14 cents ($0.14) upon every $100 or portion thereof;On the next $10 million of value as determined pursuant to this section, 12 cents ($0.12) upon every $100 or portion thereof; andOn all over $40 million of value as determined pursuant to this section, 10 cents ($0.10) upon every $100 or portion thereof, incorporated into this section. 2.

CASE NOTES Deeds of trust supplemental to building and loan agreements not taxable.  Petitioners sought refund of recordation taxes paid under protest on certain deeds of trust which were executed on the same day as and recorded immediately after certain building and loan agreements. Each deed of trust specifically incorporated its companion agreement by reference and secured notes issued under it. On each agreement the tax called for by § 58.1-807 was paid. In these circumstances the deeds of trust were exempted from recordation tax by this section being supplemental to the agreements theretofore admitted to record. There was no merit to the contention that this section was inapplicable because the agreements did not convey any property. Whi te v. Schwartz, 196 Va. 316, 83 S.E.2d 376, 1954 Va.

But if he chooses to admit it without prepayment, he assumes the tax and the admission to record is valid. Lucas v. Claffin &amp; Co., 76 Va. 269, 1882 Va. LEXIS 30 (1882). The tax on a deed of trust or mortgage to secure bonds is regulated in amount by the amo unt of the bonds secured thereby, and the payment of the full amount of the tax is a condition precedent to the right to have the deed recorded, although some of the bonds are not to be issued till a future day. The statute, which is a valid exercise of legislative power, makes no provision for the collection of any part of the tax after the deed has once been admitted to record. Pocahontas Consol.

The Departm ent is hereby authorized and directed to have prepared and to sell stamps suitable for denoting the tax on all cigarettes. The Department shall design, adopt and promulgate the form and kind of stamps to be used and may allow for electronic purchase and payment when selling such stamps. Stamps so adopted and promulgated shall be known as and termed Virginia revenue stamps, and in any information or indictment, it shall be sufficient to describe the stamps as Virginia revenue stamps.Any p erson other than the Department who sells such revenue stamps, not affixed to cigarettes sold and delivered by them, whether the said stamps be genuine or counterfeit, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. Any person who purchases revenue stamps from anyo ne other than the Department, unless such stamps are already affixed to cigarettes being purchased by and delivered to him, or who uses or affixes, or causes to be used or affixed, any revenue stamps not purchased from the Department by the owner of the cigarettes being handled or stamped, whether such stamps are genuine or counterfeit, shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. When stamping agents have qualified as such with the Department, as provided in § 58.1-1011, and purchase stamps as prescribed he rein for use on taxable cigarettes sold and delivered by them, the Department shall allow to each stamping agent on such sales of revenue stamps a discount equal to two percent of the total charged to the stamping agent by the Department for the purchase of the revenue stamps. The Tax Commissioner shall prepare for each fiscal year an estimate of the total amount of all discounts allowed to stamping agents pursuant to this subsection and such amount shall be taken into consideration in preparing the off icial estimate of the total revenues to be collected during the fiscal year by the Virginia Health Care Fund established under § 32.1-366. Any reduction in funding available for programs financed by the Virginia Health Care Fund as a result of such di scounts shall be made up by the general fund.All stamps prescribed by the Department shall be designed and furnished in such a fashion as to permit identification of the wholesale dealer or retail dealer that affixed the stamp to the particular package o f cigarettes, by means of a serial number or other mark on the stamp. The Department shall maintain for not less than three years information identifying which wholesale dealer or retail dealer affixed the revenue stamp to each package of cigarettes. B. 1. The Department shall provide Virginia revenue stamps to certain wholesale dealers ho lding a current permit issued pursuant to § 58.1-1011 prior to collecting the tax imposed under this chapter from such wholesale dealer. Such wholesale dealers shall be allowed to obtain the stamps from the Department without concurrent payment of the tax only if the conditions of this subsection are satisfied.In order to obtain Virginia revenue stamps without concurrent payment of the tax imposed under this chapter, a wholesale dealer shall (i) file a bond with a corporate surety licensed to do busi ness in Virginia, or (ii) file an irrevocable letter of credit satisfactory to the Tax Commissioner as to the bank or savings institution, the form and substance, and payable to the Commonwealth in a face amount determined by the Tax Commissioner to be s atisfactory to cover possible losses resulting from the failure to remit taxes due but not exceeding two times the anticipated average monthly amount in purchases of Virginia revenue stamps by the wholesale dealer as determined by the Commissioner. The l etter of credit shall be from a bank incorporated or authorized to conduct banking business under the laws of the Commonwealth or authorized to do business in the Commonwealth under the banking laws of the United States, or a federally insured savings in stitution located in the Commonwealth. Such bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall be conditioned upon payment of the tax imposed by this chapter relating to Virginia revenue stamps obtained by the wholesale dealer from the Department (without concur rent payment of the tax) for which such tax, net of any applicable discount described in subsection A, shall be paid within the 30 days immediately following the date that the related revenue stamp or stamps were provided by the Department to such wholes ale dealer. Any such bond shall be so written that, on timely payment of the premium thereon, it shall continue in force from year to year unless sooner terminated. 2. Any surety on a bond filed by any wholesale dealer shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to the Commonwealth accruing on such bond after the expiration of 60 days from the date upon which such surety shall have lodged with the Commissioner written request to be released and discharged. But such request shall not operate to relieve, release or discharge such surety from any liability already accrued or which shall accrue before the expiration of such 60-day period. The Commissioner shall, promptly on receipt of such notice, notify the wholesale dealer who furnished such bond. Unless such dealer on or before the expiration of such 60 days notice files with the Commissioner a new bond or letter of credit that meets all the conditions described in subdivision 1, the Commissioner shall forthwith require the wholesale dealer to pay the tax imposed under this chapter concurrent with obtaining revenue stamps from t he Department.In the event that liability upon the bond or letter of credit filed by the wholesale dealer with the Commissioner shall be discharged or reduced, whether by judgment rendered, payment made or otherwise, or if in the opinion of the Commissio ner any surety on the bond becomes unsatisfactory or unacceptable, then the Commissioner may require the filing of a new bond or letter of credit. Unless such new bond or letter of credit meets all the conditions described in subdivision 1, the Commissio ner shall forthwith require the wholesale dealer to pay the tax imposed under this chapter concurrent with obtaining revenue stamps from the Department. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision in this subsection, the Tax Commissioner, for good cause, shall require a wholesale dealer to pay the tax imposed under this chapter concurrent with obtaining revenue stamps from the Department, regardless of whether or not such dealer has filed or agreed to file the bond or letter of credit described in this subsection.

The cases below were decided under prior law. This section refers to the taxation of the capital of a resident corporation which is pe rmanently invested in a branch maintained by the corporation outside of the state. Commonwealth v. Imperial Coal Sales Co., 166 Va. 27, 183 S.E. 234, 1936 Va. LEXIS 159 (1936). This section refers to the taxation of capital of nonresident corporations doing busines s in this state. Commonwealth v. Imperial Coal Sales Co., 166 Va. 27, 183 S.E. 234, 1936 Va. LEXIS 159 (1936). Money on deposit in another state.  When a Virginia corporation does business in another state, it is present there, and in a business sense, at least, its moneys deposited in that state and employe d there are deemed to be situated there. Our tax laws recognize this. Under former § 58-411 money is classified as one of the elements of capital, and this section contains a specific exemption that no part of the capital of a corporat ion doing business in this state and elsewhere shall be taxed if it has a business situs . . . outside of this state. Commonwealth v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co., 193 Va. 37, 68 S.E.2d 122, 1951 Va. LEXIS 238 (1951), limited, Railway Express Agen cy, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 199 Va. 589, 100 S.E.2d 785, 1957 Va. LEXIS 228 (1957). It is true that strictly speaking a deposit of money in a bank is not situated in the state, city, or town where the banking institution is located. It is an asse t of the depositor and is domiciled where he is. But by common acceptation money earned, employed, and deposited in a state has a business situs there irrespective of the owners domicile elsewhere. Commonwealth v. Appalachian Elec.

All delinquent returns submitted by a taxpayer, whether upon his own initiative or at the request of the Department, shall be enforced pursuant to the provisions of subsection C and shall be accepted. However, when an indication that the taxpayer willfully failed to file the required return or if any other indication of fraud exists, the Department may refuse to accept such delinquent return submission in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth and guidelines developed pursuant to this section. B. Where it is determined that required returns have not been filed when due, the extent to which compliance for prior years will be enforced shall be determined by reference to factors ensuring compliance and proper administration of staffing and other Department res ources. Factors to be considered shall include, but are not limited to, the taxpayers prior history of noncompliance, existence of income from illegal sources, effects upon voluntary compliance, anticipated revenue, and collectability, in relation to the time and effort required to determine tax due. The Department shall also consider any special circumstances existing in the case of a particular taxpayer, class of taxpayer, or industry, or which may be peculiar to the class of tax involved. C. Subject to the provisions of subsection A, application of the criteria in subsection B shall result in enforcement by the Department of delinquency procedures for not more than six years of the taxpayers returns. Enforcement beyond such period shall not be unde rtaken without prior approval of the applicable manager designated by the Tax Commissioner. However, the approval of such manager shall not be required if the nonfiling taxpayer voluntarily files returns beyond the established enforcement period.

If any taxe s or fees, including penalties and interest, assessed by the Department of Taxation in pursuance of law against any person, are not paid within thirty days after the same become due, the Tax Commissioner may file a memorandum of lien in the circuit court clerks office of the county or city in which the taxpayers place of business is located, or in which the taxpayer resides. If the taxpayer has no place of business or residence within the Commonwealth, such memorandum may be filed in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. A copy of such memorandum may also be filed in the clerks office of all counties and cities in which the taxpayer owns real estate. Such memorandum shall be recorded in the judgment docket book and shall have the effec t of a judgment in favor of the Commonwealth, to be enforced as provided in Article 19 (§ 8.01-196 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 8.01, except that a writ of fieri facias may issue at any time after the memorandum is filed. The lien on real estate sha ll become effective at the time the memorandum is filed in the jurisdiction in which the real estate is located. No memorandum of lien shall be filed unless the taxpayer is first given ten or more days prior notice of intent to file a lien; however, in those instances where the Tax Commissioner determines that the collection of any tax, penalties or interest required to be paid pursuant to law will be jeopardized by the provision of such notice, notification may be provided to the taxpayer concurren t with the filing of the memorandum of lien. Such notice shall be given to the taxpayer at his last known address. For purposes of this section, last known address means the address shown on the most recent return filed by or on behalf of the tax payer or the address provided in correspondence by or on behalf of the taxpayer indicating that it is a change of the taxpayers address. B. Recordation of a memorandum of lien hereunder shall not affect the right to a refund or exoneration under this chapter, nor shall an application for correction of an erroneous assessment affect the power of the Tax Commissioner to collect the tax, except as specifi cally provided in this title. C. If after fi ling a memorandum of lien as required by subsection A, the Tax Commissioner determines that it is in the best interest of the Commonwealth, the Tax Commissioner may place padlocks on the doors of any business enterprise that is delinquent in either filin g or paying any tax owed to the Commonwealth, or both. He shall also post notices of distraint on each of the doors so padlocked. If after three business days, the tax deficiency has not been satisfied or satisfactory arrangements for payment made, the T ax Commissioner may cause a writ of fieri facias to be issued.It shall be a Class 1 misdemeanor for anyone to enter the padlocked premises without prior approval of the Tax Commissioner.In the event that the taxpayer against whom the distraint has been a pplied subsequently makes application for correction of the assessment under § 58.1-1821, the taxpayer shall have the right to post bond equaling the amount of the tax liability in lieu of payment until the application is acted upon.The provisions of subsection C shall be enforceable only after the promulgation, by the Tax Commissioner, of regulations under the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) setting forth the circumstances under which this subsection can be used. D. A taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Commissioner after a memorandum of lien has been filed under this section if the taxpayer alleges an error in the filing of the lien. The Tax Commissioner shall make a determination of such an appeal within fourteen days. If the Tax Commissioner determines that the filing was erroneous, he shall issue a certificate of release of the lien within seven days after such determination is made. History History.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Release of lien was not favorable termination of assessment process.  Taxpayers malicious prosecution action against the Virginia Department of Taxation and state officials arising out of an income tax assessment was missing an essential element because the effort to enforce the assessment had not ended favorably to the taxpayer; he had not initiated or exhausted his administrative remedies and the Departments release of a tax lien merely released a method of collection and did not erase the underlying tax obligation.

If the Tax Commissioner ascertains that any person has failed to make a proper return or to pay in full any proper tax, he shall assess the taxes prescribed by law, adding to the taxes so assessed the penalty prescribed by law, if any, for the failure to file a ret urn (if a return was required by law but not filed within the time prescribed by law) and the penalty or penalties prescribed by law for the failure to pay the taxes and penalty or penalties within the time prescribed by law. If no penalty is so prescrib ed, he shall assess a penalty of five percent of the tax due, or if the failure to pay in full was fraudulent, a penalty of 100 percent of the tax due. In addition thereto, interest on the outstanding tax and penalty shall be charged at the rate establis hed under § 58.1-15 for the period between the due date and the date of full payment. Except as otherwise provided by law, the amount of tax shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed, whether such return was filed on or after the da te prescribed, and no proceeding in court without assessment shall be begun for the collection of such tax after the expiration of such period. A return of tax filed before the last day prescribed by law for the timely filing thereof shall be considered as filed on the last day. A return of recordation tax shall be considered as having been filed on the date of recordation. If no return is filed, the tax may be assessed within six years of the date such return was due. If a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade the payment of tax, an assessment may be made at any time. Upon such assessment, the Department of Taxation shall send a bill therefor to the taxpayer and the taxes, penalties, and interest shall be remitted to the Department o f Taxation within 30 days from the date of such bill. Effective January 1, 2023, such bill and notice of assessment shall identify the date the initial return or payment was received by the Department, any payment amounts received, and an explanation of the taxes, penalties, and interest related to such assessment on such taxpayer. If such taxes, penalties, and interest are not paid within such 30 days, interest at the rate provided herein shall accrue thereon from the date of such assessment until paym ent. B. The Departm ent of Taxation shall not assess penalty or interest on any assessment of tax for the recovery of an erroneous refund, provided that the tax is paid to the Department within 30 days from the date of the bill. If the tax is not remitted to the Department within 30 days from the date of such bill, interest at the rate provided herein shall accrue thereon from the date of such assessment until payment. As used in this section, erroneous refund means any refund of tax resulting solely from an error by the Department of Taxation that results in the taxpayer rece iving a refund to which the taxpayer is not entitled.

Duty of commissioners of revenue.  It is the duty of the commissioners of revenue, apart from any suggestion by the board of supervisors, to assess for taxation within the prescribed limits any pro perty which upon ascertainment appeared to have been omitted for any previous years. But the subsequent assessment must be made in the manner and within the time prescribed by law. Commonwealth v. United Cigarette Mach. Co., 120 Va. 835, 92 S.E. 901, 191 7 Va.

Commissioners of the revenue have power to assess for omitted taxes in antecedent years, but this section does not empower these officials to assess property not charged with a tax by some proper tribunal. Sussex County v. Jarratt, 129 Va. 672, 106 S.E. 384, 1921 Va. LEXIS 125 (1921). Levy and assessment distinguished.  Every assessment rests upon a proper levy of a tax. In fact, it may be said, no levy, no assessment. Levy and assessment have very different meanings. The levy of taxes is a legislative function, and declares the subject and rate of taxation. Assessment is quasi-judicial, and consists in making a list of the taxpayers property, and fixing its valuation, or appraisement. Sussex County v. Jarratt, 129 Va. 672, 106 S.E. 384, 1921 Va.

The words ascertain and assess are sometimes used in this section interc hangeably, and both refer, not to a secret mental attitude of a public official, but to the acquisition of information which results in an assessment, that is, to the official action which is required of him by law.

Commonwealth, 166 Va. 229, 183 S.E. 873, 1936 Va. LEXIS 184 (1936). Boards of supervisors not empowered to make levies for past years.  This section relates to assessing officers only, and is intended to increase their powers of assessment, so as to include antecedent years, but does confer upon b oards of supervisors the power to make levies for the years that are passed. Such power might be afforded by the General Assembly, but it should be clearly given, not derived by doubtful implication. Sussex County v. Jarratt, 129 Va. 672, 106 S.E. 384, 1 921 Va. LEXIS 125 (1921). Effect of neglect of duty by examiners of records or commissioner of revenue.  No dereliction of the examiners of records in failing to report the property, or of the commissioner of the revenue in failing to assess it for taxation, can reli eve any taxpayer of his own duty to list and return his taxable property for taxation. Nor can such concurring failures and omissions relieve any of the property from its just proportion of the tax burdens, which are intended to be equal and uniform. Rix ey's Ex'rs v.

IX, § 2, the State Corporation Commission succeeded to all powers and duties of the railroad commissioner and the board of public works. Under this section, where it appeared that the eighteen miles of a railroad was not assessed for taxes for the years in controversy, it followed that it was the duty of the Commission to value the same and to assess the omitted state tax thereon, unless there were found a statutory provision which would operate to exempt the railroad from such taxation. Commonwealth ex rel. Bd. of Supvrs. v. C &amp; O Ry., 137 Va. 526, 120 S.E. 506, 1923 Va. LEXIS 177 (1923). Remedy for erroneous or ille gal assessment.  If the commissioner of revenue makes an erroneous or an illegal and invalid assessment, the remedy under §§ 58.1-1825, 58.1-1826, 58.1-1827 and 58.1-1830 is adequate, and the previously existing remedy by injunction is cut off by § 58.1-1830.

CASE NOTES Scope of section.  For a violation of § 58.1-1815, a taxpayer had to truthfully account for or fail to pay over withholding tax. The statutory language and reference to a similar federal statute, 26 U.S.C.S. § 7202, showed that those requirements both had to be met and the failure to meet either requirement violated § 58.1-1815. Gibson v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 176, 662 S.E.2d 54, 2008 Va. LEXIS 86 (2008). Prosecutorial discretion.  Even if defendant could have been convicted for not filing the required reports and for not paying state withholding taxes to the Commonwealth under §§ 58.1 -485 and 58.1-1815, that did not mean that defendants conviction under the general embezzlement statute, § 18.2-111 was improper. Where more than one statute applied, the Commonwealth had discretion about which statute should be used to charge def endant. George v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 137, 655 S.E.2d 43, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 12, aff'd, 276 Va. 767, 667 S.E.2d 779, 2008 Va. LEXIS 125 (2008). Preservation for review.  Defendant waived error concerning defendants conviction of three misdemeanor convictions for failure to pay withholding tax pursuant to § 58.1-1815. Defend ants claims about the use of the term tax in that statute and the effect of defendants company filing for bankruptcy were not made in the trial court and since the trial court did not rule on those claims, error regarding them raised in t he state supreme court was waived pursuant to Va.

LEXIS 267 (1987). 1981 announcement was assessment, as that term is used in statute of limitations, where it was made on a printed department form captioned Notice of Assessment, the form indicated the taxes, penalty, and interest due by the taxpayer as the result of a field audit for the period in question, it was issued after the department , commencing as early as 1973, had presented to taxpayer a series of shifting positions on its tax liability for the period in question, the form showed the Date of Assessment to be April 1, 1981, printed on the form was this admonition: If n ot paid within 30 days from date of assessment, interest will accrue at the applicable statutory rate from date of assessment, the form contained this additional printed message: If this assessment is incorrect or you wish to protest the above as sessment, you must do so in writing within 90 days from date of assessment, and the form advised that: This statement does not include any assessment of tax, penalty, or interest for any reporting period other than shown above. Knopp Bros. v. Department of Taxation, 234 Va. 383, 362 S.E.2d 897, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1214, 1987 Va. LEXIS 267 (1987). Application timely filed.  Forms clearly labeled Notice of Assessment were not merely updated bills because the Date of Assessment was still listed as an earlier date; the 1 990 forms were identical to the ones issued for the 1989 assessments, and when corporation filed a protest within 90 days of the date of the assessments pursuant to information provided to it on the 1990 notices, the tax commissioner responded to that pr otest without asserting that the notices were not to be construed as Notices of Assessment. Therefore, application to correct an erroneous tax assessment, filed on October 22, 1993, for the tax years ending June 30, 1987, and June 30, 1988, was t imely filed within three years from the October 24, 1990 Notices of Assessment.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Interest on tax refunds.  Tax Commissioner and Department of Taxation lack authority to assess interest on local sales tax revenues erroneously distributed to a locality by the Commonwealt h. Such revenues are repaid to the Commonwealth by the locality, without interest, using the procedures specified in § 58.1-605.

If the Department is satisfied, by evidence submitted to it or otherwise, that the tax assessed and paid upon the original return exceeds the proper amount, the Department may reassess the taxpayer and order that any amount excessively paid be refunded to him. The Department may reduce such refund by the amount of any taxes, penalties and interest whic h are due for the period covered by the amended return, or any past-due taxes, penalties and interest which have been assessed within the appropriate period of limitations. Any order of the Department denying such reassessment and refund, or the failure of the Department to act thereon within three months shall, as to matters first raised by the amended return, be deemed an assessment for the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to pursue the remedies allowed under this chapter.

This section is remedial and its avowed purpose is to provide an expeditious and inexpen sive remedy for relief against taxes which have been erroneously assessed or collected, and remedial statutes are not strictly construed but are given a liberal construction with the view of advancing the remedy sought to be applied in accordance with th e true intent and purpose of the legislature. Commonwealth v. Smallwood Mem. Inst., 124 Va. 142, 97 S.E. 805, 1919 Va. LEXIS 117 (1919); Commonwealth v. P. Lorillard Co., 129 Va. 74, 105 S.E. 683, 1921 Va. LEXIS 77 (1921); Todd v. County of Elizabeth Cit y, 191 Va. 52, 60 S.E.2d 23, 1950 Va. LEXIS 197 (1950). Assessment.  The word assessment as employed in this section and subdivision 2 of § 58.1-1820, means the amount of money in taxes the particular taxpayer is suppose d to pay. Knopp Bros. v. Department of Taxation, 234 Va. 383, 362 S.E.2d 897, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1214, 1987 Va. LEXIS 267 (1987). The term assessment is defined in subdivision 2 of § 58.1-1820 to include a written assessment made pursuant to notice by the department of taxation. A ssessments made by the department shall be deemed to be made when a written notice of assessment is delivered to the taxpayer by an employee of the department of taxation, or mailed to the taxpayer at his last known address. Commonwealth, Dep't of Taxati on v. Delta Air Lines, 257 Va. 419, 513 S.E.2d 130, 1999 Va. LEXIS 34 (1999). The general rule is that taxes voluntarily paid cannot be recovered back in the absence of a statute providing for this repayment. The rule, of course, does not apply where repayment is made pursuant to a valid statute. Commonwealth v. Ferries Co., 120 Va. 827, 92 S.E. 804, 1917 Va. LEXIS 163 (1917); 3 Va. L. Reg. 354 (1917). See also B arrow v. Prince Edward County, 121 Va. 1, 92 S.E. 910, 1917 Va. LEXIS 1 (1917). Under this section, before relief can be had it must appear that there has been an erroneous assessment. Commonwealth v. Conner, 162 Va. 406, 174 S.E. 862, 1934 Va. LEXIS 256 (1934). Remedy affor ded by this section is ample and complete.  The remedy afforded by this section for the correction of an erroneous assessment of property, under a valid statute, is ample and complete to test the correctnes s of such assessment, as it brings both the citizen and the Commonwealth before a court duly authorized to decide the matter. Johnson v. Trustees of Hampton Normal &amp; Agrl. Inst., 105 Va. 319, 54 S.E. 31, 1906 Va. LEXIS 37 (1906). When a taxpayer comes into court under the provisions of this section the court may examine into and do all that the commissioner of the revenue is required to do under the provisions of § 58.1-1812. Commonwealth v. Schmelz, 114 Va. 364, 76 S.E. 905, 1913 Va. LEXIS 93 (1913). If the commissioner of revenue makes an erroneous or an illegal and invalid assessment, the remedy under this section is adequate, and the previously existing rem edy by injunction is cut off by § 58.1-1831. Commonwealth v. Tredegar Co., 122 Va. 506, 95 S.E. 279, 1918 Va. LEXIS 114 (1918). Therefore, a bill in equity does not lie in such a case. Barrow v. Prince Edward County, 121 Va. 1, 92 S.E. 910, 1917 Va. LEXIS 1 (1917). No interference from federal courts.  This section provides taxpayers with a forum in which to challenge the validity of tax assessments and therefore constitutes the kind of state remedy envisioned b y the Tax Injunction Act; that Act, in turn, insulates Virginias system of taxation from interference by the federal courts. International Lotto Fund v. Virginia State Lottery Dep't, 20 F.3d 589, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 6012 (4th Cir. 1994). A federal court of equity is without jurisdiction of a suit to enjoin the collection of such taxes, levied by authority of the state, on the ground of erroneous assessment. Douglas Co. v.

If the assessment exceeds the proper amount, the court may order that the applicant be exonerated from the payment of so much as is erroneously or improperly charged, if not already paid and, if paid, that it be refunded to him. If t he assessment is less than the proper amount, the court shall order that the applicant pay the proper taxes and to this end the court shall be clothed with all the powers and duties of the authority which made the assessment complained of as of the time when such assessment was made and all the powers and duties conferred by law upon such authority between the time such assessment was made and the time such application is heard.

Remedies.  No reasonable taxpayer would have thought that a declaratory judgment proceeding, even assuming its constitutional adequacy, represented the exclusive remedy for relief for unlawful taxes in Virginia. Harper v. Virginia Dep't of Taxation, 250 Va. 184, 462 S.E.2d 892, 12 Va. Law Rep. 185, 1995 Va. LEXIS 99 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1128, 116 S. Ct. 1371, 134 L.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Relief granted.  Corporate taxpayer was entitled to a tax deduction under § 58.1-402B.8.a.(2) for royalties paid to a related corporation that owned its trademarks, as that cor poration derived at least one-third of its gross revenues from unrelated franchises as a result of the taxpayers pass-through to the corporation of the same proportion of royalties paid to the taxpayer by related and unrelated members. Wendy's Int'l, Inc. v. Va. Dep't of Taxation, 84 Va. Cir. 398, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 28 (Richmond Mar. 29, 2012). Statutory method properly applied.  Tax Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in applying the statutory method to a taxpayers income activities because no direct evidence or reasonable infer ence showed the extent to which any of the taxpayers customers actually operated or used the data or information within its billing address, or the extent, if any, to which the data and information were accessed; the information and data were created , developed, improved, and maintained in Virginia.

Most of the cases below were decided under prior law. Purpose of section.  The underlying purpose of this section is to prevent those liable for taxes in some amount to delay payment or possibly to escape their lawful burden, and so to i nterfere with and thwart the collection of revenues for the support of the government. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). In view of the convenience, elasticity and fairness of proceedings under § 58.1-3984 et seq., it was the controlling purpose of the legislature in the enactmen t of this section to compel a resort thereto whenever the remedy thereunder was adequate. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). The test of the statute in every case is to be found in the adequacy of the remedy at law. Commonwealth v. Tredegar Co., 122 Va. 506, 95 S.E. 279, 1918 Va. LEXIS 114 (1918) (see also Sussex County v. Jarratt, 129 Va. 672, 106 S.E. 384, 627 (1921); C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394 (1952)). Prior to this section jurisdiction of equity to restrain an illegal or unauthorized tax was well settled in this State. Commonwealth v. Tredegar Co., 122 Va. 506, 95 S.E. 279, 1918 Va. LEXIS 114 (1918); Commonwealth v. Carter, 126 Va. 469, 102 S.E. 58, 1920 Va. LEXIS 4 (1920); Todd v. County of Elizabeth City, 191 Va. 52, 60 S.E.2d 23, 195 0 Va. LEXIS 197 (1950). Statutory remedy must be followed.  Since the enactment of this section, where the statutory remedy is adequate it must be followed, and the previously existing remedy by injunction is cut off and c annot be pursued. Commonwealth v. Tredegar Co., 122 Va. 506, 95 S.E. 279, 1918 Va. LEXIS 114 (1918); Todd v. County of Elizabeth City, 191 Va. 52, 60 S.E.2d 23, 1950 Va. LEXIS 197 (1950); C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394 , 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). Where telephone company sought by bill in equity to have city ordinance imposing license tax on gross receipts declared unconstitutional and also injunctive relie f against its enforcement, it was held that company had an adequate remedy at law under the provisions of § 58.1-3984 and was not entitled to the equitable relief sought. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEX IS 246 (1952). Circ umstances insufficient to give equity jurisdiction.  The inability to recover interest is not alone sufficient in all cases to give equity jurisdiction for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). The application of this section should not be withheld and suits in equity to restrain the assessment or collection of taxes allowed contrary to its provision and purpose, on mere apprehension of harm which is not shown to be imminent or serious. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). When statutory remedy inadequate.  By § 58.1-3984, a person assessed with county levies, and aggrieved by such assessment, can apply for relief to the circuit court of the county wherein such as sessment was made. Under these provisions, where there has been an assessment, however erroneous, there can be no relief in equity, but where there is no assessment, the remedy by motion does not apply, and as the party is without adequate remedy, he may maintain his suit for an injunction. Sussex County v. Jarratt, 129 Va. 672, 106 S.E. 384, 1921 Va. LEXIS 125 (1921). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statutory remedy must be followed.  Although § 58.1-1831 prohibited actions seeking to restrain the assessment of state or local taxes except when a party had no adequate remedy at law, a taxpaye r failed to initiate or exhaust his administrative remedies in challenging an income tax assessment before filing a tort action against the Virginia Department of Taxation and Virginia state officials arising out of the assessment; he did not initiate th e procedure for challenging an assessment in § 58.1-1821 or any of the procedures set out in §§ 58.1-1820 to 58.1-1834, or §§ 58.1-3980 to 58.1-3995, and administrative relief was available to him because the statute of limitations set out in § 58.1-1825 had not expired.

Such interest shall accrue from a date sixty days after payment of the tax, or sixty days after the last day prescribed by law for such payment, whichever is later, a nd shall end on a date determined by the Department preceding the date of the refund check by not more than thirty days. Notwithstanding the above, any tax refunded pursuant to a court order or otherwise as a result of an erroneous assessment shall bear interest from the date the assessment was paid. No interest will be paid on sales taxes refunded to a dealer unless the dealer agrees to pass such interest on to the purchaser. B. 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, if an individual overpays his indivi dual income tax, the overpayment was for individual income taxes for the immediately preceding taxable year, and the overpayment has not been refunded, then interest shall accrue on the amount of the overpayment, beginning: (i) thirty days after payment of such tax if the individual filed his individual income tax return via electronic means; or (ii) sixty days after payment of such tax if the individual filed his individual income tax return using a method other than electronic means.In no case shall interest be paid for the overpayment of the same tax pursuant to this subsection and subsection A. 2. For the purposes of this subsection, interest shall accrue at a rate equal to the rate of interest established pursuant to § 58.1-15. Such interest shall end on a date determined by the Department preceding the date of the refund check by not more than seven days. C. For purpose s of this section: 1. Any i ndividual income tax deducted and withheld at the source and paid to the Department, and any amount paid as estimated tax, shall be deemed to have been paid on the day on which the return for such years income was filed; 2. Any corporate or estate and trust income tax deducted and withheld at the source and paid to the Department, and any amount paid as estimated tax, shall be deemed to have been paid on the day on which the return for such years income was filed, or the last day prescribed by law for filing such return, whichever is later; and 3. Any overpayment of tax resulting from the carry-back of a net operating loss or net capital loss shall be deemed to have been made on the day on which the return for the year in which the loss occurred was filed, or the last day prescribed by law for such filing, whichever is later. D. The Tax Com missioner and the State Comptroller shall implement procedures to allow an individual requesting a refund of the overpayment of individual income tax when filing his individual income tax return to elect on such return to have the refund paid by check ma iled to the address provided on his return. The ability of the individual to elect such refund check shall be in addition to other methods utilized by the State Comptroller for the payment of such refund, including but not limited to direct deposits or o ther electronic means.

There is he reby established the Virginia Tax Amnesty Program (the Program). B. The Virgini a Tax Amnesty Program shall be administered by the Department. Any taxpayer required to file a return or to pay any tax administered or collected by the Department shall be eligible to participate in the Program, subject to the requirements in this secti on and guidelines established by the Tax Commissioner. The Tax Commissioner may require participants in the Program to complete an amnesty application and such other forms as he may prescribe and to furnish any additional information he deems necessary t o make a determination regarding the validity of such amnesty application. C. The Tax Com missioner shall establish guidelines and rules for the procedures for participation and any other rules that are deemed necessary by the Tax Commissioner. The guidelines and rules issued by the Tax Commissioner regarding the Program shall be exempt from the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). D. The Program shall have the following features: 1. The P rogram shall be conducted during the period July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, and shall not last less than 60 nor more than 75 days. The exact dates of the Program shall be established by the Tax Commissioner. 2. All civil or criminal penalties assessed or assessable, as provided in this title, including the addition to tax under §§ 58.1-492 and 58.1-504, and one-half of the interest asse ssed or assessable, as provided in this title, which are the result of nonpayment, underpayment, nonreporting, or underreporting of tax liabilities, shall be waived upon receipt of the payment of the amount of taxes and interest owed, with the following exceptions: a. No taxpayer currently under investigation or prosecution for filing a fraudulent return or failing to file a return with the intent to evade tax shall be eligible to participate in the Program. b. No taxpayer shall be eligible to participate in the Program with respect to any assessment outstanding for which the date of assessment is less than 90 days prior to the first day of the Program or with respect to any liability arising from the failure to file a return for which the due date of the return is less than 90 days prior to the first day of the Program. c. No taxpayer shall be eligible to participate in the Program with respect to any tax liability from the income taxes imposed by §§ 58.1-320, 58.1-360, and 58.1-400, if the ta x liability is attributable to taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016. E. For the pur pose of computing the outstanding balance due because of the nonpayment, underpayment, nonreporting, or underreporting of any tax liability that has not been assessed prior to the first day of the Program, the rate of interest specified for omitted taxes and assessments under § 58.1-15 shall not be applicable. Instead, the Tax Commissioner shall establish one interest rate to be used for each taxable year that approximates the average underpayment rate specified under § 58.1-15 for the fiv e-year period immediately preceding the Program. F. 1. If any taxpayer eligible for amnesty under this section and under the rules and guid elines established by the Tax Commissioner retains any outstanding balance after the close of the Program because of the nonpayment, underpayment, nonreporting, or underreporting of any tax liability eligible for relief under the Program, then such balan ce shall be subject to a 20 percent penalty on the unpaid tax. This penalty is in addition to all other penalties that may apply to the taxpayer. 2. Any taxpayer who defaults upon any agreement to pay tax and interest arising out of a grant of amnesty is subject to reinstatement of the penalty and interest forgiven and the impositi on of the penalty under this section as though the taxpayer retained the original outstanding balance at the close of the Program. G. For the pur pose of implementing the Program, the Department is exempt from subsection B of § 2.2-2016.1 and §§ 2.2-2018.1, 2.2-2020, and 2.2-2021 pertaining to the Virginia Information Technologies Agencys project management and procurement oversight.

It has been accurately described as a catc h-all statute which provides a remedy at law for any aggrieved taxpayer who has paid any fee, tax or charge pursuant to any statute administered by the Commission unless and except as otherwise specifically provided. Commonwealth v. Cross, 196 Va. 37 5, 83 S.E.2d 722, 1954 Va. LEXIS 230 (1954). It is a remedial statute whose purpose is to provide an expeditious and inexpensive remedy for relief against taxes which have been erroneously assessed and collected. Being a remedial statute it must be given a liberal construction with the view of advancing the remedy sought to be applied in compliance with the true intent and purpose of t he legislature. Commonwealth v. Cross, 196 Va. 375, 83 S.E.2d 722, 1954 Va. LEXIS 230 (1954). The purpose of this section is to provide an expeditious and inexpensive remedy for relief against taxes which have been erroneously assessed and collected. Easte rn Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 287, 136 S.E.2d 838, 1964 Va. LEXIS 178 (1964). The right to apply for the correction of an assessment and for a refund is purely a statutory right and it is incumbent upon one seeking relief to proceed according to the statute affording such relief. The application must be made within the time required by the authorizing statute and in accordance with such restrictions or conditions a s may be contained therein. Commonwealth v. Cross, 196 Va. 375, 83 S.E.2d 722, 1954 Va. LEXIS 230 (1954). This section is available only to an aggrieved party who seeks to correct an assessment or charge made by the Commission and to secure a refund of the amount incorrectly paid. Eastern Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 287, 136 S.E.2d 838, 1964 Va. LEXIS 178 (1964). When period of limitation begins to run.  Where a contract carriers gross receipts road tax for the year 1952 was overpaid by payment made on July 14, 1952, and the overpayment was increased by a furt her payment made January 15, 1953, application for refund filed on August 17, 1953, was timely filed within the period of one year from the date of payment. The tax is an annual tax and runs from the end of the current tax year when overpayment i s made during that year, and where made after the tax year, from the date of payment. Commonwealth v. Cross, 196 Va. 375, 83 S.E.2d 722, 1954 Va. LEXIS 230 (1954).

CASE NOTES Distin ction between Articles 2 and 3 of former Chapter 21.  Prior provisions corresponding to former Chapter 21 imposed a tax on fuel purchased for use in combustible, jet, and rocket engines for transportation and other p urposes. Provisions corresponding to Article 2 of former Chapter 21 were directed primarily at gasoline used in motor vehicles, but also included aviation fuel used in aircraft.

The application of provisions corresponding to Article 3 of former Chapter 21 was thus limited to fuels other than gasoline. Commissioner of D MV v.

History History. 2000, cc. 729, 758. Annotations OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Statute is constitutional.  The legislative decision to permit the entity that pays a supplier for fuel at a terminal rack to take advantage of the one percent discount does not create a cla ssification between jobbers and gasoline retailers and, therefore, does not constitute prohibited special legislation. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Warren E. Barry, Member, Senate of Virginia, 00-092 (1/18/01). Person who receives the fuel upon its removal from the terminal.  When a jobber or some other independent truck company simply picks up fuel for a gasoline retailer and the gasoline retailer pays the supplier for the fuel, the g asoline retailer is responsible for the tax under the statute; however, if the jobber pays the supplier for the fuel placed in his transport, the jobber is the first person who receives the fuel upon its removal from the terminal pursuant to subs ection B and is entitled to take the one percent collection allowance.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Proper tax rat e to impose at time of tax rate increase.  The proper tax rate to impose on a vehicle sale transaction in Virginia is the tax rate in effect at the time of the sale, when ownership or possession of the veh icle is transferred, whichever of these events of sale occurs first. After the tax is imposed on the sales transaction, the tax is then owed and is paid and collected when the vehicle is titled by the DMV. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Gregory D. Habeeb, Member, House of Delegates; the Honorable Johnny S. Joannou, Member, House of Delegates; the Honorable Richard D.

In the case of the sale or use of a motor vehicle upon which the pricing information is required by federal law to be posted, the Commissioner may collect the tax upon the basis of the total sale price shown on such document; however, if the Commissioner is satisfi ed that the purchaser has paid less than such price, by such evidence as the Commissioner may require, he may assess and collect the tax upon the basis of the sale price so found by him. In no case shall such lesser price include credits for trade-in or any other transaction of such nature. B. In the case of the sale or use of a motor vehicle which is not a new motor vehicle, the Commissioner may employ such publications, sources of information, and other data as are customarily employed in ascertaining the maximum sale price of such used motor vehicles but in no case shall any credit be allowed for trade-in, prior rental or any other transaction of like nature. C. In the case of the sale or use of a motor vehicle, which is not a new motor vehicle, between individuals who are not required to be licensed as dealers or salespersons under the provisions of § 46.2-1508, the Commissioner may collect the tax upon the basis of th e total sale price as established by such evidence as the Commissioner may require; provided that if such motor vehicle is no more than five years old and is listed in a recognized pricing guide, the total sale price shall not be less than the value list ed in such pricing guide for such vehicle, less an allowance of $1,500, unless the purchaser shall execute an affidavit under penalty of perjury stating a lesser total sale price and declaring such sale or use to be a bona fide transaction for full value .

The 1999 amendment by c. 971, applicable for tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2002, in subsection A, substituted 58.1-2609 for 58.1-2608, a ny increase in, substituted equalized assessed valuation of the property of any public service corporation or other person with property assessed pursuant to this chapter for assessed valuation of any public service corporation property,  and deleted the last two sentences, which read: On January 1, 1967, one-twentieth, and on each subsequent January 1 for nineteen years an additional one-twentieth, of the assessed valuation on January 1, 1966, (reduced by forty percent of the va lue of the amount, if any, by which total retirements since January 1, 1966, exceed total additions since that date), shall be assessed by application of the local assessment ratio as provided above, and the remainder shall continue to be assessed by app lication of the forty percent assessment ratio as heretofore administered.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under prior law. Constitutionality.  Subsection A of this section does not contravene constitutional requirements of uniformity and fair market value. This section merely reflects the General Assemb lys intent to achieve uniformity of assessments upon real property owned by public service corporations. And, as has been repeatedly held, when it is impossible to achieve both fair market value and uniformity, the preferred standard is uniformity. C ounty of Louisa v. VEPCO, 249 Va. 351, 457 S.E.2d 100, 1995 Va. LEXIS 70 (1995). Purpose.  This section is designed to equalize, over a 20-year period, the assessment of the property of public service corporations with the ratios in force in the localit ies where the properties are located. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 692, 179 S.E.2d 623, 1971 Va. LEXIS 244 (1971). This section is designed to equalize gradually, over a period of 20 years, the assessment of all public service corporation property with the respective ratios in force in localities where the properties are located. It provides that all future increases in assessed valuations of public service company properties must be made by application of the local assessment ratio in the taxing jurisdiction where the proper ty is located. In addition, each year, beginning January 1, 1966, 1/20th of the 1966 assessed valuation is to be assessed at the local ratio and the remainder of the valuation continues to be assessed by application of the 40% assessment ratio as heretof ore administered. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 210, 176 S.E.2d 578, 1970 Va. LEXIS 236 (1970). Commission not authorized to increase values to produce predetermined revenue.  The enactment of this section did not authorize the commission to increase fair market value of property so that the assessment ratio would produce a predetermine d tax revenue. It merely required that the true local assessment ratio be applied when any increase in valuation of public service property was made and that certain additional steps be taken to accomplish a 20-year equalization. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R. v. SCC, 219 Va. 301, 247 S.E.2d 408, 1978 Va. LEXIS 192 (1978). Department determines, commission applies, assessment ratio.  The Department of Taxation, not the State Corporation Commission, is empowered to determine and publish the local assessment ratio, and the Commission must apply that ratio. County of Louisa v. VEPCO, 249 Va. 351, 457 S.E.2d 100, 1995 Va. LEXIS 70 (1995). Use of additive factor in assessing railroad property unconstitutional.  Where the commission assessed the land of a railroad in Arlington County for 1975 by comparing the land with other land in the locality, calculating a preliminary unit value, adjusted for characteristics peculiar to railroad land, multiplying the unit value by the number of units, and multiplying this value by an additive factor in an effort to achieve equalization of assessments and thus taxes with neighboring p roperty, the use of the additive factor was in violation of Va. Const., Art. X, § 2, requiring that all assessments of real estate shall be at fair market value, since the factor increased a previously determined appraisal of fair market value for the assessment zone in question. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R. v. SCC, 219 Va. 301, 247 S.E.2d 408, 1978 Va. LEXIS 192 (1978). Burden in attack ing unlawful method of assessment.  In attacking on appeal an unlawful method used in assessing real property of a railroad, the railroad did not have the burden of establishing that the assessment was out of line generally with other neighborhood properties which bear some relation to the railroad land in character and use. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R. v. SCC, 219 Va. 301, 247 S.E.2d 408, 1978 Va. LEXIS 192 (1978). Cost-less-depreciation method employed only when competent market data unavailable.  Assessments of public service corporations are not limited to the cost-less-depreciation method. To the contrary, this method is employed only when competent mark et data is unavailable. Lake Monticello Serv. Co. v. Board of Supvrs., 233 Va. 111, 353 S.E.2d 767, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1965, 1987 Va. LEXIS 144 (1987) (see also Lake Monticello Serv. Co. v. Board of Supvrs., 237 Va. 434, 377 S.E.2d 446 (1989)). Assessment at 40% of fair market value sustained.  The action of the State Corporation Commission in applying to the property of the Virginia and Southwestern Railway Company the equalization ratio of 40% of its a ctual fair market value was sustained in Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 210, 176 S.E.2d 578 (1970).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_58.1-2605"><akn:num>§ 58.1-2605</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 2002, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>502, effective January 1, 2003.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_58.1-2606"><akn:num>§ 58.1-2606</akn:num><akn:heading>Local taxation of real and tangible personal property of public service corporations; other persons</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Notwithstan ding clause (iv) of subsection C of § 58.1-3660, generating equipment of solar photovoltaic projects five megawatts or less shall be taxable by a locality, at a rate determined by such locality, but shall not exceed the real estate rate applicable in that locality, and notwithstanding subsection F of § 58.1-3660, the exemption shall be as follows: 80 percent of the assessed value in the first five years in service after commencement of commercial operation, 70 percent of the assessed value in the second five years in service, and 60 percent of the assessed value for all remaining years in service. B. Notwithstan ding clause (iii) of subsection B of § 58.1-2636, solar photovoltaic projects five megawatts or less shall not be exempt from the assessment of a revenue share by ordinance of that locality, as otherwise authorized pursuant to the provisions of § 5 8.1-2636.

The cases below were decided under prior law. This section was passed pursuant to former § 176 of the Virginia Constitution. Richmon d, F. &amp; P.R.R. v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 294, 124 S.E.2d 206, 1962 Va. LEXIS 142 (1962). The power of taxation is fundamental to the very existence of the government of the stat es. The restriction that it shall not be so exercised as to deny to any the equal protection of the laws does not compel the adoption of an iron rule of equal taxation, nor prevent variety or differences in taxation, or discretion in the selection of sub jects, or the classification for taxation of properties, businesses, trades, callings, or occupations. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 210, 176 S.E.2d 578, 1970 Va. LEXIS 236 (1970). Reasonable and natural classifications may be made.  Neither the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution nor the equality and uniformity requirements of state constitutions prohibit the making of classifica tions in state legislation relating to taxation. The power of a state to make reasonable and natural classifications for purposes of taxation is clear and not questioned. Such classifications may be made with respect to the subjects of taxation generally , the kinds of property to be taxed, the rates to be levied or the amounts to be raised, or the methods of assessment, valuation, and collection. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 210, 176 S.E.2d 578, 1970 Va. LEXIS 236 (1970). Franchise value expressly excluded.  That the valuation of the property of a railroad should be reduced by the value of the railroads franchise is an untenable position. The franchise value is ex pressly excluded by this section. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R. v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 294, 124 S.E.2d 206, 1962 Va. LEXIS 142 (1962). The duty to determine value and assess properties of public service corporations is a co ntinuing responsibility that must be performed annually. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 210, 176 S.E.2d 578, 1970 Va. LEXIS 236 (1970). Ascertaini ng value of roadbed of railway corporation.  The State Corporation Commission is charged by this section with the annual responsibility of ascertaining and assessing in the manner prescribed by law the value of the roadbed of each railway corporation. It accomplishes this task by its own investigation and inquiry, and by requiring that certain data be provided by the railroads operating in the State. With the information collected, the Commission then deter mines the value of the property. In making this determination it has been the practice of the Commission to assess the real estate and tangible personal property of public service corporations at an amount equal to 40% of its fair market value. The Commi ssion then certifies its assessments to the governing bodies of the several counties, cities and towns of the State, and they impose the local tax rate and collect the taxes based on the 40% assessment. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 210, 176 S.E. 2d 578, 1970 Va. LEXIS 236 (1970). Before relief can be given it must appear that the assessment is out of line generally w ith other neighborhood properties, which in character and use bear some relation to that of a petitioner. It is not enough to show that it is valued above a rate apportioned to another nearby lot. The inequality must be not only out of line but out of li ne generally. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 210, 176 S.E.2d 578, 1970 Va. LEXIS 236 (1970). Assessment at 40% of fair market value sustained.  The action of the State Corporation Commission in applying to the property of the Virginia and Southwestern Railway Company the equalization ratio of 40% of its a ctual fair market value was sustained in Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 210, 176 S.E.2d 578 (1970). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Property must be owned by a railroad or a railway company.  The exemption afforded under subdivision C 1 of § 58.1-3703 does not apply to the subsidiary of a Class I railroad that operates a transloading facility unless it was certified by the Interstate Commerce Commission during that agencys existence or is registered with the Surface Transportation Board for insurance purposes. The application of § 58.1-2607 depends on who owns the real and tangible property being taxed. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Deborah F. Williams, Commissioner of the Revenue, County of Spotsylvania, 11-110, 2013 Va.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. No provision for determining fair market value of franchise.  Since the annual franchise tax upon railroads is based on gross receipts, no provision is made for an appraisal or determination of the fair market value of the f ranchise either by the Constitution or by statute. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 692, 179 S.E.2d 623, 1971 Va. LEXIS 244 (1971). Agreement for compensati on for use of streets.  An ordinance granted defendant the right to locate, lay, construct, operate and maintain its street railway within a city, and in consideration of the rights, pri vileges and franchises granted, required the payment, as license taxes were paid, of a stated percentage of defendants gross receipts. Defendant contended that the payment provided for was that of a franchise or license tax, and therefore not collect ible under the State Constitution and statutes. It was held that the language of the ordinance made an agreement between the parties for compensation for the use of the streets of the city, within this section and former § 177 of the Constitution.

There is nothing in § 58.1-2627.1 or in this section which permits, or requires, the assessment of only a portion of the gross receipts deri ved from distributive sales. Nothing in either § 58.1-2627.1 or this section purports to limit the tax to revenue from sales for a specific use. To the contrary, once it is established that the corporation is engaged in the business of furnishing elec tricity or gas for heat, light or power, this section imposes the tax upon the corporations gross receipts from all sources. The sole limitation is that the receipts be derived from business in this state. Commonwealth Natural Resources, Inc. v. Comm onwealth, 219 Va. 529, 248 S.E.2d 791, 1978 Va. LEXIS 210 (1978).

For related discussion, see 7A M.J. Eminent Domain, § 26. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Definitions not mutually exclusive.  Notwithstanding the phrase other than a pipeline transmission company in the definition of distribution company in § 58.1-2600, the General Ass embly did not intend the definitions to be mutually exclusive, thus, they are not. A single pipeline company may engage in different activities which will qualify the company both as a pipeline distribution company and a pipeline transmission company for taxation purposes. Under those circumstances, the company will be considered a distribution company for property tax assessment purposes and must file its property tax report with the Commission, including a report of its gross receipts. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. SCC, 243 Va. 301, 414 S.E.2d 827, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2220, 1992 Va. LEXIS 19 (1992). Purchaser.  For taxation purposes, the word purchaser as used in the definition of pipeline distribution company in § 58.1-2600 means a retail gas sales cu stomer of the pipeline company. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. SCC, 243 Va. 301, 414 S.E.2d 827, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2220, 1992 Va. LEXIS 19 (1992). The Commission assesses value, and value only. None of the statutes requires the Commiss ion to classify and assess property as real or tangible personal property. The classification of property on the Commissions statement of valuations in no way purports to classify property as real or personal. The purpose of the Commissions state ment is to show the character of the property so it can be identified by description to separate the items of property. It is the function of the assessing officer in each locality to classify the property as real or tangible personal property. Transcont inental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Prince William County, 210 Va. 550, 172 S.E.2d 757, 1970 Va. LEXIS 161 (1970). Basis of tax classification.  Doing business in Virginia is not the basis of the tax classification involved under this section, but rather the authority of the company to carry on its operati ons in Virginia. Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 517, 145 S.E.2d 227, 1965 Va. LEXIS 228 (1965). Virginia, as the state of incorporation, had power to levy an ad valorem tax on all of a pipeline companys taxable intangibles, even though the companys c ommercial domicile was in another state which might on that account also have the power to tax such property. Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 517, 145 S.E.2d 227, 1965 Va. LEXIS 228 (1965). Franchise ta x not dependent upon number of users, etc.  The language of this statute clearly shows that the legislature intended to impose the tax on the pipeline transmission company distributing and selling natural g as to local trade for heat, light or power without reference to the number of users or customers the company may have or the amount or volume of the business done. Commonwealth Natural Resources, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 529, 248 S.E.2d 791, 1978 Va . LEXIS 210 (1978).

LEXIS 144 (1987) (see also Lake Monticello Serv. Co. v. Board of Supvrs., 237 Va. 434, 377 S.E.2d 446 (1989)). Where the property itself has been so committed to a particular use that it cannot econo mically be devoted to any other use, its fee simple and market value have been affected. Lake Monticello Serv.

The cost of the individual components of property making up the system makes no differen ce in assessing the fair market value of the system unless the evidence shows that any such component could be removed from its present location at a cost less than its fair market value after removal. Lake Monticello Serv. Co. v. Board of Supvrs., 237 V a. 434, 377 S.E.2d 446, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1998, 1989 Va. LEXIS 37 (1989). The fact that a property is a burden to a seller who is anxious to be rid of it, and tha t the buyer is relatively disinterested because of the propertys lack of profitability, is perhaps one of the strongest and most compelling influences on the fair market value of the property.

Purpose of classification of propert y.  Such property, in the second sentence of this section, means all of its real and personal property of every description. There follows an enumerat ion of the types of property to be listed under separate heads. It is evident that the purpose of such classification is not to exempt such property from taxation, but to make the duty of the railway companies so plain that they could not overlook report ing all of their property.

Section is expression of legislative intent with respect to similar tax.  While this section in terms is confined to railway and canal corporations and has no application to electric utilities, it is a plain expression of legisl ative intent with respect to a similar tax, such as that imposed by § 58.1-2690, on another class of public service corporations similarly situated.

Exemptio n or reduction in value of property classified.  There is no provision of Virginia law purporting to exempt from taxation any property classified under this section, nor any provision requiring or permitting a r eduction in value of such property because of zoning or any other restrictions or limitations upon noncarrier uses. Assessment of railroad property would be impossible if the commission first had to determine present or future availability for alternate uses. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R. v.

Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. To establish a tax situs in nondomiciliary states, the taxpayer must prove either that c ertain of its property moved through those states on fixed and regular routes or must prove that certain of its property was habitually employed in the other states in substantial numbers over irregular routes; whichever approach is taken, the taxpayer m ust show the average number of railcars used in the other states.

Ed. 2d 1005, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 27 85 (1989). Location of property out-of-state.  A taxpayer cannot meet its burden of proof of another tax situs simply by proving that the property in question was outside of the domiciliary state during the pe rtinent tax year. Winchester &amp; W.R.R. v. SCC, 236 Va. 473, 374 S.E.2d 66, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1105, 1988 Va. LEXIS 151 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1099, 109 S. Ct. 2450, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1005, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 2785 (1989).

Ed. 2d 1005, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 2785 (1989). Ascertainment of property values is a matter of pure opinion and the courts must, within reasonable bounds, permit the exercise of that opinion, lest they be converted into boards of assessment thereby arrogating to themselves the function of the duly constituted tax authorities.

Use of unit method technique.  Because the State Tax Commissioners use of the unit method technique for appraising railroad real estate did not reflect the fair market value of the real estate in its particular location, his assessments were invalid and could not be sustained. County Bd. v. Commonwealth Dep't of Taxation, 240 Va. 108, 393 S.E.2d 194, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2637, 1990 Va. LEXIS 89 (1990). Co nsideration of highest and best use for fair market value.  Generally, in assessing real estate for local taxation, the commissioner should seek to determine its fair market value by a consideration of its highest and best use in its particular location.

Appraisal by com parison with similar private land.  The commissions basic system of determining the appraised value of railroad land by comparing it with similar private land which has been appraised by the loc ality was proper.

Richmond, F. &amp; P.R .R. v. SCC, 219 Va. 301, 247 S.E.2d 408, 1978 Va. LEXIS 192 (1978). Burden not carried.  A theory advanced by a railroad that because of the dense development in the area surrounding the subject property, a different methodology is preferable in Arlin gton County from that used elsewhere in the State by the commission was not sufficient to carry the burden of proving the commissions method erroneous where the record showed that the assessment system used for the subject property was the same metho d employed uniformly by the commission for other railroad property throughout the Commonwealth.

Purpose of article.  This article authorizes a levy of two tenths of one percent on gross receipts of certain public service corporations. This is a service or valuation tax levied fo r the specific purpose of raising funds to be expended by the Commission in making independent appraisals and valuations of property of corporations against whom the tax is assessed. VEPCO v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 688, 194 S.E. 775, 1938 Va. LEXIS 243 (1 938). Tax on gross receipts from mere transfer of gas erroneous.  An order of the State Corporation Commission which permitted the imposition of special taxes upon the gross receipts of a public service corporation operating a n atural gas pipeline, including receipts from the mere transfer of gas as well as from sales of gas, was erroneous, as special taxes could be assessed under this section only upon gross receipts from sales of gas.

This section does not exclude a remedy afforded by another statute when the two statutes differ materially with respect to the nature of the tax assessed and the circumstances under which relief may be sought. City of Alexandria v. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R., 223 Va. 293, 288 S.E.2d 457, 1982 Va. LEXIS 202 (1982). Circuit court does not have jurisdiction to entertain an application filed under § 58.1-3984 by a public service corporation to correct a local real estate tax levy on grounds that the underlying evaluation made by the SCC was erroneous, absent review and correction of the SCCs evaluation by the Supreme Court. City of Alexandr ia v. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R., 223 Va. 293, 288 S.E.2d 457, 1982 Va. LEXIS 202 (1982). Th is section does not deal with classification of property.  This section has no application to a contention that a county erroneously classified and levied a tax on certain property as tangible personal property instead of as real property. This section deals with the value or tax placed on property by the Commission and not with the classification of the property. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Prince William County, 210 Va. 550, 172 S.E.2d 757, 1970 Va. LEXIS 1 61 (1970). Remedy under this section not excl usive.  Application for refund of the gross receipts tax imposed on an express company under former § 58-547, filed within the one-year period of limitation prescribed by § 58.1-2030, was properly and timely taken, and there was no merit to the contention that the taxpayers exclusive remedy was under this section, which prescribes a three-month period of limitation.

Such petition must be filed within th ree months after the Department of Taxation gives notice of the applicable prevailing local assessment ratios to all counties, cities, towns, and to the Commission pursuant to subsection A of § 58.1-2604. This section shall apply only to counties, ci ties and towns in which a public service corporations property represents twenty-five percent or more of the total assessed value of real estate in such county, city or town. B. Any proceed ing maintained under this section shall name the Department of Taxation and the applicable public service corporation, other entity whose property is assessed by the State Corporation Commission or the Department of Taxation, and the county, city or town which is the taxing district, as respondents. The action shall be conducted in accordance with the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia applicable to suits in equity, and no trial by jury will be permitted. C. If the Circ uit Court finds the local assessment ratio as ascertained by the Department of Taxation to be erroneous, it shall determine the correct local assessment ratio and shall order the Department of Taxation to adopt the corrected ratio as its prevailing local assessment ratio and provide such corrected ratio to the Commission in accordance with subsection A of § 58.1-2604. D. If a suit i s commenced by any party under this section, the period of time for any county, city, town or public service corporation or other entity whose property is assessed by the State Corporation Commission in which to file a petition with the Commission, pursu ant to § 58.1-2670, challenging the ascertainment of, or the assessment for taxation of, the value of any property of any public service corporation assessed by the Commission, shall commence to run on the date of the final order entered by the Circui t Court or, in the event of an appeal, on the date of the final order of the Supreme Court of Virginia.

Text A. Except as p rovided in subsection C, every motor carrier shall pay a road tax per gallon equivalent to the cents per gallon credit for diesel fuel as determined under subsection A of § 58.1-2706 for the relevant period plus an additional amount per gallon, as det ermined by subsection B, calculated on the amount of motor fuel, diesel fuel or liquefied gases (which would not exist as liquids at a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit and a pressure of 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute), used in its operations wi thin the Commonwealth.The tax imposed by this chapter shall be in addition to all other taxes of whatever character imposed on a motor carrier by any other provision of law. B. The additio nal amount per gallon shall be determined by the Commissioner annually, effective July 1 of each year. On July 1, 2019, the additional amount per gallon shall be calculated by multiplying the average fuel economy by $0.01125. On July 1, 2020, and each Ju ly 1 thereafter, the additional amount per gallon shall be calculated by multiplying the average fuel economy by $0.0225. The additional amount per gallon shall be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent. For purposes of this subsection, average f uel economy shall be calculated by dividing the total taxable miles driven in the Commonwealth by the total taxable gallons of fuel consumed in the Commonwealth, as reported in IFTA returns in the preceding taxable year. C. In lieu of the tax imposed in subsection A, motor carriers registering qualified highway vehicles that are not registered under the International Registration Plan shall pay a fee of $150 per year for each qualified highway vehicle regardless of whether such vehicl e will be included on the motor carriers IFTA return. For the period of July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020, the fee shall be adjusted based on the percent change in the road tax imposed pursuant to subsection A from June 30, 2019, to July 1, 2019. T he Commissioner shall adjust the fee annually on July 1 of every year thereafter based on the percentage change in the road tax imposed pursuant to subsection A for the previous fiscal year as compared to the current fiscal year. The fee is due and payab le when the vehicle registration fees are paid pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 (§ 46.2-685 et seq.) of Chapter 6 of Title 46.2.If a vehicle becomes a qualified highway vehicle before the end of its registration period, the fee due at the time the vehicle becomes a qualified highway vehicle shall be prorated monthly to the registration expiration month. Fees paid under this subsection shall not be refunded unless a full refund of the registration fee paid is authorized by law. D. All taxes a nd fees paid under the provisions of this chapter shall be deposited into the Commonwealth Transportation Fund established pursuant to § 33.2-1524. History History.

Every motor carrier subject to the road tax shall be entitled to a credit on such tax on every gallon of motor fuel, diesel fuel and liquefied gases purchased by such carrier within the Commonwealth for use in its operations either within or without the Commonwealt h and upon which the motor fuel, diesel fuel or liquefied gases tax imposed by the laws of the Commonwealth has been paid by such carrier. Evidence of the payment of such tax in such form as may be required by, or is satisfactory to, the Department shall be furnished by each carrier claiming the credit herein allowed. The credit for diesel fuel shall be at a cents per gallon rate equivalent to the tax imposed under subsection B of § 58.1-2217 for the relevant period as converted by the Commissioner t o a cents per gallon tax for purposes of this credit. The credit for all other motor fuels and liquefied gases shall be at a cents per gallon rate equivalent to the tax imposed under subsection A of § 58.1-2217 for the relevant period as converted by the Commissioner to a cents per gallon tax for purposes of this credit. B. When the am ount of the credit to which any motor carrier is entitled for any quarter exceeds the amount of the tax for which such carrier is liable for the same quarter, the excess may: (i) be allowed as a credit on the tax for which such carrier would be otherwise liable for any of the eight succeeding quarters or (ii) be refunded, upon application, duly verified and presented and supported by such evidence as may be satisfactory to the Department. C. The Departm ent may allow a refund upon receipt of proper application and review. It shall be at the discretion of the Department to determine whether an audit is required. D. The refund may be allowed without a formal hearing if the amount of refund is agreed to by the applicant. Otherwise, a formal hearing on the application shall be held by the Department after notice of not less than 10 days to the applicant and the Attorney General. E. Whenever an y refund is ordered it shall be paid out of the Highway Maintenance and Operating Fund established pursuant to § 33.2-1530. F. Whenever a person operating under lease to a motor carrier to perform transport services on behalf of the carrier purchases motor fuel, diesel fuel or liquefied gases relating to such services, such payments or purchases may, at the discretion of the Department, be considered payment or purchases by the carrier.

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the reference to the Highway Maintenance and Operating Fund was updated to conform to Acts 2014, c. 805. The 1999 amendment, in subsection A, deleted or following motor fuel, substituted and for or ten cents per gallon on preceding liquefied gases, and inserted the preceding motor fuel, diesel fuel. The 2007 amendments. The 2007 amendment by c. 896 substituted seventeen and one-half cents for sixteen cents in subsection A. The 2013 amendments. The 2013 amendment by c. 766, in subsection A, substituted such tax on every gallon of motor fuel, for such tax equivalent to seventeen and one-half c ents per gallon on all motor fuel, in the first sentence, and added the third and fourth sentences; and made a stylistic change. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. This section is designed to encourage motor carriers to purchase their motor fuel in Virginia commensurate with their use of Virginia highways. Commonwealth v. Baltimore Tank Lines, 221 Va. 651, 272 S.E.2d 220, 1980 Va. LEXIS 287 (1980). The relief provided for in this section is a matter of grace, and except for the statute , there is no relief. Lemmon Transp. Co. v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 416, 65 S.E.2d 537, 1951 Va. LEXIS 188 (1951). Any quarter defined.  The words any quarter, used in the time limitation provision of this section, mean the quarter for which the motor carrier has an excess credit. Lemmon Tr ansp. Co. v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 416, 65 S.E.2d 537, 1951 Va. LEXIS 188 (1951). Time limitation.  Appellant, a common carrier in interstate commerce, purchased all of the gasoline used by it for the year 1949 in Virginia, and the Virginia motor fuel tax was pa id thereon. On April 26, 1950, appellant paid to the state of North Carolina an amount assessed by that state for the use of its roads for the year 1949. On May 11, 1950, appellant, under authority of this section, filed an application for refund of the tax paid Virginia, contending that the 90-day period (180 days since the 1952 amendment) in the statute began to run from the date of the payment to the state of North Carolina, that being within 90 days from the end of the quarter in which it could be s hown that the tax had been paid to another state. The construction contended for by appellant would make virtually meaningless the limitation written in the statute, and the time limitation within which the State of Virginia refunded taxes would be wholl y dependent upon payment to another state. To accept such construction in refunding Virginia taxes would result in uncertainty and possibly an unanticipated drain on Virginias treasury, and appellants contention was without merit.

The surety shall be a corporation authorized to write surety bonds in Virginia. So long as the bond remains in force the Department may order refunds to the motor carrier in the amounts appearing to be due on appli cations duly filed by the carrier under this chapter (§ 58.1-2700 et seq.) without first auditing the records of the carrier. The surety shall be liable for all omitted taxes assessed pursuant to § 58.1-2025 against the carrier, including the penal ties and interest provided in such section, even though the assessment is made after cancellation of the bond, but only for taxes due and payable while the bond was in force and penalties and interest on the taxes.

The tax on consumers under this section shall not be imposed on consumers served by an electric utility owned or operated by a municipality if such municipal electric utility elects to have an amount equivalent to the tax added on the bill such utility (or an association or agency of which it is a member) pays for bundled or unbundled transmission service as a separate item. Such amount, equivalent to the tax, shall be calculated unde r the tax rate schedule as if the municipal electric utility were selling and collecting the tax from its consumers, adjusted to exclude the amount which represents the local consumption tax if the locality in which a consumer is located does not impose a license fee rate pursuant to § 58.1-3731, and shall be remitted to the Commission pursuant to § 58.1-2901. Municipal electric utilities may bundle the tax in the rates charged to their retail customers. Notwithstanding anything contained herein t o the contrary, the election permitted under this subdivision shall not be exercised by any municipal electric utility if the entity to whom the municipal electric utility (or an association or agency of which it is a member) pays for transmission servic e is not subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, unless such entity agrees to remit to the Commonwealth all amounts equivalent to the tax pursuant to § 58.1-2901. 6. The tax on consumers set forth in subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 shall only be imposed in accordance with this subdivision on consumers of electricity purchased from a utility consumer servi ces cooperative to the extent that such cooperative purchases, for the purpose of resale within the Commonwealth, electricity from a federal entity that made payments in accordance with federal law (i) in lieu of taxes during such taxable period to the C ommonwealth and (ii) on the basis of such federal entitys gross proceeds resulting from the sale of such electricity. Such tax shall instead be calculated by deducting from each of the respective tax amounts calculated in accordance with subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 an amount equal to the calculated tax amount multiplied by the ratio of the total cost of power supplied by the federal entity, including facilities rental, during the taxable period to the utility consumer services cooperatives total op erating revenue within the Commonwealth during the taxable period. The State Corporation Commission may audit the records and books of any utility consumer services cooperative that determines the tax on consumers in accordance with this subdivision to v erify that the tax imposed has been correctly determined and properly remitted. B. The tax aut horized by this chapter shall not apply to municipalities own use or to use by divisions or agencies of federal, state and local governments. C. For purpose s of this section, kilowatt hours delivered means in the case of eligible customer-generators, as defined in § 56-594, those kilowatt hours supplied from the electric grid to such customer-generators, minus the kilowatt hours generated and fed back to the electric grid by such customer-generators.

The provide r of billing services shall collect the tax from the consumer by adding it as a separate charge to the consumers monthly statement. Until the consumer pays the tax to such provider of billing services, the tax shall constitute a debt of the consumer to the Commonwealth, localities, and the State Corporation Commission. If any consumer receives and pays for electricity but refuses to pay the tax on the bill that is imposed by § 58.1-2900, the provider of billing services shall notify the State Cor poration Commission of the name and address of such consumer. If any consumer fails to pay a bill issued by a provider of billing services including the tax that is imposed by § 58.1-2900, the provider of billing services shall follow its normal colle ction procedures with respect to the charge for electric service and the tax, and upon collection of the bill or any part thereof shall (i) apportion the net amount collected between the charge for electric service and the tax and (ii) remit the tax port ion to the State Corporation Commission and the appropriate locality. After the consumer pays the tax to the provider of billing services, the taxes collected shall be deemed to be held in trust by such provider until remitted to the State Corporation Co mmission and the appropriate locality.When determining the amount of tax to collect from consumers of an electric utility that is a cooperative which purchases, for the purpose of resale within the Commonwealth, electricity from a federal entity that mad e payments during such taxable period to the Commonwealth in lieu of taxes in accordance with a federal law requiring such payments to be calculated on the basis of such federal entitys gross proceeds from the sale of electricity, the provider of bil ling services shall deduct from each of the respective tax amounts calculated in accordance with § 58.1-2900 an amount equal to the calculated tax amounts multiplied by the ratio that the total cost of the power, including facilities rental, supplied by said federal entity to said cooperative for resale within the Commonwealth bears to said cooperatives total operating revenue within the Commonwealth for the taxable period. The State Corporation Commission may audit the records and books of said cooperative to verify that the tax imposed by this chapter has been correctly determined and properly remitted. B. A provider of billing services shall remit monthly to the Commission the amount of tax paid during the preceding month by the provider of billing services consumers, except for (i) amounts added on the bills to utilities owned and operated by municipalities whi ch are collected by the entity providing transmission directly to such utilities (or an association or agency of which the municipality is a member), which they shall remit directly to the Commission and (ii) the portion which represents the local consum ption tax, which portion shall be remitted to the locality in which the electricity was consumed and shall be based on such localitys license fee rate which it imposed. Amounts of the tax that are added on the bills to utilities owned and operated by municipalities, which are collected by the entity providing transmission directly to such utilities (or an association or agency of which the municipality is a member), shall be remitted monthly by such entity to the Commission, except that the portion which represents the local consumption tax shall be remitted to the locality in which the electricity was consumed and shall be based on such localitys license fee rate which it imposed. C. The electri c utility consumption tax shall be remitted monthly, on or before the last day of the succeeding month of collection.

CASE NOTES Sections 58.1-3984 through 58.1-3989 provide a satisfactory and adequate remedy for the individual taxpayer, and this section provides an ample remedy in all cases in which the citizens of the entire county or of any district feel themselves aggrieved by an alleged illegal tax.

LEXIS 197 (1950) (decided under prior law). Tax is invalid only as to excess over authorized rate.  If a local tax, legal and regular in other respects and designated for a single purpose, is levied in excess of the authorized rate, the tax is not thereby render ed invalid as to the whole amount, but only as to the excess.

Town of Appalachia, 131 Va. 357, 108 S.E. 660, 1921 Va. LEXIS 29 (1921). Town may impose local property tax.  This section authorizes the towns, as well as the cities, of the state, to impose a local property tax for town purposes on all property in contemplation of law w ithin the corporate limits, and not segregated by the state for state taxation. Subject to the last-stated limitation, this section confers a general power of taxation on the towns. Merchants capital, not having been segregated by the state for state taxation, is intangible personal property, taxable as such by the towns under their general power of taxation. Virginia Whsle. Co. v. Town of Appalachia, 131 Va. 357, 108 S.E. 660, 1921 Va. LEXIS 29 (1921). It may tax capital of merchants.  Inasmuch as the capital of merchants is property not segregated for state taxation, it is subject to town taxation. The words subject to local taxation in this section are used in the meaning of not segregated for state taxation under the segregation act, and do not indicate that a town must look elsewhere than to this section in order to find the statute law which authorizes the local taxation by the tow n.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. This section embraces both tangible and intangible personal property. Taylor v. Commonwea lth, 124 Va. 445, 98 S.E. 5, 1919 Va. LEXIS 135 (1919). The objects and purposes of this section, in designating by whom property of minors, idi ots and lunatics is to be listed and to whom taxed, are to provide a competent person to list the property for taxation and also to act as payer of the taxes thereon, who will be likewise a person competent to give a correct list and one who, if not the owner, will be charged with responsibility to the property owner in the premises. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 445, 98 S.E. 5, 1919 Va. LEXIS 135 (1919). This section does not make the domicile of the guardian the situs for taxation of the in tangible personal property of the ward, which is in the possession or under the control of the guardian. The provisions of the section concern merely by whom the property is to be listed and to whom taxed. It is apparent that the section does not fix the domicile of the person by whom it requires property to be listed, and to whom it requires it to be taxed, as the situs of the property for taxation. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 445, 98 S.E. 5, 1919 Va. LEXIS 135 (1919). Nor does it divest the ward of his beneficial ownership of such property. Where a ward i s domiciled in this state, therefore, his domicile fixes the situs of his intangible personal property for taxation therein, although his guardian is a nonresident. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 445, 98 S.E. 5, 1919 Va. LEXIS 135 (1919). It fixes situs of intangib les held by trustee.  This section undertakes to fix the situs for taxation of intangible property held by a trustee for the benefit of a person over 21 (now 18) years of age. The situ s sought to be fixed is a situs in this state. Ellett v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 136, 110 S.E. 358, 1922 Va. LEXIS 12 (1922). Intangible personal property in hands of nonresident trustee.  Intangible personal property in the hands of a nonresident trustee in the income from which a person over the age of 21 (now 18) years residing in this state has a life estate, is by virtue of this section taxable in this state. The tax, though assessed in the name of the trustee, is not against him, but against the beneficiary, and is therefore constitutional. Selden v. Brooke, 104 Va. 832, 52 S.E. 632, 1906 Va. LEXIS 152 (1906); Wise v. Commonwealth, 122 Va. 693, 95 S.E. 632, 1918 Va. LEXIS 136, cert. denied, 248 U.S. 582, 39 S. Ct. 287, 63 L. Ed. 432, 1918 U.S. LEXIS 1669 (1918) (see also Ellett v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 136, 110 S.E. 358, 1922 Va. LEXIS 12 (1 922). Listing trust property in name of life tenant is not prejudicial.  In an action between a taxpayer and the Commonwealth, it was objected that under the provisions of this section the assessment should have been listed in the name of the trustee and not that of the life tenant. It was held that it was wholly immaterial to the life tenant whether the tax was assessed to and paid by the trustees or the life tenant, and one liable to assessment for taxes cannot evade payment by reas on of errors or irregularities which do not prejudice his rights.

For the pur poses of this section, third-party tax payment agreement means any agreement whereby a third party contracts with a taxpayer to pay to a county, city or town on behalf of that taxpayer the local taxes, charges, fees or other obligations due and o wing to the county, city or town. Such agreement may have as its subject current taxes, charges, fees and obligations, delinquent taxes, penalties and interest, or any combination of the foregoing. B. The treasur er of any county, city or town may enter into agreements authorizing third parties to offer to taxpayers within such locality third-party tax payment agreements, provided that such agreements meet the following requirements: 1. Every third-party tax payment agreement shall be in writing, in a form approved by the treasurer of the locality, and shall provide for the payment of the taxes which are the subject of such agreement by the third party directly to the treasurer of the county , city or town within ten days of the acceptance of a duly executed agreement by the third party. 2. Third-party tax payment agreements shall provide for the reimbursement of the third party by the taxpayer on whose behalf taxes were paid in installments over a period not to exceed ni nety-six months, and may provide for interest, exclusive of any origination fee, at an annual rate approved by the treasurer which shall not exceed sixteen percent. Such agreements may provide for the payment by the taxpayer of an origination fee at a ra te approved by the treasurer which shall not exceed ten percent of the amount paid by the third party. No interest, excluding any origination fee paid by the taxpayer, shall accrue during the six-month period commencing on the date of the payment. This s ubdivision shall not be construed to permit the treasurer to authorize a third party to make a mortgage loan as that term is defined in § 6.2-1600. 3. No fee may be charged to or collected from the treasurer or the locality with respect to any third-party tax payment agreement. 4. The third party shall provide to the treasurer monthly status reports regarding third-party tax payment agreements entered into by taxpayers of the locality. Such reports shall include , at a minimum, a listing of all active accounts, and with respect to each account, total charges, total taxpayer payments, total amounts paid to the treasurer, and total amounts subject to recourse. A summary of the monthly report, deleting any informat ion that would identify any taxpayer and any other confidential taxpayer information, shall be retained as a public record in the treasurers office. C. In the even t that a taxpayer who is a party to a third-party tax payment agreement fails in his obligations arising under such agreement to reimburse the third party: 1. The t hird party shall be entitled to receive from the treasurer a reimbursement payment equal to all taxes paid on behalf of such taxpayer pursuant to the tax payment agreement, less all payments received by the third party from the taxpayer, exclusive of int erest and fees charged by the third party to the taxpayer pursuant to the agreement. No payment may be requested pursuant to this subsection unless the third party has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the treasurer that good-faith efforts to collect t he obligations arising under the tax payment agreement have been made and that, notwithstanding these efforts, the taxpayer is more than thirty days delinquent in his obligations arising under the agreement. 2. Any treasurer who reimburses a third party pursuant to this subsection shall reinstate the amount of such reimbursement upon the appropriate tax rolls of the locality as delinquent tax es or current taxes, as the case may be, and shall send the taxpayer written notice of such action by first-class mail to the taxpayers last known address within five business days of such reinstatement. 3. If the taxpayer fails to pay in full any sum reinstated pursuant to this section by the ordinary due date of the tax, the treasurer may apply penalties and interest in accordance with general law from the due date of the tax. 4. Any right of the third party to payment arising under a third-party tax payment agreement shall terminate upon the receipt by the third party of a reimbursement payment from the treasu rer in accordance with the terms of this subsection. D. With respec t to each third-party tax payment agreement which has as its subject, in whole or in part, real property taxes, the third party shall cause to be recorded among the land records of the circuit court in each locality within which the real property is situ ated a copy of the applicable tax payment agreement. Such agreement shall be indexed by the clerk under the name of the taxpayer or taxpayers as grantor and the name of the third party as grantee. Upon the satisfaction of all obligations arising under a tax payment agreement so recorded, the third party, within ninety days of satisfaction, shall cause to be recorded a certificate of release, setting forth the names of the taxpayer and the third party, the date of the third-party tax payment agreement, a nd the book and page at which the agreement is recorded. Any such certificate of release shall be indexed by the clerk under the name of the third party as grantor and the taxpayer as grantee. The clerk may charge a fee not to exceed thirteen dollars for the recordation of any tax payment agreement or certificate of release. E. Upon the pa yment of any tax by a third party pursuant to a tax payment agreement, the applicable period of limitation for the enforcement of each tax which is the subject of the agreement shall be tolled during any period in which outstanding obligations remain uns atisfied pursuant to the agreement.

The 2015 amendment by c. 257 substituted ninety-six months for twenty-four months in the first sentence of subdivision B 2. CASE NOTES Credit transaction.  Tax payment agreement was a credit transaction because it provided for third-party financing of a tax obligation; the appellate court interpreted the Truth in Len ding Act (TILA) and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to cover transactions like the tax payment agreement because TILA was a remedial consumer protection statute that was read liberally to achieve its goals, and the appellate court construed TILA broadly so that it would provide protection for the consumer.

The cases below were decided under prior law. This entire chapter deals exclusively with the collection and disbursement of taxes and public funds. No part thereof relates to the ownership or distribution of moneys belonging to private persons or individuals. Beckner v. Commonwealth, 174 Va. 454, 5 S.E.2d 525, 1939 Va. LEXIS 164 (1939). Whether the treasurers office shall be located at the county seat or at some other place in the county is within the sound discretion of the board of supervisors. Its decision of the question will not be disturbed in the absence of convincing proof that the board abused the discretion reposed in it. The ordinary meaning of the term may deem in this section denotes permission and not compulsion. Board of Supvrs. v. Weems, 194 Va. 10, 72 S.E.2d 378, 1952 Va.

County treasurer guilty of contempt in failure to remove office to county seat.  A county treasurer who was on a mandate from the supreme court to remove his office to the county seat was guilty of contempt, despite his disclaimer of contemptu ous intent, where he established only a token office at the county seat but continued to maintain a completely equipped office with full clerical staff in another town, where he spent most of his time and where nearly all of the business of his office wa s transacted.

Legislative intent.  The legislation in this state on the subject of county treasurers manifests an intention on the part of the legislature to hold county treasurers to a strict acco untability for the safety of public funds entrusted to their care, and the policy manifested by that legislation, as well as the weight of authority require that they shall assume all risks of loss, and be accountable for all public funds which come into their hands, except in cases where the loss results from the act of God, or the public enemy, or possibly from some other overruling necessity.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under prior law. Constitutionality.  A tax was levied under this section on a leasehold interest in property owned by the Commonwealth. Because the tax was levied on the leasehold interest, and not o n property owned by the Commonwealth, it did not violate Va. Const., Art. X, § 6 (a) (1). Shaia v. City of Richmond, 207 Va. 885, 153 S.E.2d 257, 1967 Va. LEXIS 151 (1967). Authority for section and im position of tax.  The General Assembly of Virginia had the right to enact this section, providing for taxation of a leasehold interest in property owned by state, since the enactme nt was not prohibited by the Constitution of Virginia or the United States. The enactment of this section being within the discretion of the General Assembly, the section is not rendered invalid because the imposition of taxes thereunder may result in re duced rentals on properties leased by the state. Shaia v. City of Richmond, 207 Va. 885, 153 S.E.2d 257, 1967 Va. LEXIS 151 (1967). Exemption of lessee of industrial authority property.  Section 15.1-1382 [see now § 15.2-4911] as it stood before the 1968 amendment thereto had the effect of exempting the lessee of industrial authority property f rom the payment of a leasehold interest tax imposed pursuant to this section. Neither such a lessee nor such a leasehold interest is exempted from taxation by Va. Const., Art. X, § 6, and the exemption was therefore unconstitutional. Industrial Dev. A uth. v. Suthers, 208 Va. 51, 155 S.E.2d 326, 1967 Va. LEXIS 183 (1967) (commented on in 3 U. Rich. L. Rev. 217 (1968)). Meth od of appraisal and assessment of leasehold interest.  See Shaia v. City of Richmond, 207 Va. 885, 153 S.E.2d 257, 1967 Va. LEXIS 151 (1967). Failure to follow stri ct statutory procedures.  Where countys assessment of 406 acres of Peninsula Airport Commissions (PACs) property failed to segregate, evaluate, and assess the 150-acre portion that was leased out, and the county had not made a provisional assessment, the trial court properly entered judgment in favor of PAC and ordered the county to refund the entire amount of taxes paid, since the Commissioner of the Revenue is required to fo llow strict statutory procedures in making assessments.

CASE NOTES Fair market value.  This section requires that real estate tax assessments shall be made at 100 percent of fair market value. Finnerty v. Robinson, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 425 (Va. Ct. A pp. Dec. 4, 2007). Although real estate valuations were required to be at 100 percent of the fair market value of a property under § 58.1-3201, in an action in which Chapter 13 d ebtors sought to strip off subordinate deeds of trust from their homes, a bankruptcy court determined that the tax assessments might be evidence of value, but were not determinative. Gray v. Bank of Am., N.A. (In re Gray), No. 09-14445-RGM, No. 09-1224, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 181 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Jan. 15, 2010). All assessments of real estate shall be at their fair market value, and the court concluded that the circuit court did not err in striking the taxpayers evide nce because the taxpayers burden to prove that real property was assessed at more than its fair market value necessarily required that the taxpayer establish the propertys fair market value. Because the real property at issue consisted of condomi nium units, the taxpayer was required to, but failed to, produce evidence to show the fair market value of each individual unit pursuant to § 55-79.42; moreover, to the extent there were market-driven impediments to selling the units individually and limitations on the rental income that could be realized, such factors may affect each units fair market value, but, they did not alter the statutory requirement that condominiums be treated as separate parcels of real estate and be separately assesse d, § 55-79.42, or the taxpayers burden to establish each units fair market value in order to show that its real property was assessed at more than fair market value as required by subsection A of § 58.1-3984. TB Venture, LLC v. Arlington Co unty, 280 Va. 558, 701 S.E.2d 791, 2010 Va. LEXIS 264 (2010). Transferrable development rights.  Transferrable development rights are entirely creatures of statute and they are governed by a specific statutory regime. Two things must occur for transferrable d evelopment rights to come into being. First, the county must approve an application from an eligible sending site, and, second, the county must approve a receiving site. The dedication of density or other rights, i.e., the creation of transferrable devel opment rights, occurs under § 15.2-750 when both conditions have been fulfilled. The transferrable development rights have potential value before that, but until the county approves a sending site and a receiving site, in the eyes of the law, the tran sferrable development rights remain an inchoate interest or right. Once the transferrable development rights are created by the countys approval of a sending and a receiving site, they become a right or interest in real estate under the broad definit ion found in § 1-219 and they may be taxed under § 58.1-3201. Johnson v. Arlington Cnty., 292 Va. 843, 794 S.E.2d 389, 2016 Va. LEXIS 200 (2016). Declaratory judgment action.  Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations request for a declaration that a county tax assessment was contrary to § 58.1-3201, as a declaratory judgment action was not a proper remedy for past tax assessments.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Property structure.  Because the multiplier used by a city in its sales comparison approach accounted for a propertys unique rent-utility structure, and because the owners exp erts did not overcome the presumption of validity in subsection A of § 58.1-3984, the assessments complied with Va. Const., Art X, § 2, and § 58.1-3201. Jackson Warehouse, L.P. v. City of Richmond, 80 Va. Cir. 563, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 144 (Richm ond July 13, 2010). Assessments held proper.  Disparity between a county board of supervisors assessment of a taxpayers property and the testimony of the boards expert regarding fair market value did not establish that the boards assessment was not within the range of a reasonable difference of opinion as to value, as there was no evidence the board used flawed methodology or disregarded controlling evidence in arriving at its valuations.

The express language of the statute demonstrates that it applies to property which has not been made the subject of recorded condominium instruments. Accordingly, the trial court correctly determined that this statute had no application to deve lopers property because at all times relevant to the assessments that property was a condominium and no conversion to condominium was involved.

When any re al property is exempt from taxation under Section 6 (a)(1) or (2) or by designation under Section 6 (a)(6) of Article X of the Constitution of Virginia, the leasehold interest in such property may also be exempt from taxation, provided that the property is leased to a lessee that is exempt from taxation pursuant to § 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code or to a lessee that is entitled to or has received federal rehabilitation tax credits relating to the property pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 47 or any su ccessor thereto, and is used exclusively by such lessee primarily for charitable, literary, scientific, cultural, or educational purposes.

Such real estate shall be owned by, and be occupied as the sole dwelling of anyone at least 65 years of age or if provided in the ordinance, anyone found to be permanently and totally disabled as defined in § 58.1-3217. Such ordinance may provide for the exemption from or deferral of that portion of the tax which represents the increase in tax liability since the year such taxpayer reached the age of 65 or became disabl ed, or the year such ordinance became effective, whichever is later. A dwelling jointly held by married individuals, with no other joint owners, may qualify if either spouse is 65 or over or is permanently and totally disabled, and the proration of the e xemption or deferral under § 58.1-3211.1 shall not apply for such dwelling. B. For purpose s of this section, eligible person means a person who is at least age 65 or, if provided in the ordinance pursuant to subsection A, permanently and totally disabled.

Prorated tax exemption or deferral of tax. Text A. The governi ng body of the county, city, or town may, by ordinance, also provide for an exemption from or deferral of (or combination program thereof) real estate taxes for dwellings jointly held by two or more individuals not all of whom are at least age 65 or (if provided in the ordinance) permanently and totally disabled, provided that the dwelling is occupied as the sole dwelling by all such joint owners.The tax exemption or deferral for the dwelling that otherwise would have been provided under the local ordin ance shall be prorated by multiplying the amount of the exemption or deferral by a fraction that has as a numerator the percentage of ownership interest in the dwelling held by all such joint owners who are at least age 65 or (if provided in the ordinanc e) permanently and totally disabled, and as a denominator, 100 percent. As a condition of eligibility for such tax exemption or deferral, the joint owners of the dwelling shall be required to furnish to the relevant local officer sufficient evidence of e ach joint owners ownership interest in the dwelling. B. For purpose s of this subsection, eligible person means a person who is at least age 65 or, if provided in the ordinance pursuant to subsection A, permanently and totally disabled. For purposes of the tax exemption pursuant to subsection A, real property tha t is a dwelling jointly held by two or more individuals includes real property (i) held by an eligible person in conjunction with one or more other people as tenant or tenants for life or joint lives, (ii) held in a revocable inter vivos trust over which an eligible person with one or more other people hold the power of revocation, or (iii) held in an irrevocable trust under which an eligible person in conjunction with one or more other people possesses a life estate or an estate for joint lives or enjo ys a continuing right of use or support. The term eligible person does not include any interest held under a leasehold or term of years. C. The provisi ons of this section shall not apply to dwellings jointly held by married individuals, with no other joint owners. D. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or construed to provide for an exemption from or deferral of tax for any dwelling jointly held by nonindividuals.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  In arguing that her joint tenancy with her mother was owned unequally and that extrinsic evidence was necessary to determine the portion owned by each joint tenan t, a Chapter 7 debtors reliance on § 58.1-3211.1 was misplaced, as that provision confined its applicability to tax relief and nothing in that provision suggested that it negated § 55-20.1.Scott v.

If the governing body establishes an annual income limitation, the computation of annual inc ome shall be based on adding together the income received during the preceding calendar year, without regard to whether a tax return is actually filed, by (i) owners of the dwelling who use it as their principal residence, (ii) owners relatives who l ive in the dwelling, except for those relatives living in the dwelling and providing bona fide caregiving services to the owner whether such relatives are compensated or not, and (iii) at the option of each locality, nonrelatives of the owner who live in the dwelling except for bona fide tenants or bona fide caregivers of the owner, whether compensated or not. A locality may provide in its ordinance that, for the purpose of the computation of annual income, if an individual described in clause (ii) and (iii) is permanently and totally disabled, any disability income received by such person shall not be included. If the governing body establishes a net financial worth limitation, net financial worth shall be based on adding together the net financial wo rth, including the present value of equitable interests, as of December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, of the owners, and of the spouse of any owner, of the dwelling. Nothing in this section shall be construed or interpreted as to preclude or prohibit the governing body of a county, city or town from excluding certain sources of inco me, or a portion of the same, for purposes of its annual income limitation or excluding certain assets, or a portion of the same, for purposes of its net financial worth limitation. Any county, city, or town that pursuant to this article provides for the exemption from, deferral of, or a combination program of exemptions from and deferrals of real property taxes may exempt or defer the real property taxes of the qualifying dwelling and the land, not exceeding ten acres, upon which it is situated. No local ordinance shall require that a citizen reside in the jurisdiction for a designated period of time as a condition for qualifying for any real estate tax exempti on or deferral program established pursuant to § 58.1-3210.

An exemptio n or deferral enacted pursuant to § 58.1-3210 or 58.1-3211.1 may be granted for any year following the date that the qualifying individual occupying such dwelling and owning title or partial title thereto reaches the age of 65 years or for any year fo llowing the date the disability occurred.

An ordinanc e enacted pursuant to this article may provide that a change in ownership to a spouse or a nonqualifying individual, when such change resulted solely from the death of the qualifying individual, or a sale of such property shall result in a prorated exemp tion or deferral for the then current taxable year. The proceeds of the sale which would result in the prorated exemption or deferral shall not be included in the computation of net worth or income as provided in subsection A. Such prorated portion shall be determined by multiplying the amount of the exemption or deferral by a fraction wherein the number of complete months of the year such property was properly eligible for such exemption or deferral is the numerator and the number 12 is the denominator .

An ordinanc e enacted pursuant to this article may provide that an individual who does not qualify for the exemption or deferral under this article based upon the previous years income limitations and financial worth limitations, may nonetheless qualify for the current year by filing an affidavit that clearly shows a substantial change of circumstances, that was not volitional on the part of the individual to become eligible for the exemption or deferral, and will result in income and financial worth levels tha t are within the limitations of the ordinance. The ordinance may impose additional conditions and require other information under this subsection. The locality may prorate the exemption or deferral from the date the affidavit is submitted or any other da te.Any exemption or deferral under this subsection must be conditioned upon the individual filing another affidavit after the end of the year in which the exemption or deferral was granted, within a period of time specified by the locality, showing that the actual income and financial worth levels were within the limitations set by the ordinance. If the actual income and financial worth levels exceeded the limitations any exemption or deferral shall be nullified for the current taxable year and the taxa ble year immediately following.

Such ordinance may also provide for a credit for multifamily residential units which have been substantially rehabilitated by replaceme nt for multifamily use. Such replacement structures may exceed the total square footage of the replaced structures by no more than thirty percent. B. The local t ax credit shall be available only to those property owners who have purchased a structure which at the time of purchase contained property tax liens exceeding fifty percent of the assessed value of the property. The tax credit granted by the locality sha ll not exceed the amount by which the property tax liens exceeded fifty percent of the assessed value of the property at the time of purchase. The credit may be applied upon completion of the rehabilitation, renovation or replacement or on January 1 of t he year following completion of the rehabilitation, renovation or replacement and may be divided over a period of no longer than ten years. C. The governi ng body of any county, city or town may assess a fee not to exceed one hundred twenty-five dollars for residential properties, or two hundred fifty dollars for commercial, industrial, and/or apartment properties of six units or more for processing an app lication requesting the credit provided by this section.

The governi ng body of any county, city or town may, by ordinance, provide for the partial exemption from taxation of real estate on which any structure or other improvement no less than 20 years of age, or 15 years of age if the structure is located in an area desi gnated as an enterprise zone by the Commonwealth or as a technology zone by any county, city or town pursuant to § 58.1-3850, has undergone substantial rehabilitation, renovation or replacement for commercial or industrial use, subject to such conditi ons as the ordinance may prescribe. The ordinance may, in addition to any other restrictions hereinafter provided, restrict such exemptions to real property located within described zones or districts whose boundaries shall be determined by the governing body. The governing body of a county, city or town may establish criteria for determining whether real estate qualifies for the partial exemption authorized by this provision and may require the structure to be older than 20 years of age, or 15 years of age if the structure is located in an area designated as an enterprise zone by the Commonwealth, or as a technology zone by any county, city or town pursuant to § 58.1-3850 or place such other restrictions and conditions on such property as may be pr escribed by ordinance. Such ordinance may also provide for the partial exemption from taxation of real estate that has been substantially rehabilitated by complete replacement for commercial and industrial use. B.

The exemption may commence upon completion of the rehabilitation, renovation or replacement, or on January 1 of the year following completion of the rehabilitation, renovation or replacement and shall run with the real estate for a period of no longer than 15 years. The governing body of a county, city or town may place a shorter time limitation on th e length of such exemption, or reduce the amount of the exemption in annual steps over the entire period or a portion thereof, in such manner as the ordinance may prescribe. C. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to permit the commissioner of the revenue to list upon the land book any reduced value due to the exemption provided in subsection B. D. The governi ng body of any county, city or town may assess a fee not to exceed $125 for residential properties, or $250 for commercial, industrial, and/or apartment properties of six units or more, for processing an application requesting the exemption provided by t his section.

CASE NOTES Assessor s valuation policy conflicted with statute.  When taxpayers contested a city assessors valuation of the taxpayers rehabilitated real property under the citys program allowing a partial exempt ion, it was not error for a trial court to hold that a former assessors policy used to assess the property conflicted with § 58.1-3221 and former Richmond, Va., City Code § 27-83 because (1) initial rehabilitated assessed value as used in former Richmond, Va., City Code § 27-86(b), meant the first assessed value after rehabilitation, (2) the policy effectively read assessed out of former Richmond, Va., City Code § 27-83, (3) subsection B of § 58.1-3221 did not permit t his variance from the language of former Richmond, Va., City Code § 27-83, as subsection A of § 58.1-3221 did not let a city assessor establish the criteria for a tax exemption for rehabilitated real estate, and (4) nothing showed the trial court s ruling provided an exemption greater than the increase in the propertys assessed value due to rehabilitation, contrary to subsection B of § 58.1-3221.

If the uniform standards prescribed by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services pursuant to § 58.1-3230 require real estate to have been used for a particular purpose for a minimum length of time before qualifying as real estate devoted to agricultural use or horticultural use, then (i) use of other similar property by a lessee of the owner shall be included in calculating such time and (ii) the Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services s hall include in the uniform standards a shorter minimum length of time for real estate with no prior qualifying use, provided that the owner submits a written document of the owners intent regarding use of the real estate containing elements set out in the uniform standards.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Subsequent changes to land approved for conservation easement.  Under § 10.1-1011, conservation easement land covered by the provisions of the statute must meet the minimum acreage requirement of § 58.1-3233 at the time the easement is dedicated, unless the easement was placed on the property before the local land use assessment ordinance was adopted. Subsequent changes in acreage or use that are permitted under the conservation easement would not affect the continuing eligibility of the land for use assessment under subsection C of § 10.1-1011. No back taxes, including the roll-back tax, may be imposed when conservation easement land, through apparent unpermitted use or development, no longer appears to qualify for use assessment under subsection C of § 10.1-1011. However, upon the initiation of appropriate proceedings and the making of factual findings respecting the land and easement in question, such subsequent violations of the conservation easement could r ender the land ineligible for use assessment under § 10.1-1011. See opinion of Attorney General to Larry W. Davis, Esquire, County Attorney for the County of Albemarle, 12-099, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 76 (9/20/13). Land must meet minimum acreage requirement as well as requirements of § 58.1-3230.  Should a commissioner of the revenue make the factual determination that a parcel of land meets the criteria set forth in § 58.1-3230, but fails to meet the ac reage requirements of subdivision 2 of § 58.1-3233, such parcel may not qualify for use taxation and assessment.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Use value assessment.  Contiguous parcels of real estate that are titled in the same owner may be combined to form tracts of at least twenty acres devoted to forest use and at least fiv e acres devoted to agricultural use and are eligible for use value assessment. A parcel with mixed use may qualify for a land use assessment provided the use acreage meets the required minimum acreage for each land use. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Deborah F. Williams, Spotsylvania County Commissioner of the Revenue, 09-085, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 52 (12/10/09). Increase of minimum acreage for purpose of special land use taxation.  Subdivision 2 of this section authorizes a local governing body to increase the minimum acreage for land classified for open-space use for the purpose of special land use taxation, however, such an increase for land classified for agricultural, horticultural or forest use is not authorized. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Charles L. Campbell, Commissioner of the Revenue for Page County, 02-085 (1 0/30/02). Subsequent changes to land approved for conservation easement.  Under § 10.1-1011, conservation easement land covered by the provisions of the statute must meet the minimum acreage requirement of § 58.1-3233 at the time the easement is dedicated, unless the easement was placed on the property before the local land use assessment ordinance was adopted.

The p roperty owner shall submit an initial application, unless it is a revalidation form, at least 60 days preceding the tax year for which such taxation is sought; 2. In any year in which a general reassessment is being made, the property owner may submit such application until 30 days have elapsed after his notice of increase in assessment is maile d in accordance with § 58.1-3330, or 60 days preceding the tax year, whichever is later; or 3. In any locality which has adopted a fiscal tax year under Chapter 30 (§ 58.1-3000 et seq.), but continues to assess as of January 1, such application shall be submitted for any year at least 60 days preceding the effective date of the assessment for such year. The governing body, by ordinance, may permit applications to be filed within no more than 60 days after the filing deadline specified herein, upon the payment of a late filing fee to be established by the governing body. In addition, a locality may, by ordinance, permit a further extension of the filing deadline specified herein, upon payment of an extension fee to be established by the governing body in an amount not to exceed the late filing fee, to a date not later than 30 days after notices of assessments are mailed. An individual who is owner of an undivided interest in a parcel may apply on behalf of himself and the other owners of such parcel upon submitting an affidavit that such other owners are minors, cannot be located, or represent a minority interest in such parcel. An application shall be submitted whenever the use or acreage of such land previously approved changes; however, no application fee may be r equired when a change in acreage occurs solely as a result of a conveyance necessitated by governmental action or condemnation of a portion of any land previously approved for taxation on the basis of use assessment. The governing body of any locality ma y, however, require any such property owner to revalidate at least every six years with such locality, on or before the date on which the last installment of property tax prior to the effective date of the assessment is due, on forms prepared by the Depa rtment, any applications previously approved. Each locality that has adopted an ordinance hereunder may provide for the imposition of a revalidation fee every sixth year. Such revalidation fee shall not, however, exceed the application fee currently char ged by the locality. The governing body may also provide for late filing of revalidation forms on or before the effective date of the assessment, on payment of a late filing fee. Forms shall be prepared by the Department and supplied to the locality for use of the applicants and applications shall be submitted on such forms. An application fee may be required to accompany all such applications. In the event of a material misstatement of facts in the application or a material change in such facts prior to the date of assessment, such application for taxation ba sed on use assessment granted thereunder shall be void and the tax for such year extended on the basis of value determined under § 58.1-3236 D. Except as provided by local ordinance, no application for assessment based on use shall be accepted or appr oved if, at the time the application is filed, the tax on the land affected is delinquent. Upon the payment of all delinquent taxes, including penalties and interest, the application shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of this section. Continuation of valuation, assessment and taxation under an ordinance adopted pursuant to this article shall depend on continuance of the real estate in a qualifying us e, continued payment of taxes as referred to in § 58.1-3235, and compliance with the other requirements of this article and the ordinance and not upon continuance in the same owner of title to the land. In the event that the locality provides for a sliding scale under an ordinance, the property owner and the locality shall execute a written agreement which sets forth t he period of time that the property shall remain within the classes of real estate set forth in § 58.1-3230. The term of the written agreement shall be for a period not exceeding 20 years, and the instrument shall be recorded in the office of the cler k of the circuit court for the locality in which the subject property is located. No locality shall require any applicant who is a lessor of the property or a portion of the property that is the subject of an application submitted pursuant to this se ction to provide the lease agreement governing the property for the purpose of determining whether the property is eligible for special assessment and taxation pursuant to this article.

In valuing real estate for purposes of taxation by any county, city or town which has adopted an ordinance pursuant to this article, the commissioner of the revenue or duly appointed assessor shall consider only those indicia of value which such real estate has for agricultural, horticultural, forest or open space use, and real estate taxes for such jurisdiction shall be extended upon the value so determined. In addition to use of his personal knowledge, judgment and experience as to the value of real estate in ag ricultural, horticultural, forest or open space use, he shall, in arriving at the value of such land, consider available evidence of agricultural, horticultural, forest or open space capability, and the recommendations of value of such real estate as mad e by the State Land Evaluation Advisory Council.

When real e state qualifies for assessment and taxation on the basis of use under an ordinance adopted pursuant to this article, and the use by which it qualified changes to a nonqualifying use, or, except as provided by ordinance enacted pursuant to subsection G, t he zoning of the real estate is changed to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent, it shall be subject to additional taxes, hereinafter referred to as roll-back taxes. Such additional taxes shall only be assessed against that porti on of such real estate which no longer qualifies for assessment and taxation on the basis of use or zoning. Liability for roll-back taxes shall attach and be paid to the treasurer only if the amount of tax due exceeds ten dollars. B. In localiti es which have not adopted a sliding scale ordinance, the roll-back tax shall be equal to the sum of the deferred tax for each of the five most recent complete tax years including simple interest on such roll-back taxes at a rate set by the governing body , no greater than the rate applicable to delinquent taxes in such locality pursuant to § 58.1-3916 for each of the tax years. The deferred tax for each year shall be equal to the difference between the tax levied and the tax that would have been levie d based on the fair market value assessment of the real estate for that year. In addition the taxes for the current year shall be extended on the basis of fair market value which may be accomplished by means of a supplemental assessment based upon the di fference between the use value and the fair market value. C. In localiti es which have adopted a sliding scale ordinance, the roll-back tax shall be equal to the sum of the deferred tax from the effective date of the written agreement including simple interest on such roll-back taxes at a rate set by the governing body, which shall not be greater than the rate applicable to delinquent taxes in such locality pursuant to § 58.1-3916, for each of the tax years. The deferred tax for each year shall be equal to the difference between the tax levied and the tax that would have been levied based on the fair market value assessment of the real estate for that year and based on the highest tax rate applicable to the real estate for that year, had it not been subject to special assessment. In addition the taxes for the current yea r shall be extended on the basis of fair market value which may be accomplished by means of a supplemental assessment based upon the difference between the use value and the fair market value and based on the highest tax rate applicable to the real estat e for that year. D. Liability t o the roll-back taxes shall attach when a change in use occurs, or, except as provided by ordinance enacted pursuant to subsection G, a change in zoning of the real estate to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent occurs. Liability to the roll-back taxes shall not attach when a change in ownership of the title takes place if the new owner does not rezone the real estate to a more intensive use, unless otherwise provided by ordinance enacted pursuant to subsection G, and continues the real estate in the use for which it is classified under the conditions prescribed in this article and in the ordinance. The owner of any real estate which has been zoned to more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent as provided in su bsection E, or otherwise subject to or liable for roll-back taxes, shall, within sixty days following such change in use or zoning, report such change to the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing officer on such forms as may be prescribed. The c ommissioner shall forthwith determine and assess the roll-back tax, which shall be assessed against and paid by the owner of the property at the time the change in use which no longer qualifies occurs, or at the time of the zoning of the real estate to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent occurs, and shall be paid to the treasurer within thirty days of the assessment. If the amount due is not paid by the due date, the treasurer shall impose a penalty and interest on the amount o f the roll-back tax, including interest for prior years. Such penalty and interest shall be imposed in accordance with §§ 58.1-3915 and 58.1-3916. E. Real proper ty zoned to a more intensive use, at the request of the owner or his agent, shall be subject to and liable for the roll-back tax at the time such zoning is changed. The roll-back tax shall be levied and collected from the owner of the real estate in acco rdance with subsection D. Real property zoned to a more intensive use before July 1, 1988, at the request of the owner or his agent, shall be subject to and liable for the roll-back tax at the time the qualifying use is changed to a nonqualifying use. Re al property zoned to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent after July 1, 1988, shall be subject to and liable for the roll-back tax at the time of such zoning. Said roll-back tax, plus interest calculated in accordance with subsec tion B, shall be levied and collected at the time such property was rezoned. For property rezoned after July 1, 1988, but before July 1, 1992, no penalties or interest, except as provided in subsection B, shall be assessed, provided the said roll-back ta x is paid on or before October 1, 1992. No real property rezoned to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent shall be eligible for taxation and assessment under this article, provided that these provisions shall not be applicable to any rezoning which is required for the establishment, continuation, or expansion of a qualifying use. If the property is subsequently rezoned to agricultural, horticultural, or open space, it shall be eligible for consideration for assessment and taxatio n under this article only after three years have passed since the rezoning was effective.However, the owner of any real property that qualified for assessment and taxation on the basis of use, and whose real property was rezoned to a more intensive use a t the owners request prior to 1980, may be eligible for taxation and assessment under this article provided the owner applies for rezoning to agricultural, horticultural, open-space or forest use. The real property shall be eligible for assessment an d taxation on the basis of the qualifying use for the tax year following the effective date of the rezoning. If any such real property is subsequently rezoned to a more intensive use at the owners request, within five years from the date the property was initially rezoned to a qualifying use under this section, the owner shall be liable for roll-back taxes when the property is rezoned to a more intensive use. Additionally, the owner shall be subject to a penalty equal to fifty percent of the roll-ba ck taxes due as determined under subsection B of this section.The roll-back taxes and penalty that otherwise would be imposed under this subsection shall not become due at the time the zoning is changed if the locality has enacted an ordinance pursuant t o subsection G. F. If real est ate annexed by a city and granted use value assessment and taxation becomes subject to roll-back taxes, and such real estate likewise has been granted use value assessment and taxation by the county prior to annexation, the city shall collect roll-back t axes and interest for the maximum period allowed under this section and shall return to the county a share of such taxes and interest proportionate to the amount of such period, if any, for which the real estate was situated in the county. G. A locality may enact an ordinance providing that (i) when a change in zoning of real estate to a more intensive use at the request of the owner or his agent occurs, roll-back taxes shall not become due solely because the change in zoning is for specific more intens ive uses set forth in the ordinance, (ii) such real estate may remain eligible for use value assessment and taxation, in accordance with the provisions of this article, as long as the use by which it qualified does not change to a nonqualifying use, and (iii) no roll-back tax shall become due with respect to the real estate until such time as the use by which it qualified changes to a nonqualifying use.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  Subsection A of this section is only applicable when a conveyance or other action of the owner of real estate causes a separation of parcels of land from the real estate which is being assessed under a local special land use tax ordinance, and the remaining real estate continues to receive the benefit of reduced assessment and taxation without liability for roll-back taxes provided it continues to qualify for ben eficial treatment; by its express terms, this statute contemplates a separation of a portion of the real estate in such a manner that there is a remaining portion of the original parcel, and it does not address the conveyance of the original parcel in it s entirety by the owner. When the owner conveys the real estate in its entirety to a new owner or owners, either as one parcel or as separate lots, pieces or parcels, the liability to roll-back taxes, if any, is controlled by the provisions of subsectio n D of § 58.1-3237.

By its express terms, subsection A of this section, is only applicable to a conveyance or other action of an owner, which does not include a taking by eminent dom ain, and clearly evinces a legislative intent that the triggering subdivision of property into lots, pieces or parcels of land be a legal separation rather than a mere physical separation. Chesterfield County v. Stigall, 262 Va. 697, 554 S.E.2d 49, 2001 Va. LEXIS 129 (2001). The owner of real property subect to reduced taxation under a local special land use tax ordinance, which was conveyed in its entirety to a new owner as one parce l or as separate parcels, need not satisfy the safe-harbor provision of subsection A of this section by attesting that the subdivision of the property is for one or more of the purposes set forth in § 58.1-3230, because the potential liability to roll -back taxes under subsection A of this section is not triggered by such a conveyance or conveyances.

Section is not retroactive.  This section does not affect the validity of an assessment made in 1905 by assessors acting under authority of the law at that time. Commonwealth v. Camp Mfg. Co. , 109 Va. 84, 63 S.E. 978, 1909 Va. LEXIS 4 (1909). Mine rals and surface may be separate subjects of taxation.  Where the surface of land is held by one person and the minerals by another, the two holdings are distinct and separate subjects of taxation. Tiller v. Excelsior Coal &amp; Lumber Corp., 110 Va. 151, 65 S.E. 507, 1909 Va. LEXIS 128 (1909). Improved and under development.  The phrase improved and under development, as used in this section, means open up by mine entries and butt entries extending to solid coal, so as to rende r the land immediately accessible for practical mining. Commonwealth v. Pocahontas Coal &amp; Coke Co., 107 Va. 666, 60 S.E. 84, 1908 Va. LEXIS 126 (1908). How quantity of lands improved and under development ascertained.  In ascertaining the quantity of mineral lands improved and under development under this section, the entire body of land underlaid with coal upon which mi nes have been opened and are being operated should be assessed as improved and under development, and not merely so much of the land as will be deprived of its coal before the next assessment; and, in the absence of any evidence of a fairer or be tter method of ascertaining the extent of improvement, it is not error to take as an index the number of coke ovens in operation on the land. At the next assessment, the lands which have been deprived of their coal should be deducted from the quantity pr eviously assessed. Interstate Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. Commonwealth, 103 Va. 586, 49 S.E. 974, 1905 Va. LEXIS 29 (1905). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Subsurface mineral lands constitute real estate, and a treasurer may initiate a judicial sale of such mineral lands charged with delinquent taxes. Further, the procedure for a judicial sale of subsurface minera l lands is not affected by separate ownership and payment of taxes for the surface lands overlying the minerals or where the mineral owners are not Virginia residents. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Anna L. Fox, Alleghany County Treasur er, 07-099 (12/4/07). Subsurface minerals.  Clay and sand that are in place, i.e., beneath the surface of real property, are minerals that are subject to local taxation whether or not the property is under development. Further, the initial discovery of a mineral generally is the time at which assessment wo uld occur. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Samuel W.

CASE NOTES Individual assessments and bulk sale.  Trial court did not ignore the $34.1 million purchase price of the 2,500 acres of the business park in determining the fair market value of the land that the taxp ayers purchased in a case involving whether the taxing authority over assessed the taxpayers property for four different tax years. Although the sale price was one factor in considering the fair market value of property, a bulk sale was not a comparable sale for establishing the individual assessed values of parcels pursuant to § 58.1-3290 and could not be used to show manifest error regarding an assessment, especially since bulk sales tended to be at a cheaper per acre value than the sale of individ ual parcels.

An additional assessment or reassessment due to the construction of new or other improvements, including those i mprovements and changes set forth in § 58.1-3285, to the property shall not be an annual assessment or general reassessment within the meaning of this section, nor shall the assessed value of such improvements be included in calculating the new tax le vy for purposes of this section. Special levies shall not be included in any calculations provided for under this section. B. The governi ng body of a county, city, or town may, after conducting a public hearing, which shall not be held at the same time as the annual budget hearing, increase the rate above the reduced rate required in subsection A if any such increase is deemed to be neces sary by such governing body. C. Notice of a ny public hearing held pursuant to this section shall be given at least 30 days before the date of such hearing by the publication of a notice in (i) at least one newspaper of general circulation in such county or city and (ii) a prominent public locatio n at which notices are regularly posted in the building where the governing body of the county, city, or town regularly conducts its business, except that such notice shall be given at least 14 days before the date of such hearing in any year in which ne ither a general appropriation act nor amendments to a general appropriation act providing appropriations for the immediately following fiscal year have been enacted by April 30 of such year.

D. All hearing s shall be open to the public.

Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. So le purpose of section is to guarantee collection of taxes.  Since the passage of this section and § 58.1-3281, it has been the purpose of the Commonwealth to create an indefeasible lien on land for taxes due thereon, wh ich lien shall be . . . prior to any other lien or encumbrance thereon, and shall continue to be such prior lien until actual payment shall have been made. The sole purpose of this legislation is to protect the Commonwealth by making sure of the collection of taxes. Thomas v. Young, 196 Va. 1166, 87 S.E.2d 127, 1955 Va. LEXIS 186 (1955). This section, while it makes the lien of delinquent taxes run with the land, was enacted solely for the purpose of insuring the collection of taxes, and was not i ntended to affect the competing rights of other parties. In re Polumbo, 271 F. Supp. 640, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11470 (W.D. Va. 1967). The state, when it taxed real estate, only got its lien by virtue of this section, and i ts lien existed and continued only as prescribed therein. Liberty Sav. Bank v. Otterview Land Co., 9 Va. L. Reg. 903 (1903). Delinquent taxes are both a personal debt and a lien upon the land. It appears that they run with the land. In re Polumbo, 271 F. Supp. 640, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11470 (W.D. Va. 1967). Section relates only to interest on taxes on land returned delinquent.  Taxes which were regularly assessed for three years upon intangible property are not omitted taxes, and there is no statute requiring interest to be paid thereon, and hence none can be collected. This section relates only to interest on taxes on land returned delinquent. Rixey's Ex'rs v. Commonwealth, 125 Va. 337, 99 S.E. 573, 1919 Va.

When taxes accrue and be come preferred charge.  Taxes accrue and become personal charges against the owners of real estate as of the first day of February of each year (now the first day of January of each year ), and when the owner dies subsequent to that date the taxes for that year become a preferred charge against his estate. Kincheloe v. Gibson, 115 Va. 119, 78 S.E. 603, 1913 Va. LEXIS 14 (1913). Taxes are prior in dignity to all other liens, and must be so from the very necessity of the case, otherwise the state would be powerless to collect her revenue. Thomas v.

The lien for taxes assessed on land is superior to a prior deed of trust to secure the p ayment of money. Tax sales are made clear of prior encumbrances. Simmons v. Lyles, 73 Va.

Jones, 94 Va. 756, 27 S.E. 813, 1897 Va. LEXIS 136 (1897). Priority of real estate taxes over payment of foreclosure sale proceeds.  This section and § 55-59 give real estate taxes a priority over the payment of the proceeds of a foreclosure sale. They direct that the foreclosure trustee mus t satisfy all outstanding tax deficiencies before distributing the proceeds, and in the event that this section fails, it is provided that the delinquent taxes shall remain a debt outstanding against the purchaser at the sale. In re Polumbo, 271 F. Supp. 640, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11470 (W.D. Va. 1967). Taxes due after bankruptcy petition.  Certain real property taxes were allowed as an administrative expense under 11 U.S.C.S. § 503(b)(1)(B) where, upon commencement of a Chapter 7 debtors invo luntary case under 11 U.S.C.S. § 303(b), the estate became the owner of the debtors real property under 11 U.S.C.S. § 541(a)(1) and as the owner, it bore the real property tax liability incurred with respect to the debtors real esta te that was assessed after the date of the petition. Taxes due after that date became secured tax liens on the property at issue when the property was owned by the estate under §§ 58.1-3344 and 58.1-3340, and because those taxes were accorded prior ity lien status under state law, they were not of a kind specified in 11 U.S.C.S. § 507(a)(8). Hines v. Wolfe, 443 Bankr. 714, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 337 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2011). The fact that a taxpayer may die leaving sufficient personal estate to discharge his taxes and other debts, does not alter a citys right to elect to collect its taxes either by enforcing its lien on the land or by asserting its claim against the taxpayers estate. While it is true, that in the settlement of a decedents estate the personalty is the primary fund for the payment of his debts, including taxes, to hold that the city must resort to the personalty before enforcing its lien on the land would deprive it of its right of election to pursue either course. Pollard &amp; Bagby, In c. v. City of Richmond, 181 Va. 181, 24 S.E.2d 564, 1943 Va. LEXIS 166 (1943).

Effect of failure to charge land to estate upon land books.  Where there is no record or other evidence of the death of the owner of land, the failure to charge land to his estate upon the land books will not invalidate an assessment of taxes thereon in the name of such owner instead of his estate, and a sale thereof for delinquent taxes passes the title.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Purpose of this section is to prevent property owners from evading their fair share of t he tax burden by reason of some error or omission of the assessing officers; but if this error or omission works to the prejudice of the landowner, then the curative provisions of this section cannot be invoked. City of Norfolk v. Stephenson, 185 Va. 305 , 38 S.E.2d 570, 1946 Va. LEXIS 201 (1946); City of Richmond v. McKenny, 194 Va. 427, 73 S.E.2d 414, 1952 Va. LEXIS 248 (1952) (commented on in 39 Va. L. Rev. 404 (1953)). This section was intended to meet the decision in Albemarle County v. Massey, 183 Va. 310, 32 S.E.2d 228 (1944). There the question was concerning the enforcement of the lien for taxes on the interests of parties, in a chancery suit, who were not charged or assessed with the taxes. It had nothing to do with the collection of taxes in a personal action against an owner. It was held that the land was not assessed i n accordance with the statute, and that the assessment was invalid. Banks v. Norfolk County, 191 Va. 463, 62 S.E.2d 46, 1950 Va. LEXIS 233 (1950) (see City of Richmond v. McKenny, 194 Va. 427, 73 S.E.2d 414 (1952) (commented on in 39 Va. L. Rev. 404 (195 3))). This section is most comprehensive, and its language covers every conceivable situation where an assessing official has failed to charge real estate on the land book according to law. The legislature says, in effect, that the interest of the public in the collection of taxes is more important than the failure of an assessing official to pro perly perform his duties, and unless such failure on the part of the assessing officer has been prejudicial according to the terms of this section, it will not invalidate the assessment.

It has to do only with the lien on property for taxes and has nothing to do with the enf orcement of taxes in a personal action against an owner. Banks v. Norfolk County, 191 Va. 463, 62 S.E.2d 46, 1950 Va. LEXIS 233 (1950).

The cases below were decided under prior law. This section was enacted in 1922 as a remedial statute to provide relief for taxpayers w hose property shall have been or may be given to, sold to, or taken in any manner whatsoever by this State or any county or municipality thereof. City of Richmond v. Richmond Metro. Auth., 210 Va. 645, 172 S.E.2d 831, 1970 Va. LEXIS 176 (1970). And must be liberally interpreted.  As a remedial statute this section requires a liberal interpretation to meet those cases which are clearly within the spirit or reason of the law, provided such a n interpretation is not inconsistent with the language of the section. City of Richmond v. Richmond Metro. Auth., 210 Va. 645, 172 S.E.2d 831, 1970 Va. LEXIS 176 (1970). This section is not unconstitutional under Va. Const., Art. IV, § 14, as it is not a local nor special or private law, is not within the prohibition of Va. Const., Art. IV, § 15 against the surrender of the right to tax, and Va. Const., Art. X, §§ 1 and 4 do not prohibit the legislature from passing an act permitting the prorati on of taxes in such cases. Warwick County v. City of Newport News, 153 Va. 789, 151 S.E. 417, 1930 Va. LEXIS 271 (1930); York County v. City of Newport News, 153 Va. 824, 151 S.E. 428, 1930 Va. LEXIS 272 (1930). It is a valid exercise of legi slative power.  So far as this section relieves the grantors in deeds to the state, a county or a municipality of taxes for the unexpired portion of the tax year, it is a valid e xercise of the legislative power.

City of Richmond v. Richmond Metro. Auth., 210 Va. 645, 172 S.E.2d 831, 1970 Va. LEXIS 176 (1970).

Upon the conclusion of the presentation of the evidence of the assessing officer, the taxpayer shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to reb ut such evidence presented by the assessing officer as otherwise provided in this section. C. In consider ing complaints, nothing shall be construed to prohibit consideration of any statement of income and expense or market sales that occurred through December 31, prior to the effective date of the assessment, so long as such information is submitted to the board no later than the localitys deadline for the application for relief. No studies or analyses published after December 31 immediately preceding the effective date of the assessment shall be considered in an appeal filed relating to that assessmen t. D. In any case before the board concerning a taxpayers complaint in which the commissioner of the revenue or other local assessing officer requests the board to increase the assessment after the taxpayer files an appeal to the board on a commercial, multifamily re sidential, or industrial property, the commissioner or other officer shall provide the taxpayer notice of the request not less than 14 days prior to the hearing of the board. Except as provided herein, if the taxpayer contests the requested increase, the assessor shall either withdraw the request or shall provide the board an appraisal performed by an independent contractor who is licensed and certified by the Virginia Real Estate Appraiser Board to serve as a general real estate appraiser, which apprai sal affirms that such increase in value represents the propertys fair market value as of the date of the assessment in dispute.

The cases below were decided under prior law. It was the intention of the legislature, as appears from §§ 58.1-3378 through 58.1 -3385, that changes made by the local board of equalization appointed in 1932 should become effective in that year, and that they should affect the land book for that year, and that such changes as were made and certified to the commissioner of the reven ue before he had completed the land book for that year should have been made thereon by him. Strother Drug Co. v. Taylor, 160 Va. 427, 168 S.E. 756, 1933 Va. LEXIS 224 (1933). The language of this section means that upon presentation of a copy of the order of the local board of equalization reducing the taxpayers assessment the treasurer shall credit the assessment made against the property with the amount determined to be erroneous, and is authorized, if the tax has not been paid, to accept payment of the ta x computed on the corrected assessment, and if the tax has been paid, to refund to the taxpayer the amount erroneously paid. Strother Drug Co. v. Taylor, 160 Va. 427, 168 S.E. 756, 1933 Va. LEXIS 224 (1933). Supplemental asses sment for preceding year void.  Where the commissioner of revenue, under this section, makes a supplemental assessment not merely for the then current year, but for the year preceding, to that e xtent it is without legislative authority and void.

Tangible pe rsonal property is classified for valuation purposes according to the following separate categories which are not to be considered separate classes for rate purposes: 1. Farm animals, except as exempted under § 58.1-3505. 2. Farm machinery, except as exempted under § 58.1-3505. 3. Automobiles, except those described in subdivisions 7, 8, and 9 of this subsection and in subdivision A 8 of § 58.1-3504, which shall be valued by means of a recognized pricing guid e or if the model and year of the individual automobile are not listed in the recognized pricing guide, the individual vehicle may be valued on the basis of percentage or percentages of original cost. In using a recognized pricing guide, the commissioner shall use either of the following two methods. The commissioner may use all applicable adjustments in such guide to determine the value of each individual automobile, or alternatively, if the commissioner does not utilize all applicable adjustments in v aluing each automobile, he shall use the base value specified in such guide which may be either average retail, wholesale, or loan value, so long as uniformly applied within classifications of property. If the model and year of the individual automobile are not listed in the recognized pricing guide, the taxpayer may present to the commissioner proof of the original cost, and the basis of the tax for purposes of the motor vehicle sales and use tax as described in § 58.1-2405 shall constitute proof of original cost. If such percentage or percentages of original cost do not accurately reflect fair market value, or if the taxpayer does not supply proof of original cost, then the commissioner may select another method which establishes fair market value . 4. Trucks of less than two tons, which may be valued by means of a recognized pricing guide or, if the model and year of the individual truck are not listed in the recognized pricing guid e, on the basis of a percentage or percentages of original cost. 5. Trucks and other vehicles, as defined in § 46.2-100, except those described in subdivisions 4, and 6 through 10 of this subsection, which shall be valued by means of either a recogn ized pricing guide using the lowest value specified in such guide or a percentage or percentages of original cost. 6. Manufactured homes, as defined in § 36-85.3, which may be valued on the basis of square footage of living space. 7. Antique motor vehicles, as defined in § 46.2-100, which may be used for general transportation purposes as provided in subsection C of § 46.2-730. 8. Taxicabs. 9. Motor vehicles with specially designed equipment for use by the handicapped, which shall not be valued in relation to their initial cost, but by determining their actual market value i f offered for sale on the open market. 10. Motorcycles, mopeds, all-terrain vehicles, and off-road motorcycles as defined in § 46.2-100, campers and other recreational vehicles, which shall be valued by means of a recogni zed pricing guide or a percentage or percentages of original cost. 11. Boats weighing under five tons and boat trailers, which shall be valued by means of a recognized pricing guide or a percentage or percentages of original cost. 12. Boats or watercraft weighing five tons or more, which shall be valued by means of a percentage or percentages of original cost. 13. Aircraft, which shall be valued by means of a recognized pricing guide or a percentage or percentages of original cost. 14. Household goods and personal effects, except as exempted under § 58.1-3504. 15. Tangible personal property used in a research and development business, which shall be valued by means of a percentage or percentages of original cost. 16. Programmable computer equipment and peripherals used in business which shall be valued by means of a percentage or percentages of original cost to the taxpayer, or by such other met hod as may reasonably be expected to determine the actual fair market value. 17. Computer equipment and peripherals used in a data center, as defined in subdivision A 43 of § 58.1-3506, which shall be valued by means of a percentage or percentages of original cost, or by such other method as may reasonably be expected to determine the actual fair market value. 18. All tangible personal property employed in a trade or business other than that described in subdivisions 1 through 17, which shall be valued by means of a percentage or percentages of original cost. 19. Outdoor advertising signs regulated under Article 1 (§ 33.2-1200 et seq.) of Chapter 12 of Title 33.2. 20. All other tangible personal property. B. Methods of valuing property may differ among the separate categories, so long as each method used is uniform within each category, is consistent with requirements of this section and may reasonably be expected to determine actual fair market value as determined by the commissioner of revenue or other assessing official; however, assessment ratios shall only be used with the concurrence of the local governing body. A commissioner of revenue shall upon request take into account the condition of the property. The ter m condition of the property includes, but is not limited to, technological obsolescence of property where technological obsolescence is an appropriate factor for valuing such property. The commissioner of revenue shall make available to taxpayers on request a reasonable description of his valuation methods. Such commissioner, or other assessing officer, or his authorized agent, when using a recognized pricing guide as provided for in this section, may automatically extend the assessment if the p ricing information is stored in a computer. For any locality in which the commissioner of revenue or other assessing official adjusts the valuation of property described in subdivision A 3 to account for the amount of mileage on such vehicles, such adjus tment shall also be provided to motorcycles described in subdivision A 10.

Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. This section is a statute of classification rather than definition. R. Cross, Inc. v. Cit y of Newport News, 217 Va. 202, 228 S.E.2d 113, 1976 Va. LEXIS 260 (1976). Classification is the introductory predicate for the several paragraphs numbered serially. An enumeration of separate items is more characteristic of the technique of classification than of the process of definition. Moreover, if definition were the legislative purpose, then the language of the fifteenth paragraph, i.e., all other tangible personal property not herein specifically enumerated, woul d render the definition circuitous and abortive. R. Cross, Inc. v. City of Newport News, 217 Va. 202, 228 S.E.2d 113, 1976 Va. LEXIS 260 (1976). The word classification is a word of art with special import, connoting a division into separate classes. The General Assembly could have chosen the word definition or some equivalent language. It did not; it chose the word classification. It did so advisedly and purposefully. R. Cross, Inc. v. City of Newport News, 217 Va. 202, 228 S.E.2d 113, 1976 Va. LEXIS 260 (1976).

CASE NOTES Machinery and to ols tax relief program not uniform.  While the circuit court properly sustained a countys motion to strike a taxpayers claims regarding vested rights, separation of powers, and the county s alleged lack of statutory authority, the circuit court erred in sustaining the countys motion to strike the counts regarding constitutional and statutory uniformity because the taxpayer provided prima facie evidence sufficient to show that the mach inery and tools (M&amp;T) tax relief program was designed and implemented to directly and automatically exempt a sub-class of M&amp;T taxpayers from tax liability, the relief formula treated those taxpayers differently based on whether the county owed them a ref und on M&amp;T taxes overpaid in prior years, and the program was part of the taxation process. Int'l Paper Co. v. Cty. of Isle of Wight, 299 Va. 150, 847 S.E.2d 507, 2020 Va. LEXIS 103 (2020). Company held to be a manufacturer.  Where the evidence was sufficient to support the trial courts finding that companys manufacturing activities were substantial when compared with its total activities, the trial court did not err in ruling that the company was a manufacturer and that its machinery and tools should be taxed accordingly, since a business engaged in manufacturing does not lose its status as a manufacturer for tax purposes mer ely because it conducts some nonmanufacturing activities.

CASE NOTES Authority of local governing body.  The assessment ratio for computing merchants capital tax under this section is to be fixed by the local governing body. Wise County Bd. of Supvrs. v. Wilson, 250 Va. 482, 463 S.E.2d 650, 1995 Va. LEXIS 127 (1995). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Absence of a local ordinance imposing a tax on short-term rental property.  Short-term rental property is to be classified as a distinct category of merchants capital and may be taxed by a locality as merchants capital or as short -term rental property, but may not be classified or taxed as personal tangible property. A locality lawfully may decline to impose a tax on merchants capital, including short-term rental property. The absence of a local ordinance imposing a tax on me rchants capital or short-term rental property represents a choice by the localitys governing body not to impose a tax on such property.

For purpose s of this article, short-term rental property means all tangible personal property held for rental and owned by a person engaged in the short-term rental business as defined in subsection B, excluding (i) trailers as defined in § 46.2-100, and (ii) other tangible personal property required to be licensed or registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Wildlife Resources, or Department of Aviation.Short-term rental property shall constitute a classification of merchants capital that is separate from other classifications of merchants capital. For local property taxation purposes, the governing body of any county, city, or town may tax short-term rental property pursuant to § 58.1-3509 or may impose the tax author ized under § 58.1-3510.6, but not both. B. A person is engaged in the short-term rental business if: 1. Not l ess than 80 percent of the gross rental receipts of such business during the preceding year arose from transactions involving the rental of short-term rental property, other than heavy equipment property as defined in subdivision 2, for periods of 92 con secutive days or less, including all extensions and renewals to the same person or a person affiliated with the lessee; or 2. Not less than 60 percent of the gross rental receipts of such business during the preceding year arose from transactions involving the rental of heavy equipment property for periods of 270 consecutive days or less, including all extensions and renewals to the same person or a person affiliated with the lessee. For the purposes of this subdivision, heavy equipment property means rental property of an industry that is described under code 532412 or 532490 of the 2002 North American Industry Classification System as published by the United States Census Bureau, excluding office furniture, office equipment, and programmable computer equipment and peripherals as defined in § 58 .1-3503 A 16.

The situs f or the assessment and taxation of tangible personal property, merchants capital and machinery and tools shall in all cases be the county, district, town or city in which such property may be physically located on the tax day. However, the situs for p urposes of assessment of motor vehicles, travel trailers, boats and airplanes as personal property shall be the county, district, town or city where the vehicle is normally garaged, docked or parked; except, (i) the situs for vehicles with a weight of 10 ,000 pounds or less registered in Virginia but normally garaged, docked or parked in another state shall be the locality in Virginia where registered; and (ii) if the owner of a business files a return pursuant to § 58.1-3518 for any vehicle with a we ight of 10,000 pounds or less registered in Virginia and used in the business with the locality from which the use of such vehicle is directed or controlled and in which the owners business has a definite place of business, as defined in § 58.1-37 00.1, the situs for such vehicles shall be such locality, provided such owner has sufficient evidence that he has paid the personal property tax on the business vehicles to such locality. Any person domiciled in another state, whose motor vehicle is prin cipally garaged or parked in this Commonwealth during the tax year, shall not be subject to a personal property tax on such vehicle upon a showing of sufficient evidence that such person has paid a personal property tax on the vehicle in the state in whi ch he is domiciled. In the event it cannot be determined where such personal property, described herein, is normally garaged, stored or parked, the situs shall be the domicile of the owner of such personal property. However, in the event that a motor veh icle is used by a full-time student attending an institution of higher education, and such use establishes that the motor vehicle is normally garaged at the location of the institution of higher education, the situs shall be the domicile of the owner of the motor vehicle, provided the owner presents sufficient evidence that he has paid a personal property tax on the motor vehicle in his domicile, upon request of the locality of the institution of higher education. Any person who shall pay a personal pro perty tax on a motor vehicle to a county or city in this Commonwealth and a similar tax on the same vehicle in the state of his domicile, or in the state where such vehicle is normally garaged, docked, or parked, may apply to such county or city for a re fund of such tax payment. Upon a showing of sufficient evidence that such person has paid the tax for the same year in the state in which he is domiciled, the county or city may refund the amount of such payment. B. The assessm ent of motor vehicles, travel trailers, boats or airplanes operating over interstate routes, in the rendition of a common, contract or other private carrier service which are subject to property taxation in any other state on the basis of an apportioned assessment, shall be apportioned in the same percentage as the total number of miles traveled in the Commonwealth by such vehicle bears to the total number of miles traveled by such vehicle.

Change in general situs constituti onal.  Acts 2002, c. 78, which adjusted the general situs and tax day provisions of §§ 58.1-3511 and 58.1-3515 to meet the special and non-recurring circumstances presented by the reversion of the City of Clifton Forge to town status, was not an unconstitutional violation of Va. Const., Art. IV, § 14, because it was authorized by Va. Const., Art. VII, § 2; it also did not violate Va. Const., Art. X, § 1, as it provided greater uniformity in tax burdens than the taxpayers suggestion, which would make them free from personal property taxation by the county. Alderson v. County of Alleghany, 266 Va. 333, 585 S.E.2d 795, 2003 Va. LEXIS 83 (2003). Acts 2002, c. 78, was not an unconstitutional violation of Va. Const., Art. I, § 9, because the prohibition against ex post facto laws applied only to criminal proceedings, and the general assembly had the power to enact the statute with retroactive application as it was not arbitrary and did not disturb vested rights, impair contractual obligations, or violate due process; further, Acts 2002, c. 78, did not v iolate Va. Const., Art. VII, § 7, as it did not enact any ordinance, impose any tax, or set any tax rate. Alderson v. County of Alleghany, 266 Va. 333, 585 S.E.2d 795, 2003 Va. LEXIS 83 (2003). The situs of tangible personal property for taxation is the locus of the property itself , and not the domicile of the person by whom § 58.1-3015 requires it to be listed and to whom it requires the property to be taxed. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 445, 98 S.E. 5, 1919 Va. LEXIS 135 (1919). The common-law rule that the situs of personal property for taxation follows the owner may be changed by the legislature at its pleasure. It has been changed in V irginia by this section, which provides that the situs of tangible personal property for tax purposes is the county, etc., in which it is physically located. Hogan v. County of Norfolk, 198 Va. 733, 96 S.E.2d 744, 1957 Va. LEXIS 132 (1957). The situs for taxation as used in this section means something more than simply the place where the property is. It does not mean property which is casually there or incidentally there in the course of transit, but it does necessarily involve the idea of permanent location like real property. It is sufficient if it is there and being used in such a way as to be fairly regarded as part of the property of the count y. Hogan v. County of Norfolk, 198 Va. 733, 96 S.E.2d 744, 1957 Va. LEXIS 132 (1957). The physical location of property, as contemplated in this section and former §§ 5 8-570 to 58-577, means that property must have acquired a degree of permanency or have become a part of the common mass of property in the taxing district, and this is practically impossible in the case of floating property. It is not the purpose of such property, nor is it contemplated, that it shall remain in one place. City of Newport News v. Commonwealth, 165 Va. 635, 183 S.E. 514, 1936 Va. LEXIS 249 (1936) (see § 58.1-3512). Physical location of merchants capital on tax day determinative.  The language of subsection A is plain and unambiguous and provides a single directive for determining the taxation situs of merchants capital of any type, tha t being the place in which such property may be physically located on the tax day; this language does not provide for a determination of where the merchants capital is ordinarily or normally kept, but requires that the situs be determined by the phys ical location of the merchants capital on one particular day of each year. Shelor Motor Co. v. Miller, 261 Va. 473, 544 S.E.2d 345, 2001 Va. LEXIS 50 (2001). The inclusion of merchants capital in the first sentence of subsection A mandates the use of the situs test of physically located on the tax day, with out any qualification or limitation regarding the length of time that the property has been situated in a given locality. Shelor Motor Co. v. Miller, 261 Va. 473, 544 S.E.2d 345, 2001 Va. LEXIS 50 (2001). Apportionment is required only when property is subject to taxation, that is, has a tax situs in another jurisdiction. Without a tax situs in another jurisdiction, a domiciliary state retains the authority to tax the full value of the property. Ryder Truck Rental, Inc. v. County of Chesterfield, 248 Va. 575, 449 S.E.2d 813, 1994 Va. LEXIS 1 57 (1994). Need to show tax liability in another jurisdiction.  This section and the Commerce Clause do not require county to apportion its taxes to reflect only the percentage of miles each truck actually traveled in Virginia where truck rental company had not demonstrated that it has actually paid taxes or would even be subject to taxes in another jurisdiction on this basis. It is not enough for a taxpayer to merely identify another jurisdiction in which the taxable instrum entality is used. Ryder Truck Rental, Inc. v. County of Chesterfield, 248 Va. 575, 449 S.E.2d 813, 1994 Va. LEXIS 157 (1994). Need to show propertys presence in another jurisdiction.  A tax situs in another jurisdiction can be established by a showing that the taxpayers property traveled on fixed and regular routes or was habitually, though irregularly, employed in a particular state. However, mere absence from one taxing jurisdiction is not sufficient to establish a tax situs in another, thus, proof only that trucks accumulate mileage in other jurisdictions was insufficient.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Tax exemptions.  Regarding the tax exemption that became effective July 1, 2016, for pickups and panel trucks as defined in § 46.2-100, for any covered vehicle that was sited in the taxing jurisdiction on January 1, 2016 (before the new tax exemption went into effect), the vehicle remains taxable for the entire year. For any covered vehicle that was not sited in the taxing jurisdiction until after January 1, 2016, the tax exemption is to be pro-rated. Applying the new exemption law in this manner does not violate the constitutional requirement of equal taxation. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Ross A.

The governi ng body of any county, city or town may provide by ordinance for the levy and collection of personal property tax on motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and boats which have acquired a situs within such locality after the tax day for the balance of t he tax year. Such tax shall be prorated on a monthly basis. Such ordinance may exclude boats or motor vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers with a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or more used to transport property for hire by a motor carrier engaged in interstate commerce, or both, from the property subject to proration of the personal property tax. For purposes of proration, a period of more than one-half of a month shall be counted as a full month and a period of less than one-half of a month sha ll not be counted.Such ordinance shall also provide for relief from tax and a refund of the appropriate amount of tax already paid, which shall be prorated on a monthly basis, where any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or boat loses its situs within such locality after the tax day or after the day on which it acquires a situs (hereafter situs day). No refund shall be made if the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or boat acquires a situs within the Commonwealth in a nonprorating locality. When any person sells or otherwise transfers title to a motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or boat with a situs in the locality after the tax day or situs day, the tax shall be relieved, prorated on a monthly basis, and the appropriate amount of tax al ready paid shall be (i) refunded or (ii) credited against the tax due on any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or boat owned by the taxpayer during the same tax year by the treasurer of such locality. Such refund shall be made within thirty days of th e date such tax is relieved. No refund of less than five dollars shall be issued to a taxpayer, unless specifically requested by the taxpayer. When any person, after the tax day or situs day, acquires a motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or boat with a situs in the locality, the tax shall be assessed on the motor vehicle, trailer, or boat for the portion of the tax year during which the new owner owns the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or boat and it has a situs within the locality.Any person wh o moves from a nonprorating locality to a prorating locality in a single tax year shall be entitled to a property tax credit in the prorating jurisdiction if (a) the person was liable for personal property taxes on a motor vehicle and has paid those taxe s to a nonprorating locality and (b) the owner replaces for any reason the original vehicle upon which taxes are due to the nonprorating locality for the same tax year. The prorating locality shall provide a credit against the total tax due on the replac ement vehicle in an amount equal to the tax paid to the nonprorating locality for the period of time commencing with the disposition of the original vehicle and continuing through the close of the tax year in which the owner incurred tax liability to the nonprorating locality for the original vehicle. B. Such ordina nce shall provide for the filing of returns and payment of such tax. Such ordinance shall also exempt property from the levy of such personal property tax for any tax year or portion thereof during which the property was legally assessed by another juris diction in the Commonwealth and the tax paid. Such ordinance may provide that, notwithstanding any other date for billing and payment of local personal property tax, the locality may bill all personal property taxes assessed for a portion of the tax year less than the full year on or after December 15 of each year. The ordinance may further provide that such taxes shall be due not less than thirty days after the date of the tax bill. If the tax is not paid when due, the penalty and the interest otherwis e provided for by § 58.1-3916 shall be imposed based on the established due date. History History.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Tax exemptions.  Regarding the tax exemption that became effective July 1, 2016, for pickups and panel trucks as defined in § 46.2-100, for any covered vehicle that was sited in the taxing jurisdiction on January 1, 2016 (before the new tax exemption went into effect), the vehicle remains taxable for the entire year. For any covered vehicle that was not sited in the taxing jurisdiction until after January 1, 2016, the tax exemption is to be pro-rated. Applying the new exemption law in this manner does not violate the constitutional requirement of equal taxation. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Ross A. Mugler, City of Hampton Commissioner of the Reven ue, The Honorable Graham P. Wilson, City of Poquoson Commissioner of the Revenue, 16-031, (9/1/16). § 58.1-3516.1.

The penalties for failure to pay the tax on such personal property shall begin the day following the due date for the tax on the property. The provisions of Subtitle III (§ 58.1-3000 et seq.) of Title 58.1 which are not in conflict herewith shall apply, with the respective differences having been consid ered, to the imposition and collection of personal property taxes by the City of Winchester, and the tax credit and exemption provisions of § 58.1-3516 for the payment of taxes to other jurisdictions shall specifically apply to any ordinance adopted u nder the authority of this section.

B. Any jurisdi ction adopting such an alternative method may require the owner of a motor vehicle, trailer or boat to file a new personal property tax return whenever there is: (i) a change in the name or address of the person or persons owning taxable personal propert y; (ii) a change in the situs of personal property; (iii) any other change affecting the assessment or levy of the personal property tax on motor vehicles, trailers or boats for which a tax return has been filed previously; or (iv) any change in which a person acquires one or more motor vehicles, trailers or boats and for which no personal property tax return has been filed.

For tax yea r 2006 and all tax years thereafter, counties, cities, and towns shall be reimbursed by the Commonwealth for providing the required tangible personal property tax relief as set forth herein. B. For tax yea r 2006 and all tax years thereafter, the Commonwealth shall pay a total of $950 million for each such tax year in reimbursements to localities for providing the required tangible personal property tax relief on qualifying vehicles in subsection C. No oth er amount shall be paid to counties, cities, and towns for providing tangible personal property tax relief on qualifying vehicles. Each countys, citys, or towns share of the $950 million for each such tax year shall be determined pro rata bas ed upon the actual payments to such county, city, or town pursuant to this chapter for tax year 2005 as compared to the actual payments to all counties, cities, and towns pursuant to this chapter for tax year 2005, as certified in writing by the Auditor of Public Accounts no later than March 1, 2006, to the Governor and to the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations and the House Committee on Appropriations. The amount reimbursed to a particular county, city, or town for tax year 2006 for providing tangible personal property tax relief shall be the same amount reimbursed to such county, city, or town for each subsequent tax year.The reimbursement to each county, city, or town for tax year 2006 shall be paid by the Commonwealth ov er the 12-month period beginning with the month of July 2006 and ending with the month of June 2007, as provided in the general appropriation act. For all tax years subsequent to tax year 2006, reimbursements shall be paid over the same 12-month period. All reimbursement payments shall be made by check issued by the State Treasurer to the respective treasurer of the county, city, or town on warrant of the Comptroller. C. For tax yea r 2006 and all tax years thereafter, each county, city, or town that will receive a reimbursement from the Commonwealth pursuant to subsection B shall provide tangible personal property tax relief on qualifying vehicles by reducing its local tax rate on qualifying vehicles as follows: 1. The l ocal governing body of each county, city, or town shall fix or establish its tangible personal property tax rate for its general class of tangible personal property, which rate shall also be applied to that portion of the value of each qualifying vehicle that is in excess of $20,000. 2. After fixing or establishing its tangible personal property tax rate for its general class of tangible personal property, the local governing body of the county, city, or town shall fi x or establish one or more reduced tax rates (lower than the rate applied to the general class of tangible personal property) that shall be applied solely to that portion of the value of each qualifying vehicle that is not in excess of $20,000. No other tangible personal property tax rate shall be applied to that portion of the value of each qualifying vehicle that is not in excess of $20,000. Such reduced tax rate or rates shall be set at an effective tax rate or rates such that (i) the revenue to be r eceived from such reduced tax rate or rates on that portion of the value of qualifying vehicles not in excess of $20,000 plus (ii) the revenue to be received on that portion of the value of qualifying vehicles in excess of $20,000 plus (iii) the Commonwe alths reimbursement is approximately equal to the total revenue that would have been received by the county, city, or town from its tangible personal property tax had the tax rate for its general class of tangible personal property been applied to 10 0 percent of the value of all qualifying vehicles. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions 1 and 2, beginning with tax year 2016, each county, city, and town that receives reimbursement shall ensure that the reimbursement pays f or all of the tax attributable to the first $20,000 of value on each qualifying vehicle leased by an active duty member of the United States military, his spouse, or both, pursuant to a contract requiring him, his spouse, or both to pay the tangible pers onal property tax on such vehicle. The provisions of this subdivision apply only to a vehicle that would not be taxed in Virginia if the vehicle were owned by such military member, his spouse, or both. D. On or befor e the date the certified personal property tax book is required by § 58.1-3118 to be provided to the treasurer, the commissioner of the revenue shall identify each qualifying vehicle and its value to the treasurer of the locality.

CASE NOTES Exemption from taxation shall be strictly construed for property acquired after July 1, 1971.  Under the present constitution, which became effective July 1, 1971, the rule in Virginia is that exemption of property from taxation shall be strictly construed and, under this rule, exemption from taxation is the exception, and where there is any doubt, the doubt is resolved against the one claiming exemption and housing and health care facility came into existence and acquired its property after July 1, 1971. Hence, its claim to exemption must be strictly construed, and this meant that entitlement to exemption must have appeared clearly from the statutory provisions upon which it relies. Westminster-Canterbury of Hampton Rds., Inc. v. City of Virginia Beach, 238 Va. 493, 385 S.E.2d 561, 6 Va. Law Rep. 711, 1989 Va. LEXIS 155 (1989). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Applicability.  The statute applies to religious corporations. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Larry W. Davis, County Attorney for Albemarle County, 99-117 (1/4/02). Religious associations.  Young Life, an incorporated nonprofit Christian organization, is a religious association and, therefore, its property may be exempt from local real and pe rsonal property taxation; the tax status of its property is a factual determination to be made by the local commissioner of the revenue or other appropriate tax official.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Commissioner of Revenue should determine whether organization is exempt from local taxation according to the facts.  That factual determination depends on whether (1) the organization engaged in activities as an institution of learning or engaged in activities that predominantly promoted charitable or benevolent purposes; and (2) the organizations activities satisfy the requirements for non-profits. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Janet H. Rorrer, Commissioner of the Revenue, Patrick County, 11-028, (10/7/ 11). Whether a nonpro fit entity is a benevolent entity for the purposes of Article X, § 6(a)(6) of the Constitution is a factual determination to be made by the local governing body, after a careful consideration of all the attendant facts consistent with the procedures in § 58.1-3651. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. John H. Tate, Jr., County Attorney for Smyth County, 03-053 (7/31/03). Local property tax exemptions granted by the General Assembly prior to January 1, 2003, either by designation or classification, remain valid and are not repealed by the ratified amendment to Article X, § 6(a)(6) of the Constitution. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable William J. Howell, Speaker of the House of Delegates, 03-049 (8/5/03). Only the General Assembly has authority to repeal classification or designation tax exemptions granted prior to January 1, 2003. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable William J. Howell, Speaker of the House of Delegates, 03-049 (8/5/03). Repeal of ordinance.  A board of supervisors may repeal, through proper procedures, an ordinance adopted by the prior board pursuant to this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. John R.

CASE NOTES Petroleum is a contaminant.  In determining whether heating oil was a pollutant within the meaning of a pollution exclusion in a commercial general liability insurance policy, the court did n ot consider federal and state statutes because the plain meaning of the terms contaminant and pollutant established that heating oil was a pollutant within the meaning of the policy; however, the court noted that it would have reached the same conclusion if it had relied on federal and state statutes because petroleum was a contaminant under § 58.1-3664 and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, 33 U.S.C.S. § 2701 et seq., regulated oil as a pollutant. The fact that the Comprehensive Environmental Respons e Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 9601 et seq., excluded oil from its coverage and did not define contaminant was inconsequential to the courts determination of whether an oil spill qualified as the release of a contaminant.

CASE NOTES This section is a general provision and applies to every person engaging in any occupati on, profession or calling for which a license is required. Welles v. Revercomb, 189 Va. 777, 54 S.E.2d 878, 1949 Va. LEXIS 217 (1949) (decided under prior law). When the object of a license statute is to obtain public revenue, and not to regulate bu siness for the public welfare, the penalty imposed for its violation is upon the person and not upon the business. Contracts made in the course of such business while the statute is being violated are thus valid and enforceable. Welles v. Revercomb, 189 Va. 777, 54 S.E.2d 878, 1949 Va. LEXIS 217 (1949) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Internet access services.  Court found that the City of Norfolk collected the business, professional, and occupational license (BPOL) tax prior to October 1, 1998, from plaintiff and anothe r taxpayer for licenses to offer internet access services in 1998. Because the Citys BPOL tax fell within the Internet Tax Freedom Acts grandfather clause, the court denied plaintiffs petition to refund portions of plaintiffs 2013, 2014, and 2015 BPOL taxes and to correct the Citys 2016 tax assessment.

See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Calvin C. Massie, Jr., Campbell County Commissioner of the Revenue, 16-041, 2016 Va. AG LEXIS 33 (12/21/16). § 58.1-3700.1. Definitions. Text For the purposes of this chapter and any local ordinances adopted pursuant to this chapter, unless otherwise required by the context: Affiliated group means: 1. One o r more chains of corporations subject to inclusion connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is a corporation subject to inclusion if: a. Stock possessing at least eighty percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least eighty percent of each class of the nonvoting stock of each of the corporations subject to inclusion, except the common parent corporation, is owned directl y by one or more of the other corporations subject to inclusion; and b. The common parent corporation directly owns stock possessing at least eighty percent of the voting power of all classes of stock and at least eighty percent of each class of the n onvoting stock of at least one of the other subject to inclusion corporations. As used in this subdivision, the term stock does not include nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as to dividends; the phrase corporation subject to incl usion means any corporation within the affiliated group irrespective of the state or country of its incorporation; and the term receipts includes gross receipts and gross income. 2. Two or more corporations if five or fewer persons who are individuals, estates or trusts own stock possessing: a. At least eighty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least eighty percent of the total value of shares of all classes of the stock of each corporation; and b. More than fifty percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or more than fifty percent of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock ownership of each such person only to the extent such stock ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.When one or more of the corporations subject to inclusion, including the common p arent corporation, is a nonstock corporation, the term stock as used in this subdivision shall refer to the nonstock corporation membership or membership voting rights, as is appropriate to the context. 3. Two or more entities if such entities satisfy the requirements in subdivision 1 or 2 of this definition as if they were corporations and the ownership interests therein were stock. Assessment means a determination as to the proper rate of tax, the measure to which the tax rate is applied, and ultimately the amount of tax, including additional or omitted tax, that is due. An assessment shall include a written assessment made pursuant to notice by the assessing official or a self-assessment made by a taxpayer upon the filing of a return or otherwise not pursuant to notice. Assessments shall be deemed made by an assessing official when a written notice of assessment is delivered to the taxpayer by the assessing official or an employee of the assessing official, or mailed to the ta xpayer at his last known address. Self-assessments shall be deemed made when a return is filed, or if no return is required, when the tax is paid. A return filed or tax paid before the last day prescribed by ordinance for the filing or payment thereof sh all be deemed to be filed or paid on the last day specified for the filing of a return or the payment of tax, as the case may be.Base year means the calendar year preceding the license year, except for contractors subject to the provisions of § 58.1-3715 or unless the local ordinance provides for a different period for measuring the gross rece ipts of a business, such as for beginning businesses or to allow an option to use the same fiscal year as for federal income tax purposes.Business means a course of dealing which requires the time, attention and labor of the person so engaged for the purpose of earning a livelihood or profit. It implies a continuous and regular course of dealing, rather than an irregular or isolated transaction. A person may be engaged in more than one business. The following acts shall create a rebuttable presumption that a person is engaged in a business: (i) advertising or otherwise holding oneself out to the public as being engaged in a particular business or (ii) filing tax returns, schedules and documents that are required only of persons engaged in a trade or business.Defense pr oduction business means a business engaged in the design, development, or production of materials, components, or equipment required to meet the needs of national defense. Definite place of business means an office or a location at which occurs a regular and continuous c ourse of dealing for thirty consecutive days or more. A definite place of business for a person engaged in business may include a location leased or otherwise obtained from another person on a temporary or seasonal basis and real property leased to anoth er. A persons residence shall be deemed to be a definite place of business if there is no definite place of business maintained elsewhere and the person is not subject to licensure as a peddler or itinerant merchant. Entity means a business organization, other than a sole proprietorship, that is a corporation, limited liability company, limi ted partnership, or limited liability partnership duly organized under the laws of the Commonwealth or another state.Financial services means the buying, selling, handling, managing, investing, and providing of advice regarding money, credit, securities, or other investments. Fuel sale or fuel sales shall mean retail sales of alternative fuel, blended fuel, diesel fuel, gasohol, or gasoline, as such terms are defined in § 58.1-2201.Gas retailer  means a person or entity engaged in business as a retailer offering to sell at retail on a daily basis alternative fuel, blended fuel, diesel fuel, gasohol, or gasoline, as s uch terms are ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_58.1-3701"><akn:num>§ 58.1-3701</akn:num><akn:heading>Department to promulgate guidelines</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The Department of Taxation shall promulgate guidelines for the use of local governments in administering the taxes imposed under the authority of this chapter. In prepa ring such guidelines, the Department shall not be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) for guidelines promulgated on or before July 1, 2001, but shall cooperate with and seek the counsel of local officials a nd interested groups and shall not promulgate such guidelines without first conducting a public hearing.

Massie, Jr., Commissioner of the Revenue, Campbell County, 06-049 ( 7/24/06) (Overruled by 2020 Va. AG LEXIS 28).

In any case where a business subject to a local license tax is located partially within a county, city or town and partially within another county, city or town by reason of the boundary line between such political subdivisions passing through such place of busines s, the situs for the local license of such business shall be each county, city or town in which any part of such place of business is located. If a local license tax is measured by the volume of business done, the volume allocable to each political subdi vision for measuring the local license tax levied by it shall be such proportion of the total volume of business done at such place of business as the area within that political subdivision, which such place of business actually occupies and actively use s in connection with such business, bears to the total area which such place of business actually occupies and actively uses in connection with such business. And in every such case, if a local license tax is a flat tax, the amount thereof shall be adjus ted so as to constitute such proportion of the entire flat license tax levied by the political subdivision as the area within that political subdivision, which such place of business actually occupies and actively uses in connection with such business, b ears to the total area which such place of business actually occupies and actively uses in connection with such business. The word area, as used in this section, means the area of the land actually occupied by the building or structure constituti ng the place of business; but if such place of business actually occupies and actively uses only a part of such building or structure, the land area below such part shall be the land area which shall be used in making the apportionment, whether or not su ch building or structure contains one story or floor or more than one story or floor. If the place of business is of such nature that inventories are kept or stored outside of a building or structure, then the land area used in keeping or storing such in ventories, together with the land area actually occupied by any building or structure, or part thereof, which is actually occupied and actively used in connection with such business shall constitute the land area for making the apportionment. If the plac e of business has a parking area contiguous thereto for the use of its vehicles or those of its customers to the exclusion of any other business, such area shall be included in the word area as used in this section. If the place of business has a contiguous parking area used in common with other places of business, such parking area shall be apportioned for the purpose of this section among such places of business in the ratio of their total areas to the whole parking area, and the area so appor tioned shall be included within the word area as used in this section. B. Any person whose place of business comes within the provisions of subsection A of this section and who considers himself aggrieved by the imposition upon him of a local license tax, may, at any time during the license year, apply for relief to any court of record h aving jurisdiction in any county or city involved, and the court shall issue against each such county or city a rule to show cause why relief should not be granted. The rule shall be served on the attorney for the Commonwealth for the county or on the ci ty attorney for the city, as the case may be. The court shall hear the case without a jury and shall render judgment declaring the proper tax to be paid, and granting such relief as may be proper. In any case where the court finds that the tax imposed wa s excessive, no costs shall be awarded against the taxpayer, nor shall he be liable for penalty or interest on such tax if he pays the tax before the expiration of fifteen days after final judgment.

When a cont ractor has paid any local license tax required by the county, city or town in which his principal office and any branch office or offices may be located, no further license or license tax shall be required by any other county, city or town for conducting any such business within the confines of this Commonwealth. However, when the amount of business done by any such contractor in any other county, city or town exceeds the sum of $25,000 in any year, such other county, city or town may require of such co ntractor a local license, and the amount of business done in such other county, city or town in which a license tax is paid may be deducted by the contractor from the gross revenue reported to the county, city or town in which the principal office or any branch office of the contractor is located. B. Any contrac tor, as defined in § 58.1-3714 D, conducting business in a county, city or town for less than thirty days without a definite place of business in any county, city or town of the Commonwealth shall be subject to the license fee or license tax imposed o n contractors by any county, city or town, where the amount of business done by the contractor in such county, city or town exceeds or will exceed the sum of $25,000 for the license year.That portion of the gross receipts of a contractor subject to the l icense tax pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to such tax in any other county, city or town.

CASE NOTES Section does not excuse failure to register under § 54-113 (see now § 54.1-1100) et seq.  The provisions of this section means that if an electrical or other contractor has paid the state license tax to the treasurer of a city or county where his princ ipal office is located, he cannot again be required to pay the same tax in another city or county. Perhaps it is an oversight that this section does not refer to the exception that contractors when liable must register under § 54-113 (see now § 54. 1-1100) et seq., but this does not excuse a contractor for failure to register under such provisions. The two statutes are not mutually exclusive. F.S. Bowen Elec. Co. v. Foley, 194 Va. 92, 72 S.E.2d 388, 1952 Va. LEXIS 210 (1952) (decided under prior la w). Definite place of business.  Circuit court correctly applied the last antecedent rule of statutory construction to the clause unless the contractor was subject to the provisions o f § 58.1-3715 in subdivision A 3 a (1) of § 58.1-3703.1 and properly concluded that it applied only to the clause immediately preceding it because the unless clause had no effect upon contractors actions against a city seeking relie f from erroneous tax assessments imposed upon gross receipts the contractors received from construction projects in localities outside the city when all the gross receipts were derived from the contractors work done in localities in which they had a definite place of business; section 58.1-3715 applied only to receipts from localities in which the contractors had no definite place of business, and it contained no language granting the city authority to levy a tax on gross receipts from services perf ormed by a contractor in other localities in which it had a definite place of business.

History of section.  The general provisions of this section, defining peddlers, fixing a state license tax and a penalty for violations, and exempting farmers and producers of the enu merated articles from the imposition of the tax, are not new. The general features are found in §§ 50 and 51 of the Tax Bill of 1903. City of Petersburg v. General Baking Co., 170 Va. 303, 196 S.E. 597, 1938 Va. LEXIS 189 (1938). The right to assess peddlers with a license tax is perfectly plain, so long as it is don e in good faith. It rests both in the power to tax and in the police power. Carpel v. City of Richmond, 162 Va. 833, 175 S.E. 316, 1934 Va. LEXIS 290 (1934). The exemption of farmers under this section must be reasonably construed. It was never i ntended that the mere fact that one was a farmer carried with it all the privileges of a peddler. The agricultural products which he may sell must be those which he has produced.

The cases below were decided under prior law. This section is not applicable to one selling to consumers, but only to one selling to l icensed dealers or retailers. Caffee v. City of Portsmouth, 203 Va. 928, 128 S.E.2d 421, 1962 Va. LEXIS 239 (1962). Nor is it applicable to business which sells at a regular place of business.  Neither the tax nor an exemption contained in this section is applicable to a business which sells at a regular place of business. A basic element of sale by pedd ling is that the sale be made at other than a regular place of business. Caffee v. City of Portsmouth, 203 Va. 928, 128 S.E.2d 421, 1962 Va. LEXIS 239 (1962). Ordinance taxing nonresident dairy held not discriminatory.  The contention that a tax ordinance discriminated against a nonresident dairy, because resident dairies were not assessed with the tax, was without merit, since t he basis of the classification made by the ordinance was not whether the dairy was a resident or a nonresident, but whether, under the state laws applicable, it was or was not taxable on capital employed in business in Virginia. Thompson's Dairy, Inc. v. County Bd., 197 Va. 623, 90 S.E.2d 810, 1956 Va. LEXIS 131 (1956). And not a burden on interstate comme rce.  A dairy company, a corporation of the District of Columbia with its plant there, by truck over regular routes in Arlington County delivered dairy products to regu lar retail customers to fill orders previously taken, but also carried and sold to these customers and to other persons along the routes extra products. It sold to wholesale customers whatever products were selected on arrival of the truck. Since sales w ere made in Virginia, the county could validly assess retail and wholesale peddlers taxes against the company, there being no burden on interstate commerce. Thompson's Dairy, Inc. v.

County Bd., 197 Va. 623, 90 S.E.2d 810, 1956 Va. LEXIS 131 (1956). Under this section a dealer in forest products is exempt. This exemption must be constru ed in the light of common sense. Plainly one could not peddle filing cabinets because they chanced to be made of wood. But he may sell cordwood, kindling, charcoal, etc., and rustic furniture which he himself has made. Carpel v. City of Richmond, 162 Va. 833, 175 S.E. 316, 1934 Va. LEXIS 290 (1934). Exemptions do not render ordinance void.  Exemptions of distributors of motor vehicle fuels, farmers, dealers in forest products, and products of manufacturers, in a municipal ordinance imposing license t axes on peddlers or vendors, do not render the ordinance void as being arbitrary.

The situs for the local license taxation of such direct seller shall be the county, city or town in which such person maintains his place of abode. B. As used in this section the term direct seller means any person who: 1. Engag es in the trade or business of selling or soliciting the sale of consumer products primarily in private residences and maintains no public location for the conduct of such business; and 2. Receives remuneration for such activities, with substantially all of such remuneration being directly related to sales or other sales-oriented services, rather than to the number of ho urs worked; and 3. Performs such activities pursuant to a written contract between such person and the person for whom the activities are performed and such contract provides that such person will not be treated as an employee with respect to such activities for federal tax purposes.

Gross recei pts for license tax purposes shall not include any amount not derived from the exercise of the licensed privilege to engage in a business or profession in the ordinary course of business.The following items are excluded: 1. Amoun ts received and paid to the United States, the Commonwealth or any county, city or town for the Virginia retail sales or use tax, for any local sales tax or any local excise tax on cigarettes, or amounts received for any federal or state excise taxes on motor fuels. 2. Any amount representing the liquidation of a debt or conversion of another asset to the extent that the amount is attributable to a transaction previously taxed (e.g., the factoring of accounts receivable created by sales which have been included in taxable receipts even though the creation of such debt and factoring are a regular part of its business). 3. Any amount representing returns and allowances granted by the business to its customers. 4. Receipts which are the proceeds of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the obligor. 5. Receipts representing the return of principal of a loan transaction in which the licensee is the creditor, or the return of principal or basis upon the sale of a capital asset. 6. Rebates and discounts taken or received on account of purchases by the licensee. A rebate or other incentive offered to induce the recipient to purchase certain goods or services from a person other than the offeror, and which the recipient assigns to the licensee in consideration of the sale goods and services shall not be considered a rebate or discount to the licensee, but shall be included in the licensees gross receipts toget her with any handling or other fees related to the incentive. 7. Withdrawals from inventory for purposes other than sale or distribution and for which no consideration is received and the occasional sale or exchange of assets other than inventory wh ether or not a gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. 8. Investment income not directly related to the privilege exercised by a business subject to licensure not classified as rendering financial services. This exclusion shall apply to inter est on bank accounts of the business, and to interest, dividends and other income derived from the investment of its own funds in securities and other types of investments unrelated to the licensed privilege. This exclusion shall not apply to interest, l ate fees and similar income attributable to an installment sale or other transaction that occurred in the regular course of business. B. The followi ng shall be deducted from gross receipts or gross purchases that would otherwise be taxable: 1. Any a mount paid for computer hardware and software that are sold to a United States federal or state government entity provided that such property was purchased within two years of the sale to said entity by the original purchaser who shall have been contract ually obligated at the time of purchase to resell such property to a state or federal government entity. This deduction shall not occur until the time of resale and shall apply to only the original cost of the property and not to its resale price, and th e deduction shall not apply to any of the tangible personal property which was the subject of the original resale contract if it is not resold to a state or federal government entity in accordance with the original contract obligation. 2. Any receipts attributable to business conducted in another state or foreign country in which the taxpayer (or its shareholders, partners or members in lieu of the taxpayer) is liable f or an income or other tax based upon income.

For annual survey article, Taxation, see 46 U. Rich. L. Rev. 203 (2011). CASE NOTES No particular methodology required.  Subdivision B 2 leaves unresolved the permissible methodology for calculating the deduction; thus, the plain and unambiguous statutory language allows for the adm inistrative agency whose duty it is to administer and enforce the tax laws, that is, the Department of Taxation and the Tax Commissioner, to decide how such a deduction may be calculated. Nielsen Co. (US), LLC v. County Bd. of Arlington County, 289 Va. 7 9, 767 S.E.2d 1, 2015 Va. LEXIS 6 (2015). Use of an estimate methodology when determining a deduction, but only when it is impossible to determine the exact figures to calculate such a deduction, is neith er contrary to established rules of law nor a mechanism permitting an assessment to be founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact when that very same methodology is used to determine the initial tax to be imposed, but only when it i s impractical or impossible to determine the exact figures to calculate such a tax. Nielsen Co. (US), LLC v. County Bd. of Arlington County, 289 Va. 79, 767 S.E.2d 1, 2015 Va. LEXIS 6 (2015). Virginia Code does not require or preclude any particular methodology to calculate the deduction pursuant to subdivision B 2; because the General Assemblys in tent is usually self-evident from the statutory language itself, and because subdivision B 2 is neither ambiguous nor absurd, only the plain meaning of the words used in the statute are applied. Nielsen Co. (US), LLC v. County Bd. of Arlington County, 28 9 Va. 79, 767 S.E.2d 1, 2015 Va. LEXIS 6 (2015). Attributable speaks only to cause and consequence: that receipts are subject to deduction only if they are created by business in a foreign jurisdiction i n which the taxpayer is subject to an income-based tax liability; that is, attributable does not mandate or prohibit any particular methodology to determine which receipts captured in the pool of taxable gross receipts are subject to deduction. N ielsen Co. (US), LLC v. County Bd. of Arlington County, 289 Va. 79, 767 S.E.2d 1, 2015 Va. LEXIS 6 (2015). Accounting methodology proper.  Circuit court erred in reversing the Tax Commissioner because the Commissioners ruling to require manual accounting, or payroll apportionment in the event tha t manual accounting was impossible to calculate the deduction, fell within the scope of accounting methodologies permitted by subdivision B 2. Nielsen Co. (US), LLC v. County Bd. of Arlington County, 289 Va. 79, 767 S.E.2d 1, 2015 Va. LEXIS 6 (2015). Tax Commissioners interpretation.  Circuit court did not err in refusing to defer to the Tax Commissioners interpretation of subdivision B 2 because it was unambiguous, and thus, the Tax Commis sioners interpretation of that statute was not entitled to great weight; a court never defers to the Tax Commissioners interpretation of a statute. Nielsen Co. (US), LLC v. County Bd. of Arlington County, 289 Va. 79, 767 S.E.2d 1, 2015 Va. LEXIS 6 (2015). Burden of proof.  In appealing to the circuit court to challenge the Tax Commissioners decision, Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-3703.1(A)(7)(a) did not shift the burden to the county to disprove the availability or amount of the deduction a taxpayer sought under Va. Code Ann. § 58.1-3732(B)(2); under the Tax Commissioners three step analysis, the taxpayer continued to bear the burden before the circuit court to show that it co uld satisfy each step of the analysis in order to take and correctly calculate the deduction. Nielsen Co. (US), LLC v. County Bd. of Arlington County, 289 Va. 79, 767 S.E.2d 1, 2015 Va. LEXIS 6 (2015). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Subdivision B 2 of this section should be applied to businesses outside the Commonwealth so that the assessments are fairly apportioned between the activity within the taxing jurisdiction and the activity outside the Commonwealth. See opinion of Atto rney General to The Honorable Ross A. Mugler, Commissioner of the Revenue for the City of Hampton, 02-114 (12/12/02). Gross receip ts from another state or foreign country.  Subdivision B 2 of this section permits a Virginia licensee to deduct, from its base of taxable gross receipts, the gross receipts attributable to business conduc ted in another state or foreign country, wherein such licensee is liable for or subject to income or other tax based on income.

Notwithstan ding the provisions of § 58.1-605, whenever any locality imposes a license tax applicable to motor vehicle dealers measured by the gross receipts of such dealer, the dealer may separately state the amount of tax applicable to each sale of a motor vehi cle and add such tax to the sales price of the motor vehicle. It shall be unlawful for a motor vehicle dealer to collect an amount stated separately as such if such dealer knows the amount to be greater than the tax applicable to such sale. The failure o f such merchant to recover the tax from the purchaser shall not relieve such merchant from the obligation to pay the tax to the locality. Any locality may provide by ordinance for the quarterly collection of the gross receipt taxes on such dealers who se parately state during the year such receipts are earned. B. A motor veh icle dealer who collects excess business license tax shall exercise due diligence to refund such tax, in excess of one dollar, to the purchaser within 120 days of discovering such overpayment, and such dealer shall produce evidence of such refund to the commissioner of the revenue or other local assessing officer upon the request of either. Any amounts that are not refunded to purchasers shall be remitted to the commissioner of the revenue or other local assessing officer. During a three-year period aft er receipt of such amounts, the commissioner of the revenue or other local assessing officer and the treasurer, as that term is defined in § 58.1-3123, shall refund such amounts as appropriate to purchasers who produce documentation verifying such ove rpayment. At the expiration of this period, the commissioner of the revenue or other local assessing officer shall consider these funds as additional business license tax. The locality may recover from the motor vehicle dealer its costs of mailing, print ing, and other reasonably necessary administrative costs related to refunding such amounts to purchasers.

Such persons shall be deemed t o be engaged in the business of severing coal from the earth. Economic interest means the interest possessed by a person who has acquired by capital investment any interest in the coal in place and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income from the extraction of the coal, to which he must look for a return of his capital. A person who has no capital investment in the coal deposit shall not possess an economic interest merely because through a contractual relation he possesses a mere economic or pecuniary advantage derived from production such as persons who have a contractual right to purchase or process the coal upon production or persons entitled to compensation for extracting or mining the coal. For purposes of this chapter, economic interest does not include interests possessed by a person who receives only royalty payments solely because of such royalty payments. Apart from t he royalty interest exclusion in this definition, it is the intent of the General Assembly that economic interest shall have essentially the same meaning as for purposes of 26 C.F.R. § 1.611-1. Gross receipts means the purchase price received by a coal producer for the sale of co al to an unaffiliated purchaser in an arms-length transaction. Gross receipts does not include the cost of transporting the coal to such an unaffiliated purchaser. In circumstances in which the coal is (i) utilized by the coal producer or an affiliated individual or entity or (ii) sold in a related-party transaction or under circumstances that indicate the sale is not an arms-length transaction, gross receipts shall be determined by multiplying the volume of coal utilized or sold by (a) the average sale price received by the coal producer in arms-length transactions for the sale of other coal reasonably deemed by the commissioner of the revenue or other local assessing official of the locality to be of comparable quality dur ing the same time frame or (b) if no such other sales are available, the sale price of other coal reasonably deemed by the commissioner of the revenue or other local assessing official of the locality to be of comparable quality, sold by other coal produ cers engaged in the severance of similar coal within the county or city or neighboring counties or cities during the same time frame. No deductions shall be taken from gross receipts except for a deduction for non-local coal transportation and processing costs. Non-local coal transportation and processing costs means only such costs applicable to coal that is severed in one county or city and then transported by the coal producer to another county or city for cleaning, preparation, or processing in order to achieve a dry and clean coal. Non-local coal transportation and processing costs includes the costs of transporting the coal from the county or city in which it was severed to the second county or city and the costs of cleaning, preparation, and processing that are incurred within that second county or city. Such costs shall not incl ude any costs associated with blending dry and clean coals unless such blending occurs in the same non-local county or city to which the coal is initially transported for cleaning, preparation, or processing. The amount of the deduction for non-local coa l transportation and processing costs shall be calculated by dividing the total actual costs incurred per ton in such non-local transportation, cleaning, preparation, and processing by the total costs per ton of mining, transportation, cleaning, preparat ion, and processing of such coal to derive a factor or percentage. Such factor or percentage shall then be multiplied by the gross receipts from the sale or utilization of such coal to determine the applicable deduction for non-local coal transportation and processing costs. Small mine means a mine that sells less than 10,000 tons of coal per month.

The governing body of any locality that levies a cigarette tax and permits the use of meter impressions or stamps to evidence its payment may authorize an officer of the local or joint enf orcement authority to enter into an arrangement with the Department of Taxation under which a tobacco wholesaler who so desires may use a dual die or stamp to evidence the payment of both the local tax and the state tax, and the Department is hereby auth orized to enter into such an arrangement. The procedure under such an arrangement shall be such as may be agreed upon by and between the authorized local or joint enforcement authority officer and the Department. B. Any county cigarette tax imposed shall not apply within the limits of any town located in such county where such town now, or hereafter, imposes a town cigarette tax. However, if the governing body of any such town shall provide that a county cigarette tax, as well as the town cigarette tax, shall apply within the limits of such town, then such cigarette tax may be imposed by the county within such town. C. The maximum tax rate imposed by a locality on cigarettes pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be as follows: 1. If su ch locality is (i) a city or town that, on January 1, 2020, had in effect a rate not exceeding two cents ($0.02) per cigarette sold or (ii) a county, then the maximum rate shall be two cents ($0.02) per cigarette sold. 2. If such locality is a city or town that, on January 1, 2020, had in effect a rate exceeding two cents ($0.02) per cigarette sold, then the maximum rate shall be the rate in effect on J anuary 1, 2020. D. Any localit y that increases its tax rate shall, for one calendar year after the increase, allow a person with unsold inventory to pay the tax increase on the unsold inventory by filing a return, rather than requiring the use of a stamp or meter impression. Such ret urn shall identify the amount of unsold inventory, the amount of tax paid on such unsold inventory, and the amount of tax due as a result of the tax rate increase. Such return shall be due six calendar months after the effective date of the tax rate incr ease. For purposes of this subsection, unsold inventory means cigarettes held prior to the tax rate increase. History History.

Suc h local ordinance may: 1. Provi de for the registration of any distributor, wholesaler, vendor, retailer or other person selling, storing or possessing cigarettes within or transporting cigarettes within or into such taxing jurisdiction for sale or use. Such registration may be conditi oned upon the filing of a bond with a surety company authorized to do business in Virginia as surety, which bond shall not exceed one and one-half times the average monthly liability of such taxpayer. The county, city or town may revoke registration if s uch bond is impaired, but for no other reason. Any such distributor, wholesaler, retailer or other person whose business and residence is outside the taxing jurisdiction, who shall sell, store or possess in the taxing jurisdiction therein any cigarettes shall, by virtue of such sale, storage or possession submit himself to its legal jurisdiction and appoint as his attorney for any service of lawful process such officer or person as may be designated in the local ordinance for that purpose. A copy of any such process served on the said officer or person shall be sent forthwith by registered mail to the distributor, wholesaler or retailer. 2. Provide for the use of a tax stamp or meter impression as evidence of payment of the tax or other method or system of reporting payment and collection of such tax. Any local tax stamp or meter impression required to be used to evidence payment of the tax shall be of the same stamp technology that is used or required by the Commonwealth for the state cigarette tax stamp pursuant to Chapter 10 (§ 58.1-1000 et seq.). The purchase pric e of any tax stamps purchased under this section shall be refunded, without penalties or additional fees, upon verification by the county, city, or town imposing the tax that the stamps have been returned to such county, city, or town. 3. Provide that tobacco products found in quantities of more than six cartons within the taxing jurisdiction shall be conclusively presumed for sale or use within the jurisdiction and may be seized and confiscated if: a. They are in transit, and are not accompanied by a bill of lading or other document indicating the true name and address of the consignor or seller and of the consignee or purchaser, and the brands and quantity of cigarettes so transported, or are in tran sit and accompanied by a bill of lading or other document which is false or fraudulent, in whole or in part; or b. They are in transit and are accompanied by a bill of lading or other document indicating: (1) A consignee or purchaser in another state or the District of Columbia who is not authorized by the law of such other jurisdiction to receive or possess such tobacco products on which the taxes imposed by such other jurisdiction have not been paid, unless the tax of the state or District of destination has been paid and the said products bear the tax stamps of that state or District; or (2) A consignee or purchaser in the Commonwealth of Virginia but outside the taxing jurisdiction who does not possess a Virginia sales and use tax certificate, a Virginia retail cigarette license and, where applicable, both a business license and retail cigarette license issued by the local jurisdiction of destination; or c. They are not in transit and the tax has not been paid, nor have approved arrangements for payment been made, provided that this subparagraph shall not apply to cigarettes in the p ossession of distributors or public warehouses which have filed notice and appropriate proof with the taxing jurisdiction that those cigarettes are temporarily within the taxing jurisdiction and will be sent to consignees or purchasers outside the jurisd iction in the normal course of business. 4.

The mere possession of untaxed cigarettes in quantities of not mo re than six cartons shall not be a violation of any such ordinance. 6. Provide for the forfeiture and sale of any property seized; provided, however, that proper notice of such seizure shall be given to the known holders of property interests in such prop erty and shall include procedures for administrative appeal as well as affirmative defenses which may be asserted by such holders which procedures must be set forth in reasonable detail. 7. Provide that any coin-operated vending machine, in which any cigarettes are found, stored or possessed bearing a counterfeit or bogus cigarette tax stamp or impression or any unstamped tobacco products, or any cigarettes upon which the tax has not been paid, may be declared contraband property and shall be subject to confiscation and sale as provided in subsection 6. When any such vending machine is found containing such cigarettes it shall be presumed that such cigarettes were intended for distribution, sale or use therefrom. In lieu of immediate seizure and confiscation of any vending machines used in an illegal evasion of the tax it may be sealed by appropriate enforcement authori ties to prevent continued illegal sale or removal of any cigarettes, and may be left unmoved until other civil and criminal penalties are imposed or waived. Notice requirements shall be the same as if the machine had been seized. Such seal may be removed and the machine declared eligible for operation only by authorized enforcement authorities. Nothing in this section shall prevent seizure and confiscation of a vending machine at any time after it is sealed. 8. Provide that any counterfeit stamps or counterfeit impression devices may also be seized and confiscated. 9. Any county, city or town may enact an ordinance which would delegate its administrative and enforcement authority under its cigarette tax ordinance to one agency or authority pursuant to the provisions of § 15.2-1300.

Each county and city treasurer shall receive the local taxes and other amounts payable into the treasury of the political subdivision of the Commonwealth served by the treasurer, and shall account for and pay over the same in the manner provided by law. Taxpayers s hall make checks payable to Treasurer (or title of other officer or employee who performs the duties of a treasurer) of (name of political subdivision) or (name of political subdivision). This section shall not apply to any city insofar a s local revenues are concerned when the charter of such city provides otherwise. B. In any coun ty, the county treasurer and the treasurer of any town located partially or totally within such county may enter into a reciprocal agreement with the approval of the respective governing bodies that provides for the town treasurer to collect real and per sonal property taxes owed to the county and for the county treasurer to collect real and personal property taxes owed to the town. A treasurer collecting any taxes pursuant to an agreement entered into under this subsection shall account for and pay over such amounts to the locality owed such taxes in the same manner as provided by law. As used in this subsection, with regard to towns, the term treasurer shall mean the town officer or employee vested with authority by the charter, statute, or th e governing body to collect local taxes.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Erroneous payments.  Payments erroneously made to towns by the county treasurer under subsection H of § 58.1-605 may not be refunded to the county pursuant to subsection F of § 58.1-605. Nor does the distribution by the county treasurer to a town that was based on incorrect school census data constitute an error made in any such payment under subsection F of § 58.1-605. However, subsection A of § 58.1-3133 permits the treasurer to deduct the overpayments as other charges to recoup those amounts. See opinion of Attorney General to C.

The county treasurer collecting town taxes pursuant to an agreement made under this section shall account for and pay over to the town the amounts collected, as provided by law. Any such agreement shall establish the terms for such collection and enforcement, including payment of reasonable compensation by the town for the se rvices of the county treasurer and the order in which the county treasurer will credit partial payments between taxes owed to the county and those owed to the town.

The treasurer may elect not to send a bill amounting to $20 or less as shown by an assessment book in such treasurers office. The treasurer may employ the services of a mailing service or other vendor for fulfilling the requirements of this section. The failure of any such treasurer to comply with this section shall be a Class 4 misdemeanor. Such treasurer shall be deemed in compliance with this section as to any taxes due on real estate if, upon certific ation by the obligee of any note or other evidence of debt secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on such real estate that an agreement has been made with the obligor in writing within the mortgage or deed of trust instrument that such arrangements be ma de, he mails the bill for such taxes to the obligee thereof.

Penalty for failure to make return.  Two obligations rest on the taxpayer, one is to see that his property is properly assessed, and the other is to pay the tax thereon by December first (now Decembe r fifth) following, if he would escape the penalty. If a taxpayer who makes a full and correct return of his property to the commissioner of the revenue and fails to pay the tax in time cannot escape the penalty, then a fortiori a person or corporation s ubject to taxation who refuses or fails to make a return should be subject to the same penalty as one who made a return but failed to pay the taxes.

No penalty for failure to pay a tax or installment shall exceed (i) 10 percent of the tax past due on such property; (ii) in the case of delinquent tangible personal property tax more than 30 days past due on property classified pursuant to subdivis ion A 15, A 16, or A 20 of § 58.1-3506, which remains unpaid after 10 days written notice sent by United States mail to the taxpayer of the intention to impose a penalty pursuant hereto, the penalty shall not exceed an amount equal to the differen ce between the tax due and owing with respect to such property and the tax that would have been due and owing if the property in question had been classified as general tangible personal property pursuant to § 58.1-3503; (iii) in the case of delinquen t tangible personal property tax more than 30 days past due, 25 percent of the tax past due on such tangible personal property; (iv) in the case of delinquent remittance of excise taxes on meals, lodging, or admissions collected from consumers, 10 percen t for the first month the taxes are past due, and five percent for each month thereafter, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the taxes collected but not remitted; or (v) $10, whichever is greater, provided, however, that the penalty shall in no case exceed the amount of the tax assessable. No penalty for failure to file a return shall be greater than 10 percent of the tax assessable on such return or $10, whichever is greater; provided, however, that the penalty shall in no case exceed the amount of the t ax assessable. The assessment of such penalty shall not be deemed a defense to any criminal prosecution for failing to make return of taxable property as may be required by law or ordinance. Penalty for failure to file an application or return may be ass essed on the day after such return or application is due; penalty for failure to pay any tax may be assessed on the day after the first installment is due. Any such penalty when so assessed shall become a part of the tax. No penalty for failure to pay any tax shall be imposed for any assessment made later than two weeks prior to the day on which the taxes are due, if such assessment is m ade thereafter through the fault of a local official, and if such assessment is paid within two weeks after the notice thereof is mailed. In the event a transfer of real property ownership occurs after January 1 of a tax year and a real estate tax bill has been mailed pursuant to §§ 58.1-3281 and 58 .1-3912, the treasurer or other appropriate local official designated by ordinance of the local governing body in jurisdictions not having a treasurer, upon ascertaining that a property transfer has occurred, may invalidate a bill sent to the prior owner and reissue the bill to the new owner as permitted by § 58.1-3912, and no penalty for failure to pay any tax for any such assessment shall be imposed if the tax is paid within two weeks after the notice thereof is mailed. Penalty and interest for failure to file a return or to pay a tax shall not be imposed if such failure was not the fault of the taxpayer, or was the fault of the commis sioner of revenue or the treasurer, as the case may be. The failure to file a return or to pay a tax due to the death of the taxpayer or a medically determinable physical or mental impairment on the date the return or tax is due shall be presumptive proo f of lack of fault on the taxpayers part, provided the return is filed or the taxes are paid within 30 days of the due date; however, if there is a committee, legal guardian, conservator or other fiduciary handling the individuals affairs, such r eturn shall be filed or such taxes paid within 120 days after the fiduciary qualifies or begins to act on behalf of the taxpayer. Interest on such taxes shall accrue until paid in full. Any such fiduciary shall, on behalf of the taxpayer, by the due date , file any required returns and pay any taxes that come due after the 120-day period. The treasurer shall make determinations of fault relating exclusively to failure to pay a tax, and the commissioner of the revenue shall make determinations of fault re lating exclusively to failure to file a return. In jurisdictions not having a treasurer or commissioner of the revenue, the governing body may delegate to the appropriate local tax officials the responsibility to make the determination of fault. The governing body may further provide by resolution for reasonable extensions of time, not to exceed 90 days, for the payment of real estate and personal property taxe s and for filing returns on tangible personal property, machinery and tools, and merchants capital, and the business, professional, and occupational license tax, whenever good cause exists. The official granting such extension shall keep a record of every such extension. If any taxpayer who has been granted an extension of time for filing his return fails to file his return within the extended time, his case shall be treated the same as if no extension had been granted. This section shall be the sole authority for local ordinances setting due dates of local taxes and penalty and interest thereon, and shall supersede the provisions of a ny charter or special act.

CASE NOTES Scope of section.  This section and cognate sections providing for the collection of delinquent taxes from taxpayers apply only to cases in which the lists have been returned by the treasurer in good faith in conformity to law, and afford no remedy against a treasurer who has ex maleficio collected tax tickets in the delinquent lists. The board of supervisors alone can hold a treasurer responsible for such derelictions of duty so f ar as the county levy is concerned. These sections afford remedies against delinquent taxpayers and their property, but none against a defaulting treasurer. Board of Supvrs. v. Powell, 106 Va. 751, 56 S.E. 812, 1907 Va.

It is not necessary that resort be had to each individual item taxed. If taxes were due on two horses, plainly the tax collector would not have to sell both of them. And to this right no mortgage or deed of trust is a bar, subject only to a single qualification: When they have passed out of the possession of the del inquent owner, they are liable only for such specific taxes as have been directly levied against them. Chambers v. Higgins, 169 Va. 345, 193 S.E. 531, 1937 Va. LEXIS 180 (1937) (decided under prior law). Seizure of property required f or distress.  City had no tax lien against funds that were overpaid to the city by a bankruptcy debtors surety since the city did not seize the funds against which no taxes were assessed as required to support distress; the city first delivered a check for the funds to the bankruptcy trustee and, when the check expired, the city turned the funds over to the state as unclaimed property.

No security interest in goods or chattels shall prevent the same from being distrained and sold for taxes or levies assessed thereon, no matter in whose possession they may be found. B. Prior to su ch sale for distress, the treasurer, sheriff, constable or collector, or other party conducting the sale shall give notice to any secured party of record as his name and address shall appear on the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Departm ent of Wildlife Resources, the State Corporation Commission, or in the office of the clerk of any circuit court where the debtor has resided to the knowledge of the party to whom the tax is owing during a one-year period prior to the sale. Notice shall a lso be given to any secured party of whom the party to whom the tax is owing shall have knowledge. C. A security interest perfected prior to any distraint for taxes shall have priority over all taxes, except those specifically assessed either per item or in bulk against the goods and chattels so assessed. Taxes specifically assessed either per item or in bulk again st goods and chattels shall constitute a lien against the property so assessed and shall have priority over all security interests. For purposes of this section, a merchants capital tax shall be deemed to be specifically assessed against all inventor y in the merchants possession at the time of distraint, or at the time such inventory is repossessed by the holder of a security interest therein. For purposes of this section, taxes specifically assessed in bulk means an assessment against the speci fic class of property distrained. D. The title c onveyed to the purchaser of goods and chattels at a sale for taxes specifically assessed either per item or in bulk against such goods and chattels distrained shall be free of all claims of any creditor, including the claims of any secured party of recor d, provided that notice was given to such creditor as required by subsection B. The person conducting the sale shall apply the proceeds of the sale first to unpaid taxes, penalty, and accrued interest, and then to the claims of secured parties of record, in the order of their priority, before delivering any sum remaining to the person or estate assessed with taxes. E. Notwithstan ding any provision of this section to the contrary, no highway vehicle as defined in § 58.1-3941 purchased by a bona fide purchaser for value from the person or estate assessed with taxes shall be liable to levy or distress for such taxes unless the p urchaser knew at the time of purchase that the taxes had been specifically assessed against such vehicle. F. The purchas er of a motor vehicle sold under this section shall receive a sales receipt and an affidavit of the treasurer, sheriff, constable or collector, or other party conducting the sale affirming that he has complied with the provisions of this section, and sha ll be entitled to apply to and receive from the Department of Motor Vehicles a certificate of title and registration card for the vehicle.

CASE NOTES The right to levy on chattels for taxes, when such chattels were subject to a deed of tr ust or mortgage, existed, for whatever it was worth, independent of statute, although as a substantial right it might be barred by a prior mortgage. By the former section as it stood before the 1966 amendment, mortgages were no bar to distress and sale o f chattels for taxes, subject to but one qualification, namely, that chattels out of possession could be taken only for taxes assessed thereon.

Higgins, 169 Va. 345, 193 S.E. 531, 1937 Va. LEXIS 180 (1937) (decided under prior law). Bankruptcy.  Although debtors Chapter 13 plan failed to treat a countys claim for personal property taxes secured by the debtors vehicle as a secured claim, becaus e the county failed to object to confirmation or to take a timely appeal from the confirmation order, it was bound by the terms of the plan even if those terms were contrary to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and could not have been confirmed had a timely objection been made. However, the county was not necessarily without a remedy for ultimately collecting the taxes since the mere failure of the plan to treat the countys claim as secured did not extinguish the countys statutory lien for t he taxes. In re Meyers, No. 06-11348-SSM, 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 3916 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Nov. 16, 2007). City had no tax lien against funds that were overpaid to the city by a bankruptcy debtors surety under subsection C of § 58.1-3942 since the citys admi tted tax lien against the debtors motor vehicles for unpaid vehicle taxes did not extend to the funds against which no tax was assessed, and the lien was expressly limited to assessed property.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The term priority, as used in subsection C, means that a secured party whose security interest is perfected prior to any distraint for taxes shall be paid first out of any proceeds from the sale of the distrained property, unless the taxes for which the property was distrained were specifically assessed against the distrained property.

If the attorney for the Commonwealth employs individuals, the costs associated with employing such individuals may be paid fro m the proceeds of the amounts collected provided that the cost is apportioned on a pro rata basis according to the amount collected which is due the state and that which is due the locality. If the attorney for the Commonwealth does not undertake collect ion, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall, as soon as practicable, take steps to ensure that any agreement or contract with an individual, attorney or agency complies with the terms of the current Master Guidelines Governing Collection of Unpaid Delin quent Court-Ordered Fines and Costs Pursuant to Virginia Code § 19.2-349 promulgated by the Office of the Attorney General, the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court, the Department of Taxation, and the Compensation Board (the Master Guidelines ).

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Attorney fees.  Oral contract a county entered into with a law firm to pay a fee of the taxes collected was reasonable because the treasurer used good business sense for the bene fit of the citizens when he decided to use a contingent fee contract and pay a commission based on results; the statutes requiring the court to determine a reasonable attorneys fee in the collection of real estate taxes prevailed because this section addressed fees in the collection of local taxes in a general manner.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL City may receive the administrative fee for collection in addition to a contingent collection fee.  A city treasurer is authorized to enter into an agreement with the local Commonwealths Attorney for the collection of delinquent court debt. The city treasure r is authorized to receive a contingent collection fee provided the percentage amount of this fee is no higher than 35 percent of any amounts recovered.

For the purposes of this section, abatement costs means costs incurred by a locality that result from the conditions described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv).Upon a finding by the court, on real estate with an asses sed value of $100,000 or less in any locality, that (a) any taxes on such real estate are delinquent on December 31 following the first anniversary of the date on which such taxes have become due or (b) there is a lien on such real estate pursuant to § 15.2-900, 15.2-906, 15.2-907, 15.2-907.1, 15.2-908.1, or 36-49.1:1, which lien remains unpaid on December 31 following the first anniversary of the date on which such lien was recorded, the property shall be deemed subject to sale by public auction pursuant to proper notice under this subsection.The officer charged with the duty of collecting taxes for the locality wherein the real property lies shall, at least 30 days prior to instituting any judicial proceeding pursuant to this section, send a no tice to (1) the last known address of the property owner as such owner and address appear in the records of the treasurer, (2) the property address if the property address is different from the owners address and if the real estate is listed with the post office by a numbered and named street address and (3) the last known address of any trustee under any deed of trust, mortgagee under any mortgage and any other lien creditor, if such trustee, mortgagee or lien creditor is not otherwise made a party defendant under § 58.1-3967, advising such property owner, trustee, mortgagee or other lien creditor of the delinquency and the officers intention to take action.

The owner o f any property listed may redeem it at any time before the date of the sale by paying all accumulated taxes, penalties, reasonable attorneys fees, interest and costs thereon, including the pro rata cost of publication hereunder. Partial payment of de linquent taxes, penalties, reasonable attorneys fees, interest or costs shall not be sufficient to redeem the property, and shall not operate to suspend, invalidate or make moot any action for judicial sale brought pursuant to this article. C. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection B and of § 58.1-3954, the treasurer or other officer responsible for collecting taxes may suspend any action for sale of the property commenced pursuant to this article (i) upon entering into an agreement with the own er of the real property for the payment of all delinquent amounts in installments over a period that is reasonable under the circumstances, but that in no event shall exceed 60 months, or (ii) upon written notice by an individual, not a party to the acti on, asserting ownership rights in the property that is the subject of the action arising by virtue of testate or intestate succession, to the treasurer or other officer responsible for collecting taxes. The treasurer or other officer responsible for coll ecting taxes shall promptly advise the court of such claim and seek leave to add the individual asserting the claim as a party in the action. If the court determines that the individual asserting the claim possesses an ownership interest in the property that is the subject of the action, such individual may, within 30 days of the courts finding, enter into an agreement with the treasurer or other official responsible for collecting taxes for the payment of all delinquent amounts in installments over a period that is reasonable under the circumstances, but that in no event shall exceed 60 months.

In the even t the owner of the property or other responsible person defaults upon obligations arising under an installment agreement permitted by subsection C, or during the term of any installment agreement, defaults on any current obligation as it becomes due, suc h agreement shall be voidable by the treasurer or other officer responsible for collecting taxes upon 15 days written notice to the signatories of such agreement irrespective of the amount remaining due. Any action for the sale previously commenced p ursuant to this article may proceed without any requirement that the notice or advertisement required by subsection A, which had previously been made with respect to such property, be repeated. No owner of property which has been the subject of a default ed installment agreement shall be eligible to enter into a second installment agreement with respect to the same property within three years of such default.

The publications and notices required pursuant to this section shall identify each of the jurisdictions in which the property is situated. Upon sale of the property, the order confirming the sale shall provide fo r the payment of taxes, penalties, interest, and other charges to each jurisdiction, and copies of the order confirming the sale and the deed conveying the property to the purchaser shall be recorded among the land records of the clerks office of the circuit court for each jurisdiction within which the property that is the subject of the suit is situated.

If no claim for payment of the indebtedness secured by any lien chargeable thereon is made by an unknown beneficiary of such lien, or if no claim for such surplus is m ade by such former owner, his heirs or assigns, within two years after the date of confirmation of such sale, then such amount secured by the lien of the unknown beneficiary, surplus, or both, as applicable, shall be paid by the clerk of the court in whi ch such suit was instituted to the county, city, or town that received proceeds from the sale of the real estate. If a county and a town receive proceeds from the same sale, then such surplus shall be divided between the county and town pro rata based on the relative amount of proceeds received by each. Upon request of the former owner, his heirs or assigns, or unknown beneficiary of any real estate sold under this article, and after a showing of a prior entitlement thereto, the governing body of any co unty or city which has received such surplus funds may, in its discretion, grant relief, by ordinance, to such former owner, heir, or assign, or unknown beneficiary and pay over such amount as the governing body may deem appropriate to such former owner, heir, assign, or unknown beneficiary.

CASE NOTES Bill of review.  Circuit court erred in finding that a bill of review was inappropriate where a church sought to challenge a citys action to sell the churchs property to c ollect delinquent real estate taxes. The citys action was brought by a bill in equity, so the circuit court erred in holding that the underlying action was a matter at law. Emmanuel Worship Ctr. v. City of Petersburg, 300 Va. 393, 867 S.E.2d 291, 20 22 Va. LEXIS 1 (2022). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to ascertain all liens.  When the specific provisions of the statute do not expressly overrule the general requirements of a creditors bill, those conventions remain in full force and effect. Consequently, in a judicial proceeding to sell tax delinquent realty the liens against properties subject to sale must be determined at or before the time of entry of the decree of confirmation of sale. City of Fairfax v. Wards, Inc., 98 Va. Cir . 320, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 52 (Fairfax County Apr. 12, 2018). Surplus funds.  In a case in which funds were generated from a tax sale of property owned by petitioner, petitioner was not entitled to the surplus funds from the sale as there w as no surplus in excess of any liens chargeable thereon based on the deed of trust to the secured lender; this statute did not provide that funds subject to a security interest should be paid to the property owner upon the lenders waiver or failure t o appear as this statute clearly provided that surplus funds to which a secured lender had filed no claim would be paid to the city; and equity would follow the law, and the surplus funds from tax sales that were chargeable with the lien of a secured dee d of trust would be paid to the city and not to petitioner, the property owner. City of Norfolk v. Stull, 102 Va. Cir. 283, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 254 (Norfolk July 2, 2019). Attorney fees.  Oral contract a county entered into with a law firm to pay a fee of the taxes collected was reasonable because the treasurer used good business sense for the bene fit of the citizens when he decided to use a contingent fee contract and pay a commission based on results; the statutes requiring the court to determine a reasonable attorneys fee in the collection of real estate taxes prevailed because § 58.1-39 58 addressed fees in the collection of local taxes in a general manner.

Upon (i) receipt of proper service of process on all parties defendant, a written real estate title certificate and the written report of a licensed real estate appraiser where there is no dispute as to title or value, (ii) the receipt of the report of t he commissioner in chancery, or (iii) where the assessor for the locality files an affidavit with the court of value and the value is averred to not exceed $100,000, the court may appoint a special commissioner to sell the properties and execute the nece ssary deeds when a sale is found necessary or advisable. The court may designate the attorney employed by the governing body of the locality to bring the suit. The sale price achieved at a public auction shall be prima facie, but rebuttable, evidence of the value of the property for purposes of the approval of the sale.

The court shall allow as part of the costs, to be paid into the tre asury of the locality, a reasonable sum to defray the cost of its attorneys and the expenses of publication and appraisal necessary for the purpose of instituting such suit and such fees and commissions, including fees for preparing and executing deeds, as would be allowed if the suit were an ordinary lien creditors suit. When the special commissioner is other than the attorney employed by the locality the court may allow him reasonable fees for selling the land and executing the deed, payable out o f the proceeds of sale. In any case in which the attorney representing the locality and the governing body thereof have failed to reach an agreement as to a salary or commission or other basis as compensation for the services of such attorney, the court in which any proceedings are brought under this article may allow from the proceeds of the sale of any such real estate such fee as the court shall deem reasonable and proper to the attorney r epresenting any such locality in such proceeding.

City of Fairfax v. Wards, Inc., 98 Va. Cir . 320, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 52 (Fairfax County Apr. 12, 2018). Waiver of appraisal requirement.  Any possible waiver of the statutes requirement for an appraisal of certain tax delinquent property afforded an owner is contingent upon that same owners efforts to prevent or inhibit the very appraisal required for their benefit; absent some relative culpability in making such appraisal impossible, there can be no waiver. Cty. of Page v. Flickwir, 98 Va. Cir. 308, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Page County Apr. 6, 2018). Since Virginia law provides that a courts power to sell land for non-payment of taxes is entirely a statutory power, and the statutory requirements must be st rictly construed, it does not have the discretion to waive the appraisal requirement. Cty. of Page v. Flickwir, 98 Va. Cir. 308, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Page County Apr. 6, 2018). Appraisal.  Countys motion to waive the requirement for an appraisal report by a licensed real estate appraiser was denied because there was absolutely no evidence that t he owners of the property being sold to satisfy a tax lien were in any way responsible for preventing the appraisal, and in fact, the owners were unknown; thus, there was no equitable reason to deny the owners the protections of the applicable statutes.

After notice as required by this a rticle, service of process, and upon answer filed by the owner or other parties in interest to the bill in equity, the court shall allow the parties to present evidence and arguments, ore tenus, prior to the appointment of the special commissioner. Any s urplusage accruing to a locality, land bank entity, or existing nonprofit entity as a result of the sale of the parcel or parcels after the receipt of the deed shall be payable to the beneficiaries of any liens against the property and to the former owne r, his heirs or assigns in accordance with § 58.1-3967.

C. For sales b y a nonprofit organization pursuant to subsection B, such sales may include either (i) both the land and the structural improvements on a property or (ii) only the structural improvements of a property and not the land the structural improvements are loc ated on. A sale of only the structural improvements is permissible only if (a) the structural improvements are subject to a ground lease with a community land trust, as that term is defined in § 55.1-1200; (b) the structural improvements are subject t o a ground lease that has a term of at least 90 years; and (c) the community land trust retains a preemptive option to purchase such structural improvements at a price determined by a formula that is designed to ensure that the improvements remain afford able in perpetuity to low-income and moderate-income families earning less than 120 percent of the area median income, adjusted for family size.

CASE NOTES Debtor lost ability to redeem proper ty.  Under the wording of § 58.1-3974, debtor prior to the filing of her bankruptcy petition lost her ability to redeem the property unless the state court refused to confirm the sale. Debtors ownership of the property could only have become an asset of the bankruptcy estate if the state court declined to confirm the sale or the sale otherwise failed before completion. City of Roanoke v. Whitlow, 410 Bankr. 220 , 2009 Bankr. LEXIS 2344 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2009). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Attorney fees.  Oral contract a county entered into with a law firm to pay a fee of the taxes collected was reasonable because the treasurer used good business sense for the bene fit of the citizens when he decided to use a contingent fee contract and pay a commission based on results; the statutes requiring the court to determine a reasonable attorneys fee in the collection of real estate taxes prevailed because § 58.1-39 58 addressed fees in the collection of local taxes in a general manner. Roanoke County v. Torry, 85 Va. Cir. 357, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 148 (Roanoke County Sept. 13, 2012).

B. The treasur er or other officer responsible for collecting taxes may in addition sell, at public auction, any parcel of real property that is assessed at more than $10,000 but no more than $25,000, provided that the taxes on such parcel are delinquent on December 31 following the third anniversary of the date on which such taxes have become due, it is not subject to a recorded mortgage or deed of trust lien, and such parcel: 1. Is un improved and measures no more than 43,560 square feet (1.0 acre); 2.

The appeal shall be filed in good faith and sufficiently identify the taxpayer, the tax period covered by the challenged assessment, the amount in dispute, the remedy sought, each alle ged error in the assessment, the grounds upon which the taxpayer relies, and any other facts relevant to the taxpayers contention. 3. The commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official may hold a conference with the taxpayer if requested by the taxpayer, or require submission of additional information and do cuments, an audit or further audits, or other evidence deemed necessary for a proper and equitable determination of the application. 4. The assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct. 5. The commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official shall undertake a full review of the taxpayers claims and issue a written determination to the taxpayer setting forth th e facts and arguments in support of his decision within 90 days after such appeal is filed.

The Tax Commissioner shall not consider an appeal filed pursuant to the provisions of this subsection if he finds that the absence of a final determination on the part of the commissioner of the revenue or other asses sing official was caused by the willful failure or refusal of the taxpayer to provide information requested and reasonably needed by the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official to make his determination. C. Suspension of collection activity pending administrative appeal to commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official. Provided a timely and complete appeal is filed pursuant to subsection B, collection activity shall be suspended by the treasurer or other off icial responsible for the collection of such tax until a final determination is issued by the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official, unless the treasurer or other collection official (i) determines that collection would be jeopardized b y delay as defined in this section; or (ii) is advised by the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official that the taxpayer has not responded to a request for relevant information after a reasonable time.

Th e appeal shall include a copy of the written determination of the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official that is challenged, together with a statement of the facts and grounds upon which the taxpayer relies. 2.

Such longer period of time shall not exceed 60 days, and the Tax Commissioner shall notify the affected parties of the reason necessitating the lon ger period of time. If the Tax Commissioner is unable to issue a determination within the 60-day extension period due to the failure of an affected party to supply the Tax Commissioner with necessary information, the Tax Commissioner shall certify this f act in writing prior to the expiration of the extension period. The Tax Commissioner shall then issue his determination within 60 days of receipt of such necessary information. 4. The appeal shall be treated as an application pursuant to § 58.1-1821, and the Tax Commissioner may issue an order correcting such assessment of such property pursuant to § 58.1- 1822, if the taxpayer has met the burden of proof provided in § 58.1-3987. 5.

Interest shall accrue in accordance with the provisions of subdivision A 2 e of § 58.1-3703.1, but no furt her penalty shall be imposed while collection action is suspended. The requirement that collection activity be suspended shall cease unless an appeal pursuant to subsection D is filed and served on the necessary parties within 30 days of the service of t he notice of intent to file such appeal. F. Implementat ion of determination of Tax Commissioner. Promptly upon receipt of a final determination of the Tax Commissioner, the commissioner of the revenue or other local assessing official shall take those steps necessary to calculate the amount of tax owed by or refund due to the taxpayer consistent with the Tax Commissioners determination and shall provide that information to the taxpayer and to the treasurer or other official responsible for collection in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. 1.

Any person assessed with local taxes, aggrieved by any such assessment, may, unless otherwise specially provided by law (including, but not limited to, as provided under (i) § 15.2-717 and (ii) § 3 of Chapter 261 of the Acts of Assembly of 1936 (which was con tinued in effect by § 58-769 of the Code of Virginia; and now continued in effect by § 58.1-3260), as amended by Chapter 422 of the Acts of Assembly of 1950, as amended by Chapter 339 of the Acts of Assembly of 1958, and as amended by the 2003 Regu lar Session of the General Assembly), (a) within three years from the last day of the tax year for which any such assessment is made, (b) within one year from the date of the assessment, (c) within one year from the date of the Tax Commissioners fina l determination under subdivision A 6 of § 58.1-3703.1 or subsection D of § 58.1-3983.1, or (d) within one year from the date of the final determination under § 58.1-3981, whichever is later, apply for relief to the circuit court of the county o r city wherein such assessment was made. The application shall be before the court when it is filed in the clerks office. The taxpayer filing the application and the locality shall be necessary parties to the proceedings in the circuit court. The loc ality shall be named in the application as the City of ____, Town of ____, or ____ County, as applicable. In such proceedings, except for proceedings seeking relief from real property taxes, the burden of proof shall be upon the t axpayer to show that the property in question is valued at more than its fair market value or that the assessment is not uniform in its application, or that the assessment is otherwise invalid or illegal, but it shall not be necessary for the taxpayer to show that intentional, systematic, and willful discrimination has been made. All proceedings pursuant to this section shall be conducted as an action at law before the court, sitting without a jury. The county or city attorney or, if none, the a ttorney for the Commonwealth shall defend the locality in any such proceedings. Prior to the release of any information that constitutes confidential tax information under § 58.1-3, pursuant to discovery or otherwise, for the purposes of a proce eding under this section, the court shall, no later than the issuance of the scheduling order, make the following order: Unless otherwise ordered by the court, no entity or person who has obtained confidential information protected by § 58.1-3 of the Code of Virginia regarding [pro perty reference], directly or indirectly through any party to this action, shall disclose, exhibit, or discuss the confidential information except as provided herein. Confidential information protected by § 58.1-3 may be revealed to or discussed only with the following persons in connection with the review or litigation of the assessment of the above-referenced property: 1. The taxpayer or the locality (the Parties); 2. Counsel for any Party to this action and employees of the counsels firm, including attorneys other than counsel; 3. Outside experts retained by and assisting counsel for any Party in the preparation for or trial of this action; 4. The court or an administrative board reviewing the assessment on the above-referenced property, persons employed by the court or administrative board, and persons employed to tran scribe or record the testimony or argument at a hearing, trial, or deposition regarding the assessment of the above-referenced property; and 5. Any person who may be called as a witness in a hearing, trial, or discovery that counsel believes in good faith to be necessary for the preparation or presentation of the case. No person who is furnished with confidential information shall reveal it to, or discuss it with, any person who is not entitled to receive it under the terms of this or der. Prior to their receipt of confidential information, those persons described in subdivisions 3 and 5 shall be required to sign an acknowledgement of this order and agree to be bound by the terms hereof and be subject to the jurisdiction of the court for enforcement thereof. Any person who violates the provisions of this order shall be subject to the penalty provided in subsection F of § 58.1-3. Once the above-referenced order is entered, § 58.1-3 shall not be applicable to prevent the release of any relevant information that is responsive to a request for d iscovery made in the course of an appeal pursuant to this section. B. In circuit court proceedings to seek relief from real property taxes, there shall be a presumption that the valuation determined by the assessor or as adjusted by the board of equalization is correct. The burden of proof shall be on the taxpayer to rebut such presu mption and show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property in question was assessed at more or less than its fair market value or that the assessment is not uniform in its application, and that it was not arrived at in accordance with generally accepted appraisal practices, procedures, rules, and standards as prescribed by nationally recognized professional appraisal organizations such as the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) and applicable Virginia law relating to valuati on of property. Mistakes of fact, including computation, that affect the assessment shall be deemed not to be in accordance with generally accepted appraisal practice. However, in any appeal of the assessment of residential property filed by a taxpayer as an owner of real property containing less than four residential units, the asses sing officer shall give the required written notice to the taxpayer, or his duly authorized representative, under subsection E of § 58.1-3331, and, upon written request, shall provide the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative copies of the as sessment records set out in subsections A, B, and C of § 58.1-3331 pertaining to the assessing officers determination of fair market value of the property under appeal. A written request by the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative shall be made following the filing of the appeal to circuit court and no later than 45 days prior to trial, unless otherwise provided by an order of the court before which the appeal is pending. Provided the written request is made in accordance with this sect ion or any applicable court order, the assessing officer shall provide such records within 15 days of the written request to the taxpayer or his duly authorized representative. If the assessing officer fails to do so, the assessing officer shall present the following into evidence prior to the presentation of evidence by the taxpayer at the hearing: (i) copies of the assessment records maintained by the assessing officer under § 58.1-3331, (ii) testimony that explains the methodologies employed by th e assessing officer to determine the assessed value of the property, and (iii) testimony that states that the assessed value was arrived at in accordance with generally accepted appraisal practices, procedures, rules, and standards as prescribed by natio nally recognized professional appraisal organizations such as the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) and applicable Virginia law relating to valuation of property. Upon the conclusion of the presentation of the evidence of the assessi ng officer, the taxpayer shall have the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to rebut such evidence presented by the assessing officer as otherwise provided in this section. C. The presump tions, burdens, and standards set out in subsection B shall not be construed to change or have any effect upon the presumptions, burdens, and standards applicable to applications for the correction of erroneous assessments of any local tax other than rea l property taxes. D. In the even t it comes or is brought to the attention of the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing official of the locality that the assessment of any tax is improper or is based on obvious error and should be corrected in order that the ends of justice may be served, and he is not able to correct it under § 58.1-3981, the commissioner of the revenue or other assessing offical shall apply to the appropriate court, in the manner herein provided for relief of the taxpayer. Such application may include a p etition for relief for any of several taxpayers. History History.

Taxation, § 66. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former § 58-1148. This section is to be liberally construed in order to furnish an expeditious and inexpen sive remedy against taxes which have been erroneously assessed or collected. Adams v. Board of Supvrs., 569 F. Supp. 20, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15070 (W.D. Va. 1983). Extent of assessment compari son necessary.  It is not enough to show that the assessment is excessive as compared with an assessment against A, or against B. It must plainly appear that it is out of line wi th methods of valuation adopted in the taxing district as a whole. County of Mecklenburg v. Carter, 248 Va. 522, 449 S.E.2d 810, 1994 Va. LEXIS 139 (1994). Presumption of validity of assessmen t.  In the trial of a petition to correct an erroneous assessment, there is a clear presumption that the assessment is valid; the presumption can be rebutted only upo n a showing of manifest error or total disregard of controlling evidence. Smith v. Board of Supvrs., 234 Va. 250, 361 S.E.2d 351, 4 Va. Law Rep. 858, 1987 Va. LEXIS 235 (1987). Clear presumption favors the validity of the assessment and can be rebutted only upon a showing of manifest error or total disregard of controlling evidence. Where the trial court finds such error to exist it may properly find the presumption rebutted and fix the fair market value in accordance with the evidence. Board of Supvrs. v. Donatel li &amp; Klein, Inc., 228 Va. 620, 325 S.E.2d 342, 1985 Va. LEXIS 156 (1985). Trial court which finds manifest error in the assessment or disregard of controlling evi dence may properly conclude that the presumption has been rebutted and fix the assessment in accordance with the evidence. Arlington County Bd. v. Ginsberg, 228 Va. 633, 325 S.E.2d 348, 1985 Va. LEXIS 157 (1985). If the trial court finds that a manifest error in the assessment exists, it may properly find the presumption rebutted and fix the fair market value of the proper ty in accordance with the evidence. Board of Supvrs. v. Telecommunications Indus., Inc., 246 Va. 472, 436 S.E.2d 442, 10 Va. Law Rep. 487, 1993 Va. LEXIS 144 (1993). Court was not bound by values argued by parties or those fixed by witnesses. Rather, the court properly could weigh the evidence and establish a value accordingly. Where the court selected a value supported by the evidence, it has acted within the statutory grant of authority. Arlington County Bd. v. Ginsberg, 228 Va. 633, 325 S.E.2d 348, 1 985 Va. LEXIS 157 (1985). Taxpayer who is able to show that actual rents and expenses were ignored, or given only token consideration in the formulation of an assessment, will carry his burden of overcoming the presumption of correctness to which the assessment was entitled. At that point, the burden shifts to the assessing authority to go forward with evidence t ending to prove that the actual rent and expenses do not fairly reflect economic net income for the particular property being appraised. If the assessor fails to carry that burden, the assessment should be corrected. Smith v. Board of Supvrs., 234 Va. 25 0, 361 S.E.2d 351, 4 Va. Law Rep. 858, 1987 Va. LEXIS 235 (1987). Assessment of fa ir market value of property proper.  Evidence concerning the value of the property was sufficient to demonstrate that the countys assessment exceeded fair market value under § 58.1-3984, and t hus, there was evidence to support the circuit courts finding that the county committed error in its assessment. Further, because the circuit court on remand properly determined that the assessment was erroneous, it was empowered to set the assessmen t pursuant to this section; the circuit court stated that it considered and relied on the evidence presented to it in ruling that $7 million was the proper assessment of the fair market value of the property, and thus, the circuit courts ruling as to the proper value for the taxpayers property was not erroneous because it was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. County of Albemarle v. Keswick Club, L.P., 280 Va. 381, 699 S.E.2d 491, 2010 Va. LEXIS 236 (2010). Erroneous assessme nt determination overturned.  Where there was no evidence that the methodology used was erroneous, or that it was not followed in appraising the subject property and each property with which i t was compared, and nor was there any evidence that the fair market values of all these properties were other than those shown on the appraisals, the trial courts ruling in favor of subject was plainly wrong and without evidence to support it. County of Mecklenburg v. Carter, 248 Va. 522, 449 S.E.2d 810, 1994 Va. LEXIS 139 (1994). No procedure for remand to e xecutive branch.  The procedure for correction of erroneous assessments is entirely statutory. It contains no provision for remand to the executive branch of government. When the s tatutory procedure is invoked, the determination of the correctness of a challenged assessment, as well as any grant of appropriate relief, become matters exclusively of judicial concern. Smith v. Board of Supvrs., 234 Va. 250, 361 S.E.2d 351, 4 Va. Law Rep. 858, 1987 Va. LEXIS 235 (1987). Federal district court was barred from asserting jurisdiction over challenge to a local tax on cable television service, to the extent that plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief, since Virginia offers in her courts the opportunity for a plain, speedy and efficient remedy within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1341. Cox Cable Hamp ton Rds., Inc. v. City of Norfolk, 739 F. Supp. 1074, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8519 (E.D. Va. 1990). Court lacked authority to remand where it determined assessments were erroneous.  Where the trial court initially determined that the assessments were erroneous in that the county had failed to consider the actual rental income as a relevant fa ctor in the economic rent, it lacked authority to remand the cases to the supervisor of assessments for further consideration. Smith v. Board of Supvrs., 234 Va. 250, 361 S.E.2d 351, 4 Va. Law Rep. 858, 1987 Va. LEXIS 235 (1987). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Erroneous assessment overturned.  Assessments for three years were erroneous because, inter alia, the assessor, in using the Replacement Cost New method, used improper depreciation percentages; in using the income approach, ignored income and expenses figures supplied by the owner; and in applying both approaches, made improper or unsupported assumptions. WXII/Oxford-DTC Real Estate, L.L.C. v. Loudoun County Bd. of Supervisors, 64 Va. Cir. 317, 2 004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 157 (Loudoun County Apr. 5, 2004). Citys assessments of real property consisting of a golf course and club house were the result of manifest error because the opinions of the owners expert were more credible than the opinions of the citys expert, as (1) the owners expert cast a broader net in finding comparable sales, and the owners experts adjustments to account for differences between comparable sales and the subject prop erty were less severe, (2) the owners experts approach of only considering comparable sales that were closed or under contract as of January 1 of the relevant tax year was more consistent with sound appraisal practices, (3) the owners expert properly gave the clubhouse no value when valuing the property at the propertys highest and best use as a residential community, since the clubhouse would not be a significant amenity for such a use, and (4) the citys experts appraisal was ba sed on the disfavored development approach.

Purpose of section.  The underlying purpose of this section is to prevent those liable for taxes in some amount to delay payment or possibly to escape their lawful burden, and so to i nterfere with thwart the collection of revenues for the support of the government. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). In view of the convenience, elasticity and fairness of proceedings under § 58.1-3984, it was the controlling purpose of the legislature in the enactment of thi s section to compel a resort thereto whenever the remedy thereunder was adequate. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). The test of the statute in every case is to be found in the adequacy of the remedy at law. Commonwealth v. Tredegar Co., 122 Va. 506, 95 S.E. 279, 1918 Va. LEXIS 114 (1918) (see also Sussex County v. Jarratt, 129 Va. 672, 106 S.E. 384, 627 (1921); C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394 (1952)). Prior to this section jurisdiction of equity to restrain an illegal or unauthorized tax was well settled in this State. Commonwealth v. Tredegar Co., 122 Va. 506, 95 S.E. 279, 1918 Va. LEXIS 114 (1918); Commonwealth v. Carter, 126 Va. 469, 102 S.E. 58, 1920 Va. LEXIS 4 (1920); Todd v. County of Elizabeth City, 191 Va. 52, 60 S.E.2d 23, 195 0 Va. LEXIS 197 (1950). Statutory remedy must be followed.  Since the enactment of this section, where the statutory remedy is adequate it must be followed, and the previously existing remedy by injunction is cut off and c annot be pursued. Commonwealth v. Tredegar Co., 122 Va. 506, 95 S.E. 279, 1918 Va. LEXIS 114 (1918); Todd v. County of Elizabeth City, 191 Va. 52, 60 S.E.2d 23, 1950 Va. LEXIS 197 (1950); C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394 , 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). Where telephone company sought by bill in equity to have city ordinance imposing license tax on gross receipts declared unconstitutional and also injunctive relie f against its enforcement, it was held that company had an adequate remedy at law under the provisions of § 58.1-3984 and was not entitled to the equitable relief sought. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEX IS 246 (1952). Circ umstances insufficient to give equity jurisdiction.  The inability to recover interest is not alone sufficient in all cases to give equity jurisdiction for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). The application of this section should not be withheld and suits in equity to restrain the assessment or collection of taxes allowed contrary to its provision and purpose, on mere apprehension of harm which is not shown to be imminent or serious. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. City of Newport News, 194 Va. 409, 73 S.E.2d 394, 1952 Va. LEXIS 246 (1952). When statutory remedy inadequate.  By § 58.1-3984, a person assessed with county levies, and aggrieved by such assessment, can apply for relief to the circuit court of the county wherein such as sessment was made. Under these provisions, where there has been an assessment, however erroneous, there can be no relief in equity, but where there is no assessment, the remedy by motion does not apply, and as the party is without adequate remedy, he may maintain his suit for an injunction.

B. Notwithstan ding any other provision of law, the treasurer or other official responsible for the collection of any local tax imposed pursuant to this title may, with the consent of the governing body or its designee, compromise and settle the amount due and payable when the treasurer or other official determines that the collection of the entire amount due and owing is in substantial doubt and the best interests of the locality will be served by such compromise.

E. The treasur er or other official charged with collection of taxes may deposit into the treasury of the county, city or town any and all payments submitted with offers in compromise, unless the taxpayer specifically, clearly and conspicuously directs otherwise in wri ting at the time the offer in compromise is submitted to the responsible official. For the purposes of this subsection, no restrictive endorsement or other notation upon a check or other payment instrument shall constitute clear and conspicuous notice of a direction not to deposit. F. Upon accept ance of an offer in compromise by the responsible local official with respect to a tax liability, the matter thereafter may not be reopened except upon a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact.
