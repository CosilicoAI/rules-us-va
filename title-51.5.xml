CASE NOTES The Virginians with Disabilities Act is the exclusive state remedy for employment discrimination based on disability, therefore, plaintiff, who said she was disabled by chronic fatigue syndrome, could not maintain state common-law wrongful discharge claim. Mannell v. American Tobacco Co., 871 F. Supp. 854, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17248 (E.D . Va. 1994). No action for wrongful ter mination under act.  The policy against discrimination because of disability expressed in this act is also expressed in the Virginia Human Rights Act (VHRA) and the amendments to the VHRA limiting causes of action to those afforded by other federal or state civil rights statutes or local ordinances bar any claim for wrongful termination in violation of the public policy embodied in both this act and the VHRA. Lamb v. Qualex, Inc., 28 F. Supp. 2d 374, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19719 (E.D. Va. 1998), aff'd, 33 Fed. Appx. 49, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 5982 (4th Cir. 2002). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Virginians with Disabilities Act is the exclusive state remedy fo r disability-related employment discrimination.  Terminated workers complaint for wrongful termination due to a disability did not state a cause of action since the Virginians with Disabilities Act, §§ 51.5-1 through 51.5-52, provided the exclusive state remedy for employment discrimination and, thus, no common-law wrongful discharge claim was recognized. Wright v. St. Charles Water Auth., 59 Va. Cir. 244, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 350 (Lee County July 11, 2002). Former employee did not show that her employment was terminated due to her disability where, in her first position with the employer, reasonable accommodations we re made for her disability, which was blindness, by purchasing a computer and special software for her, and, when she was transferred to a different job, such accommodations were unnecessary to enable her to do her job, and she was terminated for making disparaging remarks about the employer.

For a note, Eradicating Discrimination Among Individuals with Disabilities: Parity in Employer-Provided, Long-Term Disability Benefit Plans, see 56 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1341 (1999). CASE NOTES The most analogous state statute to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is § 51.5-40 et se q.; therefore, the court must apply the one-year statute of limitations to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Eastman v. VPI, 732 F. Supp. 665, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3000 (W.D. Va. 1990), aff'd, 939 F.2d 204, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 14890 (4th Cir. 1991). In defendants claim of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the most appropriate statute of limitations was that provided by the Virginia Righ ts of Persons with Disabilities Act, which has a one-year statute of limitations. Wolsky v. Medical College, 1 F.3d 222, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 19456 (4th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1073, 114 S. Ct. 881, 127 L. Ed. 2d 77, 1994 U.S. LEXIS 1009 (1994 ). Act provides most analogous statute of limitations for claims brought under the American s with Disabilities Act (ADA) as well as the federal Rehabilitation Act. Childress v. Clement, 5 F. Supp. 2d 384, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7206 (E.D. Va. 1998). The Virginians with Disabilities Act standards for liability follow the standards establ ished in the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and adopted in the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. Tyndall v. National Educ. Ctrs., Inc., 31 F.3d 209, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 20163 (4th Cir.), limited, Susie v. Apple Tree Presc hool &amp; Child Care Ctr., 866 F. Supp. 390, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16736 (N.D. Iowa 1994). Members complaint did not allege that City of Richmond received any state funding fo r its educational program, as required by § 51.5-40; thus, such a deficiency in the Virginians with Disabilities Act of 1985 complaint was curable by amendment and the complaint was dismissed with leave to amend. Bacon v. City of Richmond, 386 F. Supp . 2d 700, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21376 (E.D. Va. 2005). Lottery offers a program, service, or activity within the meaning of A DA and Virginians with Disabilities Act.  Virginia Lottery offers a program, service, or activity within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 12101 et seq., and it is subje ct to the requirements of the Virginians with Disabilities Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act pursuant to § 51.5-40 and 42 U.S.C.S. § 12132; such interpretation was based on § 12132 in light of the Rehabilitation Act, the Department of Justice Regulations at 28 C.F.R. 35.102(a), and the plain meaning of the terms therein. Winborne v. Va. Lottery, 278 Va. 142, 677 S.E.2d 304, 2009 Va. LEXIS 73 (2009). Lottery had obligation to ensure disabled persons were not denied access.  Trial courts grant of partial summary judgment to the director of the Virginia Lottery was error in an action by wheelchair-bound lottery patrons, alleging th at the inaccessibility of various lottery retailers violated their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 12101 et seq., and the Virginians with Disabilities Act, § 51.5-1 et seq., as the Virginia Lottery had an obligation under § 51.5-40 and 42 U.S.C.S. § 12132 to ensure that disabled persons were not excluded from participation in or denied access to such program or activity of the Virginia Lottery. Winborne v. Va. Lottery, 278 Va. 142, 677 S.E.2d 304, 2009 Va. LEX IS 73 (2009). Although the Virginia Lottery had an obligation under § 51.5-40 of the Virginians with Disabilities Act, and 42 U.S.C.S. § 12132 of the Americans with Disab ilities Act, to ensure that disabled persons were not excluded from participation in or denied access to such program or activity of the Virginia Lottery, there was no legal requirement regarding how such access was to be accomplished; accordingly, wheel chair-bound patrons were not entitled to partial summary judgment on that issue. Winborne v. Va. Lottery, 278 Va. 142, 677 S.E.2d 304, 2009 Va. LEXIS 73 (2009). Relationship to other laws.  Because the one-year limitations period in the Virginia Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, § 51.5-40 et seq., applied to Americans with Disabilities Act claims brought in Virginia, plaintiffs claims were time barred. A Soc'y Without a Name, for People without a Home, Millennium Future-Present v. Virginia, 655 F.3d 342, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 17689 (4th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 937, 132 S. Ct . 1960, 182 L. Ed. 2d 772, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 3028 (2012). Where plaintiff, a legally deaf individual, alleged that certain certifications defendant provided and testing processes for those certifications violated the Ame ricans with Disabilities Act, plaintiffs claims were time barred under the Virginia Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act because purported violations did not constitute continuing violation such that statute of limitations period renewed with each day that defendant maintained its policies.

No employer shall discriminate in employment or promotion practices against an otherwise qualified person with a disability solely because of such disability. For the purposes of this section, an otherwise qualified person with a disability means a person q ualified to perform the essential functions of a job with or without reasonable accommodations. B. It is the p olicy of the Commonwealth that persons with disabilities shall be employed in the state service, the service of the political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, in the public schools, and in all other employment supported in whole or in part by public fun ds on the same terms and conditions as other persons unless it is shown that the particular disability prevents the performance of the work involved. C. An employer shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental impairments of an otherwise qualified person with a disability, if necessary to assist such person in performing a particular job, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommod ation would impose an undue burden on the employer. For the purposes of this section, mental impairment does not include active alcoholism or current drug addiction and does not include any mental impairment, disease, or defect that has been succ essfully asserted by an individual as a defense to any criminal charge. 1. In de termining whether an accommodation would constitute an undue burden upon the employer, the following shall be considered: a. Hardship on the conduct of the employers business, considering the nature of the employers operation, including composition and structure of the employers work force; b. Size of the facility where employment occurs; c. The nature and cost of the accommodations needed, taking into account alternate sources of funding or technical assistance included under § 51.5-173; d. The possibility that the same accommodations may be used by other prospective employees; e. Safety and health considerations of the person with a disability, other employees, and the public. 2. The employer has the right to choose among equally effective accommodations. 3. Nothing in this section shall require accommodations when the authority to make such accommodations is precluded under the terms of a lease or otherwise prohibited by statute, ordinanc e, or other regulation. 4. Building modifications made for the purposes of such reasonable accommodation may be made without requiring the remainder of the existing building to comply with the requirements of th e Uniform Statewide Building Code. D. Nothing in this section shall prohibit an employer from refusing to hire or promote, from disciplining, transferring, or discharging or taking any other personnel action pertaining to an applicant or an employee who, because of his disability, is unable to adequate ly perform his duties, or cannot perform such duties in a manner which would not endanger his health or safety or the health or safety of others. Nothing in this section shall subject an employer to any legal liability resulting from the refusal to emplo y or promote or from the discharge, transfer, discipline of, or the taking of any other personnel action pertaining to a person with a disability who, because of his disability, is unable to adequately perform his duties, or cannot perform such duties in a manner that would not endanger his health or safety or the health or safety of others. E. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering the provisions of the Virginia Minimum Wage Act (§ 40.1-28.8 et seq.). F. This sectio n shall not apply to employers covered by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. History History.

CASE NOTES Applicable to all employers.  The legislature intended the term no employer in subdivision A to mean just that and did not propose to limit the meaning to the state employers, public s chools, and other employers supported by public funds, thus, cause of action was available under this section against private employer. Yates v. Volunteer Health Care Sys., 783 F. Supp. 1002, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2360 (W.D. Va. 1992). Employees who could proceed under Rehabilitation Act.  The Virginians with Disabilities Acts (VDA) explicit statement that it does not apply to employers covered by the Rehabilitation Act indicates that the Genera l Assembly did not intend employees who could proceed against their employers under the Rehabilitation Act to be able to proceed under the VDA, which is the exclusive state law remedy. Mannell v. American Tobacco Co., 871 F. Supp. 854, 1994 U.S. Dist. LE XIS 17248 (E.D. Va. 1994). Because Virginias public policy against disability discrimination is manifested through the Virginians with Disabilities Act (VDA), and because the VDA contai ns an exclusivity provision, plaintiffs action for disability discrimination must be pursued under the VDA and not as a claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Stafford v. Radford Community Hosp., 908 F. Supp. 1369, 1995 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 12050 (W.D. Va. 1995), dismissed, No. 94-1096-R, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 523 (W.D. Va. Jan. 16, 1996), aff'd, 120 F.3d 262, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 27389 (4th Cir. 1997). Subsection B not limitat ion on cause of action.  Although the language of subsection B of this section limits discrimination in state service, in public schools, or in other employment supported by public funds, the language of subsection A of this section provides no such limitation. Had the legislature intended to limit discrimination practices to the entities outlined in subsection B, it would not have included subsection A. The legislature intended to ass ist handicapped persons to participate in all meaningful employment, not only state service, public schools, or other employment supported by public funds. Yates v. Volunteer Health Care Sys., 783 F. Supp. 1002, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2360 (W.D. Va. 1992) . Employee was not terminated because of his hypertension in violation of the Virginians w ith Disabilities Act (§ 51.5-1 et seq.). Employees hypertension may have contributed to, or have been one of the reasons for, his termination, but it clearly was not the only reason given. The trial courts factual finding that the termination was based on employees bad attitude was supported by credible evidence in the record. Progress Printing Co. v.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Discriminatory purpose not found.  Former employee met the procedural requirements of the Virginians with Disabilities Act, § 51.5-1 et seq., by alleging that her former employers employment practices discriminated against her and failed to reasonably accommodate her disability, but she did not show that the employers reason for terminating her employment was pretextual or sprang from a discriminatory purpose.

C. Each town, city, or county, individually or through transportation district commissions, shall ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the public transportation within its jurisdiction by either (i) use of the same transportation facilities or carriers available to the general public, (ii) provision of paratransit or special transportation services for persons with disabilities, or (iii) both. All persons with disabilities in the jurisdictions service area who, by reason of their disabilities, are unable to use the service for the general public shall be eligible to use such paratransit or special transportation service. No fee that exceeds the fee charged to the general public shall be charged a person with a disability for the use of the same t ransportation facilities or carriers available to the general public. Paratransit or special transportation service for persons with disabilities may charge fees to such persons comparable to the fees charged to the general public for similar service in the jurisdiction service area, taking into account especially the type, length, and time of trip. Any variance between special service and regular service fares shall be justifiable in terms of actual differences between the two kinds of service provided . D. Nothing in this title shall be construed to require retrofitting of any public transit equipment or to require the retrofitting, renovation, or alteration of buildings or places to a degree more stringent than that required by the applicable building code in effect at the time the building permit for such building or place is issued.

CASE NOTES Damages for injuries relat ed to service dogs.  Although an injured dog owner claimed that her dog, which was also hurt in the accident in which she was injured, was a service dog, the trial court ruled that a jury instruction that allowed the jury to award the owner damages for the emotional distress she suffered in seeing the dog hurt was an impermissible instruction. As the court explained, under § 3.1-796.127 [see now § 3.2-6585], dogs and cats were deemed to be personal property, and no damages could be awarded for any emotional distress suffered due to an injury to personal property.

Jan. 16, 1996), aff'd, 120 F.3d 262, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 27389 (4th Cir. 1997). In employees action for wrongful discharge in breach of his employment contract and in violation of the Virginians with Disabilities Act, where there was noth ing in the amended complaint demonstrating the employees pursuit of or reasons for his failure to pursue remedies available under the Act, the court would grant the employers motion to dismiss. Hammonds v. Builders First Source-Atlantic Group, In c., No. 3:01CV00023, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23839 (W.D. Va. Sept. 18, 2001). The most analogous state statute to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is § 51.5-40 et se q.; therefore, the court must apply the one-year statute of limitations to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Eastman v. VPI, 732 F. Supp. 665, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3000 (W.D. Va. 1990), aff'd, 939 F.2d 204, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 14890 (4th Cir. 1991). Because Congress omitted a statute of limitations on actions arising from alleged violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 12132, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.S. § 794, the court followed the mandate of 42 U.S.C.S. § 1988(a), which provided for the selection of an appropriate statute of limitations derived from the state law statute of limitations m ost applicable to the statutes in question; the appropriate statute of limitations was contained in § 51.5-46. Because plaintiff, who alleged that the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) discriminated against him when it denied hi s request to use a motorized scooter on VDGIF-administered lands, did not file suit until nearly three years after the alleged act of discrimination, the suit was barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in § 51.5-46; thus, the VDGIF wa s entitled to summary judgment. Thompson v. Va. Dep't of Game &amp; Inland Fisheries, No. 1:05CV00109, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29796 (W.D. Va. May 14, 2006), aff'd, 196 Fed. Appx. 164, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 22139 (4th Cir. 2006). Notice requirements.  42 U.S.C.S. § 1988 did not authorize the application of the Virginia notice requirement under the Virginia Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, § 51.5-4 6(B), to the minors claim under the Rehabilitation Act; therefore, grant of summary judgment in favor of the school district on that claim was erroneous. J.S. v. Isle of Wight County Sch. Bd., 402 F.3d 468, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 5071 (4th Cir. 2005). Filing of a complaint satisfied the notice requirements where a violation was ongoing.  Filing of the members Virginians with Disabilities Act of 1985 action against the City of Richmond, which alleged that the City schools handicap accessibi lity violations were ongoing up to and including the date of the filing of the lawsuit, satisfied the notice requirement of subsection B of § 51.5-46. Bacon v. City of Richmond, 386 F. Supp. 2d 700, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21376 (E.D. Va. 2005). The one-year limitations period on plaintiffs claims must be deemed to run from the date when it became clearly and unequivocally obvious that he would be subjected to inferior disability insurance coverage on the basis of his disability. Lewis v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 993 F. Supp. 382, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1645 (E.D. Va. 1998). No standing to sue in asso ciational capacity.  Citizens group had representational and associational standing to bring a claim, which challenged the handicap accessibility in the City of Richmond, under the Am ericans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 12131, and § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.S. § 794, on behalf of its interested members because its members had standing to sue in their individual capacities, the interests were germane to the groups purpose of securing equal opportunity for persons with disabilities to participate in all areas of public life in the city, and the claims and relief requested did not require participation of the individual members in the suit; however, the Virginians with Disabilities Act of 1985 did not provide for associational representation by the organization. Bacon v. City of Richmond, 386 F. Supp. 2d 700, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21376 (E.D. Va. 2005). Recovery of fees not barred for claims under federal law.  By its express terms, this section limits the recovery of attorneys fees only for state law causes of action under Title 51.5, Chapter 9 of the Virginia Code, and, consequently, can have no impact on plaintiffs rights to such fees under federal disability law when the plaintiffs have been represented by the Department for Rights of Virginians with Disabilities. Brinn v. Tidewater Transp. Dist. Comm'n, 105 F. Supp. 2d 500, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10592 (E.D. Va. 2000), aff'd, 242 F.3d 227, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 2977 (4th Cir. 2001). The prohibition on the recovery of attorneys fees in subsection D applies only to actions brought by the Department for the Rights of Virginians With Disabili ties (now the Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy), under the Virginians with Disabilities Act and does not preclude the recovery of such fees in an action pursued by the Department under federal law. Brinn v. Tidewater Transp. Dist. Comm'n, 242 F.3d 227, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 2977 (4th Cir. 2001). Evidence insufficient.  Former employee produced evidence adequate to establish only one element of his prima facie case  that he was discharged; without more, the employer was grant ed summary judgment as to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 12101-12213, claim and the Virginia Persons with Disabilities Act claim. Taylor v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 376 F. Supp. 2d 653, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14040 (E.D. Va. ), aff'd, 158 Fed. Appx. 446, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 28200 (4th Cir. 2005). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Limitations.  Virginians with Disabilities Act provided that any action against the employer was required to be brought within one year after the occurrence of any violations u nder it and that potential defendants had to receive written notice of a claim within 180 days from the date of the alleged violation.

In accordance with § 30-149 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission undertook the recodification of Title 63.1 of the Code of Virginia. This titl e, dealing with social services, was last revised in 1968. Since that time, the Department of Social Services has undergone extensive administrative and programmatic changes, including welfare reform. Revising this title provided an opportunity to delete provisions made obsolete by federal law and to update nomenclature. Also, the Departments of Blind and Vision Impaired and Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing were transferred out of Title 63.1 and into Title 51.5. The Virginia Code Commission began working on this recodification in 2000. Staff utilized informal work groups made up of Department of Social Services staff and others with expertise in the field of social services to assist staff in making recommendations to the Code Commission. A draft report detailing the work of the Virginia Code Commission between June 2000 and October 2001 was circulated for public comment . The Commission completed its work on Title 63.1 and the recodification bill was introduced and passed at the 2002 Session of the General Assembly and signed by the Governor, as Acts 2002, Chapter 747. Where appropriate, the historical citations to former sections have been added to corresponding new sections. The case notes appearing under new sections were decided under corresponding former sections or under prior law. For tables of corresponding former and new sections, see the tables in Volume 10.

The 2019 amendment by c. 88 rewrote the introductory paragraph and the definition for Blind person, which read: The following terms whenever used in t his chapter, shall have the meanings respectively set forth unless a different meaning is clearly required by the context: Blind person means a person having not better than 20/200 central visual acuity in the better eye measured at twenty feet w ith correcting lenses or having visual acuity greater than 20/200 but with the widest diameter of the visual field in the better eye subtending an angle of no greater than twenty degrees, measured at a distance of thirty-three centimeters using a three-m illimeter white test object, or a Goldman III-4e target, or other equivalent equipment.

History History. 1984, c. 670, § 63.1-85.1:1; 2002, c. 747. Annotations Editors note. In accordance with § 30-149 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission undertook the recodification of Title 63.1 of the Code of Virginia. This titl e, dealing with social services, was last revised in 1968. Since that time, the Department of Social Services has undergone extensive administrative and programmatic changes, including welfare reform. Revising this title provided an opportunity to delete provisions made obsolete by federal law and to update nomenclature. Also, the Departments of Blind and Vision Impaired and Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing were transferred out of Title 63.1 and into Title 51.5. The Virginia Code Commission began working on this recodification in 2000. Staff utilized informal work groups made up of Department of Social Services staff and others with expertise in the field of social services to assist staff in making recommendations to the Code Commission. A draft report detailing the work of the Virginia Code Commission between June 2000 and October 2001 was circulated for public comment . The Commission completed its work on Title 63.1 and the recodification bill was introduced and passed at the 2002 Session of the General Assembly and signed by the Governor, as Acts 2002, Chapter 747. Where appropriate, the historical citations to former sections have been added to corresponding new sections. The case notes appearing under new sections were decided under corresponding former sections or under prior law. For tables of corresponding former and new sections, see the tables in Volume 10.

Findings by local de partment of social services.  Adult protective services services include investigating reports of suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an adult and issuing any written findings; thus, any findings of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an adult resulting from an adult protective services investigation undertaken by a local department of social services is not a case decision of the State Department for Aging and Rehabilitative Services , but rather a decision by a city or county agency.
