CASE NOTES When loss occurs.  While an insurer cannot enforce subrogation rights until after it has made payment under a policy, loss does not occur only after payment by the insurer to the in sured or by the insured to a third party whose claim might be covered under the policy. In the context of a policy provision that the insured shall do nothing after loss to affect such rights loss occurs when an insured risk causes damage. Insura nce Co. of N. Am. v.

If construction defects existed and caused damage before a release agreement between insured and a subcontractor was signed, and if the agreement released a person or entity allegedly responsible for the damage, then the subrogation rights of the insurers would have been prejudiced and insured would be barred from recovery by a policy prov ision that the insured not injure the insurers subrogation rights.

Subrogation to insureds claim against employee for embezzlement was nondischargeable in bankruptcy.  The creditors insurer, as subrogee to the creditor (the debtors employer), was substituted to the rights of the creditor to whom it succeeded in relation to the debt arising out of debtors embezzlement of his employers funds. Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code would prevent the insurer, as subrogee, from filing a proof of claim or asserting a nondischargeability complaint. National Union Fire Ins. Co. v.

Unclean hands not relevant.  Defendant subsidiarys unclean hands defense failed; the general business conduct of the subrogee was irrelevant to whether the subrogee could recover for the insured loss suffered by the subrogor commercial greenhouse.

Subrogation against a sure ty and surety bond.  Although a title insurer had no standing in its own right to maintain a common-law breach of contract action against a surety and surety bond issued under the Vir ginia Consumer Real Estate Settlement Protection Act, based on language contained within the title insurance policy it issued, the title insurer it could maintain the action as the subrogee of its insured.

The tenant, as neither an individ ual unit owner, nor part of the association, was not protected by any waiver the provider may have made as to subrogation. Erie Ins. Exch. v.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS In surance companys right to bring claim in insureds name.  Trial court granted the insurance companys motion to prohibit, during trial, any mention of the insurance companys involvement in the case or its compensa tion to the insured due to the tenants allegedly negligent act that set the insureds apartment on fire; the insurance company had the statutory right to bring its case in the name of the insured. LeChow v. Reese, 63 Va. Cir. 110, 2003 Va. Cir. LE XIS 167 (Arlington County Sept. 10, 2003). Landlords insurer had right to proceed against tenants who started a fire.  Landlord waived any rights it had under the lease against its tenants for starting a fire in the leased apartment by returning the tenants security deposit. H owever, the landlord did not waive its negligence claim against the tenants, which arose independently of the lease, and therefore the landlords insurer could proceed in subrogation against the tenants on the negligence claim. Cincinnati Ins. Cos. v. Farrington, 81 Va. Cir. 345, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 292 (Charlottesville Nov. 16, 2010). CASE NOTES Subrogation action by title insurance companies.  Title insurance companies were subrogees and could only bring breach of fiduciary duty claims, at that time, against their settlement agents as to properties in s ettlement transactions for which they had made payments.

Except as o therwise provided in this title, no insurer transacting business in this Commonwealth shall expose itself to any loss on any one risk or hazard in an amount exceeding ten percent of its surplus to policyholders. Any risk or portion of any risk reinsured by an insurer meeting standards of solvency equal to those set forth in Article 3.1 (§ 38.2-1316.1 et seq.) of Chapter 13 shall be deducted in determining the limitation of risk prescribed in this section. B. For the pur pose of this section, the surplus to policyholders shall be determined from (i) the insurers last sworn statement filed with the Commission or (ii) the Commissions last report of examination, whichever is more recent at the time the risk is assum ed. C. For the pur pose of this section, any one risk or hazard (i) in the case of municipal bond insurance shall mean average annual debt service of insured obligations backed by a single revenue source, provided that the insurance policy does not require any accelerated payment of principal by the insurer upon the event of default and (ii) in the case of all other kinds of financial guaranty insurance shall mean the insured unpaid principal with respect to obligations for any one entity, except that any risk or hazard s hall be defined by revenue source, if the insured risk or hazard is payable from a specified revenue source or adequately secured by loan obligations or other assets. D. As used in subsection C above:Municipal bond insurance means a kind of financial guaranty insurance providin g insurance against loss by reason of nonpayment of principal, interest or other payment obligations pursuant to the terms of municipal bonds.Municipal bond means any security, or other instrument under which a payment obligation is created, issued by or on behalf of, or payable or guaranteed by, the United States, Canada, a state, a province of Canada, a municipality or political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or any public agency or instrumentality thereof, or by any other entity provided that such security is eligible for issuance by one of the foregoing. Average annual debt service means the amount of insured unpaid principal and interest on an obligation multiplied by the numbe r of such insured obligations, assuming that each obligation represents a $1,000 par value, divided by the amount equal to the aggregate life of all such obligations.Financial guaranty insurance means insurance against loss by reason of the failure of any obligor on any debt instrument or other monetary obligation, including common or preferred stoc k or capital leases, to pay when due principal, interest, premium, dividend, or purchase price of or on such instrument or obligation, or a fee in connection therewith, when such failure is the result of a financial default or insolvency, regardless of w hether such obligation is incurred directly or as a guarantor by or on behalf of another obligor that has also defaulted.For the purposes of subsection C of this section, the amount of insured unpaid principal shall be reduced by the amount of deposit of (i) cash, or (ii) the market value of obligations rated in the four highest major rating categories by a securities rating agency recognized by the Commission, or (iii) the stated amount of an unconditional, irrevocable letter of credit issued or confir med by a bank or trust company that (a) is a member of the federal reserve system or chartered by any state or (b) is organized and existing under the laws of a foreign country, has been licensed as a branch or agency by any state or the federal governme nt and is rated in the two highest major rating categories by a securities ratings agency recognized by the Commission or (c) is otherwise acceptable to the Commission or (iv) a conveyance or mortgage of real property, or (v) the scheduled cash flow from obligations rated in the four highest major rating categories by a securities rating agency recognized by the Commission if scheduled to be received on or prior to the date of scheduled debt service on the insured obligations. Such deposit shall be held by the insurer or held in trust for the benefit of the insurer or held in trust for the benefit of holders of the insured obligation whether in the form of debt service, sinking funds or other reserves pursuant to the bond indenture by a trustee accepta ble to the Commission.For the purpose of subsection C of this section, an insurers surplus to policyholders shall include the amount of any contingency or similar reserve established and maintained by the insurer pursuant to applicable law for the pr otection of insureds covered by financial guaranty insurance policies against the effect of excessive losses usually occurring during adverse economic cycles. E. The limitat ion of risk prescribed in this section for any alien insurer shall apply only to the exposure to risk and the trusteed surplus of the alien insurers policyholders. F. This sectio n shall not apply to (i) life insurance, (ii) annuities, (iii) accident and sickness insurance, (iv) insurance of marine risks or marine protection and indemnity risks, (v) workers compensation or employers liability risks, or (vi) risks covered by title insurance.

Notwithstan ding any provision of law to the contrary, in any civil case in which an insured individual sues his insurer to determine what coverage, if any, exists under his present policy or fidelity bond or the extent to which his insurer is liable for compensatin g a covered loss, the individual insured shall be entitled to recover from the insurer costs and such reasonable attorney fees as the court may award. However, these costs and attorneys fees shall not be awarded unless the court determines that the i nsurer, not acting in good faith, has either denied coverage or failed or refused to make payment to the insured under the policy. Individual, as used in this section, shall mean and include any person, group, business, company, organization, rec eiver, trustee, security, corporation, partnership, association, or governmental body, and this definition is declaratory of existing policy.

Rev. 697 (2001). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 10A M.J. Insurance, §§ 4, 68. CASE NOTES Purpose.  Statute is both punitive and remedial in nature; it is designed to punish insurer guilty of bad faith in denying coverage or withholding payment and to reimburse insured who has been compelled by insurers bad-faith conduct to incur expense of litigation. CUNA Mut. Ins. Soc'y v. Norman, 237 Va. 33, 375 S.E.2d 724, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1375, 1989 Va. LEXIS 22 (1989) (decided under former § 38.1-32.1). Construction.  General Assembly enacted the Virginia Commissions recommendations with few amendments, and no amendments to the recommended language now codified as the statu te; therefore, the supreme court accepts the report as persuasive authority that the General Assembly did not intend to make a substantive change in the statute. REVI, LLC v. Chi. Title Ins. Co., 290 Va. 203, 776 S.E.2d 808, 2015 Va. LEXIS 114 (2015). This section does not create cause of action, but merely permits the award of attorney f ees where a private cause of action already exists. Salomon v. Transamerica Occidental Life Ins. Co., 801 F.2d 659, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 30863 (4th Cir. 1986). Claim under this section may not be brought as a separate cause of action, but only as a source of recovery of costs and attorneys fees once a judgment is ent ered against the insurer. Tiger Fibers, LLC v. Aspen Specialty Ins. Co., 594 F. Supp. 2d 630, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3228 (E.D. Va. 2009). Plaintiff seeking attorneys fees based on common law principles can alternatively se ek them under this section. Atlantic Permanent Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. American Cas. Co., 670 F. Supp. 168, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18909 (E.D. Va. 1986). Bad faith.  In order to recover attorneys fees and costs under this section, a plaintiff must establish that the insurer acted in bad faith by denying coverage or refusin g to make payment under the policy. Joseph P. Bornstein, Ltd. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 828 F.2d 242, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12187 (4th Cir. 1987). An insured may be awarded attorneys fees generated in a suit against its insurer for a determination of coverage under the policy if it shows that the insurer , not acting in good faith, denied coverage or failed or refused to make payment to the insured under the policy, or an insured may seek the imposition of penalties for insurers violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act. Ryder Truck Rental, In c. v. UTF Carriers, Inc., 790 F. Supp. 637, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5941 (W.D. Va. 1992), dismissed, No. 89-0038-C, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16341 (W.D. Va. Oct. 13, 1992). Where an insured failed to show evidence from which a jury could conclude that an insurer acted in bad faith in denying the insured coverage, the insurer was enti tled to partial summary judgment on the insureds bad faith claim. HHC Assocs. v. Assurance Co. of Am., 256 F. Supp. 2d 505, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6539 (E.D. Va. 2003). Fact than an insurer was unlicensed at the time that it refused to defend an insured did not entitle the insured to a prima facie presumption that the insurer s failure to make payments in an underlying lawsuit was vexatious and without reasonable cause under subsection B of § 38.2-807 for purposes of obtaining attorneys fees for a bad faith failure to defend under § 38.2-209 because subsection B of § 38.2-807 and the presumption applied to situations where an unlicensed insurer failed to defend in an action brought by an insured upon an insurance contract, and the insurer was properly defending itself in the lawsuit. Structural Concrete Prods., LLC v. Clarendon Am. Ins. Co., No. 3:07CV253, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61714 (E.D. Va. Aug. 22, 2007). Final judgment against an insurer was not a prerequisite to a suit by an insured under § 38.2-209 to recover attorneys fees for the insurers alleged ba d faith failure to defend. Structural Concrete Prods., LLC v. Clarendon Am. Ins. Co., No. 3:07CV253, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61714 (E.D. Va. Aug. 22, 2007). There was nothing in the record to indicate that the insurers denial of the insureds claim was made in bad faith; while its reliance on the contract and p rofessional services exclusions were ultimately incorrect, the insurers interpretation of the policy was not so unreasonable as to demonstrate bad faith. The coverage questions raised by the facts of the case were by no means obvious based on settled law, and thus the insurers denial of coverage was reasonable. Capitol Envtl. Servs. v. N. River Ins. Co., 536 F. Supp. 2d 633, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15653 (E.D. Va. 2008). Subsection A did not create an independent cause of action for an insurers bad faith breach of an insurance contract, and thus, it was not a cause of action s eparate from an insureds claim for breach of contract. REVI, LLC v. Chi. Title Ins. Co., 290 Va. 203, 776 S.E.2d 808, 2015 Va. LEXIS 114 (2015). Bad faith analysis.  In evaluating conduct of insurer, courts should apply reasonableness standard; bad-faith analysis generally would require consideration of such questions as wheth er reasonable minds could differ in interpretation of policy provisions defining coverage and exclusions; whether insurer had made reasonable investigation of facts and circumstances underlying insureds claim; whether evidence discovered reasonably s upports denial of liability; whether it appears that insurers refusal to pay was used merely as tool in settlement negotiations; and whether defense insurer asserts at trial raises issue of first impression or reasonably debatable question of law or fact. CUNA Mut. Ins. Soc'y v. Norman, 237 Va. 33, 375 S.E.2d 724, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1375, 1989 Va. LEXIS 22 (1989) (decided under former § 38.1-32.1). Court, as used in subsection A, means judge, and accordingly, the judge, not the jury, must determine whether the insurer breached the insurance c ontract in bad faith before it may award attorneys fees and costs to the insured; a judge, not a jury, must determine whether an insurer has either denied coverage or failed or refused to make payment to the insured under the policy in bad faith. REV I, LLC v. Chi. Title Ins. Co., 290 Va. 203, 776 S.E.2d 808, 2015 Va. LEXIS 114 (2015). Reliance on reason able interpretation of policy.  Insurer should not be subjected to tort liability or to liability for insureds costs and fees simply because it refused to defend insured in reliance on its r easonable interpretation of the insurance policy. Joseph P. Bornstein, Ltd. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 828 F.2d 242, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12187 (4th Cir. 1987). Claim for costs and fees was not considered in determin ing the amount in controversy for purposes of federal court jurisdiction.  Estate executors claim for costs and attorneys fees under subsection A of § 38.2-209 against an insurer was not considered in determining the amount in controversy where the executor could only recover those costs after a judgment had been entered against the insurer, the executor was required to make an additional showing of bad faith to recover the mandated fees, under Virginia court precedent, the c ourt could not consider the question of the insurers bad faith, nor could the executor properly plead bad faith, until a judgment had been entered against the insurer, and as a result, the executors claim could not include any amount of attorney s fees under Virginia law. Cradle v. Monumental Life Ins. Co., 354 F. Supp. 2d 632, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12916 (E.D. Va. 2005). Fees request should be made in com plaint.  Plain language of the statute makes clear that fee request be brought within the same suit as the substantive claim; a request for fees or costs is not set out in a subsequent separate civil action but in the same matter from which it arises. Such a request must be made in the complaint, although it is not considered until the denouement of the case. Styles v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., No. 7:06CV00311, 2006 U.S . Dist. LEXIS 49294 (W.D. Va. July 7, 2006). Jury trial.  Insured had no right to a jury trial on the issue of bad faith or an award of attorneys fees and costs because Va. Const. art. I, § 11 did not apply to pro ceedings under the statute; subsection A does not implicate the right to a jury trial under Va. Const. art. I, § 11. REVI, LLC v. Chi. Title Ins. Co., 290 Va. 203, 776 S.E.2d 808, 2015 Va. LEXIS 114 (2015).

Nor shall the provisions of §§ 38.2-210 and 38.2-211 prohibit the payment to an officer or director of any such company who is a licensed attorney-at-law o f a fee in connection with loans made by the company if and when those fees are paid by the borrower and do not constitute a charge against the company. B. Nothing con tained in this chapter shall prohibit a life insurer from making a loan upon a policy of insurance issued by it and held by the borrower. This loan shall not exceed the net cash value of the policy. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit any c ompany from (i) making a loan on real property owned by the officer and improved with a dwelling that is to serve as his residence if the loan qualifies under subdivision 1 of § 38.2-1434 and under § 38.2-1437 or (ii) acquiring the residence of the officer in conformance with subsection D of § 38.2-1441 if the transaction is in connection with the relocation of the place of employment of an officer who is neither a director nor a trustee of the company.

Each person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than ten percent of a class of any equity security of a domestic insurer, or who is a director or an officer of a domestic stock insurer, shall file a statement with the Commission within ten da ys after becoming a beneficial owner, director or officer. This statement shall be in a form prescribed by the Commission and shall show the amount of all the domestic insurers equity securities of which he is the beneficial owner. Within ten days af ter the close of each calendar month, if there has been a change in his ownership during such month, the person shall file with the Commission a statement prescribed by the Commission indicating his ownership at the close of the calendar month and such c hanges in his ownership as have occurred during such calendar month. B. To prevent the unfair use of information obtained by any beneficial owner, director or officer, any profit realized by such person within six months from the purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any of the insurers equity securities shall inure to an d be recoverable by the insurer. This provision shall apply regardless of any intention of the beneficial owner, director or officer to hold the equity security purchased or not to repurchase any sold equity security for a period exceeding six months. Ho wever, this provision shall not apply if the security was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted.

No reductio n in coverage for personal injury or property damage liability initiated by an insurer and no insurer-initiated increase in the premium greater than 25 percent of (i) a policy of insurance defined in § 38.2-117 or 38.2-118 insuring a business entity; (ii) a policy of insurance that includes as a part thereof insurance defined in § 38.2-117 or 38.2-118 insuring a business entity; (iii) a policy of motor vehicle insurance against legal liability of the insured as defined in § 38.2-124 insuring a business entity; or (iv) a policy of miscellaneous casualty insurance as defined in subsection B of § 38.2-111 insuring a business entity, and which in the case of a reduction in coverage is subject to § 38.2-1912, shall be effective unless the ins urer delivers or mails to the first named insured at the address shown on the policy, or delivers electronically to the address provided by the first named insured, a written notice of such reduction in coverage or premium increase not later than 45 days prior to the effective date of same. The increase in premium shall be the difference between the renewal premium and the premium charged by the insurer at the effective date of the expiring policy. Such notice shall: 1. Be in a type size authorized under § 38.2-311; 2. State the date, which shall not be less than 45 days after the delivery or mailing of the notice of reduction in coverage or increase in premium, on which such reduction in coverage or increase in premium shall become effective; 3.

If the named insured fails to accept or rejects the changed policy, coverage for any period that extends beyond the expiration date will be under the prior po licys rates, terms and conditions as applied against the renewal policys limits, rating exposures, and additional coverages. If the named insured accepts the changed policy, the reduction in coverage or increase in premium shall take effect upon the expiration of the prior policy. E. Notice of r eduction in coverage or increase in premium shall not be required if: 1. The i nsurer, after written demand, has not received, within 45 days after such demand has been mailed or delivered to the first named insured at the address shown on the policy, or delivered electronically to the address provided by the first named insured, s ufficient information from the named insured to provide the required notice; 2. Such notice is waived in writing by the named insured; 3. The insurer delivers or mails to the first named insured a renewal policy or a renewal offer not less than 45 days prior to the effective date of the policy or, in the case of a medica l malpractice insurance policy, not less than 90 days prior to the effective date of the policy; 4.

No written notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium that is mailed or delivered electronically by an insurer to a first named insured in accordance with this section shall be effective unless the insurer complies with the applicable provisions of subdivisions 1 through 4: 1. If th e notice is mailed, proof of mailing a notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium shall be obtained using one of the following methods that demonstrates the date that the notice was sent to the first named ins ured at the address stated in the policy or to such insureds last known address: a. The notice is sent by: (1) Registered mail; (2) Certified mail; or (3) Any other similar first-class mail tracking method used or approved by the United States Postal Service, including Intelligent Mail barcode Tracing (IMb Tracing); or b. The notice is sent by another method of mailing for which a certificate of mailing is obtained from the United States Postal Service at the time the notice is accepted for mailing . A certificate of mailing from the United States Postal Service does not include a certificate of bulk mailing. 2. If the notice is delivered electronically, the insurer retains evidence of electronic transmittal or receipt of the notification for at least one year from the date of the transmittal. 3. If the notice is mailed, the insurer retains a copy of the notice of cancellation, refusal to renew, reduction in coverage, or increase in premium for at least one year from the date s uch action was effective.

CASE NOTES Presumption of actual receipt.  Executor did not establish that an insurer failed to give the notice required by § 38.2-232 to an insured prior to cancellation of a life insurance policy for nonpayment of premiums; there was no clear error in findings that the insurers electronic proof of mailing established a presumption of actual receipt that was not sufficiently rebutted.

However, your insurance coverage applies only to certain tangible personal property. Finance charges, service fees, delivery charges, taxes, interest, meals , and entertainment are not covered under your policy. Therefore, you may be paying premiums on items not covered under your policy.The disclosure described in this subsection, with the same type-size requirements, shall also be included in any written m aterials provided at the time of invitation to contract and in policies or certificates provided to insureds. I. A credit pr operty insurance or credit involuntary unemployment insurance policy or certificate which provides truncated or critical period coverage, or any other type of similar coverage that does not provide benefits or coverage for the entire term or amount of th e indebtedness, shall be subject to the following requirements: 1.

J. A portion o f the premium charged for credit property insurance or credit involuntary unemployment insurance may be allowed by the insurer to the creditor for providing and furnishing such insurance, and no such allowance shall be deemed a rebate of premium or as in terest charges or consideration or an amount in excess of permitted charges in connection with the loan or other credit transaction. K. All of the acts necessary to provide and service credit property insurance and credit involuntary unemployment insurance may be performed within the same place of business in which is transacted the business giving rise to the loan or other credit transaction.

Bolli ng, 176 Va. 182, 10 S.E.2d 518, 1940 Va. LEXIS 245 (1940); Home Ins. Co. v. Dalis, 206 Va. 71, 141 S.E.2d 721, 1965 Va. LEXIS 171 (1965). Insurable interest is mandatory.  Given the clear statutory mandate, reflecting public policy, that where an insured lacks an insurable interest the contract shall not be enforceable, a court may properly determine whether an insurable interest exists even if the issue was not raised by the parties. Tiger Fibers, LLC v. Aspen Specialty Ins. Co., 594 F. Supp. 2d 630, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3228 (E.D. Va. 2009). Definition of insurable interest.   Any person who has an interest in the property, legal or equitable, or who stands in such a relation thereto that its destruction would entail pecuniary loss upon him, has an insurable interest to the extent of his interest therein, or of the loss to which he is subjected by the casualty. Tiger Fibers, LLC v. Aspen Specialty Ins. Co., 594 F. Supp. 2d 630, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3228 (E.D. Va. 2009). Everywhere there is a tendency to broaden the definition of an insurable interest; neither legal nor equitable title is necessary; any title or interest in the pr operty, legal or equitable, will support a contract of insurance on such property. The term interest, as used in the phrase insurable interest is not limited to property or ownership in the subject matter of the insurance; where the interest of insured i n, or his relation to, the property is such that he will be benefited by its continued existence or suffer a direct pecuniary injury by its loss, his contract of insurance will be upheld, although he has no legal or equitable title. Tiger Fibers, LLC v. Aspen Specialty Ins. Co., 594 F. Supp. 2d 630, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3228 (E.D. Va. 2009). Exposure to pecuniary loss.  Virginia law makes clear that the primary inquiry is whether and to what extent the economic interests of a person are exposed to a pecuniary loss; moreover, whet her an insurable interest exists is a broad inquiry, with economic realities prevailing over legalisms, such as whether the insured holds legal or equitable title to the property. Virginia courts have found an insurable interest where the insured has an ownership interest, a leasehold interest, or a contract right or contract obligation; however, while the concept of an insurable interest is broad and expansive, it has limits and there is a point beyond which an insureds economic interests become so attenuated, remote or contingent as to become uninsurable. Tiger Fibers, LLC v. Aspen Specialty Ins. Co., 594 F. Supp. 2d 630, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3228 (E.D. Va. 2009). Insureds interests and obligations with respect to the property came within the statutory definition of an insurable interest; the interests the insured had w ith respect to the property were lawful, substantial, and economic and they also were affected by the safety or preservation of the subject of insurance free from loss, destruction or pecuniar damage. Noteworthy were the insurers concerns that a reco gnition of the insureds contingent, indirect interests as insurable interests, particularly in light of the claimed damage to those interests, might violate the indemnity principle and result in a potential windfall or improper double recovery; those concerns, however, were best addressed, not through a finding that no insurable interest existed under the broad statutory definition, but through the proper valuation of the insureds insurable interest and any calculable loss associated with those interests. Tiger Fibers, LLC v. Aspen Specialty Ins. Co., 594 F. Supp. 2d 630, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3228 (E.D. Va. 2009). Property of after-acquired subsidiar y.  Coverage under an insurance policy did not exist for fire damage to a building owned by a subsidiary of an insured limited liability company because the policy s coverage-extension provision for newly acquired buildings could not be fairly read to apply to the property of a newly acquired subsidiary that was neither a named, nor an additional insured on the policy. Erie Ins. Exch. v. EPC MD 15, LLC, 297 Va. 21, 822 S.E.2d 351, 2019 Va. LEXIS 2 (2019). Stolen vehicle.  The interest a car dealer acquired for value without notice that the car was stolen property was economic, substantial, and lawful and such interest was insurable . Castle Cars, Inc. v. United States Fire Ins. Co., 221 Va. 773, 273 S.E.2d 793, 1981 Va. LEXIS 207 (1981). Contractor and architect have interest in preserving building from loss.  Although building was substantially complete and occupied, until final payment was made, the property constituted inchoate security for the payment of contract de bts due the contractor and the architect for performance of the entire work. Thus, at the time the loss occurred  three months before the date of final payment  both the contractor and the architect had a substantial economic interest in preservi ng the building from loss.

First Protection Life Ins. Co. v. Compton, 230 Va. 166, 335 S.E.2d 262, 1985 Va. LEXIS 264 (1985).

Oral credit insurance contract.  While oral insurance contracts are generally enforceable if the essential elements are adequately proven, this rule does not apply to an oral contract for credit insurance. The statute governing credit accident and sickness insurance requires that all credit insurance be evidenced by a written policy, certificate, or statement and sets forth the required provisions of such instruments. First Protection Life Ins. Co. v. Compton, 230 Va. 166, 335 S.E.2d 262, 1985 Va. LEXIS 264 (1985).

Court unable to supply essential elements for oral contract of insurance.  Where there was no clear and convincing evidence that there was a meeting of the minds of the plaintiff and defendant on the essential elements necessary to creat e an oral contract of automobile liability insurance, the court would have had to supply virtually every essential element in order for affirmation to be meaningful and to provide an enforceable contract, and this the court was without authority to do.

Purpose of section.  Statutes like this section have been quite generally enacted to relieve against the hardships arising from the strict enforcement at common law of warranties in i nsurance policies concerning matters of no real relation to the risk assumed. Jefferson Std. Life Ins. Co. v. Clemmer, 79 F.2d 724, 1935 U.S. App. LEXIS 4252 (4th Cir. 1935). While this section does focus on statements made by the applicant, its purpose is not to limit whose statements may be used to challenge a policy; rather, this se ction modifies the common-law fraud standard applied in determining whether a statement bars recovery to a material misrepresentation standard. Nyonteh v. Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co., 958 F.2d 42, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 1524 (4th Cir. 1992). Companies have right to correct information.  It is an accepted practice of insurance companies to issue health and accident policies based upon applications without medical examinations. Such companies have a right to be in possession of the true facts and correct information when they make a determination whether or not a risk should be assumed. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. v. Dingus, 219 Va. 706, 250 S.E.2d 352, 1979 Va. LEXIS 162 (1979). An insurer is entitled to full and truthful disclosure.

Atkinson, 137 Va. 313, 119 S.E. 46, 1923 Va. LEXIS 158 (1923). The provisions of this section relating to answers to interrogatories made by an applicant for a policy of insurance have no application to the warranties contain ed in the iron safe clause of fire insurance policies. Prudential Fire Ins. Co. v. Alley, 104 Va. 356, 51 S.E. 812, 1905 Va. LEXIS 107 (1905). This section pertains to statements and declarations made in the application for an insurance policy, and not to increases in the hazard under a provision of the policy, suspending coverage while the hazard is increased by any means within the control of the insured. American Ins. Co. v. Peyton, 272 F.2d 58, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 3074 (4th Cir. 1959). It sets forth the circumstances under which a false representation therein bars recovery on a policy. Chitwood v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 206 Va. 314, 143 S.E.2d 915, 1965 Va. LEXIS 200 (1965). Both falsity and materiality must be shown.  This section and its predecessors have been construed to require an insurance company contesting a claim on the basis of an insureds alleged misrepresentation to show, by clear proof, two facts: (1) that the statement on the application was untrue and (2) that the insurance companys reliance on the false statement was material to the companys decision to undertake the risk and issue the policy. Commer cial Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Hunt &amp; Calderone, P.C., 261 Va. 38, 540 S.E.2d 491, 2001 Va. LEXIS 19 (2001). It includes an application for reinstatement.  Where the insured made a willfully false statement in application for reinstatement there could be no recovery on the reinstated policy. New York Life Ins. Co. v. Franklin, 118 Va. 418, 87 S.E. 584, 1916 Va. LEXIS 23 (1916). This section is applicable to a policy issued pursuant to the Virginia Automobile Assigned Risk Plan.  Such a policy is to be distinguished from certified policies which the insurer is required to accept pursuant to former § 46.1-497 et seq.

Effect of declarations provision in policy.  A provision in the policy that it was issued in reliance upon the truth of representations contained in the declarations in the policy and that the policy emb odies all agreements existing between insured and insurer did not preclude the company from avoiding the policy because of material and fraudulent misstatements in the application. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Butler, 203 Va. 575, 125 S.E.2d 823 , 1962 Va. LEXIS 188 (1962). Question as to good health.  Plaintiff, who honestly thought her mother was in good health and so stated to defendants agent in answer to questions in applying for insurance on the mother s life, was not precluded from recovering as beneficiary under the policy because the insured was then suffering from a latent illness of which plaintiff was unaware. The term good health means apparent sound health without knowledge to the c ontrary on the part of the applicant. Gilley v. Union Life Ins. Co., 194 Va. 966, 76 S.E.2d 165, 1953 Va. LEXIS 165 (1953). Reliance by insurance company on representations made to state agency.  There is no authority authorizing an insurance company to rely on representations made to a state agency when issuing an insurance policy. Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stegall, 293 F. Supp. 199, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8076 (W.D. Va. 1968). Failure to instruct jury as to fraud in misstatements.  It is error to fail to instruct the jury that any misstatements in the application which were relied upon by the defendant must have been fraudulent misstatements in accordance with § 38.2-3503. Sutton v. American Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., 683 F.2d 92, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 17486 (4th Cir. 1982). Statement need not be willfully false or fraudulently made.  Under provision of this section that no statement in an application for an insurance policy will bar recovery unless the statement was material and untrue, the st atement need not be willfully false or fraudulently made. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. United States Gypsum Co., 639 F. Supp. 1246, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22666 (W.D. Va. 1986). Burden on insurer to show insureds answers were knowingly false.  It is usually not necessary for an insurer to establish that an untrue representation was willfully false or fraudulently made. However, where the insurer asks th e insured to aver only that the representations are true to the best of the insureds knowledge and belief, the insurer must clearly prove that the insureds answers were knowingly false. Parkerson v. Federal Home Life Ins. Co., 797 F. Supp. 1308, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18158 (E.D. Va. 1992). Mere nondisclosure not sufficient for fraud if investigation conducted.  If one conducts an investigation, he cannot hold another in fraud unless material untrue affirmative representations were made. Mere nondisclosures would not be s ufficient for fraud if an investigation is conducted. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. United States Gypsum Co., 639 F. Supp. 1246, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22666 (W.D. Va. 1986). Limitation on general rule regarding jury questions.  Generally, whether a statement is true and whether an untrue statement was knowingly made are questions of fact reserved for the jury. However, where the record s hows clearly that the insured gave statements that were not true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief, the Supreme Court of Virginia has held that a trial court errs in submitting that question to the jury. Parkerson v. Federal Home Life I ns. Co., 797 F. Supp. 1308, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18158 (E.D. Va. 1992). When resciss ion appropriate.  Rescission of the professional liability insurance policy was appropriate only if insurer clearly proved that an answer or statement in insured-fertility speciali sts renewal application for insurance was both (i) material to the risk assumed and (ii) untrue. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Jacobson, 826 F. Supp. 155, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9722 (E.D. Va. 1993), aff'd, 48 F.3d 778, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 3089 (4th Cir. 1995). Whether insurance company can satisfy the settled test for rescission depends on whether it can clearly prove that insureds misrepresentation was material to the risk it assumed in issuing the policy. Breault v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 821 F. Supp. 410, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6612 (E.D. Va. 1993). Cancellation did not preclude rescission.  Insurer properly rescinded a law firms professional liability insurance based on a misrepresentation on application. The fact that the policy only provided fo r cancellation as the remedy for misrepresentations did not preclude the alternative remedy of rescission. TIG Ins. Co. v. Robertson, Cecil, King &amp; Pruitt, 116 Fed. Appx. 423, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 24058 (4th Cir. 2004).

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  The provisions of this section relating to the size of type are constitutional. Dupuy v. Delaware Ins. Co., 63 F. 680, 1894 U.S. App. LEXIS 2992 (C.C.D. Va. 1894) . The object of this section is a wise and beneficent one to protect applicants for insura nce who are oftentimes inexperienced and unacquainted with the provisions and stipulations usual in policies of insurance, by requiring that such conditions and restrictive provisions shall not constitute a defense unless they are printed in the policy i n type of prescribed size. It does not forbid companies to protect themselves by the insertion of conditions, limitations, and restrictions upon their liability, for men usually have the right to contract as they please about their own affairs. If printe d in small type these restrictive provisions might easily escape the observation of the unwary, and it has therefore been wisely ordered that they, and not the policy, shall be nugatory unless printed in type of such size as would challenge the attention and be easily read by the ordinary applicant. Sulphur Mines Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., 94 Va. 355, 26 S.E. 856, 1897 Va. LEXIS 83 (1897). Conditions and restrictive provisions.  The words condition and restrictive provision, used in this section before the 1952 act, which substituted therefor restriction, condition or provision, were intended to cover any clause, expression or provision, included in or appended to a policy, whereby the effect of the principal and essential part of the policy is modified, changed, restricted, or otherwise affected, so as to materia lly influence the rights and liabilities of the insured thereunder. National Life Ass'n v. Berkeley, 97 Va. 571, 34 S.E. 469, 1899 Va. LEXIS 72 (1899). Before the 1952 act, this section specified conditions and restrictive provisions, which would impose upon the insured the performance of some fun ction the nonperformance of which would defeat a recovery in an action on the policy, provided such condition or restrictive provision was printed in type of the size required, or was written with pen and ink. Stipulations with respect to the risks insured against, which imposed no onus on the insured, and with respect to which he could not be guilty of any act of omission or commission which could affect his right of recovery, where held not within the statute. Cline v. Western Assuranc e Co., 101 Va. 496, 44 S.E. 700, 1903 Va. LEXIS 57 (1903). Section does not apply to bylaws of mutual benefit societies.  This section has no application to the conditions and restrictive provisions contained in the bylaws of an ordinary mutual benefit society made a part of the cert ificate of membership, which is the contract between it and the member. Fraternities Accident Order v. Armstrong, 106 Va. 746, 56 S.E. 565, 1907 Va. LEXIS 142 (1907). But may apply to application.  The provision of this section in regard to size of type applies to both application and policy when the application is expressly made a part of the contract of in surance. Burruss v. National Life Ass'n, 96 Va. 543, 32 S.E. 49, 1899 Va. LEXIS 99 (1899). Whole of provision must fulfill requirements.  The requirement of this section is not satisfied by inserting a figure, word or even a sentence with pen and ink. The whole provision relied on must be in writing or type of the prescribed size, or else it is not available as a defense to an action on the policy. National Life Ass'n v. Berkeley, 97 Va. 571, 34 S.E. 469, 1899 Va. LEXIS 72 (1899). Beneficiary disclaiming and claiming under a provision simultaneously.  Where an insurance company is seeking to escape liability for the surrender value of its policy on the ground that the policy was not surrendered within the time prescribed by a provision of the policy, it is not inequitable for the beneficiary, while claiming the surrender value under that same provision, to insist that the time limit fixed by the provision shall be excluded because not printed in type of the re quired size nor written with pen and ink in or on the policy. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y v. Wilson, 110 Va. 571, 66 S.E. 836, 1910 Va. LEXIS 96 (1910). When objection to be raised.  An objection that the conditions of an insurance policy are not printed in the type required by the statute cannot be made for the first time in the appellate cou rt. The company was allowed to rely on the conditions in the policy which rendered it void, and the record fails to disclose that the conditions were not printed in the type prescribed by the statute. Hence, the presumption is that the policy conformed t o the statutory requirement. Sulphur Mines Co. v. Phenix Ins. Co., 94 Va. 355, 26 S.E. 856, 1897 Va. LEXIS 83 (1897). Admissibility of application not part of insurance contract.  Contention that since printed words on application for insurance were in six point type instead of eight point, the application should not have been admitted in e vidence by virtue of this section was without merit, where the application did not become a part of an insurance contract or a restriction therein. Peoples Life Ins. Co. v. Parker, 179 Va. 662, 20 S.E.2d 485, 1942 Va. LEXIS 261 (1942).

Arbitration provisions.  Where an insured entered into a Reinsurance Participation Agreement (RPA) with an insurer, which contained a mandatory arbitration provision, and where the insure d sued alleging that the RPA was an insurance contract and thus, that the insurer engaged in business without complying with Virginia insurance law, a district court properly denied the insurers motion under the FAA to compel arbitration because Virg inia law rendered void delegation provisions in putative insurance contracts; at least to the extent such provisions authorized an arbitrator to resolve whether the contract at issue constituted an insurance contract.

Ed. 2d 203, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 851 (2018). Reinsurance participation agreement is an insurance contract.  Where a workers compensation insurer appealed a district courts denial of its motion to compel arbitration, reinsurance participation agreement with the i nsured was an insurance contract for purposes of § 38.2-312, which rendered void arbitration clauses contained in insurance contracts.

CASE NOTES Section applies to policies as to which limitations are not specifically provided.  It seems reasonably clear that the function of this section is to provide a limitation upon the minimum time for bringing suit on policies as to which limitations are not specifically provided, and in such cases the policy may limit the time to not less than one year after the loss or after the cause of action accrues, as the policy may provide.

Ramsey v. Home Ins. Co., 203 Va. 502, 125 S.E.2d 201, 1962 Va. LEXIS 175 (1962). First sentence applies to policies in force when section adopted.  The declaration that no provision in any policy of insurance limiting the time within which a suit or action may be brought to less than one year after loss shall be valid applies not only to policies thereafter issued, but also to policies in force when the act was passed and upon which a right of action had not accrued. Smith v. Northern Neck Mut. Fire Ass'n, 112 Va. 192, 70 S.E. 482, 1911 Va. LEXIS 70 (1911). Section inapplicable to policy with valid limitations period.  Additional insureds argument that the limitations period in an inland marine policy was invalid or tolled was rejected. Where the policy contained a valid lim itations period of not less than one year from the date the named insured became aware of the loss, and there was no proviso that the insurer reserved a specified time to adjust the claim after the proof of loss was to be filed, neither sentence in § 38.2-314 applied. United Leasing Corp. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., No. 3:02CV200, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13069 (E.D. Va. June 8, 2002). Applicability to ERISA claims.  Plaintiffs action challenging the termination of her disability benefits was governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and therefore the disabi lity policys limitations period of three years was valid under § 38.2-314; because plaintiffs claim was filed more than three years after the cause of action accrued, plaintiffs claim was time-barred.

Section 38.2-314 sets the minimum limitations period allowed in Virginia for filing suit on an insurance contract at one year. Mirabile v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 293 Fed.

CASE NOTES Breach of warranty must exis t at time of loss.  The Virginia law today is in accord with the common-law doctrine that a breach of a material warranty in an insurance policy will defeat recovery, with the except ion that, under the Virginia rule, the breach of warranty must exist at the time the loss occurs. Coleman Furn. Corp. v. Home Ins. Co., 67 F.2d 347, 1933 U.S. App. LEXIS 4465 (4th Cir. 1933), cert. denied, 291 U.S. 669, 54 S. Ct. 453, 78 L. Ed. 1059, 193 4 U.S. LEXIS 620 (1934). But it is unnecessary to prove breach contributed to loss.  This section makes it unnecessary for the insurance company to prove that the breach of the warranty contributed to the loss, and under the Virginia rule, as unde r the federal rule, breach of a material warranty will defeat recovery of the insurance policy whether contributing to the loss or not. Coleman Furn. Corp. v. Home Ins. Co., 67 F.2d 347, 1933 U.S. App. LEXIS 4465 (4th Cir. 1933), cert. denied, 291 U.S. 6 69, 54 S. Ct. 453, 78 L. Ed. 1059, 1934 U.S. LEXIS 620 (1934). § 38.2-316.1.

There is hereby established in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund to be known as the Fire Programs Fund, hereinafter referred to as the Fund. The Fund shall be administered by the Department of Fire Programs under policies and definitions established by the Virginia Fire Services Board. All moneys collected pursuant to the assessment made by the Commission pursuant to subdivision 2 of this subsection shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund. The Fund shall also consist of any moneys appropriated thereto by the General Assembly and any grants or other moneys received by the Virginia Fire Services Board or Department of Fire Programs for the purposes set forth in this section. Any moneys deposited to or remaining in such Fund during or at the end of each fiscal year or biennium, including intere st thereon, shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. Interest earned on all moneys in the Fund and interest earned on moneys held by the Commission pursuant to subdivision 2 of this subsection prior to the deposit of such moneys into the Fund, including interest earned on such moneys during any period when the Commission is reconciling payments from insurers, shall remain in or be deposited into the Fund, as the case may be, and be credited to it. Such interest shall be set asi de for fire service purposes in accordance with policies developed by the Virginia Fire Services Board. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, policies established by the Virginia Fire Services Board for the administration of the Fun d, and any grants provided from the Fund, that are not inconsistent with the purposes set out in this section shall be binding upon any locality that accepts such funds or related grants. The Commission shall be reimbursed from the Fund for all expenses necessary for the administration of this section. The balance of moneys in the Fund shall be allocated periodically as provided in this section. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the C omptroller upon written request signed by the Executive Director of the Department of Fire Programs (Director) or his designee. 2. The Commission shall annually assess against all licensed insurance companies doing business in the Commonwealth by writing any type of insurance as defined in §§ 38.2-110, 38.2- 111, 38.2-126, 38.2-130 and 38.2-131 and those combination policies as defined in § 38.2-1921 that contain insurance as defined in §§ 38.2-110, 38.2-111 and 38.2-126, an assessment in the amount of one percent of the total direct gross premium i ncome for such insurance. Such assessment shall be apportioned, assessed and paid as prescribed by § 38.2-403. In any year in which a company has no direct gross premium income or in which its direct gross premium income is insufficient to produce at the rate of assessment prescribed by law an amount equal to or in excess of $100, there shall be so apportioned and assessed against such company a contribution of $100. B. After reser ving funds for the Fire Services Grant Program and Dry Fire Hydrant Grant Program pursuant to subsection D, 75 percent of the remaining moneys available for allocation from the Fund shall be allocated to the several counties, cities, and towns of the Com monwealth providing fire service operations to be used for the improvement of volunteer and career fire services in each of the receiving localities. Funds allocated to the counties, cities, and towns pursuant to this subsection shall not be used directl y or indirectly to supplant or replace any other funds appropriated by the counties, cities, and towns for fire service operations. Such funds shall be used solely for the purposes of (i) training volunteer or career firefighting personnel in each of the receiving localities; (ii) funding fire prevention and public safety education programs; (iii) constructing, improving, and expanding regional or local fire service training facilities; (iv) purchasing emergency medical care and equipment for fire perso nnel; (v) payment of personnel costs related to fire and medical training for fire personnel; (vi) purchasing personal protective equipment, vehicles, equipment, and supplies for use in the receiving locality specifically for fire service purposes; or (v ii) providing training and education and purchasing products, including personal protective equipment, diesel exhaust removal systems, decontamination equipment, and commercial extractors, that are designed to reduce the incidence of cancer among firefig hters. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Code, when localities use such funds to construct, improve, or expand fire service training facilities, fire-related training provided at such training facilities shall be by instructors certified or appr oved according to policies developed by the Virginia Fire Services Board. Distribution of this 75 percent of the Fund shall be made on the basis of population as provided for in §§ 4.1-116 and 4.1-117; however, no county or city eligible for such f unds shall receive less than $10,000, nor eligible town less than $4,000. The Virginia Fire Services Board shall be authorized to exceed allocations of $10,000 for eligible counties and cities and $4,000 for eligible towns, respectively. Allocations to c ounties, cities, and towns receiving such allocations shall be fair and equitable as set forth in Board policy. Any increases or decreases in such allocations shall be uniform for all localities. In order to remain eligible for such funds, each receiving locality shall report annually to the Department on the use of the funds allocated to it for the previous year and shall provide a completed Fire Programs Fund Disbursement Agreement form. Each receiving locality shall be responsible for certifying the proper use of the funds. If, at the end of any annual reporting period, a satisfactory report and a completed agreement form have not been submitted by a receiving locality, any funds due to that locality for the next year shall not be retained. Such fun ds shall be added to the 75 percent of the Fund allocated to the counties, cities, and towns of the Commonwealth for improvement of fire services in localities. C. The remaind er of the moneys available for allocation from the Fund shall be used for (i) the purposes of carrying out the powers and duties assigned to the Department of Fire Programs under Chapter 2 (§ 9.1-200) of Title 9.1, which shall include providing funded training and administrative support services for nonfunded training to localities and (ii) the payment of the compensation and costs of expenses of the members of the Fire Services Board in performing their official duties; however, the Fund shall not b e used for salaries or operating expenses associated with the Office of the State Fire Marshal. D. The Fire Se rvices Grant Program is hereby established and will be used as grants to provide regional fire services training facilities, to finance the Virginia Fire Incident Reporting System and to build or repair live fire training structures as determined by the Virginia Fire Services Board. Beginning January 1, 1996, $1 million from the assessments made pursuant to this section shall be distributed each year for the Fire Services Grant Program to be used as herein provided, and $100,000 shall be distributed ann ually for continuing the statewide Dry Fire Hydrant Grant Program. Moneys allocated pursuant to this subsection shall be used for the purposes stated in this subsection, and for no other purpose. All grants provided from these programs shall be administe red by the Department according to the policies established by the Virginia Fire Services Board. E. Moneys in t he Fund shall not be diverted or expended for any purpose not authorized by this section. F. The Directo r shall establish written standards for determining the extent to which clients outside the Commonwealth shall be financially responsible for the cost of fire and emergency services training provided by the Department of Fire Programs. Revenues generated by such training shall be retained in the Fire Programs Fund and may be used solely for providing additional funded direct training to members of Virginias fire and emergency services.

CASE NOTES Federal preemption of state laws in relation to employee benefit plans.  State laws, insofar as they are invoked by beneficiaries claiming relief for injuries arising out of the administration of employee benefit plans, relate to  such plans and, absent an applicable exemption, are preempted by Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. Claims for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for violations of the Virginia Unfair T rade Practices Act, both of which purport to impose duties on insurers, are not rescued from preemption by an insurance saving clause, in 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(A), since the insurance saving clause is limited by the so-called deemer claus e, which provides that no employee benefit plan shall be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer or to be engaged in the business of insurance for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies or insurance con tracts.

Application of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) to afford re dress for violation of Chapter 5, would invalidate and impair the regulation sought to be accomplished by Chapter 5 and the enforcement mechanisms of §§ 38.2-218 through 38.2-220. Ambrose v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Va., Inc., 891 F. Supp. 1153, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9070 (E.D. Va. 1995). Because RICO provides for a private cause of action and treble damages, and because these provisions of RICO differ dramatically from the way in which Virginia s insurance code addresses the same conduct, RICO would in effect replace Chapter 5 as the principal means by which to remedy such conduct. It would convert a system of public redress into a system of private redress. The forum for redress would shif t from the State Corporation Commission (SCC) to the federal courts. The result of these effects would be that RICO would supersede Virginias laws. Ambrose v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Va., Inc., 891 F. Supp. 1153, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9070 (E.D. Va. 1995). Personal-s take exception to intracorporate immunity.  In an action by plaintiff chiropractors, their associations and patients alleging anti-chiropractic discrimination by a health care plan, plaintiffs alleged suffi cient facts to satisfy the personal-stake exception to the doctrine of intracorporate immunity for purposes of wording a motion to dismiss, where plaintiffs asserted that competing physicians, as members of the plans provider policy committee, had a direct interest in the market for healthcare services which was distinct and independent from their roles as agents of the plan.

No. 1-901 Complaint on a Fire Insurance Policy. CASE NOTES Purpose.  The plain meaning of this section, § 38.2-502 and § 38.2-503 shows that the primary purpose of these sections is to regulate the performance of insurance co ntracts by assuring conformity between representations made by the insurer to the insured and the actual performance of the insurance policies. In other words, each statute is designed to regulate the representations made to form, and the practices which comprise, the relationship between insurer and insured and the performance of the insurance contract which is the foundation of that relationship. Ambrose v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Va., Inc., 891 F. Supp. 1153, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9070 (E.D. Va. 1995).

An award of punitive damages may not rest on a jury finding that defendant violated the Unfair Insurance Practices Act. A &amp; E Supply Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 669, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 28177 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1091, 107 S. Ct. 1302, 94 L. Ed. 2d 158, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 746 (1987). Bad faith of insurer.  An insured may be awarded attorneys fees generated in a suit against its insurer for a determination of coverage under the policy if it shows that the insurer , not acting in good faith, denied coverage or failed or refused to make payment to the insured under the policy, or an insured may seek the imposition of penalties for insurers violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act. Ryder Truck Rental, In c. v. UTF Carriers, Inc., 790 F. Supp. 637, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5941 (W.D. Va. 1992), dismissed, No. 89-0038-C, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16341 (W.D. Va. Oct. 13, 1992). Liability for bad faith conduct as matter of contract rather than tort.  In a first-party Virginia insurance relationship, liability for bad faith conduct is a matter of contract rather than tort law. The obligation arises from the agr eement and extends only to situations connected with the agreement. A &amp; E Supply Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 669, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 28177 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1091, 107 S. Ct. 1302, 94 L. Ed. 2d 158, 1987 U.S. LEX IS 746 (1987). An insured does not state a tort claim by charging that an insurer was actuated by bad faith in breaching the contract of insurance. A &amp; E Supply Co. v. Nationwid e Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 669, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 28177 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1091, 107 S. Ct. 1302, 94 L. Ed. 2d 158, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 746 (1987). Punitive damages not authorized.  The Virginia legislature has provided for punishment and deterrence without authorizing punitive damages against errant insurance companies.

Require a debtor, insurer, agent, or surplus lines broker to pay a separate charge in connection with the handling of insurance required in connection with a loan or extension of credi t or other banking product, unless such charge would be required when the depository institution or its affiliate is the licensed agent or surplus lines broker; 3. Use any advertisement that would cause a reasonable person to believe mistakenly that (i) the federal government or the Commonwealth is responsible for the insurance sales activities o f, or stands behind the credit of, the depository institution or its affiliate; or (ii) the federal government or the Commonwealth guarantees any returns on insurance products or is a source of payment on any insurance obligation of or sold by the deposi tory institution or its affiliate; 4. Act as an agent unless licensed in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18 (§ 38.2-1800 et seq.) of this title; 5. Pay or receive commissions or other valuable consideration except in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 18 (§ 38.2-1800 et seq.) of this title; however, nothing herein shall prohibit the payment of compensation to a person not licensed under Chapter 18 (§ 38.2-1800 et seq.) of this title for the referral of a customer, provided that (i) such compensation is not based on the purchase of insurance by the customer, (ii) such compensation is a one-time, nominal fee of a fixed dollar amount for each referral, and (iii) the referral does not include a discussion of specific insurance policy terms and conditions; 6. Release insurance information of a customer to any person other than an officer, director, employee, agent, or affiliate of the depository institution, for the purpose of soliciting or selling insurance, without the express written consent of the customer.

Use, disclose, or release health information obtained from the insurance records of a customer for any purpose other than for its activities as a licensed agent or surplus lines broker , without the express written consent of the customer.

Extend credit or provide any product or service that is equivalent to an extension of credit, lease or sell property of any kind, furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition or requirement that the customer obtain insurance from the depository institution or its affiliate, or a particular insurer, agent, or surplus lines broker; except that nothing shall prohibit the depository inst itution or its affiliate from: a.

If a violation of this section is found, the person in violation shall be subject to th e same procedures and penalties as are applicable to other provisions of this chapter. F. Except as p rovided for specifically in subsection A, this section shall not prevent or restrict a depository institution or its affiliate from engaging directly or indirectly, either by itself or in conjunction with an affiliate, or any other person, in any activit y authorized or permitted under state or federal law.

In any acti on against an unlicensed insurer upon an insurance contract issued or delivered in this Commonwealth to a resident of this Commonwealth or to a corporation authorized to do business in this Commonwealth, the court may allow the plaintiff a reasonable att orney fee if (i) the insurer has failed to make payment in accordance with the terms of the contract for 30 days after demand prior to the commencement of the action and (ii) the court concludes that the refusal was vexatious and without reasonable cause . The fee shall not exceed 33 1/3 percent of the amount that the court or jury finds the plaintiff is entitled to recover against the insurer, but shall be at least $200. B. Failure of the insurer to defend the action shall be deemed prima facie evidence that its failure to make payment was vexatious and without reasonable cause. History History. 1952, c. 317, § 38.1-70; 1986, c. 562; 2010, c. 343. Annotations The 2010 amendments. The 2010 amendment by c. 343 substituted 33 1/3 percent for 12 1/2 percent and $200 for $100 in the last sentence of subsection A and made a minor stylistic change. Research References.

Insurance, § 68. CASE NOTES Presumption that the insurers conduct was vexatious and without reasonable cause improper.  Fact than an insurer was unlicensed at the time that it refused to defend an insured did not entitle the insured to a prima facie presumption that the insurer s failure to make payments in an underlying lawsuit was vexatious and without reasonable cause under subsection B of § 38.2-807 for purposes of obtaining attorneys fees for a bad faith failure to defend under § 38.2-209 because subsection B of § 38.2-807 and the presumption applied to situations where an unlicensed insurer failed to defend in an action brought by an insured upon an insurance contract, and the insurer was properly defending itself in the lawsuit.

Judge has to determine bad faith.  Meaning of the Recodification Act is plain: the General Assembly did not intend for the word court to include jury in this provision; thus, the st atute clearly requires the judge, not the jury, to determine whether the insurer acted in bad faith before awarding attorneys fees to the insured.

D. Except as p rovided herein, a converted insurer shall not, after the effective date of its conversion, use in its accident and sickness insurance policies, contracts or other literature (i) the words health maintenance organization or HMO or (ii) any other words descriptive of a health maintenance organization or deceptively similar to the name or description of any health maintenance organization then doing business in the Commonwealth in any manner that misrepresents the benefits, advantages, cond itions, or terms of the converted insurers insurance policies, contracts, or other literature.

B. The Commiss ion may require a reasonable amount of additional deposits in securities that meet the requirements of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of subsection A of this section, whenever the Commission determines that the insurers financial condition, method of ope ration, or manner of doing business is such that the Commission is not satisfied that it can meet its obligations to all policyholders. C. Neither the deposit referred to in this section nor the alternate deposit permitted by § 38.2-1049 shall be required of (i) any mutual assessment property and casualty insurance company, (ii) any fraternal benefit society, or (iii) any insurer transacting exclus ively an ocean marine business in this Commonwealth. D. Any insurer which on June 30, 1991, instead of the deposit of securities required by subsection A, has entered into a bond with surety, approved by the Commission, with any conditions the Commission requires, shall have until the next renewal, anniversary, or expir ation date of such bond, or until June 30, 1992, whichever comes first, to comply with the deposit provisions of subsection A.

CASE NOTES Reinsuring company directly liable to policyholders.  A bonding company applied to the State Corporation Commission of Virginia, under this section, for leave to withdraw its assets from the State and reinsure its ri sk in another company. The statute specifically requires the reinsuring company to assume the risks of the retiring company. It was held that as both companies have invoked and received the advantages of the statute, they must be presumed to have assumed the burdens thereby imposed, and to have contracted with reference to the statute, and the contract comes within the reason of the cases which hold the reinsuring company directly liable to the assured, and is not a mere reinsurance contract. American B onding Co. v. American Sur. Co., 127 Va. 209, 103 S.E. 599, 1920 Va. LEXIS 44 (1920). Assumption of policy obligations by reinsuring company presumed from withdrawal.  Unless the circumstances are so exceptional as to take the case out of the general rule applicable in such cases, the securities deposited with the State Treasure r by an insurance company cannot be legally withdrawn by another company taking over the business of the depositing company under the provisions of this section unless it is made to appear that the obligations of the depositing companys policies have been in fact assumed by the company withdrawing the deposit, and not merely agreed to be assumed upon certain conditions not contained in the policies. Actual assumption of the policy obligation is the burden that this section requires to be taken upon itself by the corporation withdrawing such deposit; and, notwithstanding that contract between insurance companies does not contain appropriate language to evidence such an assumption, the actual assumption will, in general, be presumed, where such a dep osit has been withdrawn under such statute.

Establishing liability against issuing company will support decree against reinsuring company.  A bonding company abandoned its business in Virginia and reinsured its risks in another company. A decree on one of its bonds was against both companies. The seco nd company contended that there was no privity of contract between it and the complainant. It was held that as the suit was in equity, the beneficiary could not be required after establishing the liability of the first company, to pursue the second compa ny in another suit, as under its contract and this section, the second company was ultimately responsible for the liability, the court rightly decreed against it.

The Commiss ion may issue a certificate authorizing the reciprocal to reduce or extinguish the contingent assessment liability of subscribers under its policies then in force in this Commonwealth, and to omit provisions imposing contingent assessment liability in al l policies delivered or issued for delivery in this Commonwealth for as long as all such surplus to policyholders remains unimpaired. The certificate may be issued if, in the case of a domestic or foreign reciprocal, the reciprocal has surplus to policyh olders of at least four million dollars, or, if in the case of an alien reciprocal, the reciprocal has a trusteed surplus, as defined in § 38.2-1031, of at least four million dollars. No certificate may be issued until an application of the attorney has been approved by the subscribers advisory committee.However, any reciprocal that on June 30, 1991, was authorized to issue and was engaged in issuing policies without contingent liability may continue to do so until July 1, 1994, by maintaining a t all times the minimum surplus to policyholders if a domestic or foreign reciprocal, and the minimum trusteed surplus if an alien reciprocal, required at the time of authorization. B. The Commiss ion shall issue this certificate if it determines that the reciprocals surplus to policyholders is reasonable in relation to the reciprocals outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs. In making that determination the follow ing factors, among others, shall be considered: 1. The s ize of the reciprocal as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force and other appropriate criteria; 2. The extent to which the reciprocals business is diversified among different classes of insurance; 3. The number and size of risks insured in each class of insurance; 4. The extent of the geographical dispersion of the reciprocals insured risks; 5. The nature and extent of the reciprocals reinsurance program; 6. The quality, diversification, and liquidity of the reciprocals investment portfolio; 7. The recent past and trend in the size of the reciprocals surplus to policyholders; 8. The surplus to policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers; and 9. The adequacy of the reciprocals reserves. C. Upon impair ment of the surplus to policyholders, the Commission shall revoke the certificate. After revocation, the reciprocal shall not issue or renew any policy without providing for the contingent assessment liability of subscribers. D. The Commiss ion shall not authorize a domestic reciprocal to extinguish the contingent assessment liability of any of its subscribers or in any of its policies to be issued, unless it has the required surplus to policyholders and extinguishes the contingent assessme nt liability of all of its subscribers and in all policies to be issued for all classes of insurance written by it. However, if required by the laws of another state in which the domestic reciprocal is transacting the business of insurance as a licensed insurer, it may issue policies providing for the contingent assessment liability of its subscribers acquiring policies in that state and need not extinguish the contingent assessment liability applicable to policies already in force in that state.

Every insur er domiciled in this Commonwealth shall file a report with the Commission disclosing material acquisitions and dispositions of assets or material nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements unless such acquisitions and disposi tions of assets or material nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements have been submitted to the Commission for review, approval or information purposes pursuant to other provisions of Title 38.2 or the rules and regulations of the Commission. 1. The r eport required by this subsection is due within fifteen days after the end of the calendar month in which any of the foregoing transactions occur. 2. One complete copy of the report, including any exhibits or other attachments filed as part thereof, shall be filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners unless the i nsurer has applied for and has been granted an exemption from this requirement by the Commission. B. All reports obtained by or disclosed to the Commission pursuant to this section, shall be given confidential treatment, shall not be subject to subpoena, and shall not be made public by the Commission, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or any oth er person without the prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the Commission, after giving the insurer which would be affected thereby, notice and an opportunity to be heard, determines that the interest of policyholders, shareho lders, or the public will be served by the publication thereof, in which event the Commission may publish all or any part thereof in such manner as it may deem appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Commission may at its discretion disclose such reports to (i) a regulatory official of any state or country; (ii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, its affiliate or its subsidiary; or (iii) a law-enforcement authority of any state or country. Any such disclosure by the Commission shall not constitute a waiver of confidentiality of any such report. C. No acquisit ions or dispositions of assets need be reported pursuant to subsection A if the acquisitions or dispositions are not material. For purposes of this section, a material acquisition, or the aggregate of any series of related acquisitions during any thirty- day period, or disposition, or the aggregate of any series of related dispositions during any thirty-day period, is one that is nonrecurring and not in the ordinary course of business and involves more than five percent of the reporting insurers tota l admitted assets as reported in its most recent statutory statement filed with the Commission. 1. Asset acquisitions subject to this section include every purchase, lease, exchange, merger, consolidation, succession, or other acquisition other than the construction or development of real property by or for the reporting insurer or the acquisition of mater ials for such purpose. 2. Asset dispositions subject to this section include every sale, lease, exchange, merger, consolidation, mortgage, pledge or hypothecation, assignment, whether for the benefit of credito rs or otherwise, abandonment, destruction, or other disposition. 3. The following information is required to be disclosed in any report of a material acquisition or disposition of assets: a. Date of the transaction; b. Manner of acquisition or disposition; c. Description of the assets involved; d. Nature and amount of the consideration given or received; e. Purpose of, or reason for, the transaction; f. Manner by which the amount of consideration was determined; g. Gain or loss recognized or realized as a result of the transaction; and h. Name of all persons from whom the assets were acquired or to whom they were disposed. 4. Insurers are required to report material acquisitions and dispositions on a nonconsolidated basis unless the insurer is part of a consolidated group of insurers which utilizes a poolin g arrangement or 100 percent reinsurance agreement that affects the solvency and integrity of the insurers reserves and such insurer ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to the pool. An insurer is deemed to have ceded substantia lly all of its direct and assumed business to a pool if the insurer has less than one million dollars total direct plus assumed written premiums during a calendar year that are not subject to a pooling arrangement and the net income of the business not s ubject to the pooling arrangement represents less than five percent of the insurers capital and surplus. D. No nonrenew als, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements need be reported pursuant to this section if the nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions are not material. For purposes of this section, a material nonrenewal, cancellation or revision is on e that affects for property and casualty business, including accident and health business when written as such, more than fifty percent of an insurers ceded written premium, or for life, annuity and accident and health business, more than fifty perce nt of the total reserve credit taken for business ceded, on an annualized basis as indicated in the insurers most recently filed statutory statement; however, no filing is required if the insurers ceded written premium or the total reserve credit taken for business ceded represents, on an annualized basis, less than ten percent of direct plus assumed written premium or ten percent of the statutory reserve requirement prior to any cession, respectively. 1. Subje ct to the foregoing criteria, a report is to be filed without regard to which party has initiated the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision of ceded reinsurance whenever one or more of the following conditions exist: a. The entire cession has been cancelled, nonrenewed or revised and ceded indemnity and loss adjustment expense reserves after any nonrenewal, cancellation or revision represent less than fifty percent of the comparable reserves that would have been ceded h ad the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision not occurred; b. An authorized or accredited reinsurer has been replaced on an existing cession by an unauthorizing reinsurer; or c. Collateral requirements previously established for unauthorized reinsurers have been reduced; e.g., the requirement to collateralize incurred but not reported (IBNR) claim reserve s has been waived with respect to one or more unauthorized reinsurers newly participating in an existing cession.Subject to the materiality criteria, for purposes of the foregoing subdivisions b and c, a report shall be filed if the result of the revisio n affects more than ten percent of the cession. 2. The following information is required to be disclosed in any report of a material nonrenewal, cancellation or revision of ceded reinsurance agreements: a. Effective date of the nonrenewal, cancellation or revision; b. The description of the transaction with an identification of the initiator thereof; c. Purpose of, or reason for, the transaction; and d. If applicable, the identity of the replacement reinsurers. 3. Insurers are required to report all material nonrenewals, cancellations or revisions of ceded reinsurance agreements on a nonconsolidated basis unless the insurer is part of a consolid ated group of insurers which utilizes a pooling arrangement or 100 percent reinsurance agreement that affects the solvency and integrity of the insurers reserves and such insurer ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to the pool. An insurer is deemed to have ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to a pool if the insurer has less than one million dollars total direct plus assumed written premiums during a calendar year that are not subject to a pooling arrang ement and the net income of the business not subject to the pooling arrangement represents less than five percent of the insurers capital and surplus.

To protect against the effect of adverse economic cycles, each insurer transacting the business of mortgage guaranty insurance in this Commonwealth shall establish and maintain a contingency reserve equal to fifty percent of its earned premium. B. Allocations to the contingency reserve shall be maintained for 120 months. That portion of the contingency reserve that has been maintained for more than 120 months shall be released and shall no longer constitute part of the contingency reserve and shall be alloca ted to surplus to policyholders. C. Upon approv al by the Commission, the contingency reserve shall be available for loss payments only when the incurred losses in any one twelve-month period, less any amounts already released from the contingency reserve during that period, exceed thirty-five percent of the corresponding earned premium. D. In the even t of release of the contingency reserve for payment of losses, the contributions required by subsection A of this section shall be treated on a first-in-first-out basis. E. Whenever th e laws of any other state require a greater unearned premium reserve than that set forth in § 38.2-1312, the mortgage guaranty insurance contingency reserve of mortgage guaranty insurers organized under the laws of that state may be an amount that, wh en added to such unearned premium reserve, will result in a reserve equal to the sum of the unearned premium reserve required by § 38.2-1312 and the contingency reserve required by this section. F. The authori ty of the Commission under § 38.2-223 to issue rules and regulations includes the authority to require that a greater reserve be established for mortgage guaranty insurance on liens other than first liens.

Effective D ecember 31, 2004, and except as otherwise provided by this section or Article 10 (§ 38.2-1365 et seq.) of Chapter 13, every insurer doing business in the Commonwealth shall annually submit an actuarial opinion that has been prepared by an appointed ac tuary and that satisfies at a minimum the standards set forth in the appropriate National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) annual statement instructions. B. Every insur er domiciled in the Commonwealth that is required to submit an actuarial opinion pursuant to subsection A shall annually submit an actuarial opinion summary, also written by the insurers appointed actuary. Every insurer domiciled in the Commonwealth that is required to submit an actuarial opinion pursuant to subsection A or § 38.2-1367, at the request of the Commission, shall submit underlying work papers and an actuarial report or memorandum that satisfies the minimum standards set forth in the appropriate NAIC annual statement instructions and complies with all additional standards or requirements established by statute or by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of this section or Article 10 (§ 38.2-1365 et seq.) of Chapter 13. A company licensed but not domiciled in the Commonwealth shall provide such summary, work papers, report, and memorandum upon request of the Commission. Any summary, work papers, report, or memorandum filed in accordance with the appropriate NAIC annual statement 13 instructions shall be considered as a document supporting the actuarial opinion required by subsection A or § 38.2-1367. C. If the insu rer fails to provide supporting work papers or a required report or memorandum at the request of the Commission, or the Commission determines that the work papers or report or memorandum are unacceptable, the Commission may engage a qualified actuary at the expense of the insurer to review the opinion and the basis for the opinion and to prepare supporting work papers, or a report or memorandum. D. The appoint ed actuary shall not be liable for damages to any person, other than the insurer and the Commission for any act, error, omission, decision, or conduct with respect to the actuarys opinion, except in cases of fraud or willful misconduct on the part of the actuary.

However, this provision shall not be construed to limit the Commissions authority to release the documents to any actuarial board established for counsel ing or discipline so long as the material is required for the purpose of professional disciplinary proceedings and such board establishes procedures satisfactory to the Commission for preserving the confidentiality of the documents. Moreover, the Commiss ion is authorized to use the documents, materials, or other information in furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the Commissions official duties. 1. Neith er the Commission nor any person who received documents, materials, or other information while acting under the authority of the Commission shall be permitted or required to testify in any private civil action concerning any confidential documents, mater ials, or information subject to this subsection. 2. In order to assist in the performance of the Commissions duties under this section, the Commission: a. May share documents, material, or other information, including the confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information subject to this subsection, with other state, federal, and international regulatory agencies, with the NAIC, its affiliate s, or subsidiaries, and with state, federal, and international law enforcement authorities, provided that the recipient agrees to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the document, material, or other information. b. May receive documents, materials, or information, including otherwise confidential and privileged documents, materials, or information, from the NAIC, its affiliates, or subsidiar ies and from regulatory and law-enforcement officials of other foreign or domestic jurisdictions, and shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, material, or information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, material, or information. G. The Commiss ion may waive or modify submission requirements for a foreign insurer that has been exempted by its domiciliary commissioner from filing an actuarial opinion under a substantially similar law in its state of domicile. The Commission may modify requiremen ts in any year for an insurer that makes application, with good cause shown, for exemption due to the nature of business written or the size and volume of business activity, or because the insurer is under supervision or an order of conservation, or if t he imposition of an annual filing requirement would create a financial hardship.

For related discussion, see 10A M.J. Insurance, § 59. § 38.2-1316.2. Credit allowed a domestic ceding insurer. Text A. Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of subsection C, D, or E or § 38.2-1316.4, provided that the Commiss ion may adopt by regulation pursuant to subsection B of § 38.2-1316.7 specific additional requirements relating to or setting forth any one or more of the following: (i) the valuation of assets or reserve credits, (ii) the amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in subsection B of § 38.2-1316.7, and (iii) the circumstances pursuant to which credit will be reduced or eliminated. B. Credit shal l be allowed under subdivisions C 1, 2, and 3 only as respects cessions of those kinds or classes of business that the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a U.S. branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. Credit shall be allowed under subdivision C 3 or 4 only if the applicable requirements of subsection B of 14VAC5-300-150 of the Virginia A dministrative Code have been satisfied. C. Credit shal l be allowed a domestic ceding insurer for reinsurance ceded only when the assuming insurer meets one of the following criteria: 1. Credi t shall be allowed when the assuming insurer is licensed to transact insurance in the Commonwealth. 2. Credit shall be allowed when the assuming insurer is accredited as a reinsurer in the Commonwealth. An accredited reinsurer is one which: a. Files with the Commission evidence of its submission to the Commissions jurisdiction; b. Submits to the Commissions authority to examine its books and records; c. Is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through and licensed to t ransact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state; d. Files annually with the Commission a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile or entry and a copy of its most recent audited finan cial statement; and e. Demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commission that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance fro m domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million and its accreditation has not been denied by the Commi ssion within 90 days of its initial submission. 3. Credit shall be allowed when the assuming insurer is domiciled and licensed in or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien insurer, is entered through, a state which employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this statute and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer: a. Submits to the authority of the Commission to examine its books and records; and b. Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than $20 million. However, unless specifically required by the Commission, this surplus requirement shall be dee med waived when reinsurance is ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system. 4. Credit shall be allowed when the assuming insurer maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution for the payment of the valid claims of its United States pol icyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The assuming insurer shall report annually to the Commission information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the NAIC Annual Statement form by licensed insure rs to enable the Commission to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. a. In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account representing the assuming insurers liabilities attributable to business written in the United States, and in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trust eed surplus amount not less than $20 million, except as provided in subdivision 4 b. b. At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three full years, the commissioner with principal r egulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers , policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, i ncluding when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirement...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_38.2-1317"><akn:num>§ 38.2-1317</akn:num><akn:heading>Examinations; when authorized or required</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Whenever th e Commission considers it expedient for the protection of the interests of the people of this Commonwealth, it may make or direct to be made an examination into the affairs of any person licensed to transact any insurance business in this Commonwealth or any other person subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission pursuant to provisions of this title. The Commission may also make or direct to be made, whenever necessary or advisable an examination into the affairs of: 1. Any p erson having a contract under which he has the exclusive or dominant right to manage or control any licensed insurer, 2. Any person holding the shares of capital stock or policyholder proxies of any domestic insurer amounting to control as defined in § 38.2-1322 either as voting trustee or otherwise, 3. Any person engaged or assisting in, or proposing or claiming to engage or assist in the promotion or formation of a domestic insurer, or 4. Any person seeking a license to transact any insurance business in this Commonwealth. B. The Commiss ion shall examine or cause to be examined every domestic insurer at least once in every five years; however, on or after January 1, 1993, the Commission shall examine every insurer licensed in this Commonwealth at least once in every five years. C. The examina tion of any foreign or alien insurer or any other foreign or alien person subject to examination shall be made to the extent practicable in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states. D. Instead of making its own examination, the Commission may accept a full report of the examination of a foreign or alien person, duly authenticated by the insurance supervisory official of the state of domicile or of entry until January 1, 1994. Thereafter, such rep orts may only be accepted if: 1. The i nsurance department was at the time of the examination accredited under the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Financial Regulation Standards and Accreditation Program; 2. The examination is performed under the supervision of such an accredited insurance department or with the participation of one or more examiners who are employed by an accredited insur ance department and who, after a review of the examination work papers and report, state under oath that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures required by their insurance department; or 3. The Commission determines, in its sole discretion, that the examination was performed in a manner consistent with standards and procedures employed by the Commission in the examination of domestic insurers, and the report of examination is duly authenticated by the insurance supervisory official of the insurers state of domicile or entry.

If an insurer subject to this article is deemed by the Commission to be in a hazardous financial condition as defined by 14VAC5-290 or a condition that would be grounds for supervision , conservation, or a delinquency proceeding, then the Commission may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a deposit held by the Commission or a bond as determined by the insurer at the insurers discretion, for the protection of the insur er for the duration of the contract, agreement, or existence of the condition for which the Commission required deposit or bond.In determining if a deposit or bond is required, the Commission shall consider whether concerns exist with respect to the affi liated persons ability to fulfill the contract or agreement if the insurer were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for supervision, conservation, or a d elinquency proceeding, and a deposit or bond is necessary, the Commission has the discretion to determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the contract or agreement in any one year, and whether such deposit or bond shall be r equired for a single contract, multiple contracts, or a contract only with a specific person; 8.

The affiliate shall provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance to give the insurer access to all records and data in the event of the affiliates default under a lease or other agreement; and 9. Premiums or other funds belonging to the insurer that are collected by or held by an affiliate are the exclusive property of the insurer and subject to the control of the insurer.

With respect to nonlife insurers, the lesser of three percent of the insurers admitted assets or 25 percent of surplus as regards policyholders as of the immediately preceding December 31; or b. With respect to life insurers, three percent of the insurers admitted assets as of the immediately preceding December 31; 3. Reinsurance agreements or modifications thereto, including: a.

Otherwise sufficient in terms of providing for group-wide supervision, enterprise risk analysis, and cooperation with other regulatory officials; and 5. Whether another regulatory official acting or seeking to act as the group-wide supervisor provides the Commission with reasonably reciprocal recognition and cooperation.However, a regu latory official identified under this section as the group-wide supervisor may determine that it is appropriate to acknowledge another supervisor to serve as the group-wide supervisor. The acknowledgment of the group-wide supervisor shall be made after c onsideration of the factors listed in subdivisions 1 through 5, and shall be made in cooperation with and subject to the acknowledgment of other regulatory officials involved with supervision of members of the internationally active insurance group and i n consultation with the internationally active insurance group.

The l egal minimum standard for the valuation of life insurance contracts issued prior to January 1, 1937, shall be on the basis of the American Experience Table of Mortality, with interest at four percent per year, and strictly in accordance with the terms an d conditions of such contracts, and for life insurance contracts issued on and after that date shall be the one-year preliminary term method of valuation, as hereinafter modified, on the basis of the American Experience Table of Mortality or, at the opti on of the insurer, the American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality with interest at three and one-half percent per year. 2. If the net renewal premium under a limited payment life preliminary term policy providing for the payment of less than 20 annual premiums under the policy, or under an endowment prelim inary term policy, exceeds that under a 20-payment life preliminary term policy, the reserve for that policy at the end of any year, including the first, shall be at least the reserve on a 20-payment life preliminary term policy issued in the same year a nd at the same age, together with an amount equivalent to the accumulation of a net level premium sufficient to provide for a pure endowment maturing one year after the date on which the last annual premium is due, or at the end of 20 years if the policy provides for the payment of premiums for more than 20 years, equal to the difference between the value on the maturity date of a 20-payment life preliminary term policy and the full net level premium reserve at such time of such a limited payment life o r endowment policy. Policies valued by the above method shall contain a clause specifying either that the reserve of the policies shall be computed in accordance with the 20-payment life modification of the preliminary term method of valuation or that th e first years insurance is term insurance. 3. Except as otherwise provided in § 38.2-1370 for group annuity and pure endowment contracts, the legal minimum standard for the valuation of annuities issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be the Combined Annuity Table, with interest at four percent per year, but annuities deferred 10 or more years and written in connection with life insurance shall be valued on the same basis as that used in computing the consideration or prem ium for the life insurance, or upon any higher standard, at the insurers option. 4. The legal minimum standard for the calculation of the reserve liability for insurance against disability incorporated in life insurance policies issued on and after January 1, 1937, sh all be on the basis of any table adopted by the insurer and approved by the Commission, with interest at three and one-half percent per year. However, in no case shall such liability be less than one-half of the net annual premium for the disability bene fit computed by the table. 5. The legal standard for the valuation of group insurance written as yearly renewable term insurance issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be on the basis of the American Men Ultima te Table of Mortality with interest at three and one-half percent per year. 6. The legal minimum standard for the valuation of industrial policies issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be the American Experience Table of Mortality, with interest at three and one-half percent per year; however, any insurer may voluntarily value its industrial policies on the basis of the standard industrial mortality table or the substandard industrial mortality table, and by the level net premium method or in accordance wit h their terms by the modified preliminary term method as described in subdivision 2, or the full preliminary term method.All industrial policies issued on and after January 1, 1937, shall be valued under the rules set forth in this section, whether or no t the policies provide for surrender values, either in cash, paid-up insurance, or extended insurance. 7. The Commission may vary the standards of interest and mortality in the case of alien insurers as to contracts issued by those insurers in countries other than the United States, and in particular cases of invalid lives and other extra hazards. 8. If the actual annual premium charged for insurance is less than the net annual premium for the insurance, computed as specified in this section, the insurer shall set up an additional reserve equal to the value of an annuity of the difference between the actual premium charged and the net premium required by this section, and the term of which at the date of the valuation shall equal the period during which future premium payments are to become due on the insurance. The annuity shall be valued according to the table of mortality with the rate of interest at which the net annual premium is calculated. 9. Reserves for all of these policies and contracts, or all of any class of these policies and contracts, may be calculated, at the insurers option, according to any standards that pr oduce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts, or all of the class of the policies and contracts so valued, than the minimum reserves required by this section; and in each case the insurer shall report to the Commission in its annua l statement the standards it used in making the valuation.

Life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year on or after the operative date of § 38.2-3209; 2. Individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983, except that an insurer may elect for this to apply to all individual a nnuity and pure endowment contracts issued after July 1, 1982; 3.

The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1983, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts. B. The calenda r year statutory valuation interest rates, referred to in this section as I, shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent: 1. For l ife insurance:I =.03 + W(R1 - .03) + (W/2)(R2 - .09); 2.

Plan Type B: Before expiration of the interest rate guarantee, policyholder may withdraw funds only (i) with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since receipt of the funds by the insurance company, (ii) without an adjustment but in installments over five years or more, or (iii) no withdrawal permitted. At the end of interest rate guarantee, funds may be withdrawn without an adjustment in a single sum or installments over less than five years.

An insurer may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change-in -fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options must be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this section, an issue year basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis un der which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or g uaranteed interest contract, and the change-in-fund basis of valuation refers to a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed i nterest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund. D. The referen ce interest rate referred to in subsection B shall be defined as follows: 1.

However, upon prior written application by an insurer, the Commiss ion may, until July 1, 1992, at its discretion, allow such insurer to increase its investments in § 77r-1 securities to an amount not to exceed ten percent of the insurers total admitted assets. B. On and afte r July 1, 1992, investments made in any securities described in 15 U.S.C. § 77r-1 shall be subject to the percentage limitations and requirements set forth in this chapter. History History. 1991, c. 283; 1992, c. 588. § 38.2-1411.2. Investment limits in medium grade and lower grade obligations. Text A. No domestic insurer shall acquire, directly or indirectly, any medium grade or lower grade obligations of any business entity if, after giving effect to any such acquisition, the aggregate amount of all medium grade and lower grade obligations then held by the dome stic insurer would exceed twenty percent of its admitted assets, provided that: 1. No mo re than ten percent of its admitted assets consists of lower grade obligations; 2. No more than three percent of its admitted assets consists of lower grade obligations rated five or six by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Comm issioners; and 3. No more than one percent of its admitted assets consists of lower grade obligations rated six by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Attaining or exceeding the limit of any one category shall not preclude an insurer from acquiring obligations in other categories subject to the specific and multi-category limits. B. No domestic insurer may invest more than an aggregate of one percent of its admitted assets in medium grade obligations issued, guaranteed or insured by any one business entity nor may it invest more than one-half of one percent of its admitted assets in lower grad e obligations issued, guaranteed or insured by any one business entity. In no event may a domestic insurer invest more than one percent of its admitted assets in any medium or lower grade obligations issued, guaranteed or insured by any one business enti ty. C. Nothing con tained in this section shall prohibit a domestic insurer from acquiring any obligation which it has committed to acquire if the insurer would have been permitted to acquire that obligation pursuant to the provisions of this chapter on the date on which s uch insurer committed to purchase that obligation. D. Notwithstan ding the foregoing, a domestic insurer may acquire any obligation of a business entity in which the insurer already has one or more obligations, if the obligation is acquired in order to protect an investment previously made in the obligations of the bus iness entity; however, all such acquired obligations shall not exceed one-half of one percent of the insureds admitted assets. E. Nothing con tained in this section shall prohibit a domestic insurer from acquiring any obligation as a result of a restructuring of any obligation already held. F. Nothing con tained in this section shall require a domestic insurer to sell or otherwise dispose of any obligations legally acquired prior to July 1, 1992. G. The Board o f Directors of any domestic insurer which acquires or invests, directly or indirectly, more than two percent of its admitted assets in medium grade or lower grade obligations of any individual business entity, shall adopt a written plan for the making of such investments. The plan shall contain, in addition to guidelines with respect to the quality of the issues invested in, diversification standards including, but not limited to, standards for issuer, industry, duration, liquidity and geographic locati on. H. If the Comm ission finds that economic or other conditions render any rating of any obligation by the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners obsolete or unreflective of a diminished creditworthiness of the business entity issuing such obligations, the Commission may assign the obligations to a lower grade based on the findings of a national rating agency recognized by the Commission.

Group, Inc. v. Fidelity Bankers Life Ins. Co., 778 F. Supp. 278, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17001 (E.D. Va. 1991). While fixing claim priorities in the liquidation context may be the business of insurers, rehabilitation proceedings necessarily are the business of insurance, as that term has been defined under Union Labor Life Ins.

CASE NOTES Section establishes single regulatory scheme for resolution of claims.  In accordance with the McFarran-Ferguson Acts broad grant of exclusive regulatory authority to the states, this section clearly and unequivocally establishes a single regulatory scheme for the comprehensive and efficient resolution of conflicting claims against insolvent insurers; the designation of the State Corporation Commission as the single forum in which claims against the insolvent insurer may be asser ted precludes piecemeal and possible duplicative litigation and allows for the orderly resolution of creditors competing claims to finite and often insufficient assets. Gross v. Weingarten, 18 F. Supp. 2d 616, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13334 (E.D. Va. 19 98), rev'd, 217 F.3d 208, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15436 (4th Cir. 2000). McCarran-Ferguson Act applies to rehabilitation proceeding statutes.  The creation by statute of a single, exclusive forum for insurance company rehabilitation proceedings is regulation of the business of insurance for purpo ses of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Eden Fin. Group, Inc. v. Fidelity Bankers Life Ins. Co., 778 F. Supp. 278, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17001 (E.D. Va. 1991). The exclusive regulatory jurisdiction of the states over insurance companies applies only to the business of insurance, not to the regulation of the b usiness of insurers. Eden Fin. Group, Inc. v. Fidelity Bankers Life Ins. Co., 778 F. Supp. 278, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17001 (E.D. Va. 1991). While fixing claim priorities in the liquidation context may be the business of insurers, rehabilitation proceedings necessarily are the business of insurance, as that term has been defined under Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U.S. 119, 102 S. Ct. 3002, 73 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1982). Eden Fin. Group, Inc. v. Fidelity Bankers Life Ins. Co., 778 F. Supp. 278, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17001 (E.D. Va. 1991). Insurance company in state rehabilitation proceedings is exempt from Federal Arbitration Act.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act bars interference with state laws regulating the business of insurance, unless such laws specifically relate to insurance; because the F ederal Arbitration Act does not specifically relate to the business of insurance, an insurance company in state rehabilitation and conservation proceedings is excepted from the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act where a party attempts to invoke ar bitration against the company or its receiver. Eden Fin. Group, Inc. v. Fidelity Bankers Life Ins. Co., 778 F. Supp. 278, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17001 (E.D. Va. 1991). Under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, federal courts must defer to the exclusive jurisdiction of state proceedings over the rehabilitation of insurance companies. Eden Fin. Group, Inc. v. Fidelity Bankers Life Ins. Co., 778 F. Supp. 278, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17001 (E.D. Va. 1991). When demands for arbitration are stayed along with all other types of claims and causes of action in an insurance rehabilitation proceeding, the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act must give way to the mandates and policy of the McCarran-Ferguson Act and accompanying state regulations. Eden Fin. Group, Inc. v. Fidelity Bankers Life Ins. Co., 778 F. Supp. 278, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17001 (E.D. Va. 1991). Federal jurisdiction over counterclaims against receiver not preempted.  This section, in conjunction with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, does not preempt federal jurisdiction over counterclaims against a receiver for exoneration, contribu tion or indemnification. Gross v. Weingarten, 217 F.3d 208, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 15436 (4th Cir. 2000). Federal court divested of jurisdiction by receivership order.  A receivership order entered by the State Corporation Commission (SCC) providing that the SCC assumed and exercised sole and exclusive jurisdiction over all the p roperty of an insolvent insurer and any claims or rights respecting such property to the exclusion of any other court or tribunal, established an exclusive forum for the resolution of all claims against the insurer and was entitled to full faith and cred it so as to divest the federal court of subject matter jurisdiction over counterclaims for equitable and contractual indemnification, exoneration and contribution.

Equitably allocate disbursements to each of the entitled associations; and 3. Secure an agreement from each of the entitled associations requiring the return to the Commission of any assets previously disbursed to the association required to pay claims entitled to priority in subdivision 1 of this subsection. No bond shall be required of any entitled association; and 4. Require a full report to be made by the association to the Commission accounting for all assets disbursed to the association, all disbursements made from these assets, any interest ear ned on these assets and any other matter as the Commission may require. C. The Commiss ion shall provide for disbursements to the association in an amount estimated at least equal to the claim payments made or to be made by the association for which the association could assert a claim against the Commission. In addition, the Commission sh all provide that if the assets available for disbursement do not equal or exceed the amount of claim payments made or to be made by the associations, then disbursements shall be in the amount of available assets. D. The Commiss ion shall notify the affected associations and the commissioners of insurance in the other states of any disbursement made according to this section. The notice shall be deemed given when sent by certified mail at least thirty days prior to disbursement. History History. 1978, c. 696, § 38.1-133.1; 1979, c. 385; 1986, c. 562; 1996, c. 81.

The insolvency, financial condition, or default of the insurer at any time, provided that the right is enforceable under applicable law other than this chapter; or b. The commencement of a delinquency proceeding under this chapter; 2. Any right under a pledge, security, collateral, reimbursement, or guarantee agreement or arrangement or any other similar arrangement, or other credit enhancement relating to one or mo re netting agreements or qualified financial contracts; 3.

Any limited two-way payment or firs t method provision in a netting agreement or qualified financial contract with an insurer that has defaulted shall be deemed to be a full two-way payment or second method provision as against the defaulting insurer.

Transfer none of the netting agreements, qualified financial contracts, rights, obligations, or property referred to in subdivision 1, with respect to the counterparty and any affiliat e of the counterparty. D.

For purposes of this section, business day means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or any day on which either the Ne w York Stock Exchange or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is closed. E.

However, a transfer may be avoided under § 38.2-1513 if the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the insurer, a receiver appointed for the insurer, or existing or future creditors. F. In exercisi ng the receivers rights of disaffirmance or repudiation with respect to any netting agreement or qualified financial contract to which an insurer is a party, the receiver for the insurer shall either: 1. Disaf firm or repudiate all netting agreements and qualified financial contracts between a counterparty or any affiliate of the counterparty and the insurer that is the subject of the proceeding; or 2. Disaffirm or repudiate none of the netting agreements and qualified financial contracts referred to in subdivision 1, with respect to the person or any affiliate of the person. G. Notwithstan ding any other provision of this chapter, provided the receiver disaffirms or repudiates a netting agreement or qualified financial contract within a reasonable period after the commencement of a delinquency proceeding, any claim of a counterparty agains t the estate arising from the receivers disaffirmance or repudiation of a netting agreement or qualified financial contract that has not been previously affirmed in the liquidation or immediately preceding rehabilitation shall be determined and shall be allowed or disallowed as if the claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition for liquidation or, if a rehabilitation is converted to a delinquency proceeding, as if the claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition for rehabilitation. The amount of the claim shall be the actual direct compensatory damages determined as of the date of the disaffirmance or repudiation of the netting agreement or qualified financial contract. H.

CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  The Virginia Insurance Guaranty Association Act, considered as a whole, clearly indicates that the General Assembly did not intend that the association merely ste p into the shoes of the insolvent insurer, since establishment of the association affords a mechanism for the timely payment of appropriate claims to avoid financial loss to certain classes of people, not merely a solvent substitute for an insolvent insu rance company.

No right of subrogation against association where insureds suffered no loss.  Where the insurer of a driver of a truck which collided with insureds became insolvent and an uninsured motorist insurer paid the insured the full amount of their claims, the uninsured motorist insurer did not then have any rights of subrogation against the Property and Casualty Insurance Guarantee Association because the insureds never suffered any financial loss due to the insolvency of drivers insurer.

Liability for widows black lung benefits.  The Virginia Property and Casualty Insurance Guarantee Association (VPCIGA) was liable for the widows derivative benefits payable to the widow when the VPCIGA had assumed responsibility for payment of the deceased miners benefits. The widow could not have complied with a notice requirement until after the miner had died and the deadline imposed by the VPCIGA did not apply to the widows claims. Boyd &amp; Stevenson Coal Co. v. Dir., OWCP, 407 F.3d 663, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 8468 (4th Cir. 2005). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Legislative intent.  It is clear from the legislatures stated purpose in the opening section of the Property Association Act that the goal is to protect claimants as a priority, a nd to that end and to recoup claims paid by the Virginia Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association, the Act allows for the Guaranty Association to collect funds paid out from a narrow group of insured persons; the definition of person under the Act, § 38.2-100, reads any corporation, and as a result and because a court is directed under § 38.2-1602 to liberally construe the Act to effect the purpose, the definition of person, as contemplated in the Act, does incl ude municipal corporations.

Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10 percent or more of the voting securities of any othe r person. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact. Covered claim means an unpaid claim, including one for unearned premiums, submitted by a claimant, that (i) arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of a policy covered by this chapter and issued by an insurer who has been declared to be an insolvent insurer or (ii) arises out of and is within the c overage and is subject to the applicable limits of a policy that would not be excluded from the coverage of this chapter under the provisions of § 38.2-1601 if it were a policy of direct insurance and that has been assumed as a direct obligation by an insurer who has been declared to be an insolvent insurer, where such obligation is assumed through a merger or acquisition, or pursuant to an acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities, an assumption under the provisions of subsection B or C of § 38.2-136 or a substantially similar law of another jurisdiction, or any other novation agreement. The claimant or insured shall be a resident of the Commonwealth at the time of the insured loss, provided that for entities other than an individual, the residence of a claimant or insured is the state in which its principal place of business is located at the time of the insured loss or the property from which the claim arises shall be permanently located in the Commonwealth. Covered claim sh all not include any amount awarded as punitive damages or sought as a return of premium under any retrospective rating plan; any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association as subrogation recoveries, reinsurance recover ies, contribution, indemnification, or otherwise; any amount due under any policy originally issued by a surplus lines carrier or risk retention group; any obligation assumed by an insolvent insurer after the commencement of any delinquency proceeding, a s defined in Chapter 15 (§ 38.2-1500 et seq.), involving the insolvent insurer or the original insurer, unless it would have been a covered claim absent such assumption; or any obligation assumed by an insolvent insurer in a transaction in whi ch the original insurer remains separately liable. An obligation owing under a contract of reinsurance shall not be deemed a direct obligation for the purposes of this definition unless it shall have been assumed pursuant to the provisions of subsection B or C of § 38.2-136 or a substantially similar law of another jurisdiction. No claim for any amount due any reinsurer, insurer, insurance pool, or underwriting association may be asserted against a person insured under a policy issued by an insolvent insurer other than to the extent the claim exceeds the association obligation limitations set forth in § 38.2-1606. Insolvent insurer means an insurer that is (i) licensed to transact the business of in surance in the Commonwealth either at the time the policy was issued, when the obligation with respect to the covered claim was assumed, or when the insured loss occurred and (ii) against whom an order of liquidation with a finding of insolvency has been entered after July 1, 1987, by a court of competent jurisdiction in the insurers state of domicile or of the Commonwealth under the provisions of Chapter 15 (§ 38.2-1500 et seq.), and which order of liquidation has not been stayed or been the sub ject of a writ of supersedeas or other comparable order. Member insurer means any person who (i) writes any class of insurance to which this ch apter applies under § 38.2-1601, including reciprocal insurance contracts, and (ii) is licensed to transact the business of insurance in the Commonwealth but shall not include persons listed in subdivision 9 of § 38.2-1601. Net direct written premiums means direct gross premiums written in the Commonwealth on insurance policies applicable to this chapter, less return premiums and dividends paid or credited to policyholders on direct business. Net direct written premiums does not include premiums on contracts between insurers or reinsurers.

The Associa tion shall: 1. Be ob ligated to pay covered claims that existed prior to the determination of insolvency and which arose before the earliest of (i) ninety-one days after the determination of insolvency, (ii) the policy expiration date, or (iii) the date the insured replaces or cancels the policy. a. Such obligation shall be satisfied by paying to the claimant an amount as follows: (i) The full amount of a covered claim for benefits under a workers compensation insurance coverage; or (ii) An amount not exceeding $300,000 per claimant for all other covered claims. b. In no event shall the Association be obligated to pay a claimant for an amount in excess of the insolvent insurers obligation for a covered claim. Notwithstanding any other pr ovision of this chapter, a covered claim shall not include any claim filed with the Guaranty Association after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer. The Association shall pay only that amount of each unearned premium which is in excess of fifty dollars. A covered claim shall not include any claim filed with the Association after the final date set by the court for the filing of claims against the liquidator or receiver of an insolvent insurer. 2. Be deemed the insurer to the extent of the insolvent insurers obligation on the covered claims and to that extent shall have all the rights, duties, and obligations of the insolven t insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent. 3. Allocate claims paid and expenses incurred among the three accounts and assess member insurers separately for each account (i) the amounts necessary to pay the obligations of the Assoc iation under subdivision 1 of this subsection subsequent to an insolvency, (ii) the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, and (iii) other expenses authorized by this chapter. The assessment of each member insurer shall be based on the ratio of the net direct written premiums of the member insurer to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers. This ratio shall be determined using the premiums for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the classes of insurance in the account. Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment at least thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year on any account an amount greater than two percent of that member insurers net direct written premiums for the calendar year preceding the assessment on the classes of insurance in the account. If the sum of the maximum assessment and the assets of the account does not provide in any one year an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments f rom that account, the funds available shall be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon as funds become available. The Association shall pay claims in any order which it may deem reasonable, including the payment of claims as such are receiv ed from the claimants or in groups or categories of claims. The Association may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer if payment of the assessment would cause the member insurers financial statement to reflect an impairment of the insurers minimum capital and surplus in any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance; provided, that during the period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. De ferred assessments shall be paid when the payments shall not cause an impairment of minimum capital and surplus. These payments shall be refunded to those members receiving larger assessments by virtue of the deferment, or at the election of any such com pany, credited against future assessments. Each member insurer may set off against any assessment, payments authorized by the Association and made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of those claims. The offset shall be allowed only if the payments are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made. 3a. The Association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than assessments paid pursuant to subdivision 3 (iii) of this subsection, a certificate of contribution in a form prescribed by the Commission, for the amount of the assessment paid, excluding interest penalties. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contributi on may be shown by the insurer on its financial statement as an asset. This shall be shown in a form, in an amount, and for a period of time approved by the Commission. 4. Investigate claims brought against the Association and adjust, compromise, settle, and pay covered claims to the extent of the Associations obligation and deny all other claims. Th e Association may review settlements, releases and judgments to which the insolvent insurer or its insureds were parties to determine the extent to which the settlements, releases and judgments may be properly contested. 5. Notify those persons as the Commission directs under subdivision 8 of this subsection. 6. Handle claims through its employees or through one or more insurers or other persons designated as servicing facilities. Designation of a servicing facility is subject to (i) the appro val of the Commission and (ii) acceptance by the designated insurer. 7. Reimburse each servicing facility for the Associations obligations paid by the facility and for expenses incurred by the facility while handling claims on behalf of the Association . The Association shall pay the other expenses authorized by this chapter. 8. Notify the insureds of the insolvent insurer and any other interested parties of the determination of insolvency and of their rights under this chapter. Notification shall be sent by m ail to the insureds last known address. If the Association is unable to obtain the information required to mail the notice in a timely manner, the Association shall publish the notice in newspapers of general circulation likely to cover geographical areas occupied by the policyholders. B. The Associa tion may: 1. Emplo y or retain persons necessary to perform the duties of the Association. 2. Borrow funds necessary to effect the purposes of this chapter in accord with the plan of operation. 3. Sue or be sued. 4. Negotiate and become a party to those contracts necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter. 5. Perform any other acts necessary or proper to achieve the purpose of this chapter. 6. Pay refunds to the member insurers in proportion to their contributions made to each account during the five years immediately preceding the date of the refund. The total refund shall be the amount by which the assets of the account are expected to exceed the liabilities for the coming year as determined by the board of directors. 7. Obtain commitments or lines of credit, and in the event a natural disaster such as an earthquake, windstorm or fire results in covered claims, with the approval of its board of directo rs and the Commission, secure indebtedness for borrowed money to be used for the purpose set forth in subsection A of § 38.2-1622 in an amount not to exceed the amount reasonably estimated by its board of directors and the Commission as the aggregate amount of assessments which the Association will be authorized to make during the succeeding calendar year, by pledge, assignment, transfer in trust or hypothecation of any or all of the assessments to be made against its member insurers.

Any person recovering under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned his rights under the policy to the Association to the extent of his recovery from the Association. Each insured or claimant seeking the protection of this chapter shall cooperate with the Association to the same extent as the person would have been required to coo perate with the insolvent insurer. The Association shall have no cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out except the causes of action the insolvent insurer would have had if those sums had been paid by the insolvent insurer and except as provided in subdivision 2 of this subsection. In the case of an insolvent insurer operating on an assessment plan, payments of claims by the Association shall not reduce the liability of insureds to the receiver, liquidat or, or statutory successor for unpaid assessments previously made. However, the receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor shall under no circumstances levy an additional assessment against the insured, regardless of the terms of the policy. 2.

The expenses of the Association or a similar organization incurred in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the liquidat ors expenses. C. The Associa tion shall preserve its rights to the insolvent insurer by periodically filing with the receiver or liquidator statements of the covered claims paid by the Association and estimates of anticipated claims on the Association.

A member in surer shall have at its option the right to show a certificate of contribution as an asset in the form approved by the Commission pursuant to subdivision 3a of subsection A of § 38.2-1606 at the original face amount for the calendar year of issuance. Such amount may be amortized as follows: 1. Certi ficates of contribution issued prior to January 1, 1998, shall be amortized in each succeeding calendar year through December 31, 1997, at an amount not to exceed 0.05 of one percent of the members direct gross premium income for the classes of insur ance in the account for which the member insurer is assessed. As used herein, the definition of direct gross premium income shall be the same as that specified in § 58.1-2500. If the amount of the certificate has not been fully amortized by the contri buting insurer by December 31, 1997, the unamortized balance of the certificate amount shall be amortized, at the option of the contributing insurer, either (i) in the same manner as the certificate was amortized prior to January 1, 1998; however, if not amortized in full prior to calendar year 2010, the unamortized balance of the certificate shall be amortized in full during calendar year 2010, or (ii) over the 10 successive calendar years commencing January 1, 1998, in amounts each equal to 10 percent of such unamortized balance. A contributing insurer whose certificate has not been fully amortized by December 31, 1997, shall notify the Commission in writing of the amortization schedule option it has selected on or before March 1, 1998; however, if a contributing insurer fails to notify the Commission by such date, the insurer shall be deemed to have selected the option described in clause (i) of the preceding sentence. 2. Certificates of contribution issued on or after January 1, 1998, shall be amortized over the 10 calendar years following the year the contribution was paid in amounts each equal to 10 percent of the amount of the contribution. B. The insurer may offset the amount of the certificate amortized in a calendar year as provided in subsection A. This amount shall be deducted from the premium tax liability incurred on business transacted in this Commonwealth for that year. However, the Association shall diligently pursue all rights available to it to recover its expenditures made in the fulfillment of its responsibilities under this chapter. In the event the Commission determines after a hearing that the Association is not diligently pursuing avai lable measures of recovery, the Commission shall notify the Department of Taxation and participating insurers will not be able to offset amounts amortized during the period that the Commission determines that the Association has not been diligently pursu ing available measures of recovery.

D.

The purpose of this chapter is to protect, subject to certain limitations, the persons specified in subsection B against failure in the performance of contractual obligations, under life, accident and sickness insurance, and annuity policies, plans, or contracts sp ecified in subsection C because of the impairment or insolvency of the member insurer that issued the policies, plans, or contracts. This chapter shall be construed to effect this purpose. To provide this protection, an association of member insurers is created to pay benefits and to continue coverage as limited by this chapter, and members of the Association are subject to assessments to provide funds to carry out the purpose of this chapter. B. This chapte r shall provide coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subsection C as follows: 1. This chapter shall provide coverage, for the policies and contracts specified in subsection C, to persons who, regardless of where they reside, except for nonresident certificate holders under group policies or contracts, are the beneficiaries, assignees, or payees, including health care providers rendering services covered under accident and sickness insurance policies or certificates, of the persons covered under subdivision B 2. 2. This chapter shall provide coverage, for the policies and contracts specified in subsection C, to persons who are owners of or certificate holders or enrollees under the policies or co ntracts, other than unallocated annuity contracts and structured settlement annuities, and in each case who: a. Are residents; or b. Are not residents and (i) the member insurer that issued the policies or contracts is domiciled in the Commonwealth, (ii) the states in which the persons reside have associations similar to the Association, and (iii) the persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state due to the fact that the insurer or health maintenance organization was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the states guaranty association law. 3. For unallocated annuity contracts specified in subsection C, subdivisions B 1 and B 2 shall not apply, and this chapter, except as provided in subdivisions B 5 and B 6, shall provide c overage to persons who are the owners of the unallocated annuity contracts if the contracts are issued to or in connection with a specific benefit plan whose plan sponsor has its principal place of business in the Commonwealth. 4. For structured settlement annuities specified in subsection C, subdivision B 1 and B 2 shall not apply and this chapter, except as provided in subdivisions B 5 and B 6, shall provide c overage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity, or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased, if the payee: a. Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides; or b. Is not a resident and both (i) the contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is (a) a resident or (b) not a resident but the insurer that issued the structured settlemen t annuity is domiciled in the Commonwealth and the state in which the contract owner resides has an association similar to the Association; and (ii) neither the payee or beneficiary, nor the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association of t he state in which the payee or contract owner resides. 5. This chapter shall not provide coverage to: a. A person who is a payee, or beneficiary, of a contract owner resident of the Commonwealth if the payee, or beneficiary, is afforded any coverage by the association of another state; or b. A person covered under subdivision B 3 if any coverage is provided by the association of another state to the person. 6. This chapter is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident of the Commonwealth and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident. In order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the laws of any other state, the person shall not be provided coverage under this chapter. In determining the application of the provisions of this subdivision i n situations where a person could be covered by the association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee, enrollee, beneficiary, or assignee, this chapter shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only one association. C. This chapte r shall: 1. Provi de coverage to the persons specified in subsection B for policies or contracts of direct, nongroup life insurance, accident and sickness insurance, which for the purposes of this chapter includes health maintenance organization subscriber contracts and c ertificates, or annuities, and supplemental contracts to any of these, for certificates under direct group policies and contracts, and for unallocated annuity contracts issued by member insurers, in each case except as limited by this chapter. Annuity co ntracts and certificates under group annuity contracts include guaranteed investment contracts, deposit administration contracts, unallocated funding agreements, allocated funding agreements, structured settlement annuities, and any immediate or deferred annuity contracts. This chapter shall apply also to dental benefit contracts entered into with a dental plan organization as provided in Chapter 61 (§ 38.2-6100 et seq.). 2. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision 3, not provide coverage for: a. A portion of a policy or contract not guaranteed by a member insurer or under which the risk is borne by the policy or contract owner; b.

A portion of a policy or contract issued to a plan or program of an employer, association, or other person to provide life, health, or annuity benefits to its employees, members, or others, to the extent that the plan or program is self-funded or uninsured, including but not limited to benefits payable by an employer, association, or other person under: (1) A multiple employer welfare arrangement as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 1144; (2) A minimum premium group insurance plan; (3) A stop-loss agreement described in subsection B of § 38.2-109; or (4) An administrative services only contract; e.

A portion of a policy or contract to the extent that the assessments required by § 38.2-1705 with respect to the policy or contract are preempted by federal or state law; j.

If th e member insurer is an impaired insurer, the Association may, in its discretion and subject to any conditions imposed by the Association that do not impair the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer and that are approved by the Commission: 1. Guarantee, assume, reissue, or reinsure, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reissued, or reinsured, any or all of the policies or contracts of the impaired insurer; and 2. Provide moneys, pledges, loans, notes, guarantees or other means as are proper to effectuate subdivision 1 and assure payment of the contractual obligations of the impaired insure r pending action under that subdivision. B. If the member insurer is an insolvent insurer, the Association shall, in its discretion and subject to the approval of the Commission, either: 1. a. Guarantee, assume, reissue, or reinsure or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reissued, or reinsured the covered policies of the insolvent insurer or assure payment of the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer; and b. Provide moneys, pledges, notes, guarantees, or other means reasonably necessary to discharge its duties; or 2. Provide benefits and coverages in accordance with the following provisions: a. With respect to policies and contracts, assure payment of benefits that would have been payable under the policies or contracts of the insolvent insurer, for claims incurred: (1) With respect to group policies and contracts, not later than the earlier of the next renewal date under those policies or contracts or 45 days, but in no event less than 30 days, after the date on which the Association becomes obligated with respect to the policies and contracts; (2) With respect to nongroup policies, contracts, and annuities, not later than the earlier of the next renewal date, if any, under the policies or contracts or one year, but in no event less than 30 days, from the date on which the Association becomes obligated with respect to the policies or contracts; b. Make diligent efforts to provide all known insureds, enrollees, or annuitants (for nongroup policies and contracts), or group policy or contract owners with respect t o group policies and contracts, 30 days notice of the termination, pursuant to subdivision 2 a, of the benefits provided; c. With respect to nongroup policies and contracts covered by the Association, make available to each known insured, enrollee, or annuitant, or owner if other than the i nsured, enrollee, or annuitant, and with respect to an individual formerly an insured, enrollee, or annuitant under a group policy or contract who is not eligible for replacement group coverage, make available substitute coverage on an individual basis i n accordance with the provisions of subdivision 2 d, if the insureds, enrollees, or annuitants had a right under law or the terminated policy or annuity to convert coverage to individual coverage or to continue an individual policy, contract, or annuity in force until a specified age or for a specified time, during which the insurer or health maintenance organization had no right unilaterally to make changes in any provision of the policy, contract, or annuity or had a right only to make changes in prem ium by class; d. In providing the substitute coverage required under subdivision 2 c, the Association may offer either to reissue the terminated coverage or to issue an alternative po licy or contract at actuarially justified rates, subject to the prior approval of the Commission. Alternative or reissued policies shall be offered without requiring evidence of insurability, and shall not provide for any waiting period or exclusion that would not have applied under the terminated policy or contract. The Association may reinsure any alternative or reissued policy or contract; e. Alternative policies or contracts adopted by the Association shall be subject to the approval of the Commission. The Association may adopt alternative policies or con tracts of various types for future issuance without regard to any particular impairment or insolvency. Alternative policies or contracts shall contain at least the minimum statutory provisions required in the Commonwealth and provide benefits that shall not be unreasonable in relation to the premium charged. The Association shall set the premium in accordance with a table of rates that it shall adopt. The premium shall reflect the amount of insurance to be provided and the age and class of risk of each insured, but shall not reflect any changes in the health of the insured after the original policy or contract was last underwritten. Any alternative policy or contract issued by the Association shall provide coverage of a type similar to that of the poli cy or contract issued by the impaired or insolvent insurer, as determined by the Association; f. If the Association elects to reissue terminated coverage at a premium rate different from that charged under the terminated policy or contract, the premium shall be a ctuarially justified and set by the Association in accordance with the amount of insurance or coverage provided and the age and class of risk, subject to approval of the Commission; g. The Associations obligations with respect to coverage under any policy or contract of the impaired or insolvent insurer or under any reissued or alternative polic y or contract shall cease on the date the coverage or policy or contract is replaced by another similar policy or contract by the policy or contract owner, the insured, the enrollee, or the Association; and h. When proceeding under subdivision B 2 with respect to a policy or contract carrying guaranteed minimum interest rates, the Association shall assure the payment or cre diting of a rate of interest consistent with subdivision C 2 c of § 38.2-1700. C. Nonpayment of premiums within 31 days after the date required under the terms of any guaranteed, assumed, alternative, or reissued policy or contract or substitute coverage shall termi nate the Associations obligations under the policy or contract or coverage under this chapter with respect to the policy, contract, or coverage, except with respect to any claims incurred or any net cash surrender value that may be due in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. D. Premiums due for coverage after entry of an order of liquidation of an insolvent insurer shall belong to and be payable at the direction of the Association. If the liquidator of an ins olvent insurer requests, the Association shall provide a report to the liquidator regarding such premium collected by the Association. The Association shall be liable for unearned premiums due to policy or contract owners arising after the entry of the o rder. E. The protection provided by this chapter shall not apply where the Commission has determined that the foreign or alien insurers domiciliary jurisdiction or state of entry provides s ubstantially similar protection by statute or regulation for residents of the Commonwealth. F. In carrying out its duties under subsection B, the Association may: 1. Subject to approval by the Commission, impose permanent policy contract liens in connection with a guarantee, assumption, or reinsurance agreement, if the Association finds that the amounts that can be assessed under this chapter are less than the amount s needed to assure full and prompt performance of the Associations duties under this chapter, or that economic or financial conditions as they affect member insurers are sufficiently adverse to render the imposition of such permanent policy or contra ct liens to be in the public interest; and 2. Subject to approval by the Commission, impose temporary moratoriums or liens on payments of cash values and policy loans or any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction w ith policies or contracts, in addition to any contractual provisions for deferral of cash or policy loan values. In addition, in the event of a temporary moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court on payment of cash values or polic y loans, or on any other right to withdraw funds held in conjunction with policies or contracts, out of the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer, the Association may defer the payment of cash values, policy loans, or other rights by the Associatio n for the period of the moratorium or moratorium charge imposed by the receivership court, except for claims covered by the Association to be paid in accordance with a hardship procedure established by the liquidator or rehabilitator and approved by the receivership court. G. A deposit in the Commonwealth, held pursuant to law or required by the Commission for the benefit of creditors, including policy or contract owners, not turned over to the domiciliary liquidator upon the entry of a final order of liquidation or order approving a rehabilitation plan of a member insurer domiciled in the Commonwealth or in a reciprocal state, pursuant to Article 7 (§ 38.2-1045 et seq.) of Chapter 10 shall be promptly paid to the Association. The Association shall be entitled to retain a portion of any amount so paid to it equal to the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate amount of policy or contract owners claims related to that insolvency for which th e Association has provided statutory benefits by the aggregate amount of all policy or contract owners claims in the Commonwealth related to that insolvency and shall remit to the domiciliary receiver the amount so paid to the Association less the am ount retained pursuant to this subsection. Any amount so paid to the Association and retained by it shall be treated as a distribution of estate assets pursuant to applicable state receivership law dealing with early access disbursements. H.

For the pur pose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the Association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such time and for any amounts as the board finds necessary. Assessments shall be due not less than 30 days after prior written notice has been given to the member insurers. Late payments shall accrue interest from the due date compounded quarterly, based upon the average 90-day treasury bill rate for the most recently comple ted calendar quarter as published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin and shall be subject to a minimum charge of $50. B. There shall be two classes of assessments, as follows: 1. Class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative and legal costs and other expenses. Class A assessments may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer. 2. Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the Association under § 38.2-1704 with regard to an impaired or an i nsolvent insurer. C. 1. The amount of any Class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be aut horized and called for current member insurers on a pro rata or non-pro rata basis. If pro rata, the board may provide that it be credited against future Class B assessments. The amount of a Class B assessment, except for assessments related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated for assessment purposes between the accounts and among the subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account, pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or inso lvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances. The amount of the Class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer shall be a llocated according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and approved by the Commission. The methodology shall provide for 50 percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and sickness member insurers and 50 percent to be allocated t o life and annuity member insurers. 2. In determining the shares that shall be allocated to the life insurance and annuity account pursuant to the methodology in subdivision C 1, the guaranty association shall use the follo wing formula: =(0.50 - Life and annuity member insurers share of Accident and Sickness Account) / (Life and annuity member insurers share of Life Insurance and Annuity Account - Life and annuity member insurers share of Accident and Sickness Account). 3. For the purposes of the methodology in subdivision C 1 and the formula in subdivision C 2 only, life and annuity member insurer means a member insurer for which (i) the sum of its assessable life insurance premiums and annuity premiums is greater than or equal to (ii) its assessable accident and sickness insurance premiums, which shall include its assessable health maintenance organization premiums but shall exclude its assess able premiums written for disability income and long-term care insurance. For purposes of this definition, assessable premiums shall be measured within the state. An accident and sickness member insurer means any member insurer not defined as a life and annuity member insurer. 4. Class B assessments against member insurers for each account and subaccount shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in the Commonwealth by each assessed membe r insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account and subaccount for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became insolvent or, in the case of an assessment with re spect to an impaired insurer, the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became impaired, bear to such premiums received on business in the Commonwealth for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers. 5. Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the Association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer shall not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the pu rposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under subsection B and computation of assessments under this subsection shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The Associ ation shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within 180 days after the assessment is authorized. D. The Associa tion may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessmen t against a member insurer is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this secti on. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the Association. E. 1. a. Subject to the provisions of subdivision E 1 b, the total of all assessments auth orized by the Association with respect to a member insurer for each subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account and for the accident and sickness account shall not in any one calendar year exceed two percent of that member insurers average a nnual premiums received in the Commonwealth on the policies and contracts covered by the subaccount or account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer. b. If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual pr emiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation referenced in subdivision E 1 a shall be equal and limited to the higher of the three-year average annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated pursuant to th is section. c. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the Association in an account, does not provide in one year in that account an amount sufficient to carry out the resp onsibilities of the Association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter. 2. The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment wi ll be insufficient to cover anticipated claims. 3. If the maximum assessment for a subaccount of the life and annuity account in one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the Association, then pursuant to subdivision C 2, the board shall access the other subaccounts of the life and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum stated in subdivision E 1. F. If the Boar d of Directors of the Association determines that it has surplus funds on hand with respect to an insolvency, the Association shall, in accordance with the process set forth in the certificate of contribution for adjusting or cancelling the unamortized p ortion of the member insurers certificate of contribution in the event of a reimbursement of assessment payments, use such surplus funds to reimburse member insurers for assessment costs not otherwise amortized and offset pursuant to § 38.2-1709 a nd pay the remaining surplus to the Department of Taxation, for deposit with the State Treasurer for credit to the general fund of the Commonwealth. Within 90 days of making payment of surplus funds to the Department of Taxation for deposit with the Stat e Treasurer, the Association shall notify its member insurers of such payment. If any member insurer contends that it is entitled to any portion of the surplus refunded to the Commonwealth in order to recover assessment costs not otherwise amortized and offset pursuant to § 38.2-1709, then the member insurer may present evidence of such entitlement to the Department of Taxation. If the Department of Taxation determines that the member insurer is entitled to a portion of the surplus funds in order to recover assessment costs not otherwise amortized and offset pursuant to § 38.2-1709, then the State Treasurer shall pay to the member insurer the sum that the Department of Taxation determines that the member insurer is entitled to receive. A reasonab le amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the Association and for future losses and claims. For purposes of this subsection, surplus funds includes funds that the Association obtains by way of distri butions or recoveries from receivers and third parties as reimbursement for its costs in connection with insolvencies and impairments in excess of reasonable amounts retained in an account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the Association a nd for future losses and claims. G. It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance or health maintenance organization business within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter. H. The Associa tion shall issue to each member insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than a Class A assessment, a certificate o...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_38.2-1706"><akn:num>§ 38.2-1706</akn:num><akn:heading>Plan of operation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. 1. The Associations plan of operation approved under former § 38.1-482.24 shall remain in effect until modified in accordance with this subsection. The Association shall from time to time submit to the Commission any amendments to the plan of operation necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administratio n of the Association. Any amendments to the plan of operation shall become effective upon the Commissions written approval or unless they have not been disapproved within 60 days. 2. If at any time the Association fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the Commission shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate such reasonable rules as are necess ary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this chapter. The rules shall continue in force until modified by the Commission or superseded by an amended plan submitted by the Association and approved by the Commission. B. All member insurers shall comply with the plan of operation. C. The plan of operation shall, in addition to requirements enumerated elsewhere in this chapter: 1. Estab lish procedures for handling assets of the Association; 2. Establish the amount and method of reimbursing members of the board of directors under § 38.2-1703; 3. Establish regular places and times for meetings, including telephone conference calls, of the board of directors; 4.

Establish a plan for equitable distribution of refunds to member insurers; 8. Contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the Association; 9. Establish procedures whereby a director may be removed for cause, including in the case where a member insurer director becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer; and 10. Require the board of directors to establish a policy and procedures for addressing conflicts of interests. D. The plan of operation may provide that any or all powers and duties of the Association, except those under subdivision L 3 of § 38.2-1704 and § 38.2-1705, are delegated to a corporation, association, or other organization that performs or will perform functio ns similar to those of this Association, or its equivalent, in two or more states. Such a corporation, association, or organization shall be reimbursed for any payments made on behalf of the Association and shall be paid for its performance of any functi on of the Association. A delegation under this subsection shall take effect only with the approval of both the board of directors and the Commission, and may be made only to a corporation, association, or organization that extends protection not substant ially less favorable and effective than that provided by this chapter.

In this determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policy owners, contract owners, certificate holders, and enr ollees of the continuing or successor member insurer. 2. No distribution to any stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the Association with interest thereo n for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under § 38.2-1704 with respect to the member insurer have been fully recovered by the Association.

No such distribution shall be recoverable if the member insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the member insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. 3. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions received.

D uiser, 8 Bankr. 397, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 5185 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). Applicability.  This section was drafted to apply to the debtor-creditor relationship of insurance company and agent and not to the debtor-creditor relationship of an insurance f inance company and an insurance agent. National Agents Serv. Co. v. Duiser, 8 Bankr. 397, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 5185 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). Insureds, or their assignees, can appoint agents to receive return premiums on their beh alf. Agency Servs. v. Canal Ins. Co., 943 F. Supp. 592, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21055 (E.D. Va. 1993). In order to prove embezzlement, existence of a formal fiduciary relationship is not necessary. Rather, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant was entrusted with the property of another. In this case, victim entrusted defendant as his insurance agent, with $1,400 to pay over to insurance company. The court found irrespective o f this section that these facts established the required entrustment to sustain defendants conviction. Chiang v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 13, 365 S.E.2d 778, 4 Va.

CASE NOTES Purpose.  Predecessor statute was designed to compel a faithful discharge of that duty which an agent owes to his principal. Commonwealth v. Sharp, 155 Va. 714, 156 S.E. 57 0, 1931 Va. LEXIS 263 (1931); National Sur. Co. v. Page, 59 F.2d 370, 1932 U.S. App. LEXIS 3366 (4th Cir. 1932). Meaning of misappropriate.  In predecessor statute providing for the revocation of a certificate of an insurance agent, the use of the word misappropriate was general in its scope. I ts meaning was not limited to that appropriation of money which approaches the crime of embezzlement but extended to a willful withholding of money due by the agent to his principal. Commonwealth v. Sharp, 155 Va. 714, 156 S.E. 570, 1931 Va. LEXIS 263 (1 931). The contention of complainant was that a trust relationship existed between plaintiff and defendant, and when it appeared that defendant had written a policy of i nsurance and by reason thereof had become indebted to the insurer and failed to account for the premium, he then and there was technically guilty of misappropriation of funds. It was held that the predecessor statute contemplated more than a mere failure to pay money due by the insurance agent. Commonwealth v. Sharp, 155 Va. 714, 156 S.E. 570, 1931 Va. LEXIS 263 (1931).

If the Comm ission believes that any applicant for a license is not of good character or does not have a good reputation for honesty, it may refuse to issue the license, subject to the right of the applicant to demand a hearing on the application. Except as provided in § 38.2-1042, the Commission shall not revoke or suspend an existing license until the licensee is given an opportunity to be heard before the Commission. If the Commission refuses to issue a new license or proposes to revoke or suspend an existing license, it shall give the applicant or licensee at least ten calendar days notice in writing of the time and place of the hearing if a hearing is requested. The notice shall contain a statement of the objections to the issuance of the license, or t he reason for its proposed revocation or suspension, as the case may be. The notice may be given to the applicant or licensee by registered or certified mail, sent to the last known address of record pursuant to § 38.2-1826, or the last known business address if the address of record is incorrect, or in any other lawful manner the Commission prescribes. The Commission may summon witnesses to testify with respect to the applicant or licensee, and the applicant or licensee may introduce evidence in his or its behalf. No applicant to whom a license is refused after a hearing, nor any licensee whose license is revoked, shall again apply for a license until after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of the Commissions order, or such other period of time as the Commission prescribes in its order. B. The license of a business entity may be suspended, revoked or refused if the Commission finds, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, that a violation by an individual licensee acting at the direction of, on behalf of, or with the permission of the business e ntity was known to be a violation by one or more of the partners, officers or managers acting on behalf of the business entity, and the violation was neither reported to the Commission nor corrective action taken. C. In addition to or in lieu of any applicable denial, suspension or revocation of a license, a person may, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, be subject to a penalty pursuant to § 38.2-218. D. The Commiss ion shall retain the authority to enforce the provisions of and impose any penalty or remedy authorized by this title against any person who is under investigation for or charged with a violation of this title, even if the persons license or registra tion has been surrendered, terminated, suspended, revoked, or has lapsed by operation of law.

National Sur. Co. v. Page, 58 F.2d 145, 1932 U.S. App. LEXIS 4659 (4th Cir. 1932) (decided under prior law). Probable cause.  An agent who refuses to pay over premiums which he has collected for his principal, and as to which there is no dispute, except upon condition that the principal accept the undisputed amount as payment in full and release the agent from a liability which is disputed, is certainly not discharging faithfully the duty which he owes his principal; and a proceeding to have his license revoked because of such breach of duty cannot be said to be without probable cause. National Sur. Co. v. Page, 59 F.2d 370, 1932 U.S. App. LEXIS 3366 (4th Cir. 1932) (decided under prior law). Sufficient evi dence to support order of Commission.  On an appeal from an order of the State Corporation Commission revoking the certificate of registration of an insurance agent because of conduct alleged to violat e the obligations imposed by a predecessor statute, the order was affirmed where there was sufficient evidence to support it.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Surety bail bondsman.  A surety bail bondsman who executes a secured bail bond as a disclosed agent-in-fact for the stated corporate surety is not personally liable to the Commonwealth when the criminal defendant absconds, and the bond is forfeited. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable James S. Mathews, Judge, Norfolk General District Court, 09-025, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 28 (6/1/09). A surety bail bondsman serves only as an agent-in-fact for the surety company and binds the surety company to bail bonds executed on behalf of the surety company, thus a surety bail bondsman operating within the bounds of his authority cannot be held personally liable to the Commonwealth for forfeited bonds when a defendant fails to comply with a condition of the bond.

Provide rates that are responsive to competitive market conditions and improve the availability of insurance in this Commonwealth; and 6. Regulate the business of insurance in a manner that will preclude application of federal antitrust laws. History History. 1973, c. 504, § 38.1-279.29; 1986, c. 562. Annotations Law Review.

Rates for t he classes of insurance to which this chapter applies shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. All rates and all changes and amendments to rates to which this chapter applies for use in this Commonwealth shall consider loss experie nce and other factors within Virginia if relevant and actuarially sound, provided that other data, including countrywide, regional, or other state data, may be considered where such data is relevant and where a sound actuarial basis exists for considerin g data other than Virginia-specific data. 1. No ra te shall be held to be excessive unless it is unreasonably high for the insurance provided and a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the area with respect to the classification to which the rate applies. 2. No rate shall be held inadequate unless it is unreasonably low for the insurance provided and (i) continued use of it would endanger solvency of the insurer or (ii) use of the rate by the insurer has or, if continued, will have the effect of destroying competition or creating a monopoly. 3. No rate shall be unfairly discriminatory if a different rate is charged for the same coverage and the rate differential (i) is based on sound actuarial principles or (ii) is related to actual or reasonably anticipated experience. B. 1. In determining whether rates comply with the standards of subsection A, separate con sideration shall be given to (i) past and prospective loss experience within and outside this Commonwealth, (ii) conflagration or catastrophe hazards, (iii) a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, (iv) dividends, savings or unabsor bed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers, (v) past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specifically applicable to this Commonwealth, (vi) the loss reserving practices, standards a nd procedures utilized by the insurer, (vii) investment income earned or realized by insurers from their unearned premium and loss reserve and the Commission may give separate consideration to investment income earned on surplus funds, and (viii) all oth er relevant factors within and outside this Commonwealth. When actual experience or data does not exist, the Commission may consider estimates. 2. In the case of fire insurance rates, consideration shall be given to the experience of the fire insurance business during a period of not less than the most recent five-year period for which such experience is available. 3. In the case of workers compensation insurance rates for volunteer firefighters or volunteer emergency medical services personnel, the rates shall be calculated based upon the combi ned experience of both volunteer firefighters or volunteer emergency medical services personnel and paid firefighters or paid emergency medical services personnel, so that the resulting rate is the same for both volunteer and paid members, but in no even t shall resulting premiums be less than $40 per year for any volunteer firefighter or volunteer emergency medical services personnel. 4. In the case of uninsured motorist coverage required by subsection A of § 38.2-2206, consideration shall be given to all sums distributed by the Commission from the Uninsured Motoris ts Fund in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 30 (§ 38.2-3000 et seq.). C. For the cla sses of insurance to which this chapter applies, including insurance against contingent, consequential and indirect losses as defined in § 38.2-133 (i) the systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer or group for any class of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination of insurance for which separate expense provisions are applicable, and (ii) risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans that esta blish standards for measuring variations in hazards, expense provisions, or both. The standards may measure any difference between risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of th is subsection, except as permitted by § 38.2-1908, each member of a rate service organization shall use the uniform classification system, uniform experience rating plan, and uniform statistical plan of its designated rate service organization in the provision of insurance defined in § 38.2-119. D. No insurer shall use any information pertaining to any motor vehicle conviction or accident to produce increased or surcharged rates above their filed manual rates for individual risks for a period longer than 36 months. This period shall begin no later than 12 mon ths after the date of the conviction or accident. E. Each author ized insurer subject to the provisions of this chapter may file with the Commission an expense reduction plan that permits variations in expense provisions. Such filing may contain provisions permitting agents to reduce their commission resulting in an a ppropriate reduction in premium. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require an agent to reduce a commission, nor may an insurer unreasonably refuse to reduce a premium due to a commission reduction as permitted by its filed expense reduction p lan.

No insurer may increase its insureds premium or may charge points under a safe driver insurance plan to its insured as a result of a motor vehicle accident unless the accident was caused either wholly or partially by the named insured, a resident of the same ho usehold, or other customary operator. No insurer may increase its insureds premium or may charge points to its insured where the operator causing the accident is a principal operator insured under a separate policy. Any insurer increasing a premium o r charging points as a result of a motor vehicle accident shall notify the named insured in writing and in the same notification shall inform the named insured that he may appeal the decision of the insurer to the Commissioner if he feels his premium has increased or he has been charged points as a result of a motor vehicle accident without just cause. Such notice shall include the requirements that the appeal be in writing and made within 60 days of receipt of the notice of any premium increase adjustm ent or of any point charge resulting from a motor vehicle accident. B. An appeal o f a premium increase or of a point charge by the named insured shall be requested in writing within sixty days of receipt of the notice of any premium adjustment or of any point charge resulting from a motor vehicle accident. Upon receipt of the request, the Commissioner shall promptly initiate a review to determine whether the premium increase or the point charge is justified. The premium increase or the point charge shall remain in full force and effect until the Commissioner rules that the premium be adjusted or the point charge be removed because it is not justified, or because the point charge was not assigned in accord with the insurers filed rating plan, and so notifies the insurer and the insured. Upon receipt of the ruling, the insurer sha ll promptly refund any premiums paid as a direct result of the premium increase or the point charge, and shall adjust future billings to reflect the Commissioners ruling. C. No insurer shall assign points under a safe-driver insurance policy to any vehicle other than the vehicle customarily driven by the operator responsible for incurring points. D. If an insur ed is a law-enforcement officer, as defined in § 9.1-101, no insurer may increase such insureds personal insurance premium or may charge points under a safe driver insurance plan to such insured as a result of an accident which occurred in the cou rse of the insureds employment as a law-enforcement officer while the insured was driving a motor vehicle provided by the employing law-enforcement agency and was engaged in a law-enforcement activity at the time of such accident.

B. Each rate s ervice organization licensed under § 38.2-1914 that has been designated by an insurer for the filing of prospective loss costs or supplementary rate information under § 38.2-1908 shall file with the Commission all prospective loss costs or suppleme ntary rate information and all changes and amendments to the prospective loss costs or supplementary rate information made by it for use in the Commonwealth on or before the date they become effective.

Such limitation shall apply for the period of time specified in the insurers filing. Nothing shall prohibit such limitation from applying to policies (a) acquired by an insurer from another insurer pursuant to a written agreement of acquisition, merger, or sale that transfers all or part of the other insurers book of business or (b) transferred by an agent from one insurer to another insurer pursuant to an agent book of transfer.

CASE NOTES Federal district court lacks jurisdiction to change rates set by Commission.  Under subsection B, an insurer must charge the rates set by the State Corporation Commission (SCC). For a federal district court to award plaintiffs any relief, i t must, in effect, rule that the insurer cannot charge the rates set by the SCC. Such a ruling would conflict with the mandate of subsection B and would amount to a judicial rollback of the insurers rates. Only the SCC or the Virginia Supreme Court i s empowered to take such action. Gahres v. Phico Ins. Co., 672 F. Supp. 249, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10858 (E.D. Va. 1987). § 38.2-1906.1. Misquote of premium. Text Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if an insurer or its agent provides a written quotation for insurance to an insured or applicant for insurance and the rate filing in effect for the insurer results in a premium increase of ten percent or more over the quoted premium, the insured or applicant may, within fifteen days of written notification of the increase by the insurer or its agent, request cancell ation of the contract or policy. The insurer shall, upon receipt of such request, cancel the contract or policy calculating the earned premium pro rata using the premium originally quoted by the insurer or its agent. Nothing in this section shall apply to any increase in premium which is the result of incorrect information furnished by the insured or applicant or information omitted by the insured or applicant.

An insurer shall establish rates and supplementary rate information for any market segment based on the factors in § 38.2-1904. A rate service organization shall establish prospective loss costs and supplementary rate information for any market segment based on the factors in § 38.2-1904. An insurer may use supplementary rate information prepared by a rate service organization and may use prospective loss costs determined by the rate service organization with modification for its own expense and profit. Th e insurer may modify the prospective loss costs based on its own loss experience as the credibility of that loss experience allows. B. An insurer may discharge its obligation to file supplementary rate information under subsection A of § 38.2-1906 by giving notice to the Commission that it uses supplementary rate information prepared and filed with the Commission by a designated rate service or ganization of which it is a member, subscriber, or service purchaser. The Commission may by order require an insurer to provide information in addition to that filed by the rate service organization. The insurers supplementary rate information shall be that filed from time to time by the rate service organization, including any amendments to the supplementary rate information, subject to modifications filed by the insurer. C. Every insur er shall adhere to the uniform classification system, uniform experience rating plan, and uniform statistical plan approved by the Commission in the provision of insurance defined in § 38.2-119. An insurer may develop subclassifications of the unifor m classification system upon which rates for insurance defined in § 38.2-119 may be made; however, such subclassification must first be filed with and approved by the Commission. An insurer filing such subclassifications must certify to the Commissio n that the data it produces can be reported in a manner consistent with the uniform statistical plan and uniform classification system of its designated rate service organization.

If the Comm ission finds, after providing notice and opportunity to be heard, that a rate is not in compliance with § 38.2-1904, or is in violation of § 38.2-1916, the Commission shall order that use of the rate be discontinued for any policy issued or renewed after a date specified in the order. The order may provide for rate modifications. The order may also provide for refund of the excessive portion of premiums collected (i) during a period not exceeding one year prior to the date of any request or motion for review made pursuant to § 38.2-1909 and (ii) during all periods subsequent to any such request or motion until the date of the order. If a refund is ordered, the order may provide for the payment of interest thereon at a rate set by the Commissio n. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, the order shall be issued within thirty days after the close of the hearing or within another reasonable time extension fixed by the Commission. B. Pending a h earing, the Commission may order the suspension prospectively of a rate filed by an insurer and reimpose the last previous rate in effect if the Commission has reasonable cause to believe that: (i) a reasonable degree of competition does not exist in the area with respect to the classification to which the rate applies, (ii) the filed rate will have the effect of destroying competition or creating a monopoly, (iii) use of the rate will endanger the solvency of the insurer, or (iv) Virginia loss experien ce and other factors specifically applicable to the Commonwealth have not been properly used to determine the rates. If the Commission suspends a rate under this provision, it shall hold a hearing within fifteen business days after issuing the order susp ending the rate unless the right to a hearing is waived by the insurer. In addition, the Commission shall make its determination and issue its order as to whether the rate shall be disapproved within fifteen business days after the close of the hearing. C. At any hear ing held under the provisions of subsection A or B of this section, the insurer shall have the burden of justifying the rate in question. All determinations of the Commission shall be on the basis of findings of fact and conclusions of law. If the Commis sion disapproves a rate, the disapproval shall take effect not less than fifteen days after its order and the last previous rate in effect for the insurer shall be reimposed for a period of one year unless the Commission approves a substitute or interim rate under the provisions of subsection D or E of this section. D. For one yea r after the effective date of a disapproval order, no rate promulgated to replace a rate disapproved under the order may be used until it has been filed with the Commission and not disapproved within sixty days after filing. E. Whenever an insurer has no legally effective rates as a result of the Commissions disapproval of rates or other act, the Commission shall, on the insurers request, specify interim rates for the insurer that are high enough to protect the interests of all pa rties. The Commission may order that a specified portion of the premiums be placed in an escrow account approved by it. When new rates become legally effective, the Commission shall order the escrowed funds or any overcharge in the interim rates to be d istributed appropriately, except that refunds to policyholders that are de minimis shall not be required.

Text A. Whenever an y professional employer organization enters into an agreement with a client company to provide professional employer services, the experience rating of the professional employer organization shall be used for voluntary market workers compensation ins urance premium computation purposes with respect to such coemployees. In the event that the agreement between a client company and a professional employer organization is terminated, the coemployees shall become solely the employees of the former client company. If the coemployees have been covered as employees of the professional employer organization under a voluntary market workers compensation insurance policy for a period of three consecutive years or more, the workers compensation insuranc e premium applicable to the policy of the former client company shall be based upon the rating of the professional employer organization until the former client employer has developed sufficient experience to be rated on its own or no longer qualifies fo r experience rating. If the coemployees have been covered as employees of the professional employer organization for a period of less than three consecutive years, the workers compensation insurance premium applicable to the policy of the former clie nt company shall be based upon the experience of the former client company which reflects its experience during the experience period specified by the approved experience rating plan, including, if available, experience incurred for coemployees under the professional employer services agreement. B. Insurers ma y conduct periodic audits of any professional employer organization, including payrolls, operations and records as related to individual client company operations in order to ensure that the appropriate premium is charged for workers compensation ins urance coverage. Such audits may include audits of the client company in order to verify payroll, losses and classifications, and inspections of the premises where the coemployees work. C. A professio nal employer organization may aggregate its coemployees under a single employer plan for the purpose of providing employee benefits provided that the professional employer organization meets the regulatory licensure and filing requirements promulgated by the Commission for fully insured multiple employer welfare arrangements. The following information required to be filed shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to the public: (i) all information related to the names and addresses of employers p articipating in the plan and (ii) all information pertaining to the adequacy of the plans level of reserves and contributions; however, nothing herein shall (i) prevent the Commission from using such information in any regulatory proceeding or (ii) b e interpreted to prohibit or limit the production of documents containing such information from the professional employer organization pursuant to an otherwise lawful subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Any accountant or actuary selected shall be subj ect to standards respecting conflicts of interest used by the Commission. Any audit or evaluation under this subsection shall be subject to subsections H through O of this section, so far as appropriate. 2.

F. [Reserved.] G. An examinat ion may cover comprehensively all aspects of the examinees affairs and condition. The Commission shall determine the exact nature and scope of each examination, and in doing so shall take into account all relevant factors, including but not limited t o (i) the length of time the examinee has been operating, (ii) the length of time it has been licensed in this Commonwealth, (iii) the nature of the services provided, (iv) the nature of the accounting records available and (v) the nature of examinations performed elsewhere. H. For each ex amination under this section, the Commission shall issue an order stating the scope of the examination and designating the examiner in charge. On demand a copy of the order shall be exhibited to the examinee. I. Any examine r authorized by the Commission shall, so far as necessary for the purposes of the examination, have access at all reasonable hours to the premises and to any books, records, files, securities, documents or property of the examinee and to those of persons under subsection B of this section so far as they relate to the affairs of the examinee. J. The officer s, employees and agents of the examinee and of persons under subsection B of this section shall comply with every reasonable request of the examiners for assistance in any matter relating to the examination. No person shall obstruct or interfere with the examination in any way other than by legal process. K.

L. The examine r in charge of an examination shall make a proposed report of the examination that shall include the information and analysis as is ordered in subsection H of this section, together with the examiners recommendations. At the discretion of the examine r in charge, preparation of the proposed report may include conferences with the examinee or its representatives. The proposed report shall remain confidential until filed under subsection M of this section. M. The Commiss ion shall serve a copy of the proposed report upon the examinee. Within twenty days after service, the examinee may serve upon the Commission a written demand for a hearing on the contents of the report. If a hearing is demanded the Commission shall give notice and hold a hearing, and on demand by the examinee the hearing shall be informal and private. The Commission shall adopt the report with any necessary modifications and file it for public inspection, or it may order a new examination within either (i) sixty days after the hearing or (ii) if no hearing is demanded, sixty days after the last day on which the examinee might have demanded a hearing.

Q. In any proc eeding by or against the examinee or any officer or agent of the examinee, the examination report as adopted by the Commission shall be admissible as evidence of the facts stated in the examination report. In any proceeding by or against the examinee the facts asserted in any report properly admitted in evidence shall be presumed to be true in the absence of contrary evidence. R. The reasona ble costs of an examination under this section shall be paid by the examinee except as provided in subsection U of this section.

The Commiss ion may require any examinee, before or during an examination, to deposit with the State Treasurer any deposits the Commission considers necessary to pay the cost of the examination. Any deposit and any payment made under subsections R and S of this sect ion shall be credited to the special fund of the Bureau of Insurance. U. On the exam inees request or on its own motion, the Commission may pay all or part of the costs of an examination whenever it finds that, because of the frequency of examinations or other factors, imposition of the costs would place an unreasonable burden on the examinee. The Commission shall include in its annual report information about any instance in which it applied this subsection. V. Deposits an d payments under subsections R through U of this section shall not be considered to be a tax or license fee within the meaning of any law. If any other state charges a per diem fee for examination of examinees domiciled in this Commonwealth, any examinee domiciled in that other state shall pay the same fee when examined by the Commission.

Each insure r writing in this Commonwealth a class of insurance to which this chapter applies shall file with the Commission every manual of classifications, minimum rate, class rate, rating schedule, rating plan, rating rule, and every modification of any of the fo regoing that it proposes to use. Every filing shall indicate the character and extent of coverage contemplated. When a filing is not accompanied by the information upon which the insurer supports the filing, and the Commission does not have sufficient in formation to determine whether the filing meets the requirements of this chapter, the Commission may require the insurer to furnish the information upon which it supports the filing. A filing and any supporting information shall be a public record. Upon filing any rate to which this chapter is applicable, the insurer shall give notice to the Division of Consumer Counsel of the Office of the Attorney General that such rate has been filed with the Commission and such insurer shall so certify to the Commis sion in its rate filing. For the purposes of this section, a group or fleet of insurers operating under the same general management may be considered an insurer. B. Each insure r shall submit with each rate filing so much of the following information as deemed appropriate by the Commission: 1. Numbe r of exposures; 2. Direct premiums written; 3. Direct premiums earned; 4. Direct losses paid identified by such period as the Commission may require; 5. Number of claims paid; 6. Direct losses incurred during the year, direct losses incurred during the year which occurred and were paid during the year, and direct losses incurred during the year which were repor ted during the year but were not yet paid; 7. Any loss development factor used and supporting data thereon; 8. Number of claims unpaid; 9. Loss adjustment expenses paid identified by such period as the Commission may require; 10. Loss adjustment expenses incurred during the year, loss adjustment expenses incurred during the year for losses which occurred and were paid during the year, and loss adjustment exp enses incurred during the year for losses which were reported during the year but were not yet paid; 11. Other expenses incurred, separately by category of expense, excluding loss adjustment expenses; 12. Investment income on assets related to reserve and allocated surplus accounts; 13. Total return on allocated surplus; 14. Any loss trend factor used and supporting data thereon; 15. Any expense trend factor used and supporting data thereon; and 16. Such other information as may be required by rule of the Commission, including statewide rate information presented separately for Virginia and each state wherein the insurer writes the line, subline or rating classification for which the rate filing is made and which the Commission deems necessary for its consideration. C. Where actua l experience does not exist or is not credible, the Commission may allow the use of estimates for the information required by subdivisions 1 through 15 of subsection B of this section and may require the insurer to submit such information as the Commissi on deems necessary to support such estimates. D. The Commiss ion shall develop uniform statements or formats specifying the information categories specified in this section. Such statements or formats shall be utilized by all insurers in all rate filings. E. In determin ing the appropriateness of rates for credit involuntary unemployment insurance and credit property insurance, the Commission may not approve any rate that is calculated based upon loss experience producing a loss ratio of less than forty percent on and a fter January 1, 2001, forty-five percent on and after January 1, 2003, and fifty percent on and after January 1, 2005. For the purposes of this subsection, loss experience includes: paid losses, paid loss adjustment expense, any change in case reserves, change in incurred but not reported losses, and any special considerations for catastrophe or comprehensive coverage.

Rates for t he classes of insurance to which this chapter applies shall not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. All rates and all changes and amendments to rates to which this chapter applies for use in this Commonwealth shall consider loss experie nce and other factors within Virginia if relevant and actuarially sound; however, other data, including countrywide, regional or other state data, may be considered where such data is relevant and where a sound actuarial basis exists for considering data other than Virginia-specific data. B. 1. In making rates for the classes of insurance to which this chapter applies, separate consideration shall be given to (i) past and prospective loss experience within and outside this Commonwealth, (ii) conflagration or catastrophe hazards, (iii) a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, (iv) dividends, savings or una bsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers, (v) past and prospective expenses both countrywide and those specifically applicable to this Commonwealth, (vi) investment income earned or realized by insurers from their unearned premium and loss reserve and the Commission may give separate consideration to investment income earned on surplus funds, (vii) the loss reserving practices, standards and procedures utilized by the insurer, and (viii) all other relevant factors within and outside this Commonwealth. When actual experience or data does not exist, the Commission may consider estimates. 2. In the case of fire insurance rates, consideration shall be given to the experience of the fire insurance business during a period of not less than the most recent five-year period for which such experience is available. 3. [Repealed.]In the case of workers compensation insurance rates for volunteer firefighters or volunteer emergency medical services personnel written through the Virginia Workers Compensation Insurance Plan, the rates shall be calculated based upon the combined experience of both volunteer firefighters or volunteer emergency medical services personnel and paid firefighters or paid emergency medical services personnel, so that th e resulting rate is the same for both volunteer and paid members, but in no event shall resulting premiums be less than $40 per year for any volunteer firefighter or volunteer emergency medical services personnel. C. For the cla sses of insurance to which this chapter applies (i) the systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the opera ting methods of any such insurer or group for any class of insurance, or for any subdivision or combination of insurance for which separate expense provisions apply, and (ii) risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and mini mum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans that establish standards for measuring variations in hazards, expense provisions, or both. The standards may measure any difference a mong risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses. D. All rates, rating schedules or rating plans and every manual of classifications, rules and rates, including every modification thereof, approved by the Commission under this chapter, shall be used until a change is approved by the Commission.

CASE NOTES Duty of Commission.  The Commission has not only the duty to protect the insurance-purchasing public against excessive or unfairly discriminatory rates, but also the duty to protect t he policyholders, and investors in the insurance business, against inadequate rates. American Druggists' Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 275, 110 S.E.2d 509, 1959 Va. LEXIS 222 (1959). Uniformity of rates and classifica tion.  There is no express statutory requirement for uniformity of rates or classification. Moreover, the very process of permitting deviations authorized under former § 38.1-258 contemplated that there might be differences of classifications within the limitations therein specified. But the fact that the Bureau was required to make certain filings (former § 38.1-226) that they were deemed to be filed on behalf o f all of its members (former § 38.1-232), and that all members had to except for permitted deviations adhere to such filings (former § 38.1-258), contemplated that generally speaking the classifications would be uniform. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Common wealth, 199 Va. 434, 100 S.E.2d 31, 1957 Va. LEXIS 208 (1957). The establishment of a base in rate making is inextricably related to the fixing of the rate. Virginia Mfrs. Ass'n v. Workmen's Comp. Inspection Rating Bureau, 205 Va. 535, 138 S.E.2d 12, 1964 Va. LEXIS 214 (1964). The manual rates apply equally to stock and mutual companies. There is not one manual ra te for stock companies and a lower manual rate for mutual companies on the theory that mutual companies do not need to make profits. Harford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 491, 112 S.E.2d 142, 1960 Va. LEXIS 120 (1960). Rates must be neither too high nor too low.  The statutory requirement for fixing rates is that they must not be too high nor too low. It is extremely important that they be high enough to keep the companies solvent. American Druggists' Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 275, 110 S.E.2d 509, 1959 Va. LEXIS 222 (1959). Uniform rates for all companies are based on the statistics applicable to all companies as a group, and not on the experience of some one company. American Druggists' Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 275, 110 S.E.2d 509, 1959 Va. LEXIS 222 (1959). The formula for establishing fire insurance rates which the Commission has used to deter mine whether fire insurance rates are excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, gives consideration to the elements which this section says shall be considered in making and establishing insurance rates. American Druggists' Ins. Co. v. Commonweal th, 201 Va. 275, 110 S.E.2d 509, 1959 Va. LEXIS 222 (1959). Purpose of premium.  A premium is designed to pay casualty losses and to provide for operating expenses and underwriting profit. Virginia State AFL-CIO v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 776, 1 67 S.E.2d 322, 1969 Va. LEXIS 177 (1969). Premium income does not become stockholders profit by the mere passage of time, with out any charge for the payment of casualty losses. Virginia State AFL-CIO v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 776, 167 S.E.2d 322, 1969 Va. LEXIS 177 (1969). Subdivision B 1 requires the production of data reflecting Virginia acquisition expenses. Without such data the Commission cannot know whether Virginia expenses are lower than the national average, necessitating a compensating adjustment in Virginia rates to prevent Virginia motorists from paying in part for policies written in other states . Virginia State AFL-CIO v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 776, 167 S.E.2d 322, 1969 Va. LEXIS 177 (1969). Unde rwriting profit excludes all investment income.  Since underwriting profit is usually defined as the sum arrived at by deducting from earned premiums all incurred losses and incurred expenses, th at term excludes all investment income. Virginia State AFL-CIO v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 776, 167 S.E.2d 322, 1969 Va. LEXIS 177 (1969). Income derived from investment of the unearned premium reserve is a relevant factor  in fixing rates. Virginia State AFL-CIO v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 776, 167 S.E.2d 322, 1969 Va. LEXIS 177 (1969). Income derived from the investment of the loss reserve, as well as the unearned premium reserve, should be considered in fixing rates for fire insurance coverage. Virginia State AFL-CIO v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 776, 167 S.E.2d 322, 1969 Va. LEXIS 177 (1969). Loss reserve.  The loss reserve represents the part of the premiums paid by the policyholders that, it is expected, will be devoted to the payment of losses. So premiums paid by policyholders, rather than assets contributed by stockholders, go into the loss reserve. Virginia State AFL-CIO v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 776, 167 S.E.2d 322, 1969 Va. LEXIS 177 (1969). Judicial review.  In reviewing the action of the Commission in fixing insurance rates, the Supreme Court will not disturb its action unless it appears that it has exceeded its auth ority, or has acted unreasonably in exercising its authority, or that it has made a mistake of law, or that its finding is contrary to the evidence or without evidence to support it, or that it is fixed so low as to amount to confiscation.

Principle of estoppel not abrogated.  Section 38.2-2100 et seq. have not abrogated the principle of estoppel, where before the issuance of the policy the insurance company, or its agent, has knowledge of facts which under the express terms of the policy render it void or unenforceable from its inception.

Failu re to pay the premium when due; 2. Conviction of a crime arising out of acts increasing the probability that a peril insured against will occur; 3. Discovery of fraud or material misrepresentation; 4. Willful or reckless acts or omissions increasing the probability that a peril insured against will occur as determined from a physical inspection of the insured premises; 5.

Nothing in this section authorizes the Commissioner to substitute his judgment as to underwriting for that of the insurer. E. Nothing in this section shall apply: 1. To an y policy written to insure owner-occupied dwellings that has been in effect for less than 90 days when the notice of termination is mailed or delivered to the insured, unless it is a renewal policy; 2. If the insurer or its agent acting on behalf of the insurer has manifested its willingness to renew by issuing or offering to issue a renewal policy, certificate or other evidence of r enewal, or has otherwise manifested its willingness to renew in writing to the insured. The written manifestation shall include the name of a proposed insurer, the expiration date of the policy, the type of insurance coverage, and information regarding t he estimated renewal premium; 3. If the named insured or his duly constituted attorney-in-fact has notified the insurer or its agent orally, or in writing, if the insurer requires such notification to be in writing, t hat he wishes the policy to be canceled, or that he does not wish the policy to be renewed, or if, prior to the date of expiration, he fails to accept the offer of the insurer to renew the policy; 4. To any contract or policy written through the Virginia Property Insurance Association or any residual market facility established pursuant to Chapter 27 (§ 38.2-2700 et seq.); or 5. If an affiliated insurer has manifested its willingness to provide coverage at a lower premium than would have been charged for the same exposures on the expiring policy. The affiliate d insurer shall manifest its willingness to provide coverage by issuing a policy with the types and limits of coverage at least equal to those contained in the expiring policy unless the named insured has requested a change in coverage or limits. When su ch offer is made by an affiliated insurer, an offer of renewal shall not be required of the insurer of the expiring policy, and the policy issued by the affiliated insurer shall be deemed to be a renewal policy. F. Each insure r shall maintain, for at least one year, records of cancellation and refusal to renew and copies of every notice or statement referred to in subsection E that it sends to any of its insureds. G. There shall be no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against the Commissioner or his subordinates; any insurer, its authorized representative, its agents, or its employees; or any firm, person or corporation furnishing to the insurer information as to reasons for cancellation or refusal to renew, for any statement made by any of them in complying with this section or for providing information pertaining to the cancellation or refusal to renew. H. Nothing in this section requires an insurer to renew a policy written to insure owner-occupied dwellings, if the insured does not conform to the occupational or membership requirements of an insurer who limits its writings to an occupation or membership of an organ ization. I. No insurer or agent shall refuse to renew a policy written to insure an owner-occupied dwelling, solely because of any one or more of the following factors: 1. Age; 2. Sex; 3. Residence; 4. Race; 5. Color; 6. Creed; 7. National origin; 8. Ancestry; 9. Marital status; 10. Sexual orientation; 11. Gender identity; 12. Lawful occupation, including the military service; however, nothing in this subsection shall require any insurer to renew a policy for an insured where the insureds occupation h as changed so as to increase materially the risk; 13. Credit information contained in a consumer report, as defined in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., bearing on a natural persons creditw orthiness, credit standing or credit capacity. If credit information is used, in part, as the basis for the nonrenewal, such credit information shall be based on a consumer report procured within 120 days from the effective date of the nonrenewal; 14. Any claim resulting primarily from natural causes; 15. One or more claims that were incurred more than 60 months immediately prior to the expiration of the current policy period; or 16. Any inquiry from an insured about his insurance coverage or policy provisions. For purposes of this subdivision, inquiry means a written or oral communication by an insured seeking information regarding coverage or policy provisions that does not notify the insurer of a loss, incident or accident, and that does not provide information indicating an increase in the hazard insured against. An insurer shall not report any inqu iry as a claim to a loss history database maintained by a consumer reporting agency or insurance support organization.Nothing in this section prohibits any insurer from setting ra tes in accordance with relevant actuarial data. J. No insurer shall cancel or refuse to renew a policy written to insure an owner-occupied dwelling because an insured under the policy is a foster parent and foster children reside at the insured dwelling.

Consent for policy not requi red prior to bid.  This section does not require the Commissions consent and approval of a combination fire insurance policy prior to the submission of a bid offering the insura nce therein authorized, nor can such a requirement be implied from the language employed by it. The failure of the legislature to make such a requirement part of the statute will result in no public harm. On the contrary, it will be more likely to benefi t the public by encouraging competitive bidding, a factor that cannot be effectively obtained if every bidder can learn from the public records the bid to be submitted by his competitor.

The Commiss ion may approve and authorize the use of appropriate forms or provisions for supplemental contracts or extended coverage endorsements where the insured may be indemnified for (i) the difference between the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss and the cost of repair or replacement of the property on the same site with new materials of like kind and quality, within a reasonable time after the loss, and without deduction for depreciation, (ii) additional cost or loss by reason of any ordin ance or law in force at the time of loss which necessitates the demolition of any portion of the insured property, (iii) any increased cost of repair or replacement by reason of any ordinance or law regulating construction or repair of the insured buildi ng, and (iv) loss from interruption of business, untenantability, or termination of leasehold interest because of damage to or destruction of the property described in the policy. These forms or provisions shall apply to coverage provided to an insured h aving any interest in an insured building or structure which is a part of the building described in the policy, including service equipment for the building. B.

Any insurer issuing or delivering a policy written to insure an owner-occupied dwelling or the personal property of a tenants residential property risk that uses credit information contained in a consumer report for underwriting, tier placement or rating an app licant or insured, shall meet the following requirements: 1. Discl ose, either on the insurance application or at the time the insurance application is taken (i) that it shall obtain credit information in connection with such application; (ii) that the insured may request that his credit information be updated; and (iii ) that, if the insured questions the accuracy of the credit information, the insurer will, upon request of the insured, reevaluate the insured based on corrected credit information from a consumer reporting agency. The disclosure may be made by the insur er or its agent. Such disclosure shall be either written or provided to an applicant in the same medium as the application for insurance. The insurer need not provide the disclosure required under this subsection to any insured on a renewal policy if suc h insured has previously been provided a disclosure. Use of the following example disclosure constitutes compliance with this subsection: In connection with this application for insurance, we shall review your credit report or obtain or use an insura nce credit score based on the information contained in that credit report. We may use a third party in connection with the development of your insurance credit score. You may request that your credit information be updated and if you question the accurac y of the credit information, we will, upon your request, reevaluate you based on corrected credit information from a consumer reporting agency. 2. If an insurer takes an adverse action, based in whole or in part, upon credit information, the insurer shall provide notice to the applicant or insured that the adverse action was base d, in whole or in part, on credit information. Such notice shall also either include a statement advising the applicant or insured of the primary factors or characteristics that were used as the basis for the adverse action, or notify the applicant or in sured that he may request such information. For the purposes of this section, adverse action means a denial, nonrenewal or cancellation of, an increase in any charge for or refusal to apply a discount, or placement in a less favorable tier, or a reductio n or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of, any insurance, existing or applied for, in connection with the underwriting, tier placement or rating of insurance based on the applicants or insureds credit informat ion. Adverse action includes circumstances where due to his credit information the applicant or insured (i) receives a higher rate, (ii) is placed in a less favorable tier, and (iii) when there are multiple companies available within a group of insurers, receives coverage in a less favorably priced company of the group. Notice is required when the effect of the credit information would put the applicant or insured in a worse position than if the credit information had not been considered. In the case of renewals, the circumstances listed in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall not be deemed adverse actions if, due to the insureds credit information, the insured is not receiving a less favorable rate or placed in a less favorable tier or company than during the policy period immediately preceding renewal. B. If an insur er uses credit information from a consumer report for tier placement or rating of its renewal business for a policy insuring an owner-occupied dwelling or the personal property of a tenants residential property risk, the insurer shall be required to update the credit information at least once every three years, provided, however, that the insurer shall be required to update an insureds credit information within the three-year period if requested by the insured. If an update request is made by th e insured at least 45 days prior to the end of the policy term, any adjustment to the premium required by the update of the insureds credit information shall take effect at the first renewal following the request for update of the insureds credit information. If an update request is made by the insured within 45 days of the end of the policy term, the insurer shall have the option of applying any adjustment to the premium required by the update of the insureds credit information to the first renewal or the second renewal following the request for update of the insureds credit information. An insurer need not update the credit information more frequently than once every policy term. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, no insurer need obtain updated credit information if the insured has the most favorably priced tier or rate based on his credit information. C. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subdivision A 3 of § 38.2-1904, if an insurer issuing or delivering a policy to insure an owner-occupied dwelling or the personal property of a tenants residential property risk is unable to obtain credit information from a consumer report or when an insured or applicant has insufficient credit to produce an insurance credit score, the insurer shall underwrite, tier, or rate the individual risk in one of the following ways: (i) as if the risk received a neutral or average i nsurance credit score, as defined by the insurer, (ii) by excluding the use of credit information as a factor and using only other underwriting, tiering, or rating criteria, or (iii) in accordance with established underwriting guidelines or filed tiering or rating rules. Any such established underwriting guidelines or filed tiering or rating rules shall consider other actuarially justified factors associated with the risk in addition to the inability to obtain credit information or the insufficiency of the credit information. D. The followi ng factors shall not be used as credit criteria or to determine an insurance credit score for underwriting, tier placement, or rating purposes for a policy insuring an owner-occupied dwelling or the personal property of a tenants residential property risk: 1. Infor mation that has been identified by the consumer reporting agency as disputed by the consumer and coded as such, if the use of such disputed information would result in an adverse action; 2. Information that has been identified by the consumer reporting agency as related to insurance inquiries or nonconsumer-initiated inquiries and coded as such; 3. Information that has been identified by the consumer reporting agency as related to collection accounts with a medical industry code; 4. Information that includes multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency as being from the home mortgage industry and made within 30 days of one another, unless o nly one inquiry is considered; 5. Information that includes multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency as being from the automobile lending industry and made within 30 days of one another, unl ess only one inquiry is considered; 6. Income, gender, address, zip code, ethnic group, race, color, religion, marital status, or nationality of the consumer; or 7. The total available line of credit; however, an insurer may consider the total amount of outstanding debt in relation to the total available line of credit. E. No insurer shall take an adverse action against an applicant for a policy insuring an owner-occupied dwelling or the personal property of a tenants residential property risk based on credit information, unless an insurer obtains and uses a consumer report procu red within 90 days from the date the policy is first written. F. Notwithstan ding anything to the contrary, for a policy insuring an owner-occupied dwelling or the personal property of a tenants residential property risk, an insurer may, upon request, provide reasonable exceptions for an individual whose credit information is directly and adversely impacted by a catastrophic event, as determined by the insurer, including catastrophic illness or injury or the death of a spouse or member of the same household. The insurer may require reasonable documentation of the event prior to granting an exception. No insurer shall be deemed out of compliance with its filed rules and rates as a result of granting an exception pursuant to this subsection. G. Upon the re quest of an insured or applicant with a policy insuring an owner-occupied dwelling or the personal property of a tenants residential property risk for a reevaluation as set forth in this section, the insurer shall reevaluate the individual based on c orrected credit information from a consumer reporting agency. If the reevaluation results in a lower premium, the lower premium shall be applied retroactively to the effective date of the current policy term, and the insurer shall either refund or credit the amount to the insured. The insurer may require reasonable documentation of the corrected information from the consumer reporting agency prior to the reevaluation. H. An insurer shall indemnify, defend, and hold agents harmless from and against all liability, fees, and costs arising out of or relating to the actions, errors, or omissions of an agent who obtains or uses credit information or insurance credit scores for an insurer , provided the agent follows the instructions or procedures established by the insurer and complies with any applicable law. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to provide an applicant or insured with a cause of action that does not exist in th e absence of this subsection. I. No consumer reporting agency shall provide or sell data or lists that include any information that in whole or in part was submitted in conjunction with an insurance inquiry about an individuals credit information or a request for a consumer report or an insura nce ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_38.2-2127"><akn:num>§ 38.2-2127</akn:num><akn:heading>Notice of change in deductible</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Whenever an insurer unilaterally changes the deductible under a policy written to insure an owner-occupied dwelling, the insurer shall provide a written notice that (i) explicitly states that the deductible has changed and (ii) explains how the new deductible will be applied.

Such risk shall be specifically identified in the exclusion. Uniform policy forms or endorsements that will be used by the insurer for such exclusions shall be filed with the Commission pursuant to § 38.2-317 and shall contain a disclosure stating that the named insured has agreed to the specified risk being excluded under the policy. The insureds execution of the document evidencing his consent thereto shall be acknowledged before a notary public or witnessed by a disinterested person. Such signed exclusions, evidence of the insureds consent, and the insurers documentation substantiating the reason for the exclusion shall be made available to the Commission upon request.

CASE NOTES Section is for benef it of those who suffer damage.  This section and §§ 38.2-2204 through 38.2-2207 are, by force of their provisions, made a part of the policy and were enacted for the benefit of those who s uffer damage from the negligent use of the car by one operating it with the permission of the owner, express or implied. Storm v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 199 Va. 130, 97 S.E.2d 759, 1957 Va. LEXIS 171 (1957); General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp . v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 208 Va. 467, 158 S.E.2d 750, 1968 Va. LEXIS 135 (1968). This section applies to any policy insuring or indemnifying against liability for person al injuries, death, or property damage. Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Everette, 875 F. Supp. 1181, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1701 (E.D. Va. 1995). And is liberally construed.  This section having been enacted for the benefit of the injured parties, it is to be liberally construed so that the purpose intended may be accomplished. Storm v . Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 199 Va. 130, 97 S.E.2d 759, 1957 Va. LEXIS 171 (1957). This section and §§ 38.2-2204 through 38.2-2207 were enacted for the benefit of the injured party and are to be liberally construed. Davis v. National Grang e Ins. Co., 281 F. Supp. 998, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8336 (E.D. Va. 1968), disapproved, Rowe v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 421 F.2d 937, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11044 (4th Cir. 1970). The prohibitory provision of this section is general, and is applicable to both ownershi p and nonownership policies. Clarke v. Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., 123 F.2d 499, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 2751 (4th Cir. 1941). Beneficiary is anyone injured.  In Virginia anyone injured by the negligence of the insured under the policy is a beneficiary of the policy. Davis v. National Grange Ins. Co., 281 F. Supp. 998, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8336 (E.D. Va. 1968), disapproved, Rowe v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 421 F.2d 937, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11044 (4th Cir. 1970). Injured party may ma intain action in his own name.  Since the injured party was a beneficiary under the policy, and it was made for his benefit, it would seem the injured party is intended by the language of § 5 5-22 as one entitled to maintain an action in his own name. Davis v. National Grange Ins. Co., 281 F. Supp. 998, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8336 (E.D. Va. 1968), disapproved, Rowe v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 421 F.2d 937, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11 044 (4th Cir. 1970). But see Rowe v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 421 F.2d 937, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11044 (4th Cir. 1970). Action by injured party is on contract .  Where an injured party has obtained judgment against the assured on an indemnity policy, which judgment remains unsatisfied because of the insolvency of insured, and the injured party brings his action against the insurance company for the amount of the judgment against assured, the action is plainly upon the insurance contract and not upon the judgment against the assured, and is therefore subject to any proper defense by the company under the terms of the contract. Whether the right of the plaintiff to maintain his action is rested upon this section, or upon the stipulation in the policy, or upon § 55-22, he is seeking only to enforce compliance on the part of the company with the terms of its contract, and therefore the company can make any defense available to it in a suit by the assured. Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Davis' Adm'r, 150 Va. 778, 143 S.E. 328, 1928 Va. LEXIS 351 (1928). Policy of insuranc e is not solely one of indemnity.  Under this legislation a policy of insurance is not solely one of indemnity for loss by the named insured, but it is a contract of liability and is extended to co ver anyone operating the vehicle with the permission of the named insured. Storm v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 199 Va. 130, 97 S.E.2d 759, 1957 Va. LEXIS 171 (1957); General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 208 Va. 467, 158 S .E.2d 750, 1968 Va. LEXIS 135 (1968). Insurers liability not enlarged.  It is usually held that provisions that give the injured person the right to sue the insurer do not enlarge or extend the insurers liability but only permit t he injured person to exercise or succeed to the insureds rights against the insurer. Storm v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 199 Va. 130, 97 S.E.2d 759, 1957 Va. LEXIS 171 (1957); General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 208 Va. 467, 158 S.E.2d 750, 1968 Va. LEXIS 135 (1968). Injured party may bring action where execution returned unsatisfied.  The injured partys cause of action on the contract arises when and where the execution is returned unsatisfied. Thus venue may be laid at such place. Virginia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Saccio, 204 Va. 769, 133 S.E.2d 268, 1963 Va. LEXIS 211 (1963). Claim against insured by third party.  Chapter 7 debtor suffered dismissal with prejudice of his adversary complaint against the malpractice insurer for his former bankruptcy lawyer who allegedly faile d to persuade a bank that held mortgages on certain real estate to renegotiate the terms of those mortgages because debtor was neither an insured under the policy nor a third-party beneficiary with a right to enforce the policy per § 55-22. Debtor s assertion of a direct claim against the insurer also was precluded by § 38.2-2200, which permitted the pursuit of such a direct action only after the putative claimant has obtained an unsatisfied judgment against the insured under the policy. Reynol ds Living Trust v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (In re Reynolds), No. 09-71964, No. 11-07012, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 3352 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Sept. 6, 2011). Judgment fixes liability of insurer.  Under this section, whenever it is made to appear that a judgment has been recovered against a party who clearly comes within the provisions of the policy fixing the status of an assured, then the liability of the insurer is definitely fixed, unless, of course, fraud or collusion is shown in the procurement of the judgment. Union Indem. Co. v. Small, 154 Va. 458, 153 S.E. 685, 1930 Va. LEXIS 229 (1930). In an action to compel defendant to pay a judgment obtained against the operator of an automobile owned by one who was insured in defendant company and who was a brother of the operator of the car, liability was denied on the ground, among others, that there was no privity of contract between plaintiff and defendant. It was held that under this section whenever it is made to appear that a judgment has been recove red against a party who comes within the provisions of the policy, then the liability of the insurer is definitely fixed. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Justis, 168 Va. 158, 190 S.E. 163, 1937 Va. LEXIS 215 (1937). Defenses that may be asserted by the insurer against the insured are usually good against the injured person, if they do not arise from agreement after the accident and are not made as a result of collusion between the insurer and the insured. Storm v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 199 Va. 130, 97 S.E.2d 759, 1957 Va. LEXIS 171 (1957). The right of the injured person to maintain the action against the insurer rises no higher than the right of the insured against the insurer. The injured person s tands in the same shoes as the insured, and the same defenses that would be available to the insurer in an action brought by the insured are available to the insurer in the action brought by the injured person. Ampy v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co., 200 Va. 396, 105 S.E.2d 839, 1958 Va. LEXIS 200 (1958); General Accident Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

Upon reques t of an insured, each insurer licensed in this Commonwealth issuing or delivering any policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or use of any motor vehicle shall provide on payment of the premium, as a minimum coverage (i) to persons occupying the insured motor vehicle; and (ii) to the named insured and, while resident of the named insureds household, the spouse and relatives of the named insured while in or upon, entering or alighting from or through being struck by a motor vehicle while not occupying a motor vehicle, the following health care and disability benefits for each accident: 1. All r easonable and necessary expenses for medical, chiropractic, hospital, dental, surgical, prosthetic and rehabilitation services, services provided by an emergency medical services vehicle as defined in § 32.1-111.1, and funeral expenses, resulting from the accident and incurred within three years after the date of the accident, up to $2,000 per person; however, if the insured does not elect to purchase such limit the insurer and insured may agree to any other limit; 2. If the person is usually engaged in a remunerative occupation, an amount equal to the loss of income incurred after the date of the accident resulting from injuries received in the acc ident up to $100 per week during the period from the first workday lost as a result of the accident up to the date the person is able to return to his usual occupation. However, the period shall not extend beyond one year from the date of the accident; a nd 3. An expense described in subdivision 1 shall be deemed to have been incurred: a. If the insured is directly responsible for payment of the expense; b. If the expense is paid by (i) a health care insurer pursuant to a negotiated contract with the health care provider or (ii) Medicaid or Medicare, where the actual payment with ref erence to the medical bill rendered by the provider is less than or equal to the providers usual and customary fee, in the amount of the actual payment as evidenced by an explanation of benefits, remittance advice, or similar documentation from the h ealth care provider; however, if the insured is required to make a payment in addition to the actual payment by the health care insurer or Medicaid or Medicare, the amount shall be increased by the payment made by the insured; or c. If no medical bill is rendered or specific charge made by a health care provider to the insured, an insurer, or any other person, in the amount of the usual and customary fee char ged in that community for the service rendered. B. The insured has the option of purchasing either or both of the coverages set forth in subdivisions A 1 and A 2. Either or both of the coverages, as well as any other medical expense or loss of income coverage under any policy of automobile liability insurance, shal l be payable to the covered injured person or pursuant to an assignment of benefits in accordance with subsection D, notwithstanding the failure or refusal of the named insured or other person entitled to the coverage to give notice to the insurer of an accident as soon as practicable under the terms of the policy, except where the failure or refusal prejudices the insurer in establishing the validity of the claim. C. In any poli cy of personal automobile insurance in which the insured has purchased coverage under subsection A, every insurer providing such coverage arising from the ownership, maintenance or use of no more than four motor vehicles shall be liable to pay up to the maximum policy limit available on every motor vehicle insured under that coverage if the health care or disability expenses and costs mentioned in subsection A exceed the limits of coverage for any one motor vehicle so insured. D. Any attempt to assign medical expense benefits shall be subject to the following: 1. An as signment of medical expense benefits shall be valid only if: a. A copy of the AOB form, executed by the assignor and in compliance with the other requirements of subdivision D 1 and a copy of the notice complying with subdivision g if such notice is provided in a separate document pursuant to subdivision e, is provid ed to the motor vehicle insurer; b. The AOB form is (i) in writing, which includes any printed or electronic format, (ii) dated, and (iii) executed by the assignor; c. The AOB form includes a conspicuous statement that the assignor is not required to execute the AOB form; d. If the AOB form includes a notice that complies with the provisions of subdivision g, the AOB form is signed, initialed, or otherwise marked by the assignor, at or near the notice provision, to acknowledge that the assignor has read, or had the opportunity to read, the notice; e.

Penske Logistics, LLC, 268 Va. 129, 596 S.E.2d 518, 2004 Va. LEXIS 94 (2004). How violation of section is redres sable.  Violation of this section is redressable by the State Corporation Commission in its regulatory capacity and not through extension of coverage, at least where the insured seeks no coverage whatever and additional coverage is not in issue. Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Collier, 453 F. Supp. 883, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16271 (W.D. Va. 1978). Specific request f or optional coverage required.  The elaborate method set out in this section for notifying an insured of the availability of medical payments for injuries sustained in a non-owned motor vehicle indicates that a specific request for coverage under § 38.2-2201 is required. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Seay, 236 Va. 275, 373 S.E.2d 910, 5 Va. Law Rep. 876, 1988 Va. LEXIS 161 (1988). Effect of failure to request coverage.  Where insured received notice of optional coverage pursuant to this section, but failed to specifically request coverage for injuries sustained while occupying a non-owned motor vehicle, § 38.2-2201 would not apply to supersede the provisions in his existing policy. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Seay, 236 Va. 275, 373 S.E.2d 910, 5 Va. Law Rep. 876, 1988 Va. LEXIS 161 (1988). Rejection requirement.  This sections explicit rejection requirement is consistent with its purpose of affording adequate protection to those injured by underinsured motorists. White v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 913 F.2d 165, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 15978 (4th Cir. 1990). Information that supports an inference by the insurer that the insured intends to reject a default level of coverage does not suffice, under this section, as an a ctual rejection of that coverage. White v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 913 F.2d 165, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 15978 (4th Cir. 1990). Because plaintiff insurers settlement with an insured was not the product of any conduct by defendants, but by the insurers own misinterpretation of the l aw, the insurers action seeking indemnity from defendants was dismissed; subsection B of § 38.2-2202 did not require a waiver for a renewal policy, and thus, whether or not the insured actually signed the renewal application form was of no legal c onsequence. Canal Ins. Co. v. Leb. Ins. Agency, Inc., 543 F. Supp. 2d 521, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29805 (W.D. Va. 2008). In a case in which an employee sought a declaratory judgment that an insurer provide uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage of $1 million, the limits of the policy, because deficiencies in that form invalidated his employers selection, while the insurers supplementary application form garbled its explanation of Virginias financial responsibility limits, the employer clearly rejecte d its liability limits as its UM/UIM limits and instead selected Virginias minimum limits, which it understood to be the minimum UM/UIM limits Virginia permitted. Both its rejection and its selection were clear, and it understood them. Melton v. Disc over Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 760 F. Supp. 2d 633, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4048 (W.D. Va. 2011). Matching coverage requirement.  In a case in which an employee sought a declaratory judgment that an insurer provide uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage of $1 million, the limits of the policy, because deficiencies in that form invalidated his employers selection, while the insurers supplementary application form garbled its explanation of Virginias financial responsibility limits, the employer clearly rejecte d its liability limits as its UM/UIM limits and instead selected Virginias minimum limits, which it understood to be the minimum UM/UIM limits Virginia permitted. Both its rejection and its selection were clear, and it understood them. Santens v. Pro gressive Gulf Ins. Co., 56 F. Supp. 3d 788, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94830 (E.D. Va. 2014). Insurer had to continue to provide matching UM coverage to insured for renewals where no prior rejection existed because the mention of this section in subsection A of § 38.2-2206 did not limit the application of subsection A to new policies. Santens v. Progressive Gulf Ins. Co., 56 F. Supp. 3d 788, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94830 (E.D. Va. 2014). Waiver of higher coverag e remaining in effect.  Where in 1984, insured executed and returned a waiver form to insurer by which he requested $25,000 uninsured motorist (UM) coverage and rejected the higher level of coverage, which would have been $100,000, and where in 1990, insurer mailed insured a renewal policy for the 1991 period covering the date of the accident; however, insured did not return this waiver form to insurer, the mere fact that insurer sent i nsured a waiver fo...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_38.2-2203"><akn:num>§ 38.2-2203</akn:num><akn:heading>Policy providing for reimbursement for services that may be performed by certain practitioners other than physicians</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Notwithstanding any provision of any policy or contract of bodily injury liability insurance, when the policy or contract provides for reimbursement for any service tha t may be legally performed by a person licensed in this Commonwealth for the practice of chiropractic, reimbursement under the policy shall not be denied because the service is rendered by a licensed chiropractor.

No policy o r contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance, covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or private pleasure watercraft, shall be issued or delivered in the Commonwealth to the owner of such vehicle, aircraft, or watercraft, or shall be issued or delivered by any insurer licensed in the Commonwealth upon any motor vehicle, aircraft, or private pleasure watercraft that is principally garaged, docked, or used in the Commonwealth , unless the policy contains a provision insuring the named insured, and any other person using or responsible for the use of the motor vehicle, aircraft, or private pleasure watercraft with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured, against liability for death or injury sustained, or loss or damage incurred within the coverage of the policy or contract as a result of negligence in the operation or use of such vehicle, aircraft, or watercraft by the named insured or by any such person; howev er, nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to prohibit an insurer from limiting its liability under any one policy for bodily injury or property damage resulting from any one accident or occurrence to the liability limits for such coverage set forth in the policy for any such accident or occurrence or for any one person, regardless of the number of insureds under that policy. Provided that, when one accident or occurrence involves more than one defendant who is covered by the policy, the plai ntiff may recover the per person limit of the policy against each such defendant, subject to the per accident or occurrence limit of the policy. Each such policy or contract of liability insurance, or endorsement to the policy or contract, insuring priva te passenger automobiles, aircraft, or private pleasure watercraft principally garaged, docked, or used in the Commonwealth, that has as the named insured an individual or spouses and that includes, with respect to any liability insurance provided by the policy, contract, or endorsement for use of a nonowned automobile, aircraft, or private pleasure watercraft, any provision requiring permission or consent of the owner of such automobile, aircraft, or private pleasure watercraft for the insurance to app ly, shall be construed to include permission or consent of the custodian in the provision requiring permission or consent of the owner. B. Notwithstan ding any requirements in this section to the contrary, an insurer may exclude any person from coverage under a personal umbrella or excess policy, if the exclusion is requested in writing by the first named insured and is acknowledged in writing by the e xcluded driver. C. For aircraf t liability insurance, such policy or contract may contain the exclusions listed in § 38.2-2227. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other provisions of law, no policy or contract shall require pilot experience greater than that pres cribed by the Federal Aviation Administration, except for pilots operating air taxis, or pilots operating aircraft applying chemicals, seed, or fertilizer. D. No policy o r contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued or delivered in the Commonwealth to the owner of such vehicle or shall be issued or delivered by an insur er licensed in the Commonwealth upon any motor vehicle principally garaged or used in the Commonwealth without an endorsement or provision insuring the named insured, and any other person using or responsible for the use of the motor vehicle with the exp ressed or implied consent of the named insured, against liability for death or injury sustained, or loss or damage incurred within the coverage of the policy or contract as a result of negligence in the operation or use of the motor vehicle by the named insured or by any other such person; however, nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to prohibit an insurer from limiting its liability under any one policy for bodily injury or property damage resulting from any one accident or occurrence to the liability limits for such coverage set forth in the policy for any such accident or occurrence or for any one person regardless of the number of insureds under that policy. Provided that, when one accident or occurrence involves more than one defenda nt who is covered by the policy, the plaintiff may recover the per person limit of the policy against each such defendant, subject to the per accident or occurrence limit of the policy. This provision shall apply notwithstanding the failure or refusal of the named insured or such other person to cooperate with the insurer under the terms of the policy. If the failure or refusal to cooperate prejudices the insurer in the defense of an action for damages arising from the operation or use of such insured m otor vehicle, then the endorsement or provision shall be void. If an insurer has actual notice of a motion for judgment or complaint having been served on an insured, the mere failure of the insured to turn the motion or complaint over to the insurer sha ll not be a defense to the insurer, nor void the endorsement or provision, nor in any way relieve the insurer of its obligations to the insured, provided the insured otherwise cooperates and in no way prejudices the insurer.Where the insurer has elected to provide a defense to its insured under such circumstances and files responsive pleadings in the name of its insured, the insured shall not be subject to sanctions for failure to comply with discovery pursuant to Part Four of the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia unless it can be shown that the suit papers actually reached the insured, and that the insurer has failed after exercising due diligence to locate its insured, and as long as the insurer provides such information in response to discovery as it can without the assistance of the insured. E. Any endorse ment, provision or rider attached to or included in any such policy of insurance which purports or seeks to limit or reduce the coverage afforded by the provisions required by this section shall be void, except an insurer may exclude such coverage as is afforded by this section, where such coverage would inure to the benefit of the United States Government or any agency or subdivision thereof under the provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Federal Drivers Act and Public Law 86-654 District of C olumbia Employee Non-Liability Act, or to the benefit of the Commonwealth under the provisions of the Virginia Tort Claims Act (§ 8.01-195.1 et seq.) and the self-insurance plan established by the Department of General Services pursuant to § 2.2-18 37 for any state employee who, in the regular course of his employment, transports patients in his own personal vehicle. F. An insurer writing a policy of bodily injury or property damage liability motor vehicle insurance, or an endorsement to such policy, may exclude coverage under a motor vehicle policy issued to the owner of a shared vehicle for use of such vehicle on a peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform during the vehicle sharing period for (i) liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage, (ii) uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, (iii) medical expense and loss of income benefits coverage, and (iv) collision and other than collision physical damage coverage. Nothing in this article invalidates or limits an exclusion contained in a motor vehicle liability insurance policy, including any insurance policy in use or approved for use, that excludes coverage for motor vehicles used as a public or livery conveyance. For purposes of this subsection, peer-to-peer vehicle sharing platform, shared vehicle, and vehicle sharing period have the meanings ascribed to those terms in § 46.2-1408. History History.

If there is no other valid and collectible collision or upset insurance available and if such policy provides insurance to the named insured for collision or upset, it shall include any such other person as an additional insured, unless in the case of a leased vehicle such other person receives a conspicuous written disclosure at the commencement of the lease, warning such person that he is not an additional insured under the owners policy for collision or upset coverage. B. 1. Any policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance relat ing to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall exclude coverage to persons other than (i) the named insured, or (ii) directors, stockholders, partners, agents, or employees of the named insured, or (iii) residents of the household of either (i) or (ii), while those persons are employed or otherwise engaged in the business of selling, repairing, servicing, storing, or parking motor vehicles if there is any other valid or collectible insurance applicable to the same loss covering the p ersons under a policy with limits at least equal to the financial responsibility requirements specified in § 46.2-472. 2.

Subdivision A 1 is as much a part of policy as if incorporated therein.  The statutory provisions of subdivision A 1 of this section are as much a part of a liability policy issued to a long-term lessor as if incorporated therein.

Subdivision A 1 inapplicable to uninsured motorist coverage.  The language of subdivision A 1, defining an exception to coverage afforded a permissive user under a garage liability policy, is inapplicable to uninsured motori st coverage. GEICO v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., 232 Va. 326, 350 S.E.2d 612, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1293, 1986 Va. LEXIS 261 (1986). Garage keepers exclusion does not apply to underinsured motorist coverage.  Fact that an auto dealership customer who was injured while test driving a vehicle was not entitled to liability coverage under the dealerships garage policy did not mean he was not entitled to underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage under the policy; the garage keepers exclusion, § 38.2-2205, did not apply to UIM coverage and the UIM endorsement clearly included the customer. Seals v. Erie Ins. Exch., 27 7 Va. 558, 674 S.E.2d 860, 2009 Va. LEXIS 45 (2009). No liability protection for customer injured during test drive.  Customer who was injured while test driving an auto dealerships vehicle was not entitled to liability coverage under the dealerships garage policy; the la nguage of the policys Liability Protection clause was permissible under the garage keepers exclusion, subdivision A 1 of § 38.2-2205, and as the customer had other insurance that met the requirements of § 46.2-472, the liability pro tection did not extend to the customer. Seals v. Erie Ins. Exch., 277 Va. 558, 674 S.E.2d 860, 2009 Va. LEXIS 45 (2009). Where other insurance clauses of two policies are of identical effect in that th ey operate mutually to reduce or eliminate the amount of collectible insurance available, neither provides primary coverage and pro rata distribution as ordered by the trial court is appropriate.

LEXIS 168 (1987). Business of leasing.  Where a finance company provided the blank lease documents for use by dealerships, approved the leases before the dealership entered into them, purchased the vehi cles, took assignments of the leases, assumed all of the duties and rights of ownership of the leased vehicles, and performed administrative duties during the term of the leases, it was found to be in the business of leasing within the meaning of the statute.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Permissive user.  Employee was a permissive user of her employers automobile at the time of the accident on Sunday, because as an accommodation to her employer she had the day before used the car to deliver an auto part after the business had closed for the day; her use of the automobile on Sunday did not place such use within the scope of activities or exceptions set forth in § 38.2-2205 which would have permitted Universa l to deny coverage that must otherwise be provided to permissive users under the provisions of § 38.2-2204. Progressive Gulf Ins. Co. v. Universal Underwriters Group, 65 Va. Cir. 522, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 450 (Essex County Feb. 26, 2002). Secondary liability.  Since the garage keepers exclusion, codified in § 38.2-2205, did not apply to underinsured motorist coverage, pursuant to subsection B of § 38.2 -2206, an insureds primary claim was against the vehicle owners insurer, while the insurer of the insureds vehicle had secondary liability.

Except as p rovided in subsection J, no policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued or delivered in this Commonwealth to the owner of such vehicle or sha ll be issued or delivered by any insurer licensed in this Commonwealth upon any motor vehicle principally garaged or used in this Commonwealth unless it contains an endorsement or provisions undertaking to pay the insured all sums that he is legally enti tled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, within limits not less than the requirements of § 46.2-472. Those limits shall equal but not exceed the limits of the liability insurance provided by the policy, unle ss any one named insured rejects the additional uninsured motorist insurance coverage by notifying the insurer as provided in subsection B of § 38.2-2202. This rejection of the additional uninsured motorist insurance coverage by any one named insured shall be binding upon all insureds under such policy as defined in subsection B. The endorsement or provisions shall also obligate the insurer to make payment for bodily injury or property damage caused by the operation or use of an underinsured motor ve hicle to the extent the vehicle is underinsured, as defined in subsection B. The endorsement or provisions shall also provide for at least $20,000 coverage for damage or destruction of the property of the insured in any one accident but may provide an ex clusion of the first $200 of the loss or damage where the loss or damage is a result of any one accident involving an unidentifiable owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle. B. As used in this section:Bodily injury includes death resulting from bodily injury. Insured as used in subsections A, D, G, and H, means the named insured and, while resident of the same household, the s pouse of the named insured, and relatives, wards or foster children of either, while in a motor vehicle or otherwise, and any person who uses the motor vehicle to which the policy applies, with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured, and a guest in the motor vehicle to which the policy applies or the personal representative of any of the above.Uninsured motor vehicle means a motor vehicle for which (i) there is no bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance in the amounts specified by § 46.2-472, (ii) there is such insurance but the insurer writing the insurance denies coverage for any reason whatsoever, including failure or refusal of the insured to cooperate with the insurer, (iii) there is no bond or deposit of money or securities in lieu of such insurance, (iv) the owner of the motor vehicle ha s not qualified as a self-insurer under the provisions of § 46.2-368, or (v) the owner or operator of the motor vehicle is immune from liability for negligence under the laws of the Commonwealth or the United States, in which case the provisions of su bsection F shall apply and the action shall continue against the insurer. A motor vehicle shall be deemed uninsured if its owner or operator is unknown.A motor vehicle is underinsured when, and to the extent that, the total amount of bodily injur y and property damage coverage applicable to the operation or use of the motor vehicle and available for payment for such bodily injury or property damage, including all bonds or deposits of money or securities made pursuant to Article 15 (§ 46.2-435 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of Title 46.2, is less than the total amount of uninsured motorist coverage afforded any person injured as a result of the operation or use of the vehicle.Available for payment means the amount of liability insurance coverag e applicable to the claim of the injured person for bodily injury or property damage reduced by the payment of any other claims arising out of the same occurrence.If an injured person is entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under more than one poli cy, the following order of priority of policies applies and any amount available for payment shall be credited against such policies in the following order of priority: 1. The p olicy covering a motor vehicle occupied by the injured person at the time of the accident; 2. The policy covering a motor vehicle not involved in the accident under which the injured person is a named insured; 3. The policy covering a motor vehicle not involved in the accident under which the injured person is an insured other than a named insured.Where there is more than one insurer providing coverage under one of the payment priorities set forth, their liability shall be proportioned as to their respective underinsured motorist coverages.Recovery under the endorsement or provisions shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this section . C. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a motor vehicle is uninsured if the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles certifies that, from the records of the Department of Motor Vehicles, it appears that (i) there is no bodily injury liability insurance and property damage liability insurance in the amounts specified by § 46.2-472 covering the owner or operator of the motor vehicle; (ii) no bond has been given or cash or securities delivered in lieu of the insurance; or (iii) the owner or operator o f the motor vehicle has not qualified as a self-insurer in accordance with the provisions of § 46.2-368. D. If the owne r or operator of any motor vehicle that causes bodily injury or property damage to the insured is unknown, and if the damage or injury results from an accident where there has been no contact between that motor vehicle and the motor vehicle occupied by t he insured, or where there has been no contact with the person of the insured if the insured was not occupying a motor vehicle, then for the insured to recover under the endorsement required by subsection A, the accident shall be reported promptly to eit her (i) the insurer or (ii) a law-enforcement officer having jurisdiction in the county or city in which the accident occurred. If it is not reasonably practicable to make the report promptly, the report shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable un der the circumstances. E. If the owne r or operator of any vehicle causing injury or damages is unknown, an action may be instituted against the unknown defendant as John Doe and service of process may be made by delivering a copy of the motion for judgment or other pleadings to the clerk of the court in which the action is brought. Service upon the insurer issuing the policy shall be made as prescribed by law as though the insurer were a party defendant. The provisions of § 8.01-288 shall not be applicable to the service of proc ess required in this subsection. The insurer shall have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of John Doe. F. If any acti on is instituted against the owner or operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle by any insured intending to rely on the uninsured or underinsured coverage provision or endorsement of this policy under which the insured is making a claim, the n the insured shall serve a copy of the process upon this insurer in the manner prescribed by law, as though the insurer were a party defendant. The provisions of § 8.01-288 shall not be applicable to the service of process required in this subsection . The insurer shall then have the right to file pleadings and take other action allowable by law in the name of the owner or operator of the uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle or in its own name. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, the i mmunity from liability for negligence of the owner or operator of a motor vehicle shall not be a bar to the insured obtaining a judgment enforceable against the insurer for the negligence of the immune owner or operator, and shall not be a defense availa ble to the insurer to the action brought by the insured, which shall proceed against the named defendant although any judgment obtained against an immune defendant shall be entered in the name of Immune Defendant and shall be enforceable against the insurer and any other nonimmune defendant as though it were entered in the actual name of the named immune defendant. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle from employing counsel of his own choi ce and taking any action in his own interest in connection with the proceeding. G. Any insurer paying a claim under the endorsement or provisions required by subsection A shall be subrogated to the rights of the insured to whom the claim was paid against the person causing the injury, death, or damage and that persons insurer, although it may deny coverage for any reason, to the extent that payment was made. The bringing of an action against the unknown owner or operator as John Doe or the conclusion of such an action shall not bar the insured from bringing an action against the owner or ope rator proceeded against as John Doe, or against the owners or operators insurer denying coverage for any reason, if the identity of the owner or operator who caused the injury or damages becomes known. The bringing of an action against an unknown owner or operator as John Doe shall toll the statute of limitations for purposes of bringing an action against the owner or operator who caused the injury or damages until his identity becomes known. In no event shall an action be brought against an own er or operator who caused the injury or damages, previously filed against as John Doe, more than three years from the commencement of the action against the unknown owner or operator as John Doe in a court of competent jurisdiction. Any recovery against the owner or operator, or the insurer of the owner or operator shall be paid to the insurer of the injured party to the extent that the i...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_38.2-2207"><akn:num>§ 38.2-2207</akn:num><akn:heading>No policy to exclude coverage to employee</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text No policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle, aircraft or watercraft shall exclude coverage to an employee of the insured in any controversy arising between employees even though one employee shall be awarded compensation as provided in Title 65.2.

If th e notice is mailed, proof of mailing a notice of cancellation or refusal to renew shall be obtained using one of the following methods that demonstrates the date that the notice was sent to the named insured at the address stated in the policy or to the named insureds last known address: a. The notice is sent by: (1) Registered mail; (2) Certified mail; or (3) Any other similar first-class mail tracking method used or approved by the United States Postal Service, including Intelligent Mail barcode Tracing (IMb Tracing); or b. The notice is sent by another method of mailing for which a certificate of mailing is obtained from the United States Postal Service at the time the notice is accepted for mailing . A certificate of mailing from the United States Postal Service does not include a certificate of bulk mailing. 2.

CASE NOTES The cancellation of an automobile liability insurance policy is a matter of importance, not only to the insured thereunder but to third parties whose rights are affected thereby. Gregory v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 214 Va. 134, 198 S.E.2d 616, 1973 Va. LEXIS 268 (1973). This section becomes a part of the insurance policy contract by force of its language an d either party seeking to cancel the policy has to comply with it. Ampy v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co., 200 Va. 396, 105 S.E.2d 839, 1958 Va. LEXIS 200 (1958); Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co. v. Dollins, 201 Va. 73, 109 S.E.2d 405, 1959 Va. LEXIS 195 (1959). This section becomes a part of an insurance policy contract by virtue of its language and a party seeking to cancel a policy has to comply strictly with its provi sions. Gregory v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 214 Va. 134, 198 S.E.2d 616, 1973 Va. LEXIS 268 (1973). Insurers must comply strictly with conditions relating to cancellation.  Under the law of Virginia, insurers, who depend upon such mailings to cancel their coverages, are properly required to comply strictly with the conditions stipula ted in the policy when they exercise the right of cancellation. Riddick v. State Capital Ins. Co., 271 F.2d 641, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 3154 (4th Cir. 1959). But cancellation may be effective whether or not notice was actually received.  Cancellation complying with requirements of this section and of policy effective whether or not assured actually received notice thereof. Riddick v. State Capital Ins. Co., 271 F.2d 641, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 3154 (4th Cir. 1959). It is not necessary to prove actual receipt of the cancellation notice. If the notice is mailed in accordance with the terms of the policy and the provisions of t his section the notice of cancellation is effective. Ampy v. Metro. Cas. Ins. Co., 200 Va. 396, 105 S.E.2d 839, 1958 Va. LEXIS 200 (1958). And mailing of notice, properly addressed, may be sufficient.  Where cancellation notice complied in all respects with the requirements of the policy and was properly addressed, its mailing effectively cancelled the insurance coverage as of the date specified in the notice. Riddick v. State Capital Ins. Co., 271 F.2d 641, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 3154 (4th Cir. 1959). Notice of cancellation by an insurer may be sent the insured by mail in accordance with the provisions of the policy. Gregory v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 214 Va . 134, 198 S.E.2d 616, 1973 Va. LEXIS 268 (1973). An address is complete and proper without reference to the county in which the post offi ce is located. Riddick v. State Capital Ins. Co., 271 F.2d 641, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 3154 (4th Cir. 1959). An unsigned or blank certificate does not comply with this section. Gregory v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 214 Va. 134, 198 S.E.2d 616, 1973 Va. LEXIS 268 (1973). Authority of agency to issue a policy does not carry with it the power to cancel it. Nati onal Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Dixon, 206 Va. 568, 145 S.E.2d 187, 1965 Va. LEXIS 236 (1965). Burden.  The defendant, having interposed the cancellation of the policy as its sole defense, had the burden of proving the effective cancellation thereof. National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Dixon, 206 Va. 568, 145 S.E.2d 187, 1965 Va. LEXIS 236 (1965). The insurance company having interposed and relied upon the cancellation of the policy as its defense had the burden of proving the effective cancellation thereof in compliance with this section. Gregory v. Providence Wash. Ins. Co., 214 Va. 134, 198 S.E.2d 616, 1973 Va. LEXIS 268 (1973). Compliance with policy is questi on of law.  The question of whether the mailing of a cancellation notice complied with the requirements of the policy was one of law which should have been decided by the cou rt, rather than a jury. Riddick v. State Capital Ins. Co., 271 F.2d 641, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 3154 (4th Cir. 1959).

As used in this section:Cancellation or to cancel means a termination of a policy during the policy period.Insurer means any insurance company, association, or exchange licensed to transact motor vehicle insurance in the Commonwealth. Policy of motor vehicle insurance or policy means a policy or contract for bodily injury or property damage liability insurance issued or delivered in this Commonwealth covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehi cle, insuring as the named insured one individual or spouses who are residents of the same household, and under which the insured vehicle designated in the policy is either: 1. A mot or vehicle of a private passenger, station wagon, or motorcycle type that is not used commercially, rented to others, or used as a public or livery conveyance where the term public or livery conveyance does not include car pools, or 2. Any other four-wheel motor vehicle which is not used in the occupation, profession, or business, other than farming, of the insured, or as a public or livery conveyance, or rented to o thers. The term policy of motor vehicle insurance or policy does not include (i) any policy issued through the Virginia Automobile Insurance Plan, (ii) any policy covering the operation of a garage, sales agency, repair shop, service stat ion, or public parking place, (iii) any policy providing insurance only on an excess basis, or (iv) any other contract providing insurance to the named insured even though the contract may incidentally provide insurance on motor vehicles. Renewal or to renew means (i) the issuance and delivery by an insurer of a policy superseding at the end of the policy period a policy previously issued and delivered by the same insurer, providing types and limits of coverage at least equal to those contained in the policy being superseded, or (ii) the issuance and delivery of a certificate or notice extending the term of a policy beyond its policy period or term with types and limits of coverage at lea st equal to those contained in the policy. Each renewal shall conform with the requirements of the manual rules and rating program currently filed by the insurer with the Commission. Except as provided in subsection K, any policy with a policy period or term of less than 12 months or any policy with no fixed expiration date shall for the purpose of this section be considered as if written for successive policy periods or terms of six months from the original effective date. B. This sectio n shall apply only to that portion of a policy of motor vehicle insurance providing the coverage required by §§ 38.2-2204, 38.2-2205, and 38.2-2206. C. 1. No insurer shall refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy solely because of any one or more of the following factors: a. Age; b. Sex; c. Residence; d. Race; e. Color; f. Creed; g. National origin; h. Ancestry; i. Marital status; j. Sexual orientation; k. Gender identity; l. Lawful occupation, including the military service; m. Lack of driving experience, or number of years driving experience; n. Lack of supporting business or lack of the potential for acquiring such business; o. One or more accidents or violations that occurred more than 48 months immediately preceding the upcoming anniversary date; p. One or more claims submitted under the uninsured motorists coverage of the policy where the uninsured motorist is known or there is physical evidence of contact; q. A single claim by a single insured submitted under the medical expense coverage due to an accident for which the insured was neither wholly nor partially at fault; r. One or more claims submitted under the comprehensive or towing coverages. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit an insurer from modifying or refusing to renew the compre hensive or towing coverages at the time of renewal of the policy on the basis of one or more claims submitted by an insured under those coverages, provided that the insurer shall mail or deliver to the insured at the address shown in the policy, or deliv er electronically to the address provided by the named insured, written notice of any such change in coverage at least 45 days prior to the renewal; s. Two or fewer motor vehicle accidents within a three-year period unless the accident was caused either wholly or partially by the named insured, a resident of the same household, o r other customary operator; t. Credit information contained in a consumer report, as defined in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., bearing on a natural persons credi tworthiness, credit standing or credit capacity. If credit information is used, in part, as the basis for the nonrenewal, such credit information shall be based on a consumer report procured within 120 days from the effective date of the nonrenewal. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to insurance purchased primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; u. The refusal of a motor vehicle owner as defined in § 46.2-1088.6 to provide access to recorded data from a recording device as defined in § 46.2-1088.6; or v. The status of the person as a foster care provider or a person in foster care. 2. Nothing in this section shall require any insurer to renew a policy for an insured where the insureds occupation has changed so as to materially increase the risk. Nothing containe d in subdivisions 1 p, q, and r shall prohibit an insurer from refusing to renew a policy where a claim is false or fraudulent. Nothing in this section prohibits any insurer from setting rates in accordance with relevant actuarial data. D. No insurer shall cancel a policy except for one or more of the following reasons: 1. The n amed insured or any other operator who either resides in the same household or customarily operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy has had his driving privileges suspended or revoked during the policy period or, if the policy is a renewal, duri ng its policy period or the 90 days immediately preceding the last effective date. 2. The named insured fails to pay the premium for the policy or any installment of the premium, whether payable to the insurer or its agent either directly or indirectly under any premium finance plan or extension of credit. 3. The named insured or his duly constituted attorney-in-fact has notified the insurer of a change in the insureds legal residence to a state other than Virginia and the insured vehic le will be principally garaged in the new state of legal residence. E. No cancella tion or refusal to renew by an insurer of a policy of motor vehicle insurance shall be effective unless the insurer delivers or mails to the named insured at the address shown in the policy a written notice of the cancellation or refusal to renew, or the insurer delivers such notice electronically to the address provided by the named insured. The notice shall: 1. Be in a type size authorized under § 38.2-311. 2. State the effective date of the cancellation or refusal to renew. The effective date of cancellation or refusal to renew shall be at least 45 days after mailing or delivering to the in sured the notice of cancellation or notice of refusal to renew. However, when the policy is being canceled or not renewed for the reason set forth in subdivision D 2 the effective date may be less than 45 days but at least 15 days from the date of mailin g or delivery. 3. State the specific reason of the insurer for cancellation or refusal to renew and provide for the notification required by §§ 38.2-608, 38.2-609, and subsection B of § 38.2-61 0. However, those notification requirements shall not apply when the policy is being canceled or not renewed for the reason set forth in subdivision D 2. 4. Inform the insured of his right to request in writing within 15 days of the receipt of the notice that the Commissioner review the action of the insurer.The notice of cancellation or r efusal to renew shall contain the following statement to inform the insured of such right:IMPORTANT NOTICEWithin 15 days of receiving this notice, you or your attorney may request in writing that the Commissioner of Insurance review this action to determ ine whether the insurer has complied with Virginia laws in canceling or nonrenewing your policy. If this insurer has failed to comply with the cancellation or nonrenewal laws, the Commissioner may require that your policy be reinstated. However, the Comm issioner is prohibited from making underwriting judgments. If this insurer has complied with the cancellation or nonrenewal laws, the Commissioner does not have the authority to overturn this action. 5. Inform the insured of the possible availability of other insurance which may be obtained through his agent, through another insurer, or through the Virginia Automobile Insurance Plan. 6. If sent by mail or delivered electronically, comply with the provisions of § 38.2-2208.Nothing in this subsection prohibits any insurer or agent from including in the notice of canc ellation or refusal to renew, any additional disclosure statements required by state or federal laws, or any additional information relating to the availability of other insurance. F. Nothing in this section shall apply: 1. If th e insurer or its agent acting on behalf of the insurer has manifested its willingness to renew by issuing or offering to issue a renewal policy, certificate, or other evidence of renewal, or has manifested its willingness to renew in writing to the insur ed. The written manifestation shall include the name of a proposed insurer, the expiration date of the policy, the type of insurance coverage, and information regarding the estimated renewal premium. The insurer shall retain a copy of each written manife station for a period of at least one year from the expiration date of any policy that is not renewed; 2.

Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statute does not abrogate Moorman ru le.  As the Virginia Supreme Court had already decided in Moorman v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. C o., 207 Va. 244, 148 S.E.2d 874 (1966), that the rule set out in § 38.2-2216 was the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia, at least in cases in which the policy of insurance did not specifically state otherwise, and since Moorman has never been otherwise abrogated by the legislatur e or reversed by the Virginia Supreme Court, its holding that the question of whether payment under one coverage can be credited against the obligation to pay under the other coverage depends on the specific provisions of the policy at issue and still ap plies to all other types of insurance policies, including general commercial liability policies, notwithstanding the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another).

Only those insured persons who have voluntarily and successfully completed a mature driver motor vehicle crash prevention course approved by the Department of Motor Vehicles shall qualify for a thre e-year period after the completion of the course for the reduction in rates. No reduction in premiums shall be allowed for a self-instructed course or for any course that does not provide actual classroom instruction for a minimum number of hours as dete rmined by the Department of Motor Vehicles. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a course sponsor that has been approved by the Department for the classroom delivery of a mature driver motor vehicle crash prevention course may also b e approved to deliver that same substantive course through a secure computer-based medium provided via the Internet or other electronic means that have been approved by the Department, provided that the sponsor has acceptable security features designed t o assure that the certificates issued pursuant to subsection E are issued to the same person who took the course and passed the examination related to the course. No person assigned by the court to attend a mature driver motor vehicle crash prevention co urse shall be eligible for such reduction in premium charges. B.

Such insurers may allow an appropriate reduction in premium charges to all eligible persons upon successfully completing an approved crash prevention course via the Internet or other electronic means subject to the provisions of subsection A. E. Upon succes sfully completing the approved course, the courses sponsor shall issue to each participant a certificate approved by the Department of Motor Vehicles which shall be evidence of satisfactory completion of either a mature driver motor vehicle crash pre vention course or a driver improvement clinic for the reduction in premium charges.

CASE NOTES Purpose of section.  The obvious purpose of this section is to require a liability insurer which intends to rely on a breach of the terms and conditions of the policy contract, in def ense of any claim under the policy, to furnish prompt notice of such intention to the claimant or his attorney, so that steps may be taken by the claimant, a stranger to the insurance contract, to protect his rights. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 223 Va. 317, 288 S.E.2d 469, 1982 Va. LEXIS 204 (1982); Dan River, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 227 Va. 485, 317 S.E.2d 485, 1984 Va. LEXIS 218 (1984). Summary judgment was granted in favor of the insurer on whether the insurer had waived its right to invoke its defense of misrepresentation because, as a matter o f law, § 38.2-2226 was irrelevant to the insurers action, which sought a declaration that it was relieved from providing coverage because of an alleged misrepresentation in the policy application as to the regular operators of the insured vehicles . Cont'l Ins. Co. v. Matney, No. 1:03CV00082, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6885 (W.D. Va. Apr. 22, 2004). This statute was designed to inform injured claimant against alleged insured of a breach of policy terms which might cause the insured to become an uninsured motorist. Thus, the claimant would have knowledge in order that he might be able to comply with the demands of the uninsured motorist law. Gordon v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 675 F. Supp . 321, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12848 (E.D. Va. 1987). Legitimate interes t manifested through section.  Virginia, through this section, has manifested a legitimate interest in safeguarding the rights of persons injured within her boundaries. Federal Ins. Co. v. Nati onwide Mut. Ins. Co., 448 F. Supp. 723, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18529 (W.D. Va. 1978). The public policy of Virginia as set forth in this section is procedural for choice of law purposes since it does not affect the contractual relation between the insured and the insurer, but rather requires the insurer to give notice to the claimant when coverage is denied for breach of contract. Federal Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. C o., 448 F. Supp. 723, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18529 (W.D. Va. 1978). Section has no effect upon contractual relations between insured and insurer. Dan River, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 227 Va. 485, 317 S.E.2d 485, 1984 Va. LEXIS 218 (1984). Because § 38.2-2226 protected the rights of claimants who were strangers to a contract, and not an insured under a policy, it did not apply to bar an insurer f rom seeking to rescind increased limits to insureds directors and officers liability policy based on its claim that the insureds made material and false representations on the insurance application. Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Gross, No. 3:05CV159, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10079 (E.D. Va. Feb. 11, 2008). This section has no application to a noncoverage situation. Berry v. State Farm Mut. Auto . Ins. Co., 340 F. Supp. 228, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14303 (E.D. Va. 1972). Property owners claim against a contractor was not covered by the contractors claims-made-and-reported policy because the insurers potential liability ended when the policy expired 19 months before claim was first reported to it; the insurer did not raise a defense based on the insureds breach of policy, because there was no policy to be breached, and the insurer had no coverage obligation to defe nd against, so this provision did not apply to the insurers denial of coverage. Gateway Residences at Exch., LLC v. Ill. Union Ins. Co., 917 F.3d 269, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 6044 (4th Cir. 2019). And it does not apply to the provisions of the uninsured motorist statute or policy endorsement. Maxey v. Doe, 217 Va. 22, 225 S.E.2d 359, 1976 Va. LEXIS 235 (1976). This section starts the twenty-day period when the insurer has discovered both the claim and the breach of the policy. Thus, an insurer may not simply withhold the required notice until it makes a final determination to deny coverage under the policy. Morrel v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 188 F.3d 218, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 19035 (4th Cir . 1999). Date notice period begins to run.  Where it was undisputed that the injured claimants had not filed a proof of claim with the insurer and, although they had filed suit against the insured, they had not yet served him or the insurer, the forty-five day period within which the insurer was required to give notice of its intent to assert certain defenses had not yet begun to run and the insurer was not barred from asserting those defenses. U.S. Specia lty Ins. Co. v. Skymaster of Va., 123 F. Supp. 2d 995, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18142 (E.D. Va. 2000), aff'd, 26 Fed. Appx. 154, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 26786 (4th Cir. 2001). What discovery of breach entails.  Discovery of a breach entails, first, awareness by the insurer of facts tending to show there has been a violation of the policy provisions and, second, e valuation of those known facts culminating in a decision that a breach apparently has occurred. Morrel v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 188 F.3d 218, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 19035 (4th Cir. 1999). If there has been a breach of an insurance contract, this section specifically requires notice only to a claimant or his counsel. Maxey v. Doe, 217 Va. 22, 225 S.E.2d 359, 1976 Va. LEXIS 235 (1976). Insurer which fails to notify claimant within twenty-day statutory period waives its right to rely on the insureds breach. Morrel v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 188 F.3d 218, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 19035 (4th Cir. 1999). Insurer fails to comply with the statutory notification requisites.  Evidence showed without dispute that the landowners learned of the reservation of rights letter more than ten months after the statutory deadline; the insurer fai led to comply with the statutory notification requisites in this section and was barred from asserting a breach-of-policy defense. State Auto Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gorsuch, 323 F. Supp. 2d 746, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12583 (W.D. Va. 2004). Waiver occurs only where the rights of a claimant who is a stranger to the insurance contract may be prejudiced. Maxey v. Doe, 217 Va. 22, 225 S.E.2d 359, 1976 Va. LEXIS 235 (1976). This section does not operate as a waiver of insurers right to rely upon plaintiffs failure to file the SR-300 accident report. Maxey v. Doe, 217 Va. 22, 225 S.E.2d 359, 1976 Va. LEXIS 235 (1976). Insurance company satisfied this section by sending reservation of rights letters to defendant and by then forwarding copies of these letters to victims attorney. Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Everette, 875 F. Supp. 1181, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1701 (E.D. Va. 1995). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Insurer fails to comply with statutory notification requirements.  Self-insured rental car company was not entitled to escape payment on a subrogation claim by an insurer for payments the insurer made to its insured following an automobile accident involving the companys permissive lessee, even though the lessee was not cooperating with the company. The company had to provide notice to the insurer of its intent to rely on the provision that its lessee was not cooperating wit hin 45 days and the company had failed to provide such notice on the insurers property claim; as to the insurers personal injury claim, the company had failed to reference in its notice that it intended to rely on subsection C of § 46.2-368, t hus its notice was improper. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Budget Rent a Car Sys., 65 Va. Cir. 331, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 217 (Fairfax County Aug. 6, 2004).

Certi fication of an aircraft in a stated category by the Federal Aviation Administration; 2. Certification of a pilot in a stated category by the Federal Aviation Administration; 3. Establishing requirements for pilot experience; or 4. Restricting the use of the aircraft to the purposes stated in the policy. History History. 1970, c. 227, § 38.1-389.2; 1986, c. 562.

Every insur er issuing a new or renewal policy or contract covering liability arising from the ownership, maintenance or use of a private pleasure watercraft shall offer, in writing, to the named insured the option of purchasing coverage for damages which the insure d is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured private pleasure watercraft arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such uninsured watercraft. Such insurer shall be required to offer limits of liability for uninsu red private pleasure watercraft coverage equal to the limits of the liability insurance provided by the policy. However, no insurer shall be required to pay damages for uninsured private pleasure watercraft coverage in excess of the limits of uninsured p rivate pleasure watercraft coverage provided by the policy. Uninsured private pleasure watercraft coverage shall include coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability; provided, however, that such property damage liability coverage shall be ex cess over any other valid and collectible insurance of any kind applicable to the property.

Use of the following example disclosure constitutes compliance with this subsection: In connection with this application for insurance, we shall review your credit report or obtain or use an insur ance credit score based on the information contained in that credit report. We may use a third party in connection with the development of your insurance credit score. You may request that your credit information be updated and if you question the accura cy of the credit information, we will, upon your request, reevaluate you based on corrected credit information from a consumer reporting agency. 2. If an insurer takes an adverse action, based in whole or in part, upon credit information, the insurer shall provide notice to the applicant or insured that the adverse action was base d, in whole or in part, on credit information. Such notice shall also either include a statement advising the applicant or insured of the primary factors or characteristics that were used as the basis for the adverse action, or notify the applicant or in sured that he may request such information. For the purposes of this section, adverse action means a denial, nonrenewal or cancellation of, an increase in any charge for or refusal to apply a discount, or placement in a less favorable tier, or a reductio n or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or amount of, any insurance, existing or applied for, in connection with underwriting, tier placement or rating of insurance based on the applicants or insureds credit information. Adverse action includes circumstances where due to his credit information the applicant or insured (i) receives a higher rate, (ii) is placed in a less favorable tier, and (iii) when there are multiple companies available within a group of insurers, rec eives coverage in a less favorably priced company of the group. Notice is required when the effect of the credit information would put the applicant or insured in a worse position than if the credit information had not been considered. In the case of ren ewals, the circumstances listed in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall not be deemed adverse actions if, due to the insureds credit information, the insured is not receiving a less favorable rate or placed in a less favorable tier or company than duri ng the policy period immediately preceding renewal. B. If an insur er uses credit information from a consumer report for tier placement or rating of its renewal business for a policy of motor vehicle insurance, as defined in § 38.2-2212, issued or delivered in this Commonwealth the insurer shall be required to update the credit information at least once every three years, provided, however, that the insurer shall be required to update an insureds credit information within the three-year period if requested by the insured. If an update request is made by the insu red at least 45 days prior to the end of the policy term, any adjustment to the premium required by the update of the insureds credit information shall take effect at the first renewal following the request for update of the insureds credit infor mation. If an update request is made by the insured within 45 days of the end of the policy term, the insurer shall have the option of applying any adjustment to the premium required by the update of the insureds credit information to the first renew al or the second renewal following the request for update of the insureds credit information. An insurer need not update the credit information more frequently than once every policy term. Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection, no insur er need obtain updated credit information if the insured has the most favorably priced tier or rate based on his credit information. C. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subdivision A 3 of § 38.2-1904, if an insurer issuing or delivering a policy of motor vehicle insurance, as defined in § 38.2-2212, in this Commonwealth is unable to obtain credit information from a consumer report or when an insured or applicant has insufficient credit to produce an insurance credit score, the insurer shall underwrite, tier, or rate the individual risk in one of the following ways: (i) as if the risk received a neutral or average insurance credit score, as defined by the insurer, (ii) by excluding the use of credit information as a factor and using only other underwriting, tiering, or rating criteria, or (iii) in accordance with established underwriting guidelines or filed tiering or rating rules. Any such established underwriting guidelines or filed tiering or rating rules shall consider other actuarially justified factors associated with the risk in addition to the inability to obtain credit information or the insufficiency of the credit information. D. The followi ng factors shall not be used as credit criteria or to determine an insurance credit score for underwriting, tier placement, or rating purposes for a policy of motor vehicle insurance, as defined in § 38.2-2212, issued or delivered in this Commonwealth : 1. Infor mation that has been identified by the consumer reporting agency as disputed by the consumer and coded as such, if the use of such disputed information would result in an adverse action; 2. Information that has been identified by the consumer reporting agency as related to insurance inquiries or nonconsumer-initiated inquiries and coded as such; 3. Information that has been identified by the consumer reporting agency as related to collection accounts with a medical industry code; 4. Information that includes multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency as being from the home mortgage industry and made within 30 days of one another, unless o nly one inquiry is considered; 5. Information that includes multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency as being from the automobile lending industry and made within 30 days of one another, unl ess only one inquiry is considered; 6. Income, gender, address, zip code, ethnic group, race, color, religion, marital status, or nationality of the consumer; or 7. The total available line of credit; however, an insurer may consider the total amount of outstanding debt in relation to the total available line of credit. E. No insurer shall take an adverse action against an applicant for a policy of motor vehicle insurance, as defined in § 38.2-2212, issued or delivered in this Commonwealth, based on credit information, unless an insurer obtains and uses a consumer report procured within 90 days from the date the policy is first written. F. Notwithstan ding anything to the contrary, for a policy of motor vehicle insurance, as defined in § 38.2-2212, issued or delivered in this Commonwealth, an insurer may, upon request, provide reasonable exceptions for an individual whose credit information is dire ctly and adversely impacted by a catastrophic event, as determined by the insurer, including catastrophic illness or injury or the death of a spouse or member of the same household. The insurer may require reasonable documentation of the event prior to g ranting an exception. No insurer shall be deemed out of compliance with its filed rules and rates as a result of granting an exception pursuant to this subsection. G. Upon the re quest of an insured or applicant with respect to a policy of motor vehicle insurance, as defined in § 38.2-2212, issued or delivered in this Commonwealth, for a reevaluation as set forth in this section, the insurer shall reevaluate the individual bas ed on corrected credit information from a consumer reporting agency. If the reevaluation results in a lower premium, the lower premium shall be applied retroactively to the effective date of the current policy term, and the insurer shall either refund or credit the amount to the insured. The insurer may require reasonable documentation of the corrected information from the consumer reporting agency prior to the reevaluation. H. An insurer shall indemnify, defend, and hold agents harmless from and against all liability, fees, and costs arising out of or relating to the actions, errors, or omissions of an agent who obtains or uses credit information or insurance credit scores for an insurer , provided the agent follows the instructions or procedures established by the insurer and complies with any applicable law. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to provide an applicant or insured with a cause of action that does not exist in th e absence of this subsection. I. No consumer reporting agency shall provide or sell data or lists that include any information that in whole or in part was submitted in conjunction with an insurance inquiry about an individuals credit information or a request for a consumer report or an insura nce credit score. Such information includes the expiration dates of an insu...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_38.2-2300"><akn:num>§ 38.2-2300</akn:num><akn:heading>Conditions; permitted contracts; approval</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Provide a means for establishing eligibility of a risk for obtaining insurance through the plan; 3. Underwrite the insurance and adjust and pay losses on the insurance; 4. Appoint a service company or companies to perform functions enumerated in this subsection; 5. Provide a means for the equitable apportionment of profits or losses and expenses among participating insurers; 6.

All policie s issued by the Association shall be subject to the group retrospective premium adjustment and to the stabilization reserve fund required by § 38.2-2906. No policy form shall be used by the Association unless it has been filed with the Commission and either (i) the Commission has approved it or (ii) thirty days have elapsed and the Commission has not disapproved the form or endorsement for one or more of the reasons enumerated in subsection A of § 38.2-317. B. Policies sh all be issued by the Association, after receipt of the premium or portion of the premium prescribed by the plan of operation, to applicants that (i) meet the minimum underwriting standards of the Association, and (ii) have no unpaid or uncontested premiu m due as evidenced by the applicant having failed to make written objection to premium charges within thirty days after billing. C. Any policy issued by the Association may be cancelled for any one of the following reasons: 1. Nonpa yment of premium or portion of the premium; 2. Suspension or revocation of the insureds license to conduct business; 3. Failure of the insured to meet the minimum underwriting standards; 4. Failure of the insured to meet other minimum standards prescribed by the plan of operation; or 5. Nonpayment of any stabilization reserve fund charge. D. The rates, rating plans, rating rules, rating classifications, premium payment plans and territories applicable to the insurance written by the Association, and related supplementary rate information shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 20 (§ 38.2-2000 et seq.) of this title. Due consideration shall be given to the past and prospective loss and expense experience for the line, subclassification or type of commercial liability insurance written in this Commonwealth, trends in the frequency and severity of losses, the investment income of the Association, and other information the Commission requires. All rates shall be on an actuarially sound basis, giving due consideration to the stabilization reserve fund, and shall be calculated to be self-supportin g. The Commission shall take all appropriate steps to make available to the Association the loss and expense experience of insurers writing or having written the same line, subclassification or type of commercial liability insurance in this Commonwealth. E. All policie s issued by the Association shall be subject to a nonprofit group retrospective premium adjustment to be approved by the Commission under which the final total premium for all policyholders for each line, subclassification or type of commercial liability insurance issued each year by the Association, as a group, will be calculated based upon the experience of all such policyholders. The experience of all such policyholders shall be calculated following the end of each year and shall be based upon earned premiums, administrative expenses, loss and loss adjustment expenses, and taxes, plus a reasonable allowance for contingencies and servicing, for each line, subclassification or type of commercial liability insurance. Policyholders shall be given full c redit for all investment income, net of expenses and a reasonable management fee on policyholder supplied funds. Any final premium resulting from a retrospective premium adjustment will be collected from those moneys in the stabilization reserve fund set forth in § 38.2-2906 that are attributable to the policies written for the particular line, subclassification or type of commercial liability insurance or group of such risks for which activation occurred pursuant to § 38.2-2901. The maximum premi um for all policyholders as a group shall be limited as provided in § 38.2-2906. F. 1. If the stabilization reserve fund account for one or more lines, subclassifications or types of commercial liability insurance is exhausted in the payment of the maximum final premium for all such policies issued during the year for which a deficit exists, the Association shall certify to the Commission the estimated amount of any remai ning deficit for any years policies. Within sixty days after such certification, the Commission shall authorize the Association to recover from the members their respective share of such deficit. No member insurer may be assessed in any year an amoun t greater than two percent of the members direct gross premium income as defined in § 58.1-2500 from liability insurance for the calendar year preceding the assessment. If an assessment in any year is not sufficient to eliminate such deficit, a li ke assessment may be made the ensuing year but not thereafter. 2. A member shall be permitted to recover any assessment made by the Association under subdivision 1 of this subsection by deducting the members share of the deficit from future premi um taxes due the Commonwealth. The amount of premium tax deduction for each members share of the deficit shall be apportioned by the Commission so that in the aggregate, the total premium tax deduction permitted for all members in any one taxable yea r shall not exceed 0.05 of one percent of the direct gross premium income for the liability insurance written by member insurers defined in subsection A of § 38.2-2901. To the extent that the said 0.05 of one percent is reached in any one taxable year , any amount not so offset may be carried over to a subsequent year or years. G. In the even t that sufficient funds are not available for the sound financial operation of the Association, subject to recoupment as provided in this chapter and the plan of operation, all members shall, on a temporary basis, contribute to the financial requirements of the Association in the manner provided in this chapter. The contribution shall be reimbursed to the members by the procedure set forth in subdivision 2 of subsection F of this section. H. The Commiss ion shall examine the business of the Association as often as it deems appropriate to make certain that the group retrospective premium adjustments are being calculated and applied in a manner consistent with this section. If the Commission finds that th e group retrospective premium adjustments are not being made in a manner consistent with this section, it shall issue an order to the Association, specifying (i) how such calculation and application are not consistent and (ii) stating what corrective act ion shall be taken.

When an Ass ociation is activated under this chapter, a stabilization reserve fund shall be created for the lines, subclassifications and types of commercial liability insurance for which such activation occurred. The fund shall be administered by five directors app ointed by the Commission, one of whom shall be a representative of the Commission, two of whom shall be representatives of the Association, and two of whom shall be representatives of the Associations policyholders. B. The directo rs of the fund shall act by majority vote of those present with three directors constituting a quorum for the transaction of any business or the exercise of any power of the fund. The directors shall serve without salary, but each director shall be reimb ursed for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of his or her official duties as a director of the fund. The directors shall not be subject to any personal liability with respect to the administration of the fund. C. Each policy holder shall pay to the Association a stabilization reserve fund charge equal to one-third of the annual premium due for commercial liability insurance obtained through the Association. The means of payment shall be set forth in the plan of operation and shall be separately stated in the policy. The Association shall cancel the policy of any policyholder who fails to pay the stabilization reserve fund charge. Upon the termination of any policy during the term of the policy, payments made to the stabiliz ation reserve fund shall be returned to the policyholder on a pro rata basis identical to that applied in computing that portion of the premium which is returned to the policyholder. D. All moneys received by the fund shall be held in a separate restricted cash account or accounts under the sole control of an independent fund manager to be selected by the directors of the fund. The fund manager shall account separately for the moneys paid to the f und for each years policies written for a given line, subclassification or type of commercial liability insurance. The fund manager may invest the moneys held, subject to the approval of the directors. All investment income shall be credited to the f und. All expenses of administration of the fund shall be charged against the fund. The moneys held shall be used solely for the following purposes: (i) to reimburse the Association for any and all expenses, taxes, licenses and fees paid by the Associatio n which are properly chargeable or allocable to the stabilization reserve fund, and (ii) to pay any retrospective premium adjustment charge levied by the Association. Payment of retrospective premium adjustment charges and other authorized payments shall be made by the directors of the fund upon certification to them by the Association of the amount due. If all moneys accruing to the fund for a particular years policies for a given line, subclassification or type of commercial liability insurance ar e exhausted in payment of retrospective premium adjustment charges for the particular year, all liability and obligations of the holders of said policies with respect to the payment of retrospective premium adjustment charges shall terminate and shall be conclusively presumed to have been discharged. E. The Associa tion shall promptly pay the fund manager all stabilization reserve fund charges that it collects from its policyholders under subsection C of this section. F. Upon dissol ution of the Association, all assets remaining in the fund shall be distributed equitably to the policyholders who have contributed to the fund under procedures authorized by the directors. Distribution of assets remaining in the fund shall be made after final disposition of all claims, expenses, and liabilities against the fund, including reimbursement of preliminary organizational assessments made pursuant to subsection B of § 38.2-2904.

Rev. 547 (1953). § 38.2-3100.1. Forms of insurance authorized. Text A. Life insura nce and annuities shall be issued only in the following forms: 1. Indiv idual life insurance and annuities; or 2. Group life insurance and annuities. B. Pursuant to the authority granted by § 38.2-223, the Commission may promulgate such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to govern insurers practices with regard to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or presence of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), including advertising practices, underwriting practices, policy provisions, claim practices, or other practices with regard to individual or group life insurance and annuities, delivered or issued for delivery in the Commonwealth of Virgini a and certificates or evidences of coverage, issued under any contract delivered or issued for delivery in the Commonwealth of Virginia. History History. 1989, c. 653. § 38.2-3100.2. Funding agreements. Text A. Any insurer that is licensed to write life insurance or annuities in the Commonwealth may deliver, or issue for delivery, funding agreements in the Commonwealth. B. As used in this section funding agreement is inclusive but not limited to guaranteed investment contracts, guaranteed interest contracts, unallocated group contracts, investment contracts, or other similar instrument by whatever name, and means an agreement that authorizes the insurer to accept funds and that provides for an accumulation of funds for the purpose of making one or more payments in fixed or variable amounts, or in both, that are not based on mortality or morbidity contingencies. C. Funding agr eements may be issued to persons to fund (i) benefits under any employee benefit plan as defined in the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. § 1002 (3)) maintained in the United States or a foreign country; (ii) the activ ities of any organization exempt from taxation under section 501 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar organization in any foreign country; (iii) any program of the government of the United States, the government of any state, foreign country, or political subdivision thereof; (iv) any agreement providing for one or more payments in satisfaction of a claim; (v) any program of any individual or entity that has assets in excess of $25,000,000; or (vi) any program of any individual or entity that is registered with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. D. Amounts pai d to the insurer and proceeds applied under optional modes of settlement under a funding agreement may be allocated by the insurer to its general account and to one or more separate accounts. The assets of any such separate account shall not be chargeabl e with liabilities arising out of any other business that the insurer conducts. Where separate accounts are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of the insurer, a risk charge shall be paid on not less than a quarterly basis f rom the respective separate account to the general account to provide appropriate compensation and to fund an appropriate reserve, if any, for the risks to the general account. E. No licensed insurer shall make an agreement in the Commonwealth providing for the allocation of funding agreement amounts to a separate account until such insurer has filed with the Commission a statement as to its methods of operation of such separate account and the Commission has approved such statement. Subject to the approval of the Commission, any such statement may apply to one or more groups of separate accounts classified by investment policy, number or kinds of separate account participants, methods of d istribution of such agreements or otherwise. In determining whether or not to approve any such statement, the Commission shall consider, among other things, the history, reputation and financial stability of the insurer and the character, experience, res ponsibility, competence, and general fitness of the officers and directors of the insurer. An amendment of any such statement that changes the investment policy of a separate account shall be treated as an original filing. F. A funding a greement delivered or issued for delivery in the Commonwealth shall not qualify as or be considered to be life insurance, an annuity, or any other form of insurance defined and classified in Article 2 (§ 38.2-101 et seq.) of Chapter 1 of this title, b ut shall constitute transacting an insurance business in the Commonwealth. G. For any fun ding agreement assets held in the insurers general account, or for any other obligations due under the funding agreement from the insurers general account, the funding agreement shall be treated as an insurance contract, and the holder of the fun ding agreement shall be entitled to the same priority of distribution as other policyholders for the purposes of clause (ii) of subdivision B 1 of § 38.2-1509. H. Any domesti c insurer that has established separate accounts in connection with funding agreements and has allocated funds to such separate accounts shall file with the Commission, in addition to the annual statement required by § 38.2-1300, any other periodic or special reports the Commission prescribes. I. An insurer that has established a separate account pursuant to this section shall not transfer any assets to such separate account from any of its other accounts, including its general account, unless the transfer to such separate account is authorized by the Commi ssion.

Requirements of life insurance or annuity contracts used to fund preneed funeral contracts. Text A. For purpose s of this section, preneed funeral contract means any agreement where payment is made by the insured prior to the receipt of services or supplies contracted for, which evidences arrangements prior to death for (i) the providing of funeral service s or (ii) the sale of funeral supplies. B. Each indivi dual and group life insurance policy issued or issued for delivery in Virginia, each individual and group annuity contract issued or issued for delivery in Virginia, and each certificate issued in connection with a group life insurance policy or group an nuity contract issued or issued for delivery in Virginia shall include a provision specifying the means by which face amount adjustments will be made and benefits payable upon death will be adjusted when such a policy or contract will be used to fund a p reneed funeral contract. C. Each insure r proposing to issue individual or group life insurance policies or individual or group annuity contracts in Virginia for purposes of funding preneed funeral contracts shall clearly disclose the intended purpose and market for such policies and contracts when submitting the forms with the Commission for approval, in accordance with § 38.2-316.

Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection C of this section, a domestic insurer shall not enter into an insurance contract upon the life or person of a resident of a reciprocal state unless the insurer is licensed in that state. C. The followi ng are exceptions to the provisions of subsection B of this section: 1. Contr acts entered into when the person insured, or proposed to be insured, is, at the time he signs the application, personally present in a state where the insurer is licensed; 2. Certificates issued under any lawfully issued group life or group accident and sickness policy, when the group policy is entered into in a state where the insurer is licensed; 3. Contracts made pursuant to a pension or retirement plan of an employer, when the contracts are applied for in a state where the employer is personally present or doing business and whe re the insurer is also licensed; or 4.

B. An express provision in the body of the policy limiting the liability of the insurer to an insured who, whether sane or insane, dies by his own act within two years from the date of the policy shall be valid but the insurer shall be obligated to return or pay at th e least the amount of the premium paid for the policy.

CASE NOTES Liberal construction.  The proviso of this section relating to suicide, the purpose of which was to preserve the common-law rule for the limited period of two years where provision to t hat effect is contained in the policy, should be given a liberal and not a strained construction. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, 118 F.2d 414, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 4020 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 629, 62 S. Ct. 60, 86 L. Ed. 505, 194 1 U.S. LEXIS 390 (1941). Provision limiting liability.  Any language showing that liability of the insurer under the policy shall not extend to death from suicide and that, in such event, the premiums paid on the polic y shall be returned, is a sufficient compliance with the requirements of this section. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, 118 F.2d 414, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 4020 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 629, 62 S. Ct. 60, 86 L. Ed. 505, 1941 U.S. LEXI S 390 (1941). Where plaintiff in Employee Retirement Income Security Act case appealed district courts entry of summary judgment in favor of insurer/administrator, suicide exclusion in the supplemental life insurance policy did not violate § 38.2-3106; exclusion sufficiently complied with Virginia law because a policy only needed to provide sufficient notice of an exclusion and its limit of two years to comply with the statute. Collins v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., 700 Fed. Appx. 205, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 12060 (4th Cir. 2017). Effect of suicide clause.  The suicide clause, whether it provides that the policy shall be void in case of suicide or that suicide is not a risk covered, is necessarily a limitation on cov erage. Its effect is to except death by suicide from the promise to pay the amount of the policy in case of death. New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, 118 F.2d 414, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 4020 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 314 U.S. 629, 62 S. Ct. 60, 8 6 L. Ed. 505, 1941 U.S. LEXIS 390 (1941). Policy taken out upon termination of coverage under group policy.  A policy of group life insurance provided for termination of coverage upon termination of employment but gave the employee the right to take out a policy without medical examination within 31 days after termination of employment, said policy to become effective at the end of this 31-day period. Insureds employment was terminated on October 2, 1954; he applied for and obtained a policy whose stated effective d ate was November 2, 1954; and committed suicide in April, 1955. The policy limited the companys liability to return of premiums if suicide occurred within two years from its effective date. Under the circumstances and the terms of the policy it was h eld that the new policy was not a continuation of the group insurance but a new and different policy and its provisions as to suicide would be given effect. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Kegley, 199 Va. 273, 99 S.E.2d 601, 1957 Va. LEXIS 188 (195 7). The defense of suicide, to avail, must exclude every hypothesis of accidental death. The party making the defense has the burden of proof. It will not be presumed. The mere fact that the body of an insured is found with a pistol in his hand and a bullet in his head is not sufficient to prove suicide. Cosmopolitan Life Ins. Co. v.

CASE NOTES Purpose of section.  This section and kindred laws are wise statutes of limitation. Insurance companies should not be permitted with shut eyes to receive in silence the profits of the ir contracts, and to grow articulate only when called upon to pay. The authorities are full-handed to show that such provisions are valid when a reasonable time is given the company in which to make inquiry, and are liberally construed in favor of the as sured. Harrison v. Provident Relief Ass'n, 141 Va. 659, 126 S.E. 696, 1925 Va. LEXIS 440 (1925). Incontestable pr ovision does not affect coverage.  The incontestable provision nowhere undertakes to define risks not assumed, and has nothing at all to do with coverage. It does apply, however, to conditions brok en. United Sec. Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v. Massey, 159 Va. 850, 167 S.E. 248 (1933). For this section does not deal with rights of litigants, but is one of limitation, wisel y conceived and to be liberally construed. If such section did not apply to false warranties and to conditions broken, it would be of little value. United Sec. Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v. Massey, 159 Va. 850, 167 S.E. 248 (1933). Incontestable clause construed in favor as assured.  It is agreed that as a rule the contract including the incontestable clauses should be liberally construed in favor of the assured and against the party who prepa red the contract; that is, against the assurer. Harrison v. Provident Relief Ass'n, 141 Va. 659, 126 S.E. 696, 1925 Va. LEXIS 440 (1925). It is for the benefit of the benefic iary.  While the contract is with the insured and not with the beneficiary, nevertheless, it is for the use of the beneficiary and there is no reason to say that the inc ontestable clause is not meant for his benefit as well as for the benefit of the insured. Harrison v. Provident Relief Ass'n, 141 Va. 659, 126 S.E. 696, 1925 Va. LEXIS 440 (1925). The incontestable statute is a short statute of limitation, applied when the validity of the policy is contested. It is not a limitation upon the amount of the coverage, nor of the risk assumed. It does not limit the right of the insurance carrier to refuse the payment of a larger sum than is made payable by the terms of the policy, nor lim it the right to contend that the terms of the policy exclude certain risks. Darden v. North Am. Benefit Ass'n, 170 Va. 479, 197 S.E. 413, 1938 Va. LEXIS 203 (1938). Effect of incontestability clause on material misrepresentation.  An insurer must contest a contracts validity for false or fraudulent statements within the period prescribed in the policy, thus, an incontestability clause f orecloses untimely challenges based on material misrepresentations in insurance applications. Nyonteh v. Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co., 958 F.2d 42, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 1524 (4th Cir. 1992). Which is a limitation for questioning truthfulness of answers.  Under this section the validity of the contract of life insurance as such, the truthfulness of the answers to the questions propounded to the applicant, and such like things, cannot be questioned by the insurer as a defense against the policy, after the expiration of what some of the courts have termed a short statute of limitations. United Sec. Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v. Massey, 159 Va. 832, 164 S.E. 529, 1932 Va. LEXIS 224 (1932), different results reached on reh'g, 159 Va. 832, 167 S.E. 248 (1933). Under the incontestable clause, the insurer may not contest the validity of the contract for false or fraudulent statements made by the insured to secure the poli cy, for questions involved in the inception of the policy, nor for breach of covenants and conditions subsequent by the insured, after liability has become fixed. But the statute does not deny to the insurance carrier the right to question the genuinenes s of the claim, controvert the amount of its liability, or to contend that the risk involved was not assumed in the coverage. Darden v. North Am. Benefit Ass'n, 170 Va. 479, 197 S.E. 413, 1938 Va. LEXIS 203 (1938). Commencement of contestability per iod.  Where plaintiff asserted that policy became incontestable two years after the date on which plaintiffs husband signed the application form and paid the first premium in advance, the clear language of subsection A and § 38.2-3305, and the clear language of the policy, precluded use of plaintiffs starting point for the commencement of the contestability period. The contestability period in husbands p olicy began to run on the date on the receipt which was part of the policy. Parkerson v. Federal Home Life Ins. Co., 797 F. Supp. 1308, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18158 (E.D. Va. 1992). What constitutes a contest.  An insurance company is not liable for a loss not covered by its policy, and a denial of liability for a loss not covered by the policy will not constitute a cont est. But if liability were denied because of some condition subsequently broken, that would be a contest within the purview of this section. United Sec. Life Ins. &amp; Trust Co. v. Massey, 159 Va. 850, 167 S.E. 248 (1933). Contest relating to coverage.  In an action on an insurance policy, the policy stated that the beneficiary should be entitled to only one fifth of the amount otherwise due, should the assured d ie of heart disease having its incipiency within two years from the date of the policy. Assured died of heart disease which had its inception within the two-year period, but plaintiff contended that this section (as it stood prior to the 1962 amendment) made the policy incontestable after one year from its date. It was held that the contest related to the coverage, and not to the validity of the policy, and hence this section had no application. Darden v. North Am. Benefit Ass'n, 170 Va. 479, 197 S.E. 4 13, 1938 Va. LEXIS 203 (1938). This section does not apply where premiums have not been paid and it does not apply to l osses not covered by the policy. Collins v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 163 Va. 833, 178 S.E. 40, 1935 Va. LEXIS 243 (1935). Recovery allowed o n policy covering life convict.  In view of this section, in regard to incontestable policies, it is not against public policy to permit a recovery upon a policy on the life of a life convict.

Contestable misrepresentations not limited to applicants.  While this section limits challenges based on material misrepresentations to those based on written statements, it is not only applicable to written statements ma de by the applicant. Thus, beneficiarys signing of reinstatement application which did not acknowledge his leukemia diagnosis could be classified as a misrepresentation under this section. Nyonteh v. Peoples Sec.

As used in this section:Employer means a person doing business in or operating within the Commonwealth who e mploys a resident of the Commonwealth to work for wages or a salary or on commission and includes any similar entity acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee. Employer does not include the Commonweal th or any of its agencies, institutions, or political subdivisions or any public body.Pension plan has the same meaning ascribed to that term in § 3(2) of ERISA.Retirement annuity contract means an allocated or unallocated group annuity contract that is issued or issued for delivery by an insurer to an employer or a pension plan, pension plan sponsor, or affiliate of such employer, pension plan, or pension plan sponsor, for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to employees or retirees of the employer under a defined benefit plan and that (i) is issued or issued for delivery in the Commonwealth or (ii) affects retired employees residing in the Commonwealth who are certi ficate holders or beneficiaries of a contract if the Commission has jurisdiction over the insurer issuing the contract. B. On or after July 1, 2018, no retirement annuity contract shall be transferred to or assumed by another insurer unless: 1. The t ransfer is made to an assuming insurer that has a rating equivalent of A or better from two or more nationally recognized rating agencies; or 2. The transfer to the assuming insurer is approved by the Commission, which approval shall not be granted unless the assuming insurer meets all of the requirements of § 38.2-1024. C. If the Comm ission determines that an insurer has violated this section or any order or regulation adopted hereunder, the Commission, after notice and opportunity to be heard, may impose a penalty in accordance with §§ 38.2-218 and 38.2-219.

Upon appointment and qualification of a trustee, the proceeds of the insurance shall be paid to the trustee to be held and disposed of under the terms of the will. If there is no valid will appointing a t rustee or if the trust provided by the will is invalid for any other cause, the designation of a trustee as beneficiary of the policy shall be void. If no qualified trustee makes claim to the proceeds from the insurer within one year after the death of t he insured, or if satisfactory evidence is furnished to the insurer within the one-year period showing that no trustee can qualify to receive the proceeds, payment shall be made by the insurer to the executors, administrators or assigns of the insured, u nless otherwise provided for by the owner of the policy, if the owner is other than the insured, or by the insured by agreement with the insurer. C.

Employer-employee relationship.  Ordinarily, an employee who is, in a sense, dependent on his or her employer for income will not satisfy the criteria necessary to claim a dependency exemption un der subsection B of § 38.2-3122; however, the court will not adopt a per se rule that prohibits a finding of dependency whenever there is any evidence of an employer-employee relationship. Instead, the court will examine the facts in each case, and in the instant matter, the existence of the employer-employee arrangement between debtor and her father was insufficient to carry the trustees burden of proof. In re Naranjo, 590 Bankr. 126, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 2244 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2018). Meaning of dependent on.  Plain meaning of the word dependent, as applied by the courts in Dry and Rigdon, should be assigned to the phrase dependent on set forth in subsection B of § 38.2-3122 rather than definition of the word dependent contained in § 34-4. In re Naranjo, 590 Bankr. 126, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 2244 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2018). Where defendant had an absolute right to disclaim the proceeds of her husbands life insurance policy, plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim against defendant-children was barred by this section. Abbott v. Willey, 253 Va. 88, 479 S.E.2d 528, 1997 Va. LEXIS 8 (1997). Life insurance exemptions found in this section and § 38.2-3123 are independent from homestead exemption found in Title 34 and are not limited by the provisions of § 34-21. In re Redmon, 31 Bankr. 756, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5960 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983). Section 34-21 does not limit debtors rights to exempt the cash surrender value of their life insurance policies pursuant to this section and § 38.2-3123. I n re Redmon, 31 Bankr. 756, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5960 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983). Equitable assignment.  Circuit court properly awarded an ex-wife her agreed-upon share (50%) of her ex-husbands insurance proceeds upon his death because her claim was not statutori ly barred since the final divorce decree that ratified and incorporated the parties property settlement agreement (PSA) created an equitable assignment superior to that of the new beneficiaries who were designated as such by the ex-husbands modif ication of the PSA two days prior to his suicide, no evidence suggests that the designation of the new beneficiaries was the product of a bilateral agreement supported by consideration, and they did not pursue any of the available defenses to a claimed e quitable assignment in the circuit court. Wood v. Martin, 299 Va. 238, 848 S.E.2d 809, 2020 Va. LEXIS 124 (2020). Bankruptcy.  This section could not be used to exempt life insurance proceeds payable to the debtor from a policy owned by her late husband because this section protects the p roceeds of a life insurance policy only against creditors of the insured, not creditors of the beneficiary. In re Martinez, No. 09-19927-SSM, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 1331 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Mar. 30, 2011). Debtors interest in the cash value of an insurance policy was exempt pursuant to § 38.2-3122, notwithstanding the language of § 38.2-3123, because the t wo statutes could not reasonably be harmonized, and the language of subsection F of § 38.2-3122 implicitly repealed § 38.2-3123. In re Bowman, 582 Bankr. 899, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 55 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2018). § 38.2-3122.1. Annuity contract purchased to fund retirement benefits; protection from creditors claims. Text A.

The nonforf eiture benefit referred to in § 38.2-3309 shall be available to the insured in the event of default in premium payments, after premiums have been paid for three full years. The premium paid for the insured under any policy provision shall not be consi dered in default. The nonforfeiture benefit shall be a stipulated form of insurance, effective from the due date of the defaulted premium, the net value of which shall at least equal the reserve at the date of default on the policy and on any dividend ad ditions to the policy, exclusive of the reserve on account of return premium insurance and on total and permanent disability and additional accidental death benefits, less a sum not more than 2 1/2 percent of the amount insured by the policy and of any d ividend additions to the policy and less any existing indebtedness to the insurer on or secured by the policy. The policy shall specify the mortality table and rate of interest used in computing these reserves. Instead of allowing a deduction from the re serve of a sum not more than 2 1/2 percent of the amount insured by the policy, and of any dividend additions to the policy, the insurer may insert in the policy a provision that one-fifth of the reserve may be deducted, or may provide in the policy that a deduction may be made of 2 1/2 percent of the amount insured by the policy or one-fifth of the reserve, at the insurers option. The cash surrender value referred to in § 38.2-3309 shall be available upon surrender of the policy to the insurer w ithin one month of the due date of the defaulted premium and shall at least equal the sum which would otherwise be available for the purchase of insurance. The insurer may defer payment for not more than three months after the application for the cash su rrender value is made. C. If more tha n one option is provided, the policy shall stipulate which of the options shall be effective if the insured does not elect any option on or before the expiration of the grace period allowed for the payment of the premium. D. A provision may also be inserted in the policy that in the event of default in a premium payment before the options become available, the reserve on any dividend additions then in force may, at the insurers option, be paid in cash or applied as a net premium to the purchase of paid-up term insurance for any amount not exceeding the face amount of the original policy. E. This sectio n shall apply to term insurance policies only if the term is for more than twenty years. History History.

That in the event of default in any premium payment, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of the du e date, in the amount specified in this article. Instead of the stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent al ternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit that provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits. 2.

The provisi ons of this section shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date as defined in § 38.2-3209. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, the adjusted premium for any life insurance policy issued on or after the operative da te stated in § 38.2-3214 shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be a uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding any extra premiums charged because of impairments or special hazards, so that the present value at the date of issue of the policy of all adjusted premiums is equal to the sum of: (i) the then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; (ii) two percent of the amount of insurance, if the ins urance is uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount as defined in subsection B of this section if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy; (iii) forty percent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year; and (iv) twenty-five percent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less. However, in applying the percentages specified in (iii) and (iv) of this subsection, no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed four percent of the amount of insurance or level amount equivalent to the amount o f insurance. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined. B. The equival ent uniform amount of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy is the level amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the sam e age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy. However, for a policy providing a varying amount of insurance iss ued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by the policy at age ten. C. The adjuste d premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by a rider or a supplemental policy provision shall equal (i) the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without the term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for the term insurance benefits are payable by (ii) the adjusted premiums for the term insurance. Items (i) and (ii) of this subsection shall be calculated separately and as specified in subsections A and B of this section. For the purposes of items (ii), (iii), and (iv) of subsection A of this section, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in item (ii) of this subsection shall equal th e excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in item (i) of this subsection.

In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with any accompanying pure endowment offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more t han those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance; 5.

If the Commission approves by regulation any Commissioners Standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the NAIC for use in determining the min imum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual; and 7.

B. The basic c ash value shall equal the present value on that anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits that would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as defined in this section, corresponding to premiums that would have fallen due on and after that anniversary.

Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at a rate of interest of three percent per year; and b. The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued. 2.

The percentages of net considerations shall be 65 percent of the net consideration for the first contract year and 87 1/2 percent of the net considerations for the second and later contract years. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sentence, the percentage shall be 65 percent of the portion of the tot al net consideration for any renewal contract year that exceeds by not more than two times the sum of those portions of the net considerations in all prior contract years for which the percentage was 65 percent. C. For contrac ts providing for fixed scheduled considerations, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be calculated on the assumption that considerations are paid annually in advance and shall be the same as for contracts with flexible considerations that are paid annual ly with two exceptions: 1.

F. The followi ng provisions shall apply for contracts issued on or after July 1, 2005, and at the election of the insurer may apply also to specified contracts issued on or after July 1, 2004. An insurer may make this election on a contract-form-by-contract-form basis by filing written notice with the Commission and specifying a date for the provisions to apply prior to July 1, 2005. 1. The m inimum nonforfeiture amount at or any time before the beginning of any annuity payments shall equal an accumulation up to that time at rates of interest, as indicated in subdivision 3, of the net considerations as defined in this subsection, paid prior t o that time, and decreased by the sum of: a. Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision 3; b. An annual contract charge of $50, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision 3; c. Any premium tax paid by the insurer for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as indicated in subdivision 3, adjusted for any tax that is not actually paid or which has b een credited back to the insurer, such as upon early termination of the contract; and d. The amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract, including interest due and accrued. 2. The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be equal to 87.5 percent of the gross considerations credited to the contract dur ing that contract year. 3. The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent per annum and the following, which sha ll be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset: a. The five-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent, specified in the contract no longer than 15 months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date under this subdivision; b. Reduced by 125 basis points; c. Where the resulting interest rate is not less than 15 basis points (0.15 percent); and d. The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date, basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the cont ract. The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five-year Constant Maturity Treasury Rate to be used at each redetermination date. 4. During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in subdivision 3 b by up to an additi onal 100 basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit. The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit. The Commissio n may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit. Where administration is lacking or unacceptable, the Commission may, at its discretion, disallow or limit the additional red uction. G.

Therefore, subdivision B 2 of § 38.2-3304 prohibited the use of the medical examination form because it was not attached to the policy when delivered to the deceased. Hammond v. Pac. Mut. Life Ins.

CASE NOTES The obvious purpose of this section is to require an insurance company to display on the face and on the back of a policy a description of its nature and form in order that a prospective purchaser may know what type of insurance he is purchasing. Such requirement is for the benefit of the prospective purchaser and he is entitled to rely on it. While it may not be strictly accurate to say that such an endorsement is a part of the contract of insurance, in construing the contract the policy must be considered as a whole and the endorsement read in connection with the remainder thereof, as an aid in arriving at the intention of the parties.

CASE NOTES Accident defined.  An accident is an event that takes place without ones foresight or expectation, an undesigned, sudden, and unexpected event; further, it is generally held tha t if the insured voluntarily provokes or is the aggressor in an encounter, and knows, or under the circumstances should reasonably anticipate, that he will be in danger of death or great bodily harm as the natural or probable consequence of his act or co urse of action, his death or injury is not caused by an accident within the meaning of such a policy. Harris v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., 222 Va. 45, 278 S.E.2d 809, 1981 Va. LEXIS 271 (1981). Issue of accident improp erly decided by court.  In an action claiming that defendant insurance company breached a contract insuring plaintiffs husband against accidental death or dismemberment, where eviden ce showed that the husband was stabbed to death by another woman with whom he lived after the husband had disciplined the womans child and pushed the woman, the trial court erred in deciding as a matter of law that the husbands death was not an a ccident, since whether the husband should have anticipated that his disciplining the child or his pushing the woman would lead to a violent reaction presented a factual issue dependent on the relationship of the parties and the circumstances of the incid ent.

Text A. No insuranc e contract providing hospital, medical, surgical and similar or related benefits, and no subscription contract or health services plan delivered or issued for delivery or providing for payment of benefits to or on behalf of persons residing in or employe d in this Commonwealth shall contain any provision providing for subrogation of any persons right to recovery for personal injuries from a third person. B. No such con tract, subscription contract or health services plan shall contain any provision requiring the beneficiary of any such contract or plan to sign any agreement to pay back to any company issuing such a contract or creating a health services plan any benefi ts paid pursuant to the terms of such contract or plan from the proceeds of a recovery by such a beneficiary from any other source; provided, that this provision shall not prohibit an exclusion of benefits paid or payable under workers compensation l aws or federal or state programs, nor shall this provision prohibit coordination of benefits provisions when there are two or more such accident and sickness insurance contracts or plans providing for the payment of the same benefits. Coordination of ben efits provisions may not operate to reduce benefits because of any benefits paid, payable, or provided by any liability insurance contract or any benefits paid, payable, or provided by any medical expense or medical payments insurance provided in conjunc tion with liability coverage. C. No insuranc e contract providing hospital, medical, surgical and similar or related benefits, and no subscription contract or health services plan delivered or issued for delivery or providing for payment of benefits to or on behalf of persons residing in or employe d in this Commonwealth shall contain any provision limiting, restricting, or prohibiting a physician from disclosing fully all medical treatment options to patients whether or not such treatment options are (i) experimental or covered services, (ii) serv ices that the health insurer will not authorize, or (iii) the costs of the treatment will be borne by the health insurer or the patient to facilitate an informed decision by the patient, if the physician determines that such an option is in the best inte rest of the patient. For the purposes of this subsection, medical treatment options means any alternative or experimental therapeutic, psychiatric, medical treatment or procedure, health care service, drug, or remedy. D. Whenever be nefits paid or payable under workers compensation are excluded from coverage under the terms of any such contract, subscription contract or health services plan, the issuer thereof shall not exclude coverage for any medical condition pursuant to such exclusion if (i) an award of the Workers Compensation Commission pursuant to § 65.2-704 denies compensation benefits relating to such medical condition and no request for review of such award is made pursuant to and within the time prescribed by § 65.2-705 or (ii) an award of the Workers Compensation Commission, after review by the full Commission pursuant to § 65.2-705, denies compensation benefits relating to such medical condition. Following the entry of a workers compensation a ward pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) having the effect of prohibiting the application of any such exclusion, the issuer shall immediately provide coverage for such medical condition to the extent otherwise covered under the contract, subscription contract or health services plan. If, upon appeal to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, such medical condition is held to be compensable under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act (Title 65.2), the issuer may recover from the applicable employer or workers compensation insurance carrier the costs of coverage for medical conditions found to be compensable under the Act.

CASE NOTES Purpose of section.  This section was enacted by the General Assembly to reverse the holding in Collins v. Blue Cross, 213 Va. 540, 193 S.E.2d 782 (1973), that a conventional subrogat ion provision in a hospital indemnity contract was not invalid as contrary to public policy. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Smith, 218 Va. 881, 241 S.E.2d 794, 1978 Va. LEXIS 241 (1978). ERISA preemption.  This section is not preempted by ERISA where the plan at issue is an insurance plan, and not a self-funded or self-insured plan. Whitlinger v. Cont'l Cas. Co., 12 9 F. Supp. 2d 924, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 829 (E.D. Va. 2001). This section proscribes a subrogation provision in the policy. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Smi th, 218 Va. 881, 241 S.E.2d 794, 1978 Va. LEXIS 241 (1978). Subrogation of medical expense payments under a motor vehicle insurance policy is prohib ited by this section. Berczek v. Erie Ins. Group, 259 Va. 795, 529 S.E.2d 89, 2000 Va. LEXIS 74 (2000). Offset of social security payments is not subrogation.  Subsection A addresses only subrogation and subrogation is not at issue where, in accordance with the terms of the policy, an insurer that has paid disability ben efits seeks reimbursement for past payments and an offset against future payments based the amount of the claimants social security benefits. Subrogation involves the insurer stepping into the shoes of the insured and attempting to recover from the t hird party who caused the injury and the insurer did not assert a right to step into the insureds shoes or pursue a claim against the social security administration. Whitlinger v. Cont'l Cas. Co., 129 F. Supp. 2d 924, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 829 (E.D. Va. 2001). Responsible explicitly refers to responsibility for the injuries themselves, not to responsibility for their treatment or for other financial loss occasioned thereby. Hines v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 788 F.2d 1016, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24530 (4th Cir. 1986). Responsible means causally responsible. Hines v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 788 F.2d 1016, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24530 (4th Cir. 1986). The ordinary meaning of a person responsible for such injuries is the person who caused the injuries, who did the damage. The Virginia Supreme Court has used responsible in this way as well. Hines v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 788 F.2d 1016, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24530 (4th Cir. 1986). Workers compensation as ot her insurance.  If this section is to be consistent with § 38.2-3509, other insurance, including workers compensation, must be differentiated from recovery from a tortfeasor. A contract may eliminate duplication of benefits when the benefits come from workers compensation and the injured partys insurer, but not when they are derived from a health insurance carrier and a tortfeasor. Workers compensation is regarded as other insurance for the purposes of § 38.2-3509. For the purposes of this section, workers compensation should be regarded as akin to other insurance rather than to recovery from a tortfeasor. Hines v. Blue Cross Blue Shiel d, 788 F.2d 1016, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24530 (4th Cir. 1986). This section does not operate to prohibit provisions that exclude coverage when there has already been recovery under workers compensation law. Hines v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 788 F.2d 1016, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24530 (4th Cir. 1986). Statute inapplicable t o disability insurance.  By its terms, this section only applies to insurance contract[s] providing hospital, medical, surgical and similar or related benefits and subscriptio n contract[s] and health services plan[s]; it does not apply to disability insurance. Whitlinger v. Cont'l Cas. Co., 129 F. Supp. 2d 924, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 829 (E.D. Va. 2001). Section was inapplicable.  In case in which insurer sought to recover moneys advanced to plan participant after she was injured in an auto accident, this section was not applicable, as the case concerned a dispute over the terms of the insurance contract itself, and the contract did not provide for subrogation against a third party. All insurer sought was the money it paid out to the insured; it did not seek to step into her shoes. Provid ent Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Waller, 906 F.2d 985, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 10813 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 982, 111 S. Ct. 512, 112 L. Ed. 2d 524, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 5907 (1990) (declining to consider the issue of preemption by federal ERISA provis ions). Preempted by ERISA.  This section is preempted by ERISA because it makes reference to the types of employee benefit plans governed by ERISA in that it prohibits the enforcement of sub rogation and reimbursement provisions in subscription contracts and health services plans and because it has some connection to ERISA in that it imposes on plans regulated by the statute a regulatory scheme that is not employed by other states.

CASE NOTES Purpose of section.  The legislative intent was to except such payments or benefits to one entitled thereto from all claims of creditors. The legislative purpose of this statute was t o protect from the claims of creditors such a policyholder who might be overtaken by accident or sickness and who has become entitled to benefit payments and thus likely prevent him and his family from becoming an object of public charity. Atlantic Life Ins. Co. v. Ring, 167 Va. 121, 187 S.E. 449, 1936 Va. LEXIS 283 (1936). Exemption from setoff.  While this section does not in express terms mention setoff along with the lien of a judgment, etc., yet it must be remembered that such statutes being remedial they should have a liberal construction in order that the legislative intent and purpose may be accomplished. The exemption of such payments from setoff finds strong support in the textbooks and in decided cases. There are few cases to the contrary. Atlantic Life Ins. Co. v. Ring, 167 Va. 121, 187 S.E. 449, 1936 Va. LEXIS 283 (1936); Norfolk S. Ry. v. Lassiter, 193 Va. 360, 68 S.E.2d 641, 1952 Va. LEXIS 144 (1952). Exemption from bankruptcy estate.  Debtors long term disability insurance benefit was found to be exempt from inclusion in her bankruptcy estate, pursuant to § 38.2-3406 and 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(1); the objecting trustee failed to show the policy was not issued within the State of Virginia. In re Neal, 344 Bankr. 456, 2004 Bankr. LEXIS 2456 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2004). Statute inapplicable to disa bility policy.  On its face, this statute applies to liens and levies under accident and sickness insurance policies, and not a setoff/ reimbursement provision in a disability in surance policy. Whitlinger v. Cont'l Cas. Co., 129 F. Supp. 2d 924, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 829 (E.D. Va. 2001). § 38.2-3406.1. Application of requirements that policies offered by small employers include state-mandated health benefits. Text A. As used in this section:Eligible individual means an individual who is employed by a small employer and has satisfied applicable waiting period requirements.Health insurance coverage means benefits consist ing of coverage for costs of medical care, whether directly, through insurance or reimbursement, or otherwise, and including items and services paid for as medical care under a group policy of accident and sickness insurance, hospital or medical service policy or certificate, hospital or medical service plan contract, or health maintenance organization contract, which coverage is subject to this title or is provided under a plan regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Health insurer means any insurance company that issues accident and sickness insurance policies providin g hospital, medical and surgical, or major medical coverage on an expense-incurred basis, a corporation that provides accident and sickness subscription contracts, or any health maintenance organization that provides a health care plan that provides, arr anges for, pays for, or reimburses any part of the cost of any health care services, that is licensed to engage in such business in the Commonwealth, and that is subject to the laws of the Commonwealth that regulate insurance within the meaning of § 5 14(b)(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)).Small employer has the same meaning ascribed to the term in § 38.2-3431.State-mandated health benefit means coverage required under this title or other laws of the Commonwealth to be provided in a policy of accident and sickness insurance or a contract for a health-related condition that (i) includes coverage for specific health care services or benefits; (ii) places limitations or restrictions on deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or any annual or lifetime maximum benefit amounts; or (iii) includes a specific category of licensed health care practitioners from whom an insured is entitled to receive care. State-mandated health benefit includes, without limitation, any coverage, or the offering of coverage, of a benefit or provider pursuant to §§ 38.2-3407.5 through 38.2-3407.6:1, 38.2-3407.9:01, 38.2-3407.9:02, 38.2-3407.11 through 38.2-3407.11:3, 38.2-3407.16, 38.2-3408, 38.2-3411 through 38.2-3414.1, 38.2-3418 through 38.2-3418.14, or § 38.2-4221. For purposes of this article, state-mandated health benefit does not include a benefit that is mandated by federal law. B. Notwithstan ding any statute, rule, or regulation to the contrary, and for the purposes of this section, a group accident and sickness insurance policy providing hospital, medical and surgical, or major medical coverage on an expense-incurred basis; a group accident and sickness subscription contract providing health insurance coverage for eligible individuals; and a health care plan that provides, arranges for, pays for, or reimburses any part of the cost of any health care services that is offered, sold, or issue d by a health insurer to a small employer: 1. Shall not be required to include coverage, or the offer of coverage, for any state-mandated health benefit, except for: a. Coverage for mammograms pursuant to § 38.2-3418.1; b. Coverage for pap smears pursuant to § 38.2-3418.1:2; c. Coverage for PSA testing pursuant to § 38.2-3418.7; and d. Coverage for colorectal cancer screening pursuant to § 38.2-3418.7:1. 2. May include any, or none, of the state-mandated health benefits not otherwise noted in subdivision B 1 as the health insurer and the small employer shall agree.Notwithstanding any prov ision of this section to the contrary, if any plan authorized by this section includes and offers health care services covered by the plan that may be legally rendered by a health care provider listed in § 38.2-3408, that plan shall allow for the reim bursement of such covered services when rendered by such provider. Unless otherwise provided in this section, this provision shall not require any benefit be provided as a covered service. C. Any applica tion and any enrollment form used in connection with coverage under this section shall prominently disclose that the policy, contract, or evidence of coverage is not required to provide state-mandated health benefits, shall prominently disclose any and a ll state-mandated health benefits that the policy, subscription contract, or evidence of coverage does not provide, and shall clearly describe all eligibility requirements. D. A policy fo rm, subscription contract, or evidence of coverage issued under this section to a small employer shall prominently disclose any and all state-mandated health benefits that the policy, subscription contract, or evidence of coverage does not provide. Such disclosure shall also be included in certificate forms or other evidences of coverage furnished to each participant. Health insurers proposing to issue forms providing coverage under this section shall clearly disclose the intended purposes for such poli cies, contracts, or evidences of coverage when submitting the forms to the Commission for approval in accordance with § 38.2-316. E. The Commiss ion shall adopt any regulations necessary to implement this section. F. The provisi ons of this section shall not apply in any instance in which the provisions of this section are inconsistent or in conflict with a provision of Article 6 (§ 38.2-3438 et seq.) of Chapter 34.

Acts 2009, cc. 796 and 877, cl. 3 provides: That health insurers offering plans pursuant to § 38.2-3406.1 of the Code of Virginia shall report annually to the Bureau of Insurance on the number of small employers and individuals using plans issued pursuant to such section, the coverage provided, and the cost of premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.

One or more insurers may offer or administer a health benefit program under which the insurer or insurers may offer preferred provider policies or contracts that limit the numbers and types of providers of health care services eligible for payment as preferred prov iders. B. Any such in surer shall establish terms and conditions that shall be met by a hospital, physician or type of provider listed in § 38.2-3408 in order to qualify for payment as a preferred provider under the policies or contracts. These terms and conditions shall n ot discriminate unreasonably against or among such health care providers. No hospital, physician or type of provider listed in § 38.2-3408 willing to meet the terms and conditions offered to it or him shall be excluded. Neither differences in prices a mong hospitals or other institutional providers produced by a process of individual negotiations with providers or based on market conditions, or price differences among providers in different geographical areas, shall be deemed unreasonable discriminati on. The Commission shall have no jurisdiction to adjudicate controversies growing out of this subsection. C. Mandated ty pes of providers set forth in § 38.2-3408, and types of providers whose services are required to be made available and that have been specifically contracted for by the holder of any such policy or contract shall, to the extent required by § 38.2-3 408, have the same opportunity to qualify for payment as a preferred provider as do doctors of medicine. D. Preferred p rovider policies or contracts shall provide for payment for services rendered by nonpreferred providers, but the payments need not be the same as for preferred providers. E. An insurer may offer individual or group exclusive provider policies or contracts if: 1. The i nsurer provides or includes a benefit for preferred and nonpreferred providers in accordance with the provisions of subsection D to a group contract holder to be provided or offered as a benefit for the enrollee, at the enrollees option, individually to accept or reject. In connection with its group enrollment application, every insurer shall, at no additional cost to the group contract holder, make available or arrange with a carrier to make available to the prospective group contract holder and to all prospective enrollees, in advance of initial enrollment and in advance of each reenrollment, a notice in form and substance approved by the Commission as required under § 38.2-316, that accurately and completely explains to the group contract hol der and prospective enrollee the benefit for preferred and nonpreferred providers and permits each enrollee to make his election. The form of notice provided in connection with any reenrollment may be the same as the approved form of notice filed under § 38.2-316 used in connection with initial enrollment and may be made available to the group contract holder and prospective enrollee by the carrier in any reasonable manner; and 2. The insurer provides out-of-network emergency services at the minimum level required by the preferred provider policy or contract. F. For the pur poses of this section, exclusive provider policies or contracts are insurance policies or contracts that condition the payment of benefits on the use of preferred providers, and preferred provider policies or contracts are insurance polic ies or contracts that specify how services are to be covered when rendered by preferred and nonpreferred classifications of providers.

CASE NOTES Legislative distinction.  The application of this section to insured preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and not to uninsured PPOs, is a distinction created by the Virginia legislatur e. Richter v. Capp Care, Inc., 868 F. Supp. 163, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16979 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd, 77 F.3d 470, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 7962 (4th Cir. 1996). Statute preempted by ERISA.  This statute at the very least indirectly bears upon, and therefore relates to, employee benefit plans covered by ERISA, and is preempted by ERISA as prescribed b y Congress. Furthermore, because the statute does not regulate insurance, or the business of insurance, the statute is not thereby saved from preemption. HCA Health Servs. of Va., Inc. v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 803 F. Supp. 1132, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1661 6 (E.D. Va. 1992). Though Virginia statute regulates the relationship between the insurer and insured through the formation of the insurers preferred provider organization (PPO) , it is nonetheless a law regulating the business of insurance, for statute satisfied the three criteria of transferring or spreading policyholders risk, it is an integral part of the policy relationship between insurer and insured, and it is express ly limited to entities within the insurance industry and thus, ERISAs insurance savings clause exempts the Virginia statute from application of preemption clause. Stuart Circle Hosp. Corp. v. Aetna Health Mgt., 995 F.2d 500, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 1300 3 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1003, 114 S. Ct. 579, 126 L. Ed. 2d 478, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 7516 (1993). The any willing provider provisions only apply to insurance preferred provider organizat ions (PPOs) within the insurance industry, and regulates the relationship between insurer and insured and the type of policy which could be issued. Richter v. Capp Care, Inc., 868 F. Supp. 163, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16979 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd, 77 F.3d 470, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 7962 (4th Cir. 1996). Insurer has considerable latitude in determining manner in which it selects preferred provider.  The language of this section suggests that an insurer has considerable latitude in determining the manner in which it selects a preferred provider for its preferr ed provider organization (PPO). This section does not define terms and conditions but rather implies that such terms are variable and dependent upon the specific context in which a PPO is established.

Communicat ion of selection criteria to all providers.  Health insurance company fulfilled its legal duty by establishing and communicating to all providers with which it negotiated the selection criteria used to devis e a short list of eligible providers. HCA Health Servs. of Va., Inc. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 752 F. Supp. 202, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16499 (E.D. Va. 1990). Proposal of targeted lower per diem rate is a valid negotiating technique.  Health insurance companys proposal at the onset of negotiations of a targeted per diem rate that is lower than the prices charged by the hospitals is a valid negotiating technique. HCA Health Servs. of Va., Inc. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 752 F. Supp. 202, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16499 (E.D. Va. 1990). Selection criteria functional equivalent of statutorily required terms and conditions.  Selection criteria used by health insurance company to devise a short list of eligible providers with which the company would engage in price negotiations were th e functional equivalent of statutorily required terms and conditions. HCA Health Servs. of Va., Inc. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 752 F. Supp. 202, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16499 (E.D. Va. 1990). Statute prohibits unreasonable discrimination.  This section does not mandate nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; rather, it prohibits unreasonable discrimination against or among providers. Reasonable dis crimination between providers is necessary to establish a limited network that can effectively reduce costs by inducing hospitals to lower prices in exchange for a greater market share. HCA Health Servs. of Va., Inc. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 752 F. Supp. 202, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16499 (E.D. Va. 1990). Exclusion of certain providers did not unreasonably discriminate among providers.  Neither the exclusion of institutional providers that deliver specialized rather than general acute care services nor the exclusion of providers whose services ha ve not been heavily utilized in the past by the insurers beneficiaries unreasonably discriminates among providers for the purpose of establishing a preferred provider organization. HCA Health Servs. of Va., Inc. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 752 F. Supp. 202, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16499 (E.D. Va. 1990). Division of territory into areas reflecting usage of providers does not discriminate among providers.  The division of a territory into service areas that reflect the population usage of providers does not inherently unreasonably discriminate against or among provi ders. HCA Health Servs. of Va., Inc. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 752 F. Supp. 202, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16499 (E.D. Va. 1990). Discrimination in credential ing not found.  Preferred provider organizations credentialing policy to deny the applications of physicians who have been disciplined for professional misconduct did not dis criminate unreasonably against plaintiff. There was no evidence to show that defendant accepted the applications of other similarly situated physicians who were disciplined by the Virginia Board of Medicine or that defendants consideration, in its cr edentialing, of plaintiffs reprimand by the Virginia Board of Medicine for professional misconduct was an unreasonable criterion.

Th is term includes a benefit consortium established under Chapter 55 (§ 59.1-589 et seq.) of Title 59.1. 1.

For purposes of this subsection: Bank means an institution that has or is eligible for insurance of deposits by the Fed eral Deposit Insurance Corporation. Plan-sponsoring organization means an association that (i) sponsors a MEWA composed on ly of banks; (ii) has been actively in existence for at least five years; (iii) has been formed and maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining insurance; (iv) does not condition membership in the association on any health status-related f actor relating to an individual, including an employee of an employer or a dependent of an employee; (v) makes health insurance coverage offered through the association available to all members regardless of any health status-related factor relating to s uch members or individuals eligible for coverage through a member; (vi) does not make health insurance coverage offered through the association available other than in connection with a member of the association; and (vii) meets such additional requireme nts as may be imposed under the laws of the Commonwealth, and includes any subsidiary of such an association.

CASE NOTES Ripeness.  Where the Commonwealth of Virginia claimed that § 1501 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 26 U.S.C.S. § 5000A, was directly at tension with § 38.2-3430.1:1, the case was ripe for review, despite the fact that § 1501 did not go into effect until 2014, because the issues presented were purely legal and further development of the factual record would not clarify the issues for judicial re solution. Commonwealth ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 702 F. Supp. 2d 598, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 77678 (E.D. Va. 2010), vacated, 656 F.3d 253, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 18632 (4th Cir. 2011). Standing.  Commonwealth of Virginia lacked standing to challenge the individual health insurance mandate under 26 U.S.C.S. § 5000A. There was no genuine conflict between the individual mandate and the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act, § 38.2-3430.1:1, a non-binding declaration that apparently functioned only to declare Virginias opposition to a federal insurance mandate; the Virginia Health Care Freedom Act reflec ted no exercise of sovereign power because Virginia lacked the authority to nullify federal law. Virginia ex rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 656 F.3d 253, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 18632 (4th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 567 U.S. 951, 133 S. Ct. 59, 183 L.

For purpose s of this article:Eligible individual means an individual: 1. (i) fo r whom, as of the date on which the individual seeks coverage under this section, the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage is 18 or more months and (ii) whose most recent prior creditable coverage was under individual health insurance coverage , a group health plan, governmental plan, church plan, or a state plan under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.), or health insurance coverage offered in connection with any such plan; 2. Who is not eligible for coverage under (i) a group health plan, (ii) part A or part B of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, or (iii) a state plan under Title XIX of such Act, or a ny successor program, and does not have other health insurance coverage; 3. With respect to whom the most recent coverage within the coverage period described in subdivision 1 was not terminated based on a factor described in subdivision B 1 or B 2 of § 38. 2-3430.7 relating to nonpayment of premiums or fraud; 4. If the individual had been offered the option of continuation coverage under a COBRA continuation provision or under a similar state program, who elected such coverage; 5. Who, if the individual elected such continuation coverage, has exhausted such continuation coverage under such provision or program; and 6. In the case where individual health insurance coverage is the most recent creditable coverage, the coverage was nonrenewed by the health insurance issuer under the conditions allowed i n subdivision C 2 of § 38.2-3430.7, in which case the aggregate period of creditable coverage required is reduced to 12 months.For the purposes of determining the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage under subdivision B 1 (i) of this sectio n, a period of creditable coverage shall not be counted with respect to enrollment of an individual under a health benefit plan if, after such period, there was a 63-day period during all of which the individual was not covered under any creditable cover age or was not serving a waiting period for coverage under a group health plan, or for group health insurance coverage or was in an affiliation period. This period shall begin on the day following an individuals termination of coverage and shall cont inue until the date an individual submits an application for coverage. In those cases where an application is submitted by mail, the date of postmark shall be deemed to be the date the application is submitted.

B. No coverage offered under this article shall exclude an employer based solely on the nature of the employers business. C.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Private right of action.  In the medical services providers action against an insurer to recover the difference between the amount billed and the amount paid by the insurer, the court overruled the insurers demurrer on the providers allegation that the insured failed to reimburse the provider in accordance with this section because the court held that this section created a private right of action. Dominion Surgical Specialist s, LLC v. Anthem Healthkeepers, Inc., 104 Va. Cir. 229, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 13 (Fairfax County Feb. 10, 2020). Court did not err in finding that § 38.2-3445 created a private right of action where the Code provisions title did not preclude providers from having such a right, and the statutes language did not indicate that a health carriers duty was limited to payments to the patient/member nor did it indicate that the provider did not have a right to recover. Dominion Surgical Specialists, LLC v. Anthem Hea lthkeepers, Inc., 105 Va. Cir. 255, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 87 (Fairfax County June 30, 2020). § 38.2-3445.01. Balance billing for certain services; prohibited. Text A. No out-of-n etwork provider shall balance bill an enrollee for (i) emergency services provided to an enrollee or (ii) nonemergency services provided to an enrollee at an in-network facility if the nonemergency services involve surgical or ancillary services provided by an out-of-network provider. B. An enrollee that receives services described in subsection A satisfies his obligation to pay for the services if he pays the in-network cost-sharing requirement specified in the enrollees or applicable group health plan contract. The enrollees obligation sh all be determined using the carriers median in-network contracted rate for the same or similar service in the same or similar geographical area. The carrier shall provide an explanation of benefits to the enrollee and the out-of-network provider that reflects the cost-sharing requirement determined under this subsection. The obligation of an enrollee in a health benefit plan that uses no median in-network contracted rate for the services provided shall be determined as provided in § 38.2-3407.3. C. The health carrier and the out-of-network provider shall ensure that the enrollee incurs no greater cost than the amount determined under subsection B and shall not balance bill or otherwise attempt to collect from the enrollee any amount greater than such amount. Additional amounts owed to health care providers through good faith negotiations or arbitration shall be the sole responsibility of the carrier unless the carrier is prohibited from providing the additional benefits under 26 U.S.C. § 223(c)(2) or any other federal or state law. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude a provider from collecting a past due balance on a cost-sharing requirement with interest. D. The health carrier shall treat any cost-sharing requirement determined under subsection B in the same manner as the cost-sharing requirement for health care services provided by an in-network provider and shall apply any cost-sharing amount paid by the enrollee for such services toward the in-network maximum out-of-pocket payment obligation. E. If the enro llee pays the out-of-network provider an amount that exceeds the amount determined under subsection B, the provider shall refund the excess amount to the enrollee within 30 business days of receipt. The provider shall pay the enrollee interest computed d aily at the legal rate of interest stated in § 6.2-301 beginning on the first calendar day after the 30 business days for any unrefunded payments. F. The amount paid to an out-of-network provider for health care services described in subsection A shall be a commercially reasonable amount, based on payments for the same or similar services provided in a similar geographic area. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of a clean claim from an out-of-network provider, the carrier shall offer to pay the provider a commercially reasonable amount. If the out-of-network provider disputes the carriers payment, the provider shall notify the carrier no later than 30 calen dar days after receipt of payment or payment notification from the carrier. If the out-of-network provider disputes the carriers initial offer, the carrier and provider shall have 30 calendar days from the initial offer to negotiate in good faith. If the carrier and provider do not agree to a commercially reasonable payment amount within 30 calendar days and either party chooses to pursue further action to resolve the dispute, the dispute shall be resolved through arbitration as provided in § 38. 2-3445.02. G. The carrier shall make payments for services described in subsection A directly to the provider. H. Carriers sh all make available through electronic and other methods of communication generally used by a provider to verify enrollee eligibility and benefits information regarding whether an enrollees health plan is subject to the requirements of this section.

If , in addition to employees or individuals, any class of dependents may participate fully in the wellness program, such reward shall not exceed 30 percent of the cost of the coverage in which any employee or individual and any dependents are enrolled; 2. The wellness program is reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease; 3. The health carrier gives individuals eligible for the program the opportunity to qualify for the reward under the program at least once each year; 4. The full reward under the wellness program is made available to all similarly situated individuals. The reward is not available to all similarly situated individuals for a period unles s the wellness program allows for a reasonable alternative standard or waiver of the otherwise applicable standard for obtaining the reward for any individual for whom, for that period, (i) it is unreasonably difficult due to a medical condition to satis fy the otherwise applicable standard or (ii) it is medically inadvisable to attempt to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard. The health carrier may seek verification, such as a statement from an individuals physician, that a health status factor makes it unreasonably difficult or medically inadvisable for the individual to satisfy or attempt to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard; and 5. The health carrier discloses, in all health benefit plan materials describing the terms of the wellness program, the availability of a reasonable alternative standard or the possibilit y of waiver of the otherwise applicable standard required under subdivision 4. If plan materials disclose that such a program is available without describing its terms, the disclosure under this subdivision shall not be required. History History. 2013, c. 751.

A health carrier may base the average paid to a network provider on what that health carrier pays to providers in the network applicable to the covered persons specific health benefit plan, or across all of its health benefit plans offered in the Commonwealth. B. Incentives may include, but are not limited to, cash payments, gift cards, or credits or reductions of premiums, copayments, or deductibles. Health carriers may let covered persons decide which method they prefer to receive the incentive. C. The incenti ve program shall provide covered persons with an incentive for each service or category of comparable health care service resulting from comparison shopping by covered persons. A health carrier is not required to provide a payment or credit to a covered person when the health carriers saved cost is $25 or less. D. A health ca rrier shall determine the allowed amount paid or payable by that health carrier to network providers for that comparable health care service on the basis of the average allowed amount for the procedure or service under the covered persons health bene fit plan. Such determination shall be made on the basis of the average of the allowed amounts using data collected over a reasonable period not to exceed one year. A health carrier may determine an alternate methodology for calculating the average allowe d amount if approved by the Commission. A health carrier shall, at minimum, inform covered persons of their eligibility for an incentive payment and the process to request the average allowed amount for a procedure or service on the health carriers w ebsite and in health benefit plan materials.

Eligibility for an incentive payment may require a covered person to demonstrate, through reasonable documentation such as a quote from the health care provider, that the covered person shopped prior to receiving care from the health care provider who charges less for the comparable health care service than the average allowed amount paid or payable by that health carrier. Health carriers shall provide additional mechanisms for the covered person to satisfy this requirement by utilizing the health carriers cos t transparency website or toll-free number, established under this article.

Except as p rovided in § 38.2-3505, each individual accident and sickness insurance policy delivered or issued for delivery in this Commonwealth shall contain the provisions specified in this section using the same words which appear in this section. Provisions 1 through 12 shall apply to all such policies. In addition, provision 13 shall apply to all such policies that are delivered, issued for delivery, renewed, or extended in this Commonwealth on or after January 1, 2001. An insurer may substitute correspondi ng provisions of different wording approved by the Commission that are in each instance not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary. These provisions shall be preceded individually by the caption REQUIRED PROVISIONS or by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the Commission may approve. 1. Provi sion 1:ENTIRE CONTRACT; CHANGES: This policy, including the endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of insurance. No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an executive officer of the Company and unle ss such approval is endorsed hereon or attached hereto. No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions. 2. Provision 2:TIME LIMIT ON CERTAIN DEFENSES: (a) Misstatements in the application: After two years from the date of this policy, only fraudulent misstatements in the application may be used to void the policy or deny any claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) that starts after the two-year period.Provision 2 shall not be construed to affect any legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim d uring such initial two-year period, nor to limit the application of subdivisions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of § 38.2-3504 in the event of misstatement with respect to age, occupation or other insurance.Instead of Provision 2, a policy which the insured has th e right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium (i) until at least age 50 or, (ii) for a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue, may contain the following provision, from which the cl ause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurers option:INCONTESTABLE: (a) Misstatements in the application: After this policy has been in force for two years during the Insureds lifetime (excluding any period during which the Insured is disabled), the Company cannot contest the statements in the application.PREEXISTING CO NDITIONS: (b) No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) that starts after one year from the date of issue of this policy will be reduced or denied because a sickness or physical condition, not excluded by name or specific description before the date of loss, had existed before the effective date of coverage. 3. Provision 3:GRACE PERIOD: This policy has a . . . . . . . . day grace period. This means that if a renewal premium is not paid on or before the date it is due, it may be paid during the following . . . . . . . . days. During the grace period the policy shall continue in force.In Provision 3 a number not less than 7 for weekly premium policies, 10 for monthly premium policies and 31 for all other policies sh all be inserted between the words a and day, and between following and days. However, if provisions of federal law require a policy to have a grace period in excess of one month, the period of time that the policy shall co ntinue in force during the grace period shall not be required to exceed one month from the beginning of the grace period.A policy that contains a cancellation provision may add, at the end of Provision 3: subject to the right of the Company to cancel in accordance with the cancellation provision.A policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal shall have, in Provision 3, the following sentence:The grace period will not apply if, at least . . . . . . . . days before the pr emium due date, the Company has delivered or has mailed to the Insureds last address shown in the Companys records written notice of the Companys intent not to renew this policy.In the above sentence a number not less than 7 for weekl y premium policies, 10 for monthly premium policies and 31 for all other policies shall be inserted between the words least and days. 4. Provision 4:REINSTATEMENT: If the renewal premium is not paid before the grace period ends, the policy will lapse. Later acceptance of the premium by the Company or by an agent authori zed to accept payment, without requiring an application for reinstatement, will reinstate the policy. If the Company or its agent requires an application for reinstatement, the Insured will be given a conditional receipt for the premium. If the applicati on is approved the policy will be reinstated as of the approval date. Lacking such approval, the policy will be reinstated on the forty-fifth day after the date of the conditional receipt unless the Company has previously written the Insured of its disap proval. The reinstated policy will cover only loss that results from an injury sustained after the date of reinstatement and sickness that starts more than 10 days after such date. In all other respects the rights of the Insured and the Company will rema in the same, subject to any provisions noted or attached to the reinstated policy. Any premiums the Company accepts for a reinstatement will be applied to a period for which premiums have not been paid. No premiums will be applied to any period more than 60 days prior to the date of reinstatement.The last sentence of Provision 4 may be omitted from any policy that the Insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (i) until at least age 50, or (ii) for a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its effective date. 5. Provision 5:NOTICE OF CLAIM: Written notice of claim must be given within 20 days after a covered loss starts or as soon as reasonably possible. The notice can be given to the Company at . . . . . . . . (insert the location of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose), or to the Companys agent.

The Insured need not do this if legally incapacitated. The first six months after any filing of proof by the Insured or any payment or denial of a claim by the Company will not be counted in applying this provision. If the Insured delays in giving this n otice, the Insureds right to any benefits for the six months before the date the Insured gives notice will not be impaired. 6. Provision 6:CLAIM FORMS: When the Company receives the notice of claim, it will send the Claimant forms for filing proof of loss. If these forms are not given to the Claimant within 15 days after the giving of such notice, the Claimant shall meet the proof of loss requirements by giving the Company a written statement of the nature and extent of the loss within the time limit stated in the Proofs of Loss Section. 7. Provision 7:PROOFS OF LOSS: If the policy provides for periodic payment for a continuing loss, written proof of loss must be given the Company within 90 days after the end of each peri od for which the Company is liable. For any other loss, written proof must be given within 90 days after such loss. If it was not reasonably possible to give written proof in the time required, the Company shall not reduce or deny the claim for this reas on if the proof is filed as soon as reasonably possible. In any event, except in the absence of legal capacity, the proof required must be given no later than one year from the time specified. 8. Provision 8:TIME OF PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: After receiving written proof of loss, the Company will pay . . . . . . . . (Insert period for payment which must not be less frequently than m onthly) all benefits then due for . . . . . . . . (Insert type of loss). Benefits for any other loss covered by this policy will be paid as soon as the Company receives proper written proof. 9. Provision 9:PAYMENT OF CLAIMS: Benefits will be paid to the Insured. Loss of life benefits are payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation in effect at the time of payment. If none is then in effect, the benefits will be paid to the Insureds estate. Any other benefits unpaid at death may be paid, at the Companys option, either to the Insureds beneficiary or the Insureds estate.Optional paragraph: If benefits are payable to the Insureds estate or a beneficiary who cannot execute a valid release, the Company can pay benefits up to $ . . . . . . . . (insert an amount which shall not exceed $2,000), to someone related to the Insured or beneficiary by blood or by marriage whom the Company considers to be entitled to the benefits. The Company will be discharged to the extent of any payment made in good faith.Optional paragraph: The Company may pay all or a portion of any indemnities provided for health care services to the health care services provider, unless the Insured directs otherwise in writing by the time proofs of loss are filed. The Company cannot require that the services be rendered by a particular health care services provider. 10. Provision 10:PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS AND AUTOPSY: The Company at its own expense has the right to have the Insured examined as often as reasonably necessary while a claim is pending. It may also have an autopsy made unless prohibited by law. 11.

Provisions 1 through 7, 8 b, and 9 through 11 shall apply to all such policies that are issued for delivery, delivered, renewed, or extended in this Commonwealth on or after January 1, 2001. The insurer may use a corresponding provision of different wording approved by the Commission that is not less favorable in any respect to the Insured or the beneficiary. Any such provision shall be preceded individually by the appropriate caption OTHER PROVISIONS or by such appropriate in dividual or group captions or subcaptions as the Commission may approve. 1. Provi sion 1:CHANGE OF OCCUPATION: If the Insured is injured or contracts sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the Company as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the Company will pay only the portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the Company for the more hazardous occupation. If the Insured changes his occupation to one classified by the Company as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the Company, upon receipt of proof of the change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly and will return the excess pro rata unearn ed premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is more recent. In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the Company prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the Company is liable or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation with the state insurance supervisory official in the state where the Insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if the filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the Company in the state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the da te of proof of change in occupation. 2. Provision 2:MISSTATEMENT OF AGE: If the Insureds age has been misstated, the benefits will be those the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age. 3.

(insert maximum limit of indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all premiums paid for suc h excess shall be returned to the Insured or to his estate.Instead of Provision 3, the following provision may be used:Insurance effective at any one time on the Insured under a like policy or policies in this Company is limited to the one such policy el ected by the Insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may be, and the Company will return all premiums paid for all other such policies. 4. Provision 4:INSURANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES: If there is other valid coverage, not with this Company, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or on an expen se incurred basis and of which this Company has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount wh ich would otherwise have been payable under this policy plus the total of the like amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this Company had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss, an d for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the like amount of such ot her coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.If Provision 4 is included in a policy that also contains Provision 5, the phrase EXPENSE INCURRED BENEFITS shall be added to th e caption of Provision 4. The insurer may include in this provision a definition of other valid coverage, approved by the Commission. The definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction of the United States or Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Commission .

In applying Provision 4 no third party liability coverage shall be included as other valid coverage. 5. Provision 5:INSURANCE WITH OTHER COMPANIES: If there is other valid coverage, not with this Company, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis and of which this Company has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided under this policy for such lo ss as the like indemnities of which the Company had notice, including the indemnities under this policy, bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata p ortion for the indemnities thus determined.If Provision 5 is included in a policy that also contains Provision 4, the phrase OTHER BENEFITS shall be added to the caption of Provision 5. The insurer may include in this provision a definition of other valid coverage, approved by the Commission.

For the purpose of applying Provision 5, any amount of benefit provided for the insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute, including any workers compensation or employers liability statute, whether provided by a governmental ag ency or otherwise, shall in all cases be deemed to be other valid coverage of which the Company has had notice. In applying Provision 5 no third party liability coverage shall be included as other valid coverage. 6. Provision 6:RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE: If the total monthly amount of loss of time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss of time coverage upon the Insured, w hether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the Insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which a claim is made, which ever is greater, the Company will be liable only for the proportionate amount of the benefits under this policy as the amount of the monthly earnings or the average monthly earnings of the Insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the sam e loss under all the coverage upon the insured at the time the disability commences and for the return of the part of the premiums paid during such two years that exceeds the pro rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but t his shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all the coverage upon the Insured below the sum of $200 or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in the coverages, whichever is less, nor shall it operate to reduce be nefits other than those payable for loss of time.Provision 6 may be inserted only in a policy that the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (i) until at least age 50 or (ii) for a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may include in this provision a definition of valid loss of time coverage approved by the Commission. The definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provide d by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this Commonwealth or any other jurisdiction of the United States or Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approv ed by the Commission or any combination of coverages.

Annotations CASE NOTES Under this statute, the insurer cannot deny the insured benefits unless his medical expenses are fully covered by other insurance, here workers compensation. The proviso enables the insurers to prevent the insured from receiving multiple recoveries in excess of total medical expenses. Hines v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, 788 F.2d 1016, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24530 (4th Cir. 1986). Workers compensation as ot her insurance.  If § 38.2-3405 is to be consistent with this section, other insurance, including workers compensation, must be differentiated from recovery from a tortfeasor. A contract may eliminate duplication of benefits when the benefits come from workers compensation and the injured partys insurer, but not when they are derived from a health insurance carrier and a tortfeasor. Workers compensation is regarded as other insurance for the purposes of this section. For the purposes of § 38.2-3405, workers compensation should be regarded as akin to other insurance rather than to recovery from a tortfeasor. Hines v.

No sound health requirement or exclusion of preexisting illness may be enforced if the applicant did not know or might not reasonably have been expected t o know about the insureds condition. Sharp v. Richmond Life Ins. Co., 212 Va. 229, 183 S.E.2d 132, 1971 Va. LEXIS 334 (1971). § 38.2-3514.1. Preexisting conditions provisions. Text A. In determin ing whether a preexisting conditions provision applies to an insured, all coverage shall credit the time the person was covered under previous individual or group policies providing hospital, medical and surgical or major medical coverage on an expense i ncurred basis if the previous coverage was continuous to a date not more than thirty days prior to the effective date of the new coverage, exclusive of any applicable waiting period under such coverage. B. As used her ein, a preexisting conditions provision means a policy provision that limits, denies, or excludes coverage for charges or expenses incurred during a twelve-month period following the insureds effective date of coverage, for a condition that, during a twelve-month period immediately preceding the effective date of coverage, had manifested itself in such a manner as would cause an ordinarily prudent person to seek diagnosis, care, or treatment, or for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within twelve months immediately preceding the effective date of co verage or as to pregnancy existing on the effective date of coverage. C. This sectio n shall not apply to the following insurance policies or contracts: 1. Short -term travel; 2. Accident-only; 3. Limited or specified disease contracts; 4. Long-term care insurance; 5. Short-term nonrenewable policies or contracts of not more than six months duration which are subject to no medical underwriting or minimal underwriting; 6. Policies subject to Article 4.1 (§ 38.2-3430.1 et seq.) of Chapter 34 of this title; 7. Policies or contracts designed for issuance to persons eligible for coverage under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, known as Medicare, or any other similar coverage under state or federal government plans; and 8. Disability income. History History. 1995, c. 522; 1997, c. 291; 1999, c. 1004. Annotations Editors note.

Renewability of coverage. Text A.

CASE NOTES No private right of action.  Beneficiary, who while he was hospitalized, was advised by the administrator of an employee group health plan, that the plan was unable to continue coverage, sinc e he was no longer an employee, although the plan provided the beneficiary with the necessary information for extending coverage, failed to show that the administrator, the plan, the employer, and the insurer violated §§ 38.2-3416 and 38.2-3541 by failing to provide the beneficiary with notice of his rights to continuation and conversion coverage upon termination of his coverage and by refusing to allow the estate administrator to elect such coverage because these provisions did not provide a priv ate right of action, and in any event, the insurer actually offered both continuation and conversion coverage options, although neither provision required any such notice to an individual whose group coverage had been terminated.

Written policy required.  While oral insurance contracts are generally enforceable if the essential elements are adequately proven, this rule does not apply to an oral contract for credit insurance. The statute governing credit accident and sickness insurance requires that all credit insurance be evidenced by a written policy, certificate, or statement and sets forth the required provisions of such instruments. First Protection Life Ins. Co. v. Compton, 230 Va. 166, 335 S.E.2d 262, 1985 Va. LEXIS 264 (1985). Some elements may be supplied by inference.  By statute, a policy, certificate, or statement of credit accident or sickness insurance must state, among other things, a description of the coverage includi ng the amount and term thereof, and any exceptions, limitations, or restrictions. Although the parties normally must expressly agree on each essential element of an insurance contract, some of these elements may be supplied by inference in certain ci rcumstances, including cases involving temporary insurance binders. First Protection Life Ins. Co. v. Compton, 230 Va. 166, 335 S.E.2d 262, 1985 Va. LEXIS 264 (1985). Oral binders for temporary insurance.  It is apparent that the General Assembly intended to proscribe only oral contracts of insurance never commemorated by a writing, not oral binders or contracts of temporary credit insurance pending issuance of a written policy.

The Commiss ion shall, based on a morbidity study, promulgate seven-, fourteen- and thirty-day retroactive and nonretroactive credit accident and sickness insurance premium rates which will reasonably be expected to produce the loss ratio as required by subsection E of § 38.2-3725. These prima facie rates will be published by the Commission no later than September 1, 1992, and will be effective on or after January 1, 1993. After this date, the premium charged in connection with any credit accident and sickness i nsurance policy or certificate issued in this Commonwealth may not exceed the then-published prima facie rate as set forth in this section and as may be adjusted pursuant to § 38.2-3730.The morbidity study shall be based on policies and certificates i ssued in this Commonwealth for the past three years, the premiums charged for those contracts and the experience produced by those contracts. The Commission may also take into consideration the reserves held on these contracts and the methods used to pro duce those reserves and any other information which the Commission in its discretion may consider necessary to produce a credible morbidity study. B.

C. If premiums are paid on the basis of a premium rate per month per $1,000 of outstanding insured indebtedness, they shall be computed according to the following formula or according to a formula approved by the Commission which produces rates actuarially equivalent to the single premium rates: Opn = 20 Spn  n+1 Opn = Spn 20 n+1 Opn = Spn 20 n+1 Opn = Spn 20 n+1 Click to viewWhere Spn = Single Premium Rate per $100 of initial insured indebtedness repayable in n equal monthly installments.Op = Monthly Outstanding Balance Premium Rate per $1,000.n = Original repayment period, in months.

Use of prim a facie rates. An insurer that files rates or has rates on file that are not in excess of the prima facie rates set forth in § 38.2-3726 or published as set forth in § 38.2-3727, to the extent adjusted pursuant to § 38.2-3730, may use those rat es without further proof of their reasonableness. B. Use of rate s higher than prima facie rates. An insurer may file for approval of and use rates that are higher than the prima facie rates set forth in § 38.2-3726 or published as set forth in § 38.2-3727, to the extent adjusted by § 38.2-3730. In order to use these higher rates, it shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that the use of such higher rates will result in a ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned (assuming the use of such higher rates) that is not less than the loss ratios as required by § 38.2-3725 D and E for those accounts to which such higher rates apply and that such upward deviations will not result on a statewide basis for that insurer of a ratio of claims incurred to premiums earned of less than the expec ted loss ratio underlying the current prima facie rate developed or adjusted pursuant to § 38.2-3730. Deviations effective for 1993 and 1994 for credit life insurance shall be derived based upon a fifty percent loss ratio.If rates higher than the pri ma facie rates provided for in §§ 38.2-3726 and 38.2-3727, to the extent adjusted pursuant to § 38.2-3730, are filed for approval, the filing shall specify the account or accounts to which such rates apply. Such rates may be applied on an equita ble basis approved by the Commission to only one or more accounts specified by the insurer for which the experience has been less favorable than expected. C. Approval pe riod of deviated rates. 1. A dev iated rate will be in effect for a period of time not longer than the experience period used to establish such rate. In no event will deviated rates remain in effect after the effective date that new prima facie rates are effective as set forth in § 38.2-3730. 2. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the prima facie rates shall be employed in the event that the account becomes insured by another insurer. D. As used in this section: 1. Experience means earned premiums and incurred claims during the experience period. 2. Experience period means the most recent period of time for which experience is reported, but not for a period longer than three full years. 3. Incurred claims means total claims paid during the experience period, adjusted for the change in claim reserve.

Each indivi dual policy or group certificate shall provide that, in the event of termination of the insurance prior to the scheduled maturity date of the indebtedness, any refund of an amount paid by the debtor for insurance shall be paid or credited promptly to the debtor or person entitled thereto. B. If a credit or requires a debtor to make any payment for credit life insurance or credit accident and sickness insurance and an individual policy or group certificate of insurance is not issued, the creditor shall immediately give written notice to such debtor and s hall promptly make an appropriate credit to the account. C. Refund form ulas which any insurer desires to use for decreasing term credit life insurance with terms of more than sixty-one months must develop refunds which are at least as favorable to the debtor as refunds based on the actuarial method. Refund formulas for decr easing term credit life insurance with terms of sixty-one months or less must develop refunds which are at least as favorable to the debtor as refunds based on the Rule of 78 or the actuarial method, whichever method is consistent with the original metho d of premium calculation. Refund formulas for credit accident and sickness insurance shall develop refunds that are at least as favorable to the debtor as refunds based on the actuarial method. The actuarial method will result in refunds equal to the pre mium cost of scheduled benefits subsequent to the date of cancellation or termination, computed at the schedule of premium rates in effect on the date of issue. The refund of premiums for level term credit life insurance shall be no less than the pro rat a unearned gross premium. Refund formulas must be filed with and approved by the Commission prior to use. D. The require ments of subsection C of this section that refund formulas be filed with the Commission shall be considered fulfilled if the refund formulas are set forth in the individual policy or group certificate filed with the Commission. E. Refunds may be computed: 1. On a daily basis; or 2. From the end of the loan month if sixteen days or more of a loan month have been earned, provided that, if fifteen days or less of a loan month have been earned, the refund is computed from the beginning of the loan month. F. No refund o f five dollars or less need be made. G. Voluntary p repayment of indebtedness. If a debtor prepays the indebtedness other than as a result of death: 1. Any c redit life insurance covering such indebtedness shall be terminated and an appropriate refund of the credit life insurance premium shall be paid or credited to the person entitled to the refund in accordance with this section; and 2. Any credit accident and sickness insurance covering such indebtedness shall be terminated and an appropriate refund of the credit accident and sickness insurance premium shall be paid or credited to the person entitled to the refund in accordance with this section. If a claim under such coverage is in progress at the time of prepayment, the amount of refund may be determined as if the prepayment did not occur until the payment of bene fits terminates. No refund need be paid during any period of disability for which credit accident and sickness benefits are payable. A refund shall be computed as if prepayment occurred at the end of the disability period. H. Involuntary prepayment of indebtedness. If an indebtedness is prepaid by the proceeds of a credit life insurance policy covering the debtor, then it shall be the responsibility of the insurer to see that the following are paid to the insured debtor, if living, or t he beneficiary, other than the creditor, named by the debtor or to the debtors estate: 1. An ap propriate refund of the credit accident and sickness insurance premium in accordance with this section; and 2. The amount of benefits in excess of the amount required to repay the indebtedness after crediting any unearned interest or finance charges.

A domestic society may consolidate or merge with any other society by complying with the provisions of this section. It shall file with the Commission: 1. A cer tified copy of the written contract containing in full the terms and conditions of the consolidation or merger; 2. A sworn statement by the president and secretary or corresponding officers of each society showing its financial condition on a date fixed by the Commission but not earlier than Decemb er 31 next preceding the date of the contract; 3. A certificate of such officers, duly verified, that the consolidation or merger has been approved by a two-thirds vote of the supreme governing body of each society, such vote being co nducted at a regular or special meeting of each such body, or, if the societys laws permit, by mail; and 4. Evidence that at least sixty days prior to the action of the supreme governing body of each society, the text of the contract has been furnished to all members of each society either b y mail or by publication in full in the official publication of each society.

Upon such approval, the contract shall be effective unless any society which is a party to the contract is incorporated under the laws of any other state or territory. In such event, the consolidation or merger shall not become effective until it has been approved as provided by the laws of such state or territory and a certificate of such approval filed with the Commission.

Any domesti c fraternal benefit society organized or operated under this chapter may, upon a two-thirds vote of its supreme governing body, amend its articles of incorporation and laws if already incorporated, or, if not incorporated, may incorporate, in a manner to transform itself into a mutual life insurer. It may use the name by which it is already known, or another name, as its supreme governing body shall determine. However, the proposed plan for reorganization or reincorporation shall be submitted to and ap proved by the Commission. Upon so doing, and upon procuring from the Commission a license to do the business of insurance in this Commonwealth as a mutual life insurer, it shall incur the obligations and enjoy the benefits of a mutual life insurer as if originally incorporated as a mutual life insurer. Any such corporation under its articles and bylaws as so framed or amended shall be a continuation of the original organization, and the officers of the organization shall serve through their respective terms as provided in the original articles and laws. However, their successors shall be elected and serve as the laws of this Commonwealth and the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the reorganized company provide. The incorporation, amendment or r eincorporation shall not affect existing suits, rights or contracts. The organization, after reorganization, shall have the power to do business of the same nature done by it before reorganization, as well as the powers conferred in this section and con templated by its articles of incorporation, in order to protect and perform rights and contracts existing before reorganization, but all new business written shall be as a mutual life insurer. B. All assets, other than general or expense fund assets, belonging to any reorganized insurer, prior to reorganization or arising or accruing from benefit certificates issued prior to the reorganization, shall be used only for the benefit of the holders of the benefi t certificates or their beneficiaries. C. If at the t ime of reorganization, or at any time after reorganization, it appears from the last preceding annual report of any such organization, filed with the Commission, or any investigation made by the Commission, that the present value of the contributions to be received from the holders of the benefit certificates, together with all assets, other than general or expense fund assets, owned by the insurer that have been accumulated from payments made by members holding such certificates, are not equal to the p resent value of the benefits promised to be paid, including all matured liabilities on any benefit certificates, then the insurer so reorganized shall establish, provide for, and maintain a fund, which with the present value of contributions and assets w ill equal the present value of the benefits, together with all matured liabilities. The fund shall be used for the payment of matured liabilities arising on the benefit certificates when other assets applicable thereto are exhausted. The fund need not be maintained unless required by conditions expressed in this chapter. D. Members in good standing in any society prior to reorganization shall have the right after reorganization to transfer their insurance in the society to the mutual life plan without further medical examination for the same or lesser amount, and at legal reserve or l evel premium rates. The interest in the assets of the society of any person so transferring, as determined by the board of directors, trustees or corresponding body, shall be transferred to, and be a part of, the assets of the insurer on the legal reserv e or level premium plan. E. The insurer so organized, and its officials, shall exercise all the rights and powers and perform all the duties conferred or imposed by law upon organizations writing the kinds of insurance written by the insurer so organized. The organization and its officials s hall exercise all the rights and powers and have full authority to perform all the duties necessary to protect rights and contracts existing prior to reorganization. The Commission shall exercise the powers and discharge the duties concerning any such i nsurer so reorganized that are applicable to insurers writing insurance or issuing policies of the same class, organized or operating in this Commonwealth. The Commission shall issue a certificate of authority to any solvent insurer so reorganized that has fully complied with the laws of this Commonwealth to do such insurance business in this Commonwealth. F. Any fratern al benefit society reorganized to do mutual life insurance business as provided in this chapter shall value its benefit certificates according to the standard of valuation for fraternal benefit societies used in this Commonwealth, and its legal reserve o r level premium policies according to the standard of valuation for those policies in this Commonwealth. The various classes of insurance shall be governed by the law applicable to each class of insurance. G. The expense of operation and maintenance of a reorganized insurer shall be apportioned between those holding benefit certificates issued before the reorganization and those holding policies issued after the reorganization as may be determined by the board of direct ors, trustees or corresponding body.

Beneficial and Benevolent Associations, § 21. CASE NOTES In general.  Where the charter of a benefit society designated the classes of persons who may be beneficiaries, this section was not intended to alter, modify, or repeal the c harter, but merely to enumerate the objects for which a benefit association might be organized. Pettus v. Hendricks, 113 Va. 326, 74 S.E. 191, 1912 Va. LEXIS 40 (1912). This interpretation of the statute has met with the approval of the General Assembly. Shepherd v. Sovereign Camp of Woodmen of World, 166 Va. 488, 186 S.E. 113, 1 936 Va. LEXIS 213 (1936). Liberal construction adopted to determine meaning of terms used to designate beneficiaries.  In determining the meaning and scope of particular terms, such as the words children, issue, heirs, devisees, legal representa tives, and estate, as those terms are used in a members designation of beneficiaries, or in statutes or the charter or laws of a fraternal benefit society for the purpose of designating beneficiaries, the courts adopt a liberal rule of co nstruction, so as to effectuate the intent of the parties and the benevolent objects of the society. Shepherd v. Sovereign Camp of Woodmen of World, 166 Va. 488, 186 S.E. 113, 1936 Va. LEXIS 213 (1936). Beneficiar y must be within class permitted by statute.  The person designated as the beneficiary under a certificate of a fraternal benefit society must be within the classes permitted by the appropriate statute and th e rules and regulations of the association. Shepherd v. Sovereign Camp of Woodmen of World, 166 Va. 488, 186 S.E. 113, 1936 Va. LEXIS 213 (1936). A member of a fraternal benefit society has merely a power of appointment, limited to the classes of beneficiaries named in the statute, and any other designation is invalid and void. Also, the society has no authority to create a fund for other persons than those specified in this section, nor can a member direct that the fund be paid to a person outside of such classes. Bryant v. Tunstall, 177 Va. 1, 12 S.E.2d 784, 1941 Va. LEXIS 189 (1941). But this was not app lied to foreign corporations.  Former § 38.1-600 was not intended to restrict or modify the constitution and bylaws of a Nebraska corporation which had been doing business in Virginia since 1901. Under the bylaws of the Nebraska company the right of plaintiff who was the named beneficiary, and who went to live with the assured and his wife at the age of eight, took their name, and was raised by them as their child, but no proceedings were i nstituted for her legal adoption, was governed by the words of the associations constitution and bylaws and not by the Virginia statute. Shepherd v. Sovereign Camp of Woodmen of World, 166 Va. 488, 186 S.E. 113, 1936 Va. LEXIS 213 (1936). Former § 38.1-600 did not add to the classes of beneficiaries named in the charter, c onstitution or bylaws of a Virginia fraternal benefit society, and conversely the charter, constitution and bylaws of a corporation, did not add to the classes enumerated in the section. Bryant v. Tunstall, 177 Va. 1, 12 S.E.2d 784, 1941 Va. LEXIS 189 (1 941). Charter provision for designating beneficiaries according to its bylaws.  Where the charter of a benefit society provides that the association will pay to the nearest relative, or such other dependent as may be designated by the mem ber according to its bylaws, such sum of money upon the death of such member as said bylaws shall provide, the phrase according to its bylaws is merely intended to reserve to the association the right to prescribe a method of designation if i t should see fit to do so, and the charter is, in this respect, self-executing. Pettus v. Hendricks, 113 Va. 326, 74 S.E. 191, 1912 Va. LEXIS 40 (1912). Right to question eligib ility of beneficiary.  A person whom the assured had attempted to make the beneficiary, not being an eligible beneficiary under former § 38.1-600, had no interest in the fund and cou ld not question the assureds wifes eligibility, and the society, having admitted its indebtedness by paying the fund into court, waived the right to question the wifes eligibility. Bryant v. Tunstall, 177 Va. 1, 12 S.E.2d 784, 1941 Va. LEXIS 189 (1941). The use of the restricted phrase, children by legal adoption is in itself a reco gnition of the fact that adopted children has a broader meaning. Shepherd v. Sovereign Camp of Woodmen of World, 166 Va. 488, 186 S.E. 113, 1936 Va. LEXIS 213 (1936). Example.  The holder of a certificate issued by a fraternal benefit society attempted to change the beneficiary from his wife to a person who was not dependent upon him and who was not related to him. The person whom the assured attempted to make the beneficiary was within the classes permitted by the bylaws of the society, but was not within any of the classes of beneficiaries specified in former § 38.1-600. It was hel d that the attempted change of beneficiary was ineffective and void, and the contract of insurance must be regarded as though the designation of the original beneficiary had never been changed.

The certificate shall also contain a provision stating the amount of premiums which are payable under the certificate and a provision reciting or setting forth the substanc e of any sections of the societys laws or rules in force at the time of issuance of the certificate which, if violated, will result in the termination or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate. If the laws of the society provide for exp ulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate shall also contain a provision that any member so expelled or suspended, except for nonpayment of a premium or within the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membershi p or insurance, shall have the privilege of maintaining the certificate in force by continuing payment of the required premium. G. Benefit con tracts issued on the lives of persons below the societys minimum age for adult membership may provide for transfer of control or ownership to the insured at an age specified in the certificate.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Exemptions from taxation which are accorded some classes and withheld from other different classes do not create an inequality in a constitutional sense. Fireman' s Mut. Aid Ass'n v. Commonwealth, 166 Va. 34, 184 S.E. 189, 1936 Va. LEXIS 160, cert. denied, 298 U.S. 677, 56 S. Ct. 941, 80 L. Ed. 1398, 1936 U.S. LEXIS 872 (1936) (wherein the company was not allowed to question the constitutionality of former § 38 .1-577). Purpose of exemption.  The legislature in exempting the funds of fraternal benefit societies from taxation may have been influenced by the fact that such societies generally pay small d eath and burial benefits; that they serve a large class of people who, as a rule, cannot afford more expensive and adequate protection; that an important element of the body politic known as the working class is generally impelled to their membership and that such organizations need the aegis of protection that the State can properly accord to them.

The report of valuation shall show, as reserve liabilities, the difference between the present midyear value of the promised benefits provided in the certificates of the society in force and the present midyear value of the future net premiums as they are in practi ce actually collected, not including any value for the right to make extra assessments and not including any amount by which the present midyear value of future net premiums exceeds the present midyear value of promised benefits on individual certificate s. At the option of any society, the valuation may show the net tabular value instead of the above value. The net tabular value as to certificates issued prior to June 28, 1969, shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of law applicable pri or to June 28, 1968, and as to certificates issued on or after June 28, 1969, shall not be less than the reserves determined according to the Commissioners reserve valuation method as defined in subsection C of this section. If the premium charged is less than the tabular net premium according to the basis of valuation used, an additional reserve equal to the present value of the deficiency in the premiums shall be set up and maintained as a liability. The reserve liabilities shall be properly adjus ted in the event that the midyear or tabular values are not appropriate. B. A society m ay value its certificates in accordance with valuation standards authorized by the laws of this Commonwealth for the valuation of policies issued by life insurers. C. Reserves ac cording to the Commissioners reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of certificates providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be any excess of the present value, a t the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by those certificates, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums therefor. The modified net premiums for any such certificate shall be a uniform percentage of t he respective contract premiums for the benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the certificate, of all modified net premiums shall equal the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the certificate and the excess of 1 over 2, as follows: 1. A net -level premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first certificate year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annual annuity of one dollar payable on each anniversary of the cert ificate on which a premium falls due. However, the net-level annual premium shall not exceed the net-level annual premium on the nineteen-year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at any age one year higher than the age at issue of th e certificate; and 2. A net one-year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first certificate year. Reserves according to the Commissioners reserve valuation method for (i) life insurance be nefits for varying amounts of benefits or requiring the payment of varying premiums, (ii) annuity and pure endowment benefits, (iii) disability and accidental death benefits in all certificates and contracts, and (iv) all other benefits except life insur ance and endowment benefits, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of this subsection. D. The present value of deferred payments due under incurred claims or matured certificates shall be deemed a liability of the society and shall be computed upon mortality and interest standards prescribed in subsections E through G of this section. E. The valuati on and underlying data shall be certified by a competent actuary or, at the expense of the society, verified by the actuary of the department of insurance of the state of domicile of the society. F. The minimum standards of valuation for certificates issued prior to June 28, 1969, shall be those provided by the law applicable immediately prior to June 28, 1968, but not lower than the standards used in the calculating of rates for those certificates. G. The minimum standard of valuation for certificates issued after June 28, 1969, shall be 3 1/2 percent interest and the following tables: 1. For c ertificates of life insurance, American Men Ultimate Table of Mortality, with Bowermans or Davis Extension thereof or with the consent of the Commission, the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, the Commissioners 1941 Standard In dustrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, using actual age of the insured for male risks and an age not more than three years younger than the actual age of the insured for female risks; 2. For annuity and pure endowment certificates, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in the certificates, the 1937 Standard Annuity Mortality Table or the Annuity Mortal ity Table for 1949, Ultimate, or any modification of either of these tables approved by the Commission; 3. For total and permanent disability benefits in or supplementary to life insurance certificates, Hunters Disability Table, or the Class III Disability Table (1926) modified to confo rm to the contractual waiting period, or the tables of Period 2 disablement rates and the 1930 to 1950 termination rates of the 1952 Disability Study of the Society of Actuaries with due regard to the type of benefit. Any of these tables shall, for activ e lives, be combined with a mortality table permitted for calculating the reserves for life insurance certificates; 4. For accidental death benefits in or supplementary to life insurance certificates, The Inter-Company Double Indemnity Mortality Table or the 1959 Accidental Death Benefits Table. Either table shall be combined with a mortality table permitted for calculating the reserves for life insurance certificates; and 5. For noncancellable accident and health benefits, the Class III Disability Table (1926) with conference modifications or, with the consent of the Commission, tables based upon the socie tys own experience. H. The Commiss ion may, in its discretion, accept other standards for valuation if it finds that the reserves produced by those standards will not be less in the aggregate than reserves computed in accordance with the minimum valuation standard prescribed in this secti on. The Commission may, in its discretion, vary the standards of mortality applicable to all certificates of insurance on substandard lives or other extra hazardous lives by any society licensed to do business in this Commonwealth. Whenever the mortalit y experience under all certificates valued on the same mortality table exceeds the expected mortality according to that table for a period of three consecutive years, the Commission may require additional reserves that it deems necessary on account of th e certificates. I. Any society , with the consent of the commissioner of insurance of the state of domicile of the society and under any conditions he may impose, may establish and maintain reserves on its certificates in excess of the reserves required by the state. However, the con tractual rights of any insured member shall not be affected by the excess reserves. History History.

Commission approval of mergers of nonstock corporations operating prepaid hospital, medical and surgical services plans. Text A. Except as o therwise provided in this chapter, Article 11 (§ 13.1-893.1 et seq.) of Chapter 10 of Title 13.1 shall apply to mergers involving corporations licensed under this chapter. B. Before any joint agreement for the merger of a corporation licensed under this chapter is submitted to the members, it shall first be submitted to and approved by the Commission. The Commission shall approve the agreement, unless, after giving notice and opportunit y to be heard, it determines that: 1. After the merger, the new or surviving corporation would not be able to satisfy the requirements of this chapter for the issuance of a license; 2. The effect of the merger would lessen competition substantially or tend to create a monopoly in insurance, prepaid hospital, medical and surgical services plans, or health care benefit plans in this Commonwealth; 3. The financial condition of any party to the merger might jeopardize the financial stability of the new or surviving corporation, or prejudice the interest of the subscribers; 4. Any plans or proposals of the new or surviving corporation to liquidate the new or surviving corporation, sell its assets or merge it with any person, or to make any other material cha nge in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to the subscribers and not in the public interest; 5. The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the new or surviving corporation are such that it would not be in the interest of the subs cribers and of the public to permit the merger; or 6. After the change of control, the new or surviving corporations surplus to subscribers would not be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities or adequate to its financia l needs. C. The provisi ons of subsection B notwithstanding, the Commission has the authority to merge two nonstock corporations licensed under this chapter where it finds that (i) one of the corporations is insolvent or is in such condition that its further transaction of busi ness in this Commonwealth is hazardous to subscribers and the public, (ii) that the merger of such nonstock corporation into another nonstock corporation licensed under this chapter is desirable for the protection of its subscribers, and that such merger of such nonstock corporation is in the public interest, and (iii) that an emergency exists, and if the board of directors of the insolvent or financially hazardous nonstock corporation to be merged approves a plan of merger of such nonstock corporation into another nonstock corporation licensed under this chapter, compliance with the requirements of § 13.1-895 shall be dispensed with as to such nonstock corporation and the approval by the Commission of such plan of merger shall be the equivalent of approval of two-thirds of the members for all purposes of Article 11 (§ 13.1-893.1 et seq.) of Chapter 10 of Title 13.1. The Commission shall provide that prompt notice of its findings, and plan of merger be sent to the members of record of such corpo ration for the purpose of providing such members an opportunity to challenge the findings of the Commission and the plan of merger.

Notwithstan ding any provision of § 38.2-4209, no corporation providing preferred provider subscription contracts or its pharmacy benefits manager, as defined in § 38.2-3465, shall prohibit any person receiving pharmaceutical benefits, including specialty phar macy benefits, thereunder from selecting, without limitation, the pharmacy of his choice to furnish such benefits. This right of selection extends to and includes pharmacies that are nonpreferred providers and that have previously notified the corporatio n or its pharmacy benefits manager, by facsimile or otherwise, of their agreement to accept reimbursement for their services at rates applicable to pharmacies that are preferred providers, including any copayment consistently imposed by the corporation, as payment in full. Each corporation or its pharmacy benefits manager shall permit prompt electronic or telephonic transmittal of the reimbursement agreement by the pharmacy and ensure payment verification to the pharmacy of the terms of reimbursement. I n no event shall any person receiving a covered pharmacy benefit from a nonpreferred provider that has submitted a reimbursement agreement be responsible for amounts that may be charged by the nonpreferred provider in excess of the copayment and the corp orations reimbursement applicable to all of its preferred pharmacy providers. B. No such cor poration or its pharmacy benefits manager shall impose upon any person receiving pharmaceutical benefits furnished under any such contract: 1. Any c opayment, fee or condition that is not equally imposed upon all individuals in the same benefit category, class or copayment level, whether or not such benefits are furnished by pharmacists who are nonpreferred providers; 2.

Each health maintenance organization or its pharmacy benefits manager shall permit prompt electronic or telephonic transmittal of the rei mbursement agreement by the pharmacy and ensure prompt verification to the pharmacy of the terms of reimbursement. In no event shall any person receiving a covered pharmacy benefit from a nonparticipating provider that has submitted a reimbursement agree ment be responsible for amounts that may be charged by the nonparticipating provider in excess of the copayment and the health maintenance organizations reimbursement applicable to all of its participating pharmacy providers. If a pharmacy has provid ed notice pursuant to this subsection through an intermediary, the health maintenance organization or its intermediary may elect to respond directly to the pharmacy instead of the intermediary.

The health care plan does not provide or arrange for basic health care services or limited health care services; 4. The health maintenance organization is no longer financially responsible and a reasonable expectation exists that it may be unable to meet its obligations to enrollees or prospective e nrollees; 5. The health maintenance organization has failed to implement a mechanism providing the enrollees with an opportunity to participate in matters of policy and operation as provided in § 38.2-4304; 6.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Exclusive remedy.  Health Maintenance Organizations demurrer was sustained in hospitals action alleging that it violated subsection B of § 38.2-4312.3 because the remedy of suspending an HMOs license pursuant to § 38.2-4316 had to be interpreted as the exclusive remedy for the rights created by subsection B of § 38.2-4312.3 in the absence of language stating otherwise; although the hospitals had a duty under th e federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 1395dd, to render services without regard to a patients insurance status or ability to pay, that duty alone provided insufficient reason to find a private right of action in the Commonwealth without even a hint of the supporting legislative and administrative intent.

The Commiss ion shall periodically investigate the economic conditions and other factors relating to and affecting the business of insurance premium finance companies. The Commission shall ascertain all pertinent facts necessary to determine what maximum interest ra te and what maximum service charge shall be permitted. Upon the basis of those facts and subject to this chapter, the Commission shall determine and fix by regulation or order the maximum interest rate and maximum service charge that may be charged in ad vance upon the amount financed by any insurance premium finance company. B. The Commiss ion shall initially fix the maximum interest rate at one percent per month charged in advance upon the entire amount financed payable in installments, and shall initially fix the maximum service charge at fifteen dollars. Thereafter, the maximum interest rate and maximum service charge shall be determined by the Commission after giving due consideration to such factors as (i) prevailing market interest rates, (ii) other relevant cost indices, and (iii) the industry-wide experience of premium finance com panies operating in this Commonwealth. Before redetermining the maximum interest rate or maximum service charge, the Commission shall give all licensees notice and opportunity to be heard and to introduce evidence with respect to the maximum interest rat e or service charge. C. Interest at the authorized rate may be charged from the effective date of the premium finance agreement or the inception date of the insurance contract for which the premiums are being financed, whichever is earlier, through the date when the final installment of t he premium finance agreement is payable. Interest charged under a premium finance agreement shall not be fully earned at the inception of the agreement. The insurance premium finance company may earn interest through the date the principal amount finance d under a premium finance agreement has been paid in full for any reason. Upon such payment in full, a refund credit of any unearned interest shall be due the insured and shall be computed on a short rate or prorata basis as set forth in the agreement, p rovided that the interest charged does not exceed the maximum interest rate established by the Commission pursuant to subsection A. The service charge received by an insurance premium finance company shall be fully earned upon its receipt and no portion of the service charge need be refunded upon prepayment of the loan for any reason. Only one service charge shall be made for each premium finance agreement, and no insurance agent or insurance premium finance company shall induce any person to enter into more than one premium finance agreement for the purpose of obtaining more than one service charge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one additional charge not to exceed ten dollars may be charged if additional premiums are added to an existing finance agre ement at the insureds request. Such additional charge may be applied only once during the term of any premium finance agreement. No part of any charges shall be paid to any insurance agent by an insurance premium finance company, nor shall any insura nce premium finance company pay, allow or give, or offer to pay, allow or give, directly or indirectly, to any insurance agent, any valuable consideration as an inducement to finance the premium of any insurance policy. No insurance agent shall accept an y valuable consideration as an inducement to finance the premium of any insurance policy. No person shall be in violation of this section solely by reason of ownership in an insurance premium finance company. D. Notwithstan ding the foregoing, the Commission by rule or order may exempt any premium finance agreement, any class of premium finance agreements or any market segment from any of the provisions of this section, if it finds their application unnecessary to achieve t he purposes of this chapter.

For comment, Continuing Care Retirement Communities: A Promise Falling Short, see 8 G.M.U. L. Rev. 47 (1985). § 38.2-4904.1. Escrow of entrance fee to continuing care providers and others. Text A. A provider shall maintain in escrow with a bank or trust company, or other escrow agent approved by the Commission, all entrance fees or portions thereof in excess of $1,000 per person received by the provider prior to the date the resident is permitted to occupy a unit in the facility. Funds or assets deposited therein shall be kept and maintained in an account separate and apart from the providers business accounts. For the purposes of this section only, the term entrance fee shall include within its meaning any advanced payment or series of advanced payments totaling $5,000 or more and the term provider shall include any person or entity that would be included in the definition thereof in § 38.2-4900 if such fee of $5,000 or more constit uted an entrance fee for the purposes of the definition of continuing care in § 38.2-4900. B. All funds o r assets deposited in the escrow account shall remain the property of the prospective resident until released to the provider in accordance with this section. The funds or assets shall not be subject to any liens, judgments, garnishments or creditors claims against the provider or facility. The escrow agreement may provide that charges by the escrow agent may be deducted from the funds or assets if such provision is disclosed in the disclosure statement. C. All funds o r assets deposited in escrow pursuant to this section shall be released to the provider when the provider presents to the escrow agent evidence that a unit has been occupied by the resident or a unit of the type reserved is available for immediate occupa ncy by the resident or prospective resident on whose behalf the fee was received. D. Notwithstan ding any other provision of this section, all funds or assets deposited in escrow pursuant to this section shall be released according to the terms of the escrow agreement to the prospective resident from whom it was received (i) if such funds or assets have not been released within three years after placement in escrow or within three years after construction has started, whichever is later (but in any event within six years after placement in escrow unless specifically approved by the Commission), or within such longer period as determined appropriate by the Commission in writing, (ii) if the prospective resident dies before occupying a unit, (iii) if the construction of a facility, not yet operating is stopped indefinitely before the facility is com pleted or (iv) upon rescission of the contract pursuant to provisions in the contract or in this chapter. If construction of the unit to be reserved has not started within three years after the deposit of funds or assets into an escrow account, the prosp ective resident may require the return of such funds or assets unless the Commission determines that construction will begin in a reasonable period of time and the extension of such three-year period is appropriate. However, funds or assets subject to re lease under item (i) of this subsection or under subsection C of this section may be held in escrow for an additional period at the mutual consent of the provider and the prospective resident; however, the prospective resident may consent to such additio nal period only after his deposit has been held in escrow for at least two years. Item (i) above shall not apply if fees are refundable within thirty days of request for refund. E. Unless othe rwise specified in the escrow agreement, funds or assets in an escrow account pursuant to this section may be held in the form received or if invested shall be invested in instruments authorized for the investment of public funds as set forth in Chapter 45 (§ 2.2-4500 et seq.) of Title 2.2 and not in default as to principal or interest. F. This sectio n shall not apply to entrance fees for initial occupancy of units under construction on June 30, 1986. G. This sectio n shall not apply to application or reservation fees whether or not such fees are considered to be a portion of the entrance fee, provided such application or reservation fees are not in excess of $1,000 per person.

In addition to other provisions considered proper to effect the purpose of any continuing care contract, each contract executed on or after July 1, 1985, shall: 1. Provi de for the continuing care of only one resident, or for two or more persons occupying space designed for multiple occupancy, under appropriate regulations established by the provider. 2. Show the value of all property transferred, including donations, subscriptions, fees and any other amounts paid or payable by, or on behalf of, the resident or residents. 3. Specify all services which are to be provided by the provider to each resident including, in detail, all items that each resident will receive and whether the items will be provided fo r a designated time period or for life. Such items may include, but are not limited to, food, shelter, nursing care, drugs, burial and incidentals. 4. Describe the physical and mental health and financial conditions upon which the provider may require the resident to relinquish his space in the designated facility. 5. Describe the physical and mental health and financial conditions required for a person to continue as a resident. 6. Describe the circumstances under which the resident will be permitted to remain in the facility in the event of financial difficulties of the resident. 7. State (i) the current fees that would be charged if the resident marries while at the designated facility, (ii) the terms concerning the entry of a spouse to the facility and (iii) the consequences if the spouse does not meet the requirements for entry. 8. Provide that the provider shall not cancel any continuing care contract with any resident without good cause. Good cause shall be limited to: (i) proof that the resident is a danger to himself or others; (ii) nonpayment by the resident of a monthly or periodic fee; (iii) repeated conduct by the resident that interferes with other residents quiet enjoyment of the facility; (iv) persistent refusal to comply with reasonable written r ules and regulations of the facility; (v) a material misrepresentation made intentionally or recklessly by the resident in his application for residency, or related materials, regarding information which, if accurately provided, would have resulted in ei ther a failure of the resident to qualify for residency or a material increase in the cost of providing to the resident the care and services provided under the contract; or (vi) material breach by the resident of the terms and conditions of the continui ng care contract. If a provider seeks to cancel a contract and terminate a residents occupancy, the provider shall give the resident written notice of, and a reasonable opportunity to cure within a reasonable period, whatever conduct is alleged to wa rrant the cancellation of the agreement. Nothing herein shall operate to relieve the provider from duties under the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (§ 55.1-1200 et seq.) when seeking to terminate a residents occupancy. 9. Provide in clear and understandable language, in print no smaller than the largest type used in the body of the contract, the terms governing the refund of any portion of the entrance fee and the terms under which such fee can be used by the provider. 10. State the terms under which a contract is cancelled by the death of the resident. The contract may contain a provision to the effect that, upon the death of the resident, the money paid for the continuing care of such resident shall be considered earned and become the property of the provider. 11. Provide for at least 30 days advance notice to the resident, before any change in fees, charges or the scope of care or services may be effective, except for changes required by state or federal assistance programs. 12. Provide that charges for care paid in one lump sum shall not be increased or changed during the duration of the agreed upon care, except for changes required by state or federal ass istance programs. B. A resident shall have the right to rescind a continuing care contract, without penalty or forfeiture, within seven days after making an initial deposit or executing the contract. A resident shall not be required to move into the facility designated in the contract before the expiration of the seven-day period. C. If a reside nt dies before occupying the facility, or is precluded through illness, injury or incapacity from becoming a resident under the terms of the continuing care contract, the contract is automatically rescinded and the resident or his legal representative sh all receive a full refund of all money paid to the provider, except those costs specifically incurred by the provider at the request of the resident and set forth in writing in a separate addendum, signed by both parties to the contract. D. No standard continuing care contract form shall be used in this Commonwealth until it has been submitted to the Commission. If the Commission determines that the contract does not comply with the provisions of this chapter, it shall have the right to take action pu rsuant to § 38.2-4931 to prevent its use. The failure of the Commission to object to or disapprove of any contract shall not be evidence that the contract does or does not comply with the provisions of this chapter. However, individualized amendments to any standard form need not be filed with the Commission. History History. 1985, c. 554, § 38.1-960; 1986, cc. 562, 598; 2012, cc. 208, 3 03.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This chapter does not violate the Anti-Discrimination Clause in Va. Const., Art. I, § 11. This clause is not applicable because it applies only to governme ntal discrimination upon the basis of religious conviction, race, color, sex, or national origin. King v. Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, 242 Va. 404, 410 S.E.2d 656, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1340, 1991 Va. LEXIS 151 (1991). This chapter does not violate Va. Const., Art. IV, §§ 14 or 15. King v. Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, 242 Va. 404, 410 S.E.2d 65 6, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1340, 1991 Va. LEXIS 151 (1991). Purpose bears reasonable relationship to assessments provision and assessments not arbitrary.  The purpose of this chapter, which is to make medical malpractice insurance coverage available to licensed physicians, bears a reasonable relationship to the prov ision for assessments, and the assessments are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in a manner prohibited by the State or federal Constitutions. King v. Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, 242 Va. 404, 410 S.E.2d 656, 8 Va. Law Rep . 1340, 1991 Va. LEXIS 151 (1991). Purpose.  Enacted in 1987 in direct response to the grossly lessening availability of medical malpractice insurance for obstetricians in the Commonwealth of Virginia, this act was intended to assure affordable malpractice insurance and therefore a sufficient pool of obstetricians practicing throughout the Commonwealth. Jan Paul Fruiterman, M.D. &amp; Assocs. v. Waziri, 259 Va. 540, 525 S.E.2d 552, 2000 Va. LEXIS 39 (2000). Br each of contract claim covered under malpractice policy.  Patients claim against an insured alleging a breach of contract based on the insureds failure to participate in the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological In jury Compensation Act (Birth Injury Fund), § 38.2-5000 et seq., as represented to the patients was a covered claim under a medical malpractice policy because the policy was construed against the insurer, as the drafter of the document, and thus the br oader construction attributable to the term arising from in policy was sufficient to include the services rendered in the birth of the patients child; this permitted a less direct nexus between the services rendered and the damages incurred, although such nexus still had to be present. The delivery of the child by the insured was an element in the chain of causation. Doctors Co. v. Women's Healthcare Assocs., 285 Va. 566, 740 S.E.2d 523, 2013 Va. LEXIS 50 (2013). Virginia Workers Compe nsation Commission.  Clear language of subsection A of § 8.01-273.1 alters the Gibson v. Riverside Hospita l decision; the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission has the sole authority to determine whether a cause of action satisfies the requirements of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, § 38.2-5000 et seq. If that determination is in the affirmative, the Act is the exclusive remedy for all claimants, no matter the identity of the claimant or the cause of action. Cooper v. Adler, 44 Va. App. 268, 604 S.E.2d 747, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 554 (2004). Act was mothers exclusive remedy.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly held that a mothers sole remedy against the participants in the Virginia Birth Injury Program for the mo thers emotional injuries arising out of the birth of her decedent son was an award of Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act benefits to the son as the mothers emotional distress flowed naturally from and was incidental to th e birth-related neurological injury to her child. Cooper v. Adler, 44 Va. App. 268, 604 S.E.2d 747, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 554 (2004). Interlocutory order.  Ruling that the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission lacked jurisdiction to consider an administratrix of an estate of a deceased infants (decedent) c laim that the decedents injuries were due to the doctors intentional or willful and wanton acts was not an appealable order as it did not adjudicate the underlying issue as to whether the decedent suffered a birth-related neurological injury caus ed by the doctors, which is necessary to a Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act claim. Maryview Hosp. v. Woodard, 54 Va. App. 13, 675 S.E.2d 837, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 211 (2009). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Coverage.  Mothers of infants who sustain other birth-related injuries or who sustain birth-related neurological injury without permanent developmental or cognitive damage a re not covered under § 38.2-5000 et seq. and are thus not precluded from recovery for civil claims.

In order to constitute a birth-related neurological injury within the m eaning of this chapter, such disability shall cause the infant to be permanently in need of assistance in all activities of daily living. This definition shall apply to live births only and shall not include disability or death caused by genetic or conge nital abnormality, degenerative neurological disease, or maternal substance abuse. Claimant means any person who files a claim pursuant to § 38.2-5004 for compensatio n for a birth-related neurological injury to an infant. Such claims may be filed by any legal representative on behalf of an injured infant; and, in the case of a deceased infant, the claim may be filed by an administrator, executor, or other legal repre sentative. Commission means the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission. Participating hospital means a general hospital licensed in Virginia which at the time of the injury (i) had in force an agreement with the Commissioner of Health or his designee, in a form prescribed by the Commissioner, whereby the hospital agreed to participate in the development of a program to provide obstetrical care to patients eli gible for Medical Assistance Services and to patients who are indigent, and upon approval of such program by the Commissioner of Health, to participate in its implementation, (ii) had in force an agreement with the State Department of Health whereby the hospital agreed to submit to review of its obstetrical service, as required by subsection C of § 38.2-5004, and (iii) had paid the participating hospital assessment pursuant to § 38.2-5020 for the period of time in which the birth-related neurologi cal injury occurred. The term also includes employees of such hospitals, excluding physicians or nurse-midwives who are eligible to qualify as participating physicians, acting in the course of and in the scope of their employment. Participating physician means a physician licensed in Virginia to practice medicine, w ho practices obstetrics or performs obstetrical services either full or part time or, as authorized in the plan of operation, a licensed nurse-midwife who performs obstetrical services, either full or part time, within the scope of such licensure and who at the time of the injury (i) had in force an agreement with the Commissioner of Health or his designee, in a form prescribed by the Commissioner, whereby the physician agreed to participate in the development of a program to provide obstetrical care to patients eligible for Medical Assistance Services and to patients who are indigent, and upon approval of such program by the Commissioner of Health, to participate in its implementation, (ii) had in force an agreement with the Board of Medicine whereby the physician agreed to submit to review by the Board of Medicine as required by subsection B of § 38.2-5004, and (iii) had paid the participating physician assessment pursuant to § 38.2-5020 for the period of time in which the birth-related neurol ogical injury occurred. The term participating physician includes a partnership, corporation, professional corporation, professional limited liability company or other entity through which the participating physician practices. Program means the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program esta blished by this chapter.

Editors note. Acts 2000, c. 207, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act amending § 38.2-5001 are declaratory of existing law. Acts 2017, c. 756, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act are declaratory of existing law. The 1999 amendment added the fourth sentence in the paragraph defining Birth-related neurological injury. The 2000 amendments. The 2000 amendment by c. 207, effective April 1, 2000, added the last sentence of the paragraph defining Participating physician. The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 897 substituted necessitated by a deprivation of oxygen or mechanical injury that occurred in the course of labor or delivery for in the immediate post-delivery period in the definition of Birth-related neurological injury. The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendments by cc. 896 and 931 are identical, and inserted general near the beginning of the first sentence in the definition of Participating hospital. The 2017 amendments.

For note, Will Tort Reform Combat the Medical Malpractice Insurance Availability and Affordability Problems That Virginias Physicians Are Facing, see 44 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1463 (1988). CASE NOTES 2000 amendments not retroactive.  The Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not abuse its discretion by finding that the April 1, 2000, amendments to §§ 8.01-273.1 and 38.2-5001 d id not apply retroactively. Berner v. Mills, 38 Va. App. 11, 560 S.E.2d 925, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 175 (2002), aff'd, 265 Va. 408, 579 S.E.2d 159, 2003 Va. LEXIS 52 (2003). Amendments to the law surrounding the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act were effective prospectively, as the phrase declaratory of e xisting law did not state retroactive intent and the language of the amended laws did not support retroactivity. Berner v. Mills, 265 Va. 408, 579 S.E.2d 159, 2003 Va. LEXIS 52 (2003). Birth-related neurological injury.   Workers compensation commissions decision that found the infant son had a birth-related neurological injury within the meaning of the Virginia Bir th-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, because the infant was permanently, motorically disabled, was developmentally disabled, and would require assistance in all activities of daily living was supported by credible evid ence in the record and the compensation program did not rebut the presumption that the infant son was so disabled. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program v. McGrady, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 79 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2006). Timing of injury.  Workers Compensation Commission did not err in determining that the relevant time for the injury to occur was when the oxygen deprivation was suffered during the course of labor or delivery or when resuscitation was necessitated by a deprivation of oxygen during labor or delivery because it interpreted the timing of injury requirement in a manner consistent with the rules of statutory construction. Ha mmer v. D.S., 67 Va. App. 388, 796 S.E.2d 454, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 55 (2017). Proof of claim; inferences.  Mother who filed a claim for compensation from the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program was entitled to an inference that information m issing from her daughters medical records supported the claim; thus, the court properly reversed the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions decision that the daughter was not entitled to benefits under the Program and remanded the case for further proceedings because the Commission reached its decision without giving the mother and daughter the benefit of an inference that information missing from the daughters records supported the claim. Wolfe v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injur y Comp. Program, 40 Va. App. 565, 580 S.E.2d 467, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (2003). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in denying an infant admission into the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program b ecause assuming that the missing evidence inference applied to the case, the Commissions failure to apply the inference was harmless error, because even if the Commission had adopted the missing evidence inference it would not have changed its decisi on that the infant did not suffer a birth-related neurological injury; the inference that healthcare providers sought would not add anything new to the evidence presented to the Commission or change an expert witnesss conclusion, which supported its ruling, and the court of appeals would not review conflicting medical evidence on appeal, so long as the Commission had credible evidence to support its decision. Danville Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, 2009 Va. A pp. LEXIS 366 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 18, 2009). Statutory pres umption does not apply to home births.  The expression birth-related neurological injury in this section addressed a concept related to, but not identical with, the term birth in subdivi sion A 5 ii. of § 38.2-5008; thus Virginia W...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_38.2-5002"><akn:num>§ 38.2-5002</akn:num><akn:heading>Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program; exclusive remedy; exception</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. There is he reby established the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program. B. Except as p rovided in subsection D, the rights and remedies herein granted to an infant on account of a birth-related neurological injury shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such infant, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin, at common law or otherwise arising out of or related to a medical malpractice claim with respect to such injury to the infant, including any claims by the infants personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin that, by substantive law, are derivative of the medical malpractice claim with respect to the infants injury, including but not limited to claims of emotional distress proximately related to the infants injury. This subsection shall not be construed to exclude other rights a nd remedies available to the infants mother arising out of or related to a physical injury, separate and distinct from an injury to the infant, that is suffered by the infants mother during the course of the infants delivery. C. Notwithstan ding anything to the contrary in this section, a civil action shall not be foreclosed against a physician or a hospital where there is clear and convincing evidence that such physician or hospital intentionally or willfully caused or intended to cause a birth-related neurological injury, provided that such suit is filed prior to and in lieu of payment of an award under this chapter. Such suit shall be filed before the award of the Commission becomes conclusive and binding as provided for in § 38.2-50 11. D. Notwithstan ding anything to the contrary in this section, a civil action arising out of or related to a birth-related neurological injury under this chapter, brought by an infant, his personal representative, parents, dependents, or next of kin, shall not be forecl osed against a nonparticipating physician or hospital, provided that (i) no participating physician or hospital shall be made a party to any such action or related action, and (ii) the commencement of any such action, regardless of its outcome, shall con stitute an election of remedies, to the exclusion of any claim under this chapter; provided that if claim is made, accepted and benefits are provided by the Fund established under this Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program, the Fund shall have the right, and be subrogated, to all of the common law rights, based on negligence or malpractice, which the said infant, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin may have or may have had against the non-participati ng physician or hospital, as the case may be.

For comment on Virginias Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, see 22 U. Rich. L. Rev. 431 (1988). For note, Will Tort Reform Combat the Medical Malpractice Insurance Availability and Affordability Problems That Virginias Physicians Are Facing, see 44 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1463 (1988). CASE NOTES Construction.  If the General Assembly intended to limit the statutory exclusion to a mothers injuries only occurring at the precise moment of delivery, the statute could ha ve been easily written as at delivery or at birth, but nonetheless, the legislature specifically included the phrase during the course of, which is consistent with a more expansive inclusion of time, place, and circumstances. Wome n's Healthcare Assocs. v. Mucci, 64 Va. App. 420, 768 S.E.2d 720, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2015). Claims by infants mother are exc luded.  Plain language of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, specifically subsection B of § 38.2-5002, excludes recovery for any claims b y an infants personal representative, parents, dependents or next of kin arising from or related to the birth-related neurological injury whether for the infants injuries or for injuries of the parent; the Virginia general assembly expres sly intends that rights and remedies of certain specified persons other than the injured infant will be excluded in return for an award of benefits on behalf of the infant. Cooper v. Adler, 44 Va. App. 268, 604 S.E.2d 747, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 554 (2004). And infant may become the unwilling claimant.  Once a matter is properly before the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, § 38.2-5008 requires the Commission to determine, among other things, if the injury claimed is a birth-related neurological injury and if so, to award compensation pursuant to § 38.2-5009; thus, an infant who otherwise has not filed a claim on his or her own behalf may become the unwilling claimant and his rem edy will exclude all other claims arising out of a medical malpractice claim with respect to such injury under subsection B of § 38.2-5002. Cooper v. Adler, 44 Va. App. 268, 604 S.E.2d 747, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 554 (2004). Infant who suffers injury must file claim with Workers Compensation Commission.  An infant who suffers a neurological injury as defined by the act must file a claim with the Workers Compensation Commission, which has exclusive jurisdiction to decide all claims made pursuant to the act. Gibson v. Riverside Hosp., 250 Va. 140, 458 S.E.2d 460, 1995 Va. LEXIS 89 (1995). Separate and distinct injury.  Mothers claim for injuries to her uterine tissue and emotional stress relating to those injuries did not occur but for the birth-related neurological injury t o her son, and her claims were for separate injuries and thus were not subject to the exclusive remedy of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act of 1987; it was clear from the face of the statute that injuries sustained by a moth er that are not incidental to the childs neurological injuries are not governed by the Act. Women's Healthcare Assocs. v. Mucci, 64 Va. App. 420, 768 S.E.2d 720, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2015). Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions sole task was to determine if the mothers injuries were separate and distinct from her sons neurological injuries, and the fact that the expert reports expressed a different theory of negligence than stated in the circuit court pleadings had no relevance to this task; appellants were on notice of the mothers specific allegations, they failed to conduct discovery, and any variance in the theory of negligence alleged in the complaint and expert reports was not relevant and the Commission did not err in finding that any issues of proof or notice were best left to the circuit court upon remand. Women's He althcare Assocs. v. Mucci, 64 Va. App. 420, 768 S.E.2d 720, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2015). Separate and distinct claims of an injured childs mother that are not subject to the exclusive remedy of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compen sation Act of 1987 are distinct from the derivative claims arising out of a claim of injury to the infant, which are encompassed by the Act. Women's Healthcare Assocs. v. Mucci, 64 Va. App. 420, 768 S.E.2d 720, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2015). Exclusive remedy provision not applicable to professional corporation.  This statute expressly limits those entitled to its rights and benefits to selected health-care providers and does not include a professional corporation that emp loys a participating physician. Jan Paul Fruiterman, M.D. &amp; Assocs. v. Waziri, 259 Va. 540, 525 S.E.2d 552, 2000 Va. LEXIS 39 (2000). Br each of contract claim covered under malpractice policy.  Patients claim against an insured alleging a breach of contract based on the insureds failure to participate in the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological In jury Compensation Act (Birth Injury Fund), § 38.2-5000 et seq., as represented to the patients was a covered claim under a medical malpractice policy because the policy was construed against the insurer, as the drafter of the document, and thus the br oader construction attributable to the term arising from in policy was sufficient to include the services rendered in the birth of the patients child; this permitted a less direct nexus between the services rendered and the damages incurred, although such nexus still had to be present.

Exclusive jurisdiction.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether an infants claim lies within the purview of the Virginia Birth-Relat ed Neurological Injury Compensation Act of 1987, and the court affirms the Commissions determination that limiting the interpretation of the language during the course of delivery to only the moment of the infants birth would create an in consistency with the definition of birth related neurological injury, which can occur during labor, delivery, and resuscitation, and the court appropriately defers to the Commissions consistent interpretation of the Act and its medical terms such as during the course of delivery. Women's Healthcare Assocs. v. Mucci, 64 Va. App. 420, 768 S.E.2d 720, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2015). Statutory pres umption does not apply to home births.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission correctly determined that the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act did not apply to a parents claim for medical malpractice damages and tort immunity to a group of doctors, as the birth occured at the mothers home, and the mother was not admitted to the hospital until thereafter; further, the expression birth-related neurological injury in § 38.2-5001 addressed a concept related to, but not identical with, the term birth in subdivision A 5 ii. of § 38.2-5008.

Exclusive jurisdiction.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether an infants claim lies within the purview of the Virginia Birth-Relat ed Neurological Injury Compensation Act of 1987, and the court affirms the Commissions determination that limiting the interpretation of the language during the course of delivery to only the moment of the infants birth would create an in consistency with the definition of birth related neurological injury, which can occur during labor, delivery, and resuscitation, and the court appropriately defers to the Commissions consistent interpretation of the Act and its medical terms such as during the course of delivery. Women's Healthcare Assocs. v. Mucci, 64 Va. App. 420, 768 S.E.2d 720, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (2015). Submission of reimbursement requests .  It was error for the Workers Compensation Commission to enforce a guideline issued by the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program requ iring the submission of requests for reimbursement within certain time frames, when denying parents request for reimbursement, because the reimbursement deadlines usurped the Commissions exclusive authority to decide if an invoice was so stale as to render the invoice unpersuasive evidence of a covered expense. Kavanaugh v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, 60 Va. App. 440, 728 S.E.2d 527, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 242 (2012). Post-judgment interest.  Given the remedial purposes of the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, the powers incorporated by reference in § 38.2-5003 include awards of po st-judgment interest. Thus, the post-judgment interest procedure generally applicable to Workers Compensation Commission awards governs awards under the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act. Spicer v. Va.

Petition.  Petition includes all medical records and expert reports that can be characterized as assessments, evaluations, prognoses, and records that can be obtained during discovery, and nothing supported appellants proposition that the deputy commissioner was limited to considering only the petition to make a jurisdictional determination; there is no statutory language that limits the Virginia Workers Compensatio n Commissions authority to consider the entire record when making a jurisdictional determination, and the Commission did not err in considering other documents when making its determination of jurisdiction.

Hence, because the opinions sought demanded careful and diligent review of the medical records and the research, the appeals court could not say that the time expended by the experts or the rates of compensation were unreasonable as a matter of law. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program v. Long, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 11 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 10, 2006). No discovery.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions sole task was to determine if the mothers injuries were separate and distinct from her sons neurological injuries, and the fact that the expert reports expressed a different theory of negligence than stated in the circuit court pleadings had no relevance to this task; appellants were on notice of the mothers specific allegations, they failed to conduct discovery, and any variance in the theory of negligence alleged in the complaint and expert reports was not relevant and the Commission did not err in finding that any issues of proof or notice were best left to the circuit court upon remand.

The Commiss ion shall determine, on the basis of the evidence presented to it, the following issues: 1. Wheth er the injury claimed is a birth-related neurological injury as defined in § 38.2-5001. a. A rebuttable presumption shall arise that the injury alleged is a birth-related neurological injury where it has been demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, that the infant has sustained a brain or spinal c ord injury caused by oxygen deprivation or mechanical injury, and that the infant was thereby rendered permanently motorically disabled and (i) developmentally disabled or (ii) for infants sufficiently developed to be cognitively evaluated, cognitively d isabled.If either party disagrees with such presumption, that party shall have the burden of proving that the injuries alleged are not birth-related neurological injuries within the meaning of the chapter. b. A rebuttable presumption of fetal distress, an element of a birth-related injury, shall arise if the hospital fails to provide the fetal heart monitor tape to the claimant, as req uired by subsection E of § 38.2-5004. 2. Whether obstetrical services were delivered by a participating physician at the birth. 3. Whether the birth occurred in a participating hospital. 4. How much compensation, if any, is awardable pursuant to § 38.2-5009. 5. If the Commission determines (i) that the injury alleged is not a birth-related neurological injury as defined in § 38.2-5001, or (ii) that obstetrical services were not delivered b y a participating physician at the birth and that the birth did not occur in a participating hospital, it shall dismiss the petition and cause a copy of its order of dismissal to be sent immediately to the parties by registered or certified mail. 6. All parties are bound for all purposes including any suit at law against a participating physician or participating hospital, by the finding of the Virginia Workers Compensation Co mmission (or any appeal therefrom) with respect to whether such injury is a birth-related neurological injury. B. The deans o f the schools of medicine of the Eastern Virginia Medical School, University of Virginia School of Medicine, and Medical College of Virginia of Virginia Commonwealth University shall develop a plan whereby each claim filed with the Commission is reviewed by a panel of three qualified and impartial physicians drawn from the fields of obstetrics, pediatrics, pediatric neurology, neonatology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, or any other specialty particularly appropriate to the facts of a particular case. Such plan shall provide that each of the three aforementioned medical schools shall maintain a review panel of physicians to review claims, with responsibility for reviewing claims rotating among each medical schools panel on a case-by-case bas is. The chair of the panel shall be determined by the schools dean. In no event shall the panel contain more than one panel member from the field of obstetrics. The Commission shall direct the Program to pay to the medical school that performed the a ssessment and prepared a report in conformity with this provision the sum of $3,000 per claim reviewed. C. The panel c reated pursuant to subsection B shall prepare a report that provides a detailed statement of the opinion of the panels members regarding whether the infants injury does or does not satisfy each of the criteria of a birth-related neurological inju ry enumerated in such terms definition in § 38.2-5001. The report shall include the panels basis for its determination of whether each such criteria was or was not satisfied. In addition, the report shall include such supporting documentation as the board of directors of the program may reasonably request.

For note, Will Tort Reform Combat the Medical Malpractice Insurance Availability and Affordability Problems That Virginias Physicians Are Facing, see 44 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 1463 (1988). CASE NOTES Virginia Workers Compensation Commission determines if injury falls within Act.  Once a matter is properly before the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, § 38.2-5008 requires the Commission to determine, among other things, if the injury claimed is a birth-related neurological injury and if so, to award compensation pursuant to § 38.2-5009; thus, an infant who otherwise has not filed a claim on his or her own behalf may become the unwilling claimant and his rem edy will exclude all other claims arising out of a medical malpractice claim with respect to such injury under subsection B of § 38.2-5002. Cooper v. Adler, 44 Va. App. 268, 604 S.E.2d 747, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 554 (2004). Presum ption shifts burden of production and persuasion.  The presumption set forth in this section shifts to the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program (Program), both the burden of production a nd the burden of persuasion on the issue of causation. The purpose of this section is to implement a social policy of providing compensation to families whose neonates suffer birth-related neurological injuries and application of the theory that the pres umption disappears once the Program produces countervailing evidence would be inconsistent with these policy objectives. Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program v. Young, 34 Va. App. 306, 541 S.E.2d 298, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (200 1). Rebuttal of presumption.  To defeat the presumption in subdivision A 1 of this section that an injury is a birth-related neurological injury under certain circumstances, a party opposing t he presumption must prove, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, both (1) that the claimants brain or spinal cord injury did not occur in the course of labor, delivery or resuscitation in the immediate post-delivery period in a hospital, and ( 2) that there was a specific, non-birth-related cause of the injury. Coffey v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, 37 Va. App. 390, 558 S.E.2d 563, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 47 (2002). In an action for benefits under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, the mothers award was upheld upon her presentation of medical expert opinions which stated that oxygen deprivation caused the childs brain injuries, the child was injured when the inflammation of the fetal membranes developed during labor and delivery, and much of the evidence presented by the Virginia Birth-R elated Neurological Injury Compensation Program supported these conclusions, instead of rebutting the presumption. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program v. Long, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 11 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 10, 2006). Workers Compensation Commission did not err in concluding that although a childs disabilities could require him to utilize adaptive equipment, the use of that equipment did not equate to requiring assistance because in making its finding that the child had rebutted the presumption, the Commission noted from a doctors opinion that the child would be able to independently prepare, set up, and cl ean up simple meals and would not remain totally dependent upon others for his care. Hammer v. D.S., 67 Va. App. 388, 796 S.E.2d 454, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 55 (2017). Workers Compensation Commission did not err in its determination that there was no event during labor and delivery associated with injurious oxygen deprivatio n, and thus, a child provided sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of a birth-related neurological injury, because its conclusions were based on credible evidence; both the panels written report and a testimony of the only obstetrician who te stified supported the Commissions determination. Hammer v. D.S., 67 Va. App. 388, 796 S.E.2d 454, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 55 (2017).

Upon determ ining (i) that an infant has sustained a birth-related neurological injury and (ii) that obstetrical services were delivered by a participating physician at the birth or that the birth occurred in a participating hospital, the Commission shall make an aw ard providing compensation for the following items relative to such injury: 1. Actua l medically necessary and reasonable expenses of medical and hospital, rehabilitative, therapeutic, nursing, attendant, residential and custodial care and service, medications, supplies, special equipment or facilities, and related travel, such expenses to be paid as they are incurred. Reimbursement may be provided for nursing and attendant care that is provided by a relative or legal guardian of a Program beneficiary so long as that care is beyond the scope of child care duties and services normally an d gratuitously provided by family members to uninjured children. However, such expenses shall not include: a. Expenses for items or services that the infant has received, or is entitled to receive, under the laws of any state or the federal government except to the extent prohibited by federal law; b. Expenses for items or services that the infant has received, or is contractually entitled to receive, from any prepaid health plan, health maintenance organization, or other priva te insuring entity; c. Expenses for which the infant has received reimbursement, or for which the infant is entitled to receive reimbursement, under the laws of any state or federal government except to the extent prohibited by federal law; and d. Expenses for which the infant has received reimbursement, or for which the infant is contractually entitled to receive reimbursement, pursuant to the provisions of any health or s ickness insurance policy or other private insurance program.Expenses of medical and hospital services under this subdivision shall be limited to such charges as prevail in the same community for similar treatment of injured persons of a like standard of living when such treatment is paid for by the injured person.In order to provide coverage for expenses of medical and hospital services under this subdivision, the Commission, in all cases where a comparative analysis of the costs, including the effects on the infants familys health insurance coverage, and benefits indicates that such action is more cost-effective than awarding payment of medical and hospital expenses, shall (i) require the claimant to purchase private health insurance providing coverage for such expenses, provided that the premium or other costs of such coverage shall be paid by the Fund; (ii) require the claimant to participate in the State Medicaid Program, the Childrens Health Insurance Program or other state or federal health insurance program for which the infant is eligible; or (iii) if the Commission determines that it would be unreasonably burdensome to require the claimant to purchase private health insurance and that the infant is ineligible for a health insuran ce program described in clause (ii), to make an award providing compensation for the cost of private accident and sickness insurance for the infant. 2. Loss of earnings from the age of 18 are to be paid in regular installments beginning on the eighteenth birthday of the infant. An infant found to have sustained a birth-related neurolo gical injury shall be conclusively presumed to have been able to earn income from work from the age of 18 through the age of 65, if he had not been injured, in the amount of 50 percent of the average weekly wage in the Commonwealth of workers in the priv ate, nonfarm sector. Payments shall be calculated based on the Commonwealths reporting period immediately preceding the 18th birthday of the claimant child, and subsequently adjusted based upon the succeeding annual reports of the Commonwealth. The p rovisions of § 65.2-531 shall apply to any benefits awarded under this subdivision. 3. Reasonable expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with the filing of a claim under this chapter, including reasonable attorneys fees of the claimants attorney, but exc luding attorney fees incurred in opposing a claimants admission pursuant to § 8.01-273.1. Any award for expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by the claimant in connection with the filing of a claim under this chapter shall be subject t o the approval and award of the Commission.A copy of the award shall be sent immediately by registered or certified mail to the parties.

CASE NOTES Submission of reimbursement requests .  It was error for the Workers Compensation Commission to enforce a guideline issued by the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program requ iring the submission of requests for reimbursement within certain time frames because the reimbursement deadlines exceeded the Programs authority, as (1) the Program could not issue a guideline inconsistent, directly or indirectly, with the t ext and structure of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, § 38.2-5000 et seq., and (2) the deadline purported to limit subdivision A 1 of § 38.2-5009, which stated the Commission shall award covered expenses and shall not award uncovered expenses, as no difference between the two involved a fixed deadline between the date an expense was incurred and the date the expense was submitted for reimbursement.

CASE NOTES Spoliation of evidence.  Mother who filed a claim for compensation from the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program was entitled to an inference that information m issing from her daughters medical records supported the claim; thus, the court properly reversed the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions decision that the daughter was not entitled to benefits under the Program and remanded the case for further proceedings because the Commission reached its decision without giving the mother and daughter the benefit of an inference that information missing from the daughters records supported the claim. Wolfe v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injur y Comp. Program, 40 Va. App. 565, 580 S.E.2d 467, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (2003). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION The parties and their counsel are responsible for reviewing the applicable statute or rule governing requests for review, and the period within which one must be filed. A party or attorney who relies upon informal information regarding filing deadlines, given to him over the telephone by someone in the Clerks office, does so at his peril. The Commission dismissed the Petitioners request for review, findin g that it was filed untimely. Even though counsel was apparently misinformed about the filing deadline, the Commission found the law is clear that relying on inaccurate information does not toll a review statute.

Annotations CASE NOTES Statutory presumption did not apply.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission correctly determined that the evidence in a wrongful death action, following the death of a newborn, did not afford t he statutory presumption under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, §§ 38.2-5000 to 38.2-5021, that a birth-related neurological injury existed, as the Commission correctly applied the legal principles governing the pres umption and rested its factfinding on credible evidence. Accordingly, the obstetrician, her practice, and the hospital were not entitled to statutory tort immunity in the wrongful death action. Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield , 42 Va. App. 264, 590 S.E.2d 631, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (2004). Rebuttal of presumption.  Workers Compensation Commission did not err in its determination that there was no event during labor and delivery associated with injurious oxygen deprivatio n, and thus, a child provided sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of a birth-related neurological injury, because its conclusions were based on credible evidence; both the panels written report and a testimony of the only obstetrician who te stified supported the Commissions determination. Hammer v. D.S., 67 Va. App. 388, 796 S.E.2d 454, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 55 (2017). Award upheld on appeal.  Award of benefits and expenses under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Compensation Act, §§ 38.2-5009 through 38.2-5021, to the parents of a child wit h cerebral palsy was upheld on appeal where it was found that the Workers Compensation Commission properly applied the rebuttable presumption that the infants injuries were neurologically birth-related since sufficient evidence was presented to s upport the opinions of those physicians who specialized in neonatology and pediatric neurology as opposed to other physicians asserted to have been more credible by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program, and the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program Board. Since it was uncontradicted that the infant had normal development at 17 weeks but was born at 29 weeks with numerous issues, the rational conclusion, based upon the credible and competent evidence, was that the condition was caused by a deprivation of oxygen during birth or immediate attempts to resuscitate.

The Bureau of Insurance of the State Corporation Commission shall undertake an actuarial investigation of the requirements of the Fund based on the Funds experience in the first year of operation, including without limitation the assets and liabilities of the F und.

All RBC Pla ns and RBC Reports, to the extent the information therein is not required to be set forth in a publicly available annual statement schedule, which are filed with the Commission with respect to any domestic licensee or foreign licensee, constitute informa tion that might be damaging to the licensee if made available to its competitors, and therefore shall be kept confidential by the Commission. This information shall not be made public nor shall it be subject to subpoena, other than by the Commission and then only for the purpose of enforcement actions taken by the Commission pursuant to this Act or any other provision of the insurance laws of this Commonwealth; however, the Commission may at its discretion disclose such confidential information to (i) a regulatory official of any state or country; (ii) the NAIC, its affiliate or its subsidiary; or (iii) a law-enforcement authority of any state or country. Any such disclosure by the Commission shall not constitute a waiver of confidentiality of such pla ns, reports, and information.

B. The compari son of a licensees Total Adjusted Capital to any of its RBC Levels is a regulatory tool which may indicate the need for possible corrective action with respect to the licensee, and is not intended as a means to rank licensees generally.

If any materially false statement comparing a licensees Total Adjusted Capital to its RBC Levels, or any of them, or a misleading comparison of any other amount to the licensees RBC Levels is published in any written publication and the licensee is able to demonstrate to the Commission with substantial proof the falsity or misleading nature of such statement, as the case may be, then the licensee may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut the materially false or misleading statement. C. RBC Instruc tions, RBC Reports, Adjusted RBC Reports, RBC Plans and Revised RBC Plans are intended solely for use by the Commission in monitoring the solvency of licensees and the need for possible corrective action with respect to licensees and shall not be used by the Commission for ratemaking nor considered or introduced as evidence in any rate proceeding nor used by the Commission to calculate or derive any elements of an appropriate premium level or rate of return for any line of insurance which a licensee or any affiliate is authorized to write.

Annotations CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Sale of life insurance policies by terminally ill patients directly and substantially affected the business of insurance and the Virginia Viatical Settlements Act , § 38.2-6002 et seq., related to such business and was enacted for the purpose of regulating such business; the McCarran-Ferguson Act thus saved the Virginia Act from preemption of the Commerce Clause and rendered it constitutional. The Virginia Act regulated only the insurance side of the transaction, involving the providers purchase of life insurance policies from viators, with the clear purpose of securing the interests of those originally purchasing the policies by mandating that the y receive a fair price from licensed providers for the policies that became the subject of viatical settlements.

A document in which the insured consents to the release of his medical records to a viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement broker, and the insurance company that issued the life insurance policy covering the life of the insured. The consent for the release of medical records shall only be obtained for the insurance company if the life insurance policy covering the insured was issued within 48 months of the date of the viators application for the viatical settlement contract. 2. Within 20 days after a viator executes documents necessary to transfer any rights under an insurance policy or within 20 days of entering any agreement, option, promise or any other fo rm of understanding, expressed or implied, to viaticate the policy, the viatical settlement provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued that insurance policy that the policy has or will become a viaticated policy.

A system of control shall include regular routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others aut horized by the licensee who disseminates advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval prior to the use of any advertisements not furnished by the licensee. C. Advertiseme nts shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a viatical settlement contract shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It shall not have the capacity or tendency t o mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the Commission from the overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average educa tion or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed. D. The informa tion required to be disclosed under this section shall not be minimized, rendered obscure, or presented in an ambiguous fashion or intermingled with the text of the advertisement so as to be confusing or misleading. 1. An ad vertisement shall not omit material information or use words, phrases, statements, references, or illustrations if the omission or use has the capacity, tendency, or effect of misleading or deceiving viators, as to the nature or extent of any benefit, lo ss covered, premium payable, or state or federal tax consequence. The fact that the viatical settlement contract offered is made available for inspection prior to consummation of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the viator is not sa tisfied or that the viatical settlement contract includes a free look period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements. 2. An advertisement shall not use the name or title of a life insurance company or a life insurance policy unless the advertisement has been approved by the insurer. 3. An advertisement shall not state or imply that interest charged on an accelerated death benefit or a policy loan is unfair, inequitable, or in any manner an incorrect or improper pract ice. 4. The words free, no cost, without cost, no additional cost, at no extra cost, or words of similar import shall not be used with respect to any be nefit or service unless true. An advertisement may specify the charge for a benefit or a service or may state that a charge is included in the payment or use other appropriate language. 5. Testimonials, appraisals, or analysis used in advertisements must be genuine; represent the current opinion of the author; be applicable to the viatical settlement contract, product, o r service advertised, if any; and be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective viators as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisal, analysis, or endorsement. In using testimonials, apprai sals, or analysis, the viatical settlement licensee makes as its own all the statements contained therein, and the statements are subject to all the provisions of this section. a. If the individual making a testimonial, appraisal, analysis, or an endorsement has a financial interest in the viatical settlement provider, viatical settlement broker, or related entity as a stockholder, director, officer, employee, or otherwise, or rec eives any benefit directly or indirectly other than required union scale wages, that fact shall be prominently disclosed in the advertisement. b. An advertisement shall not state or imply that a viatical settlement contract benefit or service has been approved or endorsed by a group of individuals, society, association, or other organization unless that is the fact and unless any relationship between an organization and the viatical settlement licensee is disclosed. If the entity making the endorsement or testimonial is owned, controlled, or managed by the viatical settlem ent licensee, or receives any payment or other consideration from the viatical settlement licensee for making an endorsement or testimonial, that fact shall be disclosed in the advertisement. c. When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a viatical settlement contract all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of five years after its use. E. An advertis ement shall not contain statistical information unless it accurately reflects recent and relevant facts. The source of all statistics used in an advertisement shall be identified. F. An advertis ement shall not disparage insurers, viatical settlement providers, viatical settlement brokers, viatical settlement investment agents, insurance producers, policies, services, or methods of marketing. G. The name of the viatical settlement licensee shall be clearly identified in all advertisements about the licensee or its viatical settlement contracts, products, or services, and if any specific viatical settlement contract is advertised, the viatical settlement co ntract shall be identified either by form number or some other appropriate description. If an application is part of the advertisement, the name of the viatical settlement provider shall be shown on the application. H. An advertis ement shall not use a trade name, group designation, name of the parent company of a viatical settlement licensee, name of a particular division of the viatical settlement licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device or reference without discl osing the name of the viatical settlement licensee, if the advertisement would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the viatical settlement licensee, or to create the impression that a company other than the viat ical settlement licensee would have any responsibility for the financial obligation under a viatical settlement contract. I. An advertis ement shall not use any combination of words, symbols, or physical materials that by their content, phraseology, shape, color, or other characteristics are so similar to a combination of words, symbols, or physical materials used by a government program or agency or otherwise appear to be of such a nature that they tend to mislead prospective viators into believing that the solicitation is in some manner connected with a government program or agency. J. An advertis ement may state that a viatical settlement licensee is licensed in the state where the advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that a competing viatical settlement licensee may not be so licensed. The advertis ement may ask the audience to consult the licensees website or contact the Bureau of Insurance to find out if this Commonwealth requires licensing and, if so, whether the viatical settlement provider or viatical settlement broker is licensed. K. An advertis ement shall not create the impression that the viatical settlement provider, its financial condition or status, the payment of its claims or the merits, desirability, or advisability of its viatical settlement contracts are recommended or endorsed by any government entity. L. The name of the actual licensee shall be stated in all of its advertisements. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate, or controlling entity of the licensee, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual licensee or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the licens ee. M. An advertis ement shall not directly or indirectly create the impression that any division or agency of the state or of the U.S. government endorses, approves, or favors: 1. Any v iatical settlement licensee or its business practices or methods of operation; 2. The merits, desirability, or advisability of any viatical settlement contract; 3. Any viatical settlement contract; or 4. Any life insurance policy or life insurance company. N. If the adve rtiser emphasizes the speed with which the viatication will occur, the advertising must disclose the average time frame from completed application to the date of offer and from acceptance of the offer to receipt of the funds by the viator. O. If the adve rtising emphasizes the dollar amounts available to viators, the advertising shall disclose the average purchase price as a percent of face value obtained by viators contracting with the licensee during the past six months.

Annotations CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Sale of life insurance policies by terminally ill patients directly and substantially affected the business of insurance and the Virginia Viatical Settlements Act , § 38.2-6002 et seq., related to such business and was enacted for the purpose of regulating such business; the McCarran-Ferguson Act thus saved the Virginia Act from preemption of the Commerce Clause and rendered it constitutional. The Virginia Act regulated only the insurance side of the transaction, involving the providers purchase of life insurance policies from viators, with the clear purpose of securing the interests of those originally purchasing the policies by mandating that the y receive a fair price from licensed providers for the policies that became the subject of viatical settlements.
