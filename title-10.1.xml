OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Riparian landowners.  The provisions of the Virginia Scenic Rivers Act do not apply to riparian landowners constructing dams, docks, or other structures that could impede water flow al ong tributaries of designated waterways unless those tributaries are included within the scope of the designation.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Impounding structure.  Irrigation is not a necessary element for a farm pond to qualify for the agricultural exemption, provided the impounded waters are utilized in a manner found to b e required for agricultural production. The determination of whether the agricultural exemption applies to any particular structure is primarily a factual question reserved to the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation on a case-by-cas e basis. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas C. Wright, Jr., Member, House of Delegates, 12-074, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 1 (1/4/13). Agricultural exemption.  Absent a specific definition in the Dam Safety Act, it is appropriate to look to the definition of the term forester provided in the statutes governing th e Department of Forestry as an interpretative guide, and that a forester differs from an orchardist in that an orchardist harvests fruit, nuts or sap from trees, while a forester is concerned with the timber itself. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas C. Wright, Jr., Member, House of Delegates, 12-074, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 1 (1/4/13). § 10.1-604.1. Determination of hazard potential classification. Text A. The hazard potential classification for an impounding structure shall be determined by one of the following procedures: 1. The o wner of an impounding structure that does not currently hold a regular or conditional certificate from the Board, or the owner of an impounding structure that is already under certificate but the owner believes that a condition has changed downstream of the impounding structure that may reduce its hazard potential classification, may request that the Department conduct a simplified dam break inundation zone analysis to determine whether the impounding structure has a low hazard potential classification. The owner shall pay 50 percent of the cost of the analysis. If the Department finds that the impounding structure has a low hazard potential classification, the owner shall be eligible for general permit coverage in accordance with § 10.1-605.3. If t he Department finds that the impounding structure appears to be a high or significant hazard potential structure, the owners engineer shall provide further analysis in accordance with § 10.1-606.2 and the criteria set out in the Impounding Structu re Regulations (4 VAC 50-20). The owner may be eligible for grant assistance in accordance with § 10.1-603.19. 2. The owner may propose a hazard potential classification that shall be subject to approval by the Board. To support the proposed hazard classification, an analysis shall be conducted by the owners engineer and shall comply with the criteria set out in the Impounding Structure Regulations (4 VAC 50-20). If the engineer finds that the impounding structure has a low hazard potential classification, the owner shall be eligible for gene ral permit coverage in accordance with § 10.1-605.3.An impounding structures hazard potential classifications determination shall include an analysis of those hazards created by flood and nonflood dam failures. In conducting the hazard potenti al classification, the Department or the owners engineer may utilize an incremental damage analysis. When considering the failure of the impounding structure under a flood condition, such engineers shall only consider those hazards that exceed those created by the flood event. B. Any owner a ggrieved by a decision of the Department regarding his impounding structure shall have the right to judicial review of the final decision pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.).

Any dam owner who has submitted the certifications required by subdivisions 1 a through 1 h shall make (i) such certifications, (ii) the emergency action plan required by subdivision 1 a, and (iii) the certificate of insurance required by subdivision 1 g available, upon request and within five business days, to any person. A dam owner may comply with the requirements of this subdivision by providing the same information on a website a nd directing the requestor to such website. A dam owner who fails to comply with this subdivision shall be subject to a civil penalty pursuant to § 10.1-613.2. C. The Board s regulations shall establish an incremental damage analysis procedure that permits the spillway design flood requirement for an impounding structure to be reduced to the level at which dam failure shall not significantly increase downstream hazard t o life or property, provided that the spillway design flood requirement shall not be reduced to below the 100-year flood event for high or significant hazard impounding structures, or to below the 50-year flood event for low hazard potential impounding s tructures.

In district s authorized to impose a service charge, the service charge shall be based on the initial increase in fair market value resulting from a project. In order to determine the initial increase in fair market value, the trustees shall subtract the fair market value of each parcel without the project, as shown in the landbook for the year immediately preceding the year in which the project was begun from the fair market value of the parcel following completion of the project. The fair market value of each par cel with the project shall be determined by the district directors in a reasonable manner. The values so determined shall be the values against which the service charge rate is imposed so long as any bonds remain outstanding, and thereafter unless a chan ge is approved by the district directors. If an additional improvement is made while any bonds are outstanding, the district directors may cause a new increase in fair market values to be computed to reflect such improvement. However, while any bonds are outstanding, such newly computed values shall not be used unless the total new increase in fair market values in the district is equal to or greater than the previously determined increase in fair market values. Within thirty days after determining the increase in fair market value for all real estate in the watershed improvement district resulting from the project, the trustees shall mail a notice of such determination to the owner of record of each parcel in the district.

Flood waters disregard jurisdictional boundaries, and the public interest requires the management of flood-prone areas in a manner whic h prevents injuries to persons, damage to property and pollution of state waters. B. The General Assembly supports and encourages those measures which prevent, mitigate, and alleviate the effects of sea level rise, stormwater surges, and all causes of recurrent flooding and declares that the expenditure of public funds and any obligations incurred in the development of flood control and other civil works projects, the benefits of which may accrue to any county, municipality, or region in the Commonwealth, are necessary expenses of local and state government. The General Assembly shall prioritize m easures that use community-scale and regional-scale planning, protect and enhance natural and nature-based approaches, address socioeconomic inequities, and enhance equity through flood resilience and preparedness.

For related discussion, see 6B M.J. Easements, § 2. CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  Virginia Conservation Easement Act did not create a new right to burden land by a negative easement in gross for the purpose of land conservation and historic pre servation, but facilitated the continued creation of such easements by providing a clear statutory framework under which tax exemptions are made available to charitable organizations devoted to those purposes and tax benefits and incentives are provided to the grantors of such easements, contrary to the common law; moreover, the easement at issue was not of a novel character and is consistent with the statutory recognition of negative easements in gross for conservation and historic purposes. United Sta tes v. Blackman, 270 Va. 68, 613 S.E.2d 442, 2005 Va. LEXIS 69 (2005). No abrogation of str ict construction principle.  In certain significant respects, the Virginia Conservation Easement Act is in derogation of the common law, but this does not necessarily mean that the common-law strict construction principle applied to restrictive covenants is abrogated by the Act; the Act does not abrogate the common-law strict construction principle as the Act is not directly and irreconcilably opposed to it, and thus the restrictive covenant s in the easement that were ambiguous had to be strictly construed against restriction and in favor of the business. Wetlands Am. Trust, Inc. v. White Cloud Nine Ventures, L.P., 291 Va. 153, 782 S.E.2d 131, 2016 Va. LEXIS 12 (2016). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Conservation easements.  A conservation easement obtained under the Virginia Conservation Easement Act (§ 10.1-1009 et seq.) or the Open-Space Land Act (§ 10.1-1700 et seq.) is not extinguished by application of the common-law doctrine of merger of estates when the easement holder acquires fee simple title to the encumbered land.

A holder ma y acquire a conservation easement by gift, purchase, devise or bequest. B. No right or duty in favor of or against a holder and no right in favor of a person having a third-party right of enforcement arises under a conservation easement before its acceptance by the holder and a recordation of the acceptance. C. A conservat ion easement shall be perpetual in duration unless the instrument creating it otherwise provides a specific time. For all easements, the holder shall (i) meet the criteria in § 10.1-1009 and (ii) either have had a principal office in the Commonwealth for at least five years, or be a national organization in existence for at least five years which has an office in the Commonwealth and has registered and is in good standing with the State Corporation Commission. Until a holder has met these requirement s, the holder may co-hold a conservation easement with another holder that meets the requirements. D. An interest in real property in existence at the time a conservation easement is created is not impaired by it unless the owner of the interest is a party to the conservation easement or consents to it in writing. E. No conserva tion easement shall be valid and enforceable unless the limitations or obligations created thereby conform in all respects to the comprehensive plan at the time the easement is granted for the area in which the real property is located. F. This chapte r does not affect the power of the court to modify or terminate a conservation easement in accordance with the principles of law and equity, or in any way limit the power of eminent domain as possessed by any public body. In any such proceeding the holde r of the conservation easement shall be compensated for the value of the easement. History History. 1988, cc. 720, 891; 2000, c. 182; 2003, c. 1014; 2004, c. 364.

Where an ea sement held pursuant to this chapter or the Open-Space Land Act (§ 10.1-1700 et seq.) by its terms is perpetual, neither the interest of the holder of a conservation easement nor a third-party right of enforcement of such an easement shall be subject to state or local taxation nor shall the owner of the fee be taxed for the interest of the holder of the easement. B. Assessments of the fee interest in land that is subject to a perpetual conservation easement held pursuant to this chapter or the Open-Space Land Act (§ 10.1-1700 et seq.) shall reflect the reduction in the fair market value of the land that results from the ina bility of the owner of the fee to use such property for uses terminated by the easement. To ensure that the owner of the fee is not taxed on the value of the interest of the holder of the easement, the fair market value of such land (i) shall be based on ly on uses of the land that are permitted under the terms of the easement and (ii) shall not include any value attributable to the uses or potential uses of the land that have been terminated by the easement. C. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection B, land which is (i) subject to a perpetual conservation easement held pursuant to this chapter or the Open-Space Land Act (§ 10.1-1700 et seq.), (ii) devoted to open-space use as defined in § 58.1-3230, and (iii) in any county, city or town which has provided for land use assessment and taxation of any class of land within its jurisdiction pursuant to § 58.1-3231 or § 58.1-3232, shall be assessed and taxed at the use value for open space, if the land otherw ise qualifies for such assessment at the time the easement is dedicated. If an easement is in existence at the time the locality enacts land use assessment, the easement shall qualify for such assessment. Once the land with the easement qualifies for lan d use assessment, it shall continue to qualify so long as the locality has land use assessment.

See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas Davis Rust, Member, House of Delegates, 11-140, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 31 (8/31/2012). Subsequent changes to land approved for conservation easement.  Under § 10.1-1011, conservation easement land covered by the provisions of the statute must meet the minimum acreage requirement of § 58.1-3233 at the time the easement is dedicated, unless the easement was placed on the property before the local land use assessment ordinance was adopted. Subsequent changes in acreage or use that are permitted under the conservation easement would not affect the continuing eligibility of the land for use assessment under subsection C of § 10.1-1011. No back taxes, including the roll-back tax, may be imposed when conservation easement land, through apparent unpermitted use or development, no longer appears to qualify for use assessment under subsection C of § 10.1-1011. However, upon the initiation of appropriate proceedings and the making of factual findings respecting the land and easement in question, such subsequent violations of the conservation easement could r ender the land ineligible for use assessment under § 10.1-1011.

Annotations CASE NOTES Conservation easement interpretati on.  By leaving the strict construction principle in force with the passage of the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, the legislature must have viewed this principle as an appropriate additional incentive for those who draft the conservation easements to achieve clarity in light of the fact that they are subject to enforcement in perpetuity, and this is equally true of the constitutional policy to protect the environ ment, the Open Space Land Act, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, and the Virginia Land Conservation Incentives Act of 1999; like the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, none of these provisions address in any way the interpretive principles to be applied to a conservation easement.

Forestry, w hen practiced in accordance with accepted silvicultural best management practices as determined by the State Forester pursuant to § 10.1-1105, constitutes a beneficial and desirable use of the Commonwealths forest resources. B. Notwithstan ding any other provision of law, silvicultural activity, as defined in § 10.1-1181.1, that (i) is conducted in accordance with the silvicultural best management practices developed and enforced by the State Forester pursuant to § 10.1-1105 and (ii) is located on property defined as real estate devoted to forest use under § 58.1-3230 or in a district established pursuant to Chapter 43 (§ 15.2-4300 et seq.) or Chapter 44 (§ 15.2-4400 et seq.) of Title 15.2, shall not be prohibited or unreas onably limited by a local governments use of its police, planning and zoning powers. Local ordinances and regulations shall not require a permit or impose a fee for such silvicultural activity. Local ordinances and regulations pertaining to such silv icultural activity shall be reasonable and necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of citizens residing in the locality, and shall not be in conflict with the purposes of promoting the growth, continuation and beneficial use of the Commonweal ths privately owned forest resources. Prior to the adoption of any ordinance or regulation pertaining to silvicultural activity, a locality may consult with, and request a determination from, the State Forester as to whether the ordinance or regulati on conflicts with the purposes of this section. Nothing in this section shall preclude a locality from requiring a review by the zoning administrator, which shall not exceed ten working days, to determine whether a proposed silvicultural activity complie s with applicable local zoning requirements. C. The provisi ons of this section shall apply to the harvesting of timber, provided that the area on which such harvesting occurs is reforested artificially or naturally in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 11 (§ 10.1-1100 et seq.) of Title 10.1 or is conve rted to bona fide agricultural or improved pasture use as described in subsection B of § 10.1-1163.The provisions of this section shall not apply to land that has been rezoned or converted at the request of the owner or previous owner from an agricult ural or rural to a residential, commercial or industrial zone or use.Nothing in this section shall affect any requirement imposed pursuant to the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act (§ 62.1-44.15:67 et seq.) or imposed by a locality pursuant to the design ation of a scenic highway or Virginia byway in accordance with §§ 33.2-405 through 33.2-408.

CASE NOTES Local ordinances affecting silvicultural activity not prohibited.  This section authorizes a county zoning administrator to review proposed silvicultural activity to determine whether it complies with applicable local zoning requ irements but there is nothing in this section that suggests that such a compliance review is limited to determining whether the forestry plan complies with zoning ordinances relating to non-silvicultural activities, such as noise abatement ordinances, no r does anything in the statute suggest that a county cannot enact ordinances affecting silvicultural activity. Dail v. York County, 259 Va. 577, 528 S.E.2d 447, 2000 Va. LEXIS 66 (2000). Approval by zoning administrator may be required.  This section authorizes a county zoning administrator to review proposed silvicultural activity to determine whether it complies with applicable local zoning requ irements and this statutory review process includes a component of evaluation and decision regarding compliance; accordingly, describing the decision a local zoning administrator must make as an approval in an ordinance is consistent with authori zing the zoning administrator to make such a determination regarding compliance and does not create a prohibited permit requirement. Dail v. York County, 259 Va. 577, 528 S.E.2d 447, 2000 Va. LEXIS 66 (2000). Lo cal ordinance restricting clear cutting not prohibited.  A local ordinance providing that clear cutting of trees was not permitted but that the zoning administrator could permit selected thinning based upon best managem ent practices and in accordance with an approved plan was not an absolute prohibition on clear cutting of timber in areas subject to the ordinance but a limitation on clear cutting, which could be altered by the zoning administrator and, therefore, this ordinance did not contravene, and was not preempted by, this section. Dail v. York County, 259 Va. 577, 528 S.E.2d 447, 2000 Va. LEXIS 66 (2000). Burden not shifted to locality to prove validity of ordinances.  The limitations placed on a localitys general police powers and zoning authority by this section did change the status quo and impose the burden upon localiti es if they enact requirements that exceed the best management practices promulgated by the state forester to show that the state regulations were inadequate to protect the health, safety and welfare of their citizens and that local regulation was necessa ry to meet identified shortcomings in the state program.

The governi ng body of any county, city or town may adopt a tree conservation ordinance regulating the preservation and removal of heritage, specimen, memorial and street trees, as defined under subsection B of this section, when such preservation and removal are no t commercial silvicultural or horticultural activities, including but not limited to planting, managing, or harvesting forest or tree crops. Such ordinance shall consider planned land use by the property owner, may include reasonable fees for the adminis tration and enforcement of the ordinance and may provide for the appointment by the local governing body of an administrator of the ordinance. B. Any ordinan ce enacted pursuant to this authority may contain reasonable provisions for the preservation and removal of heritage, specimen, memorial and street trees.

The individual property owner of such trees shall be notified prior to the hearing on the adoptio n of such ordinance by certified mail. C. The provisi ons of a tree conservation ordinance enacted pursuant to this section shall not apply: (i) to work conducted on federal or state property; (ii) to emergency work to protect life, limb or property; (iii) to routine installation, maintenance and repair of cable and wires used to provide cable television, electric, gas or telephone service; (iv) to activities with minor effects on trees, including but not limited to, home gardening and landscaping of individual homes; and (v) commercial silvicultural or ho rticultural activities, including but not limited to planting, managing, or harvesting forest or tree crops. D. In the even t that the application of any ordinance regulating the removal of heritage, specimen, memorial or street trees results in any taking of private property for a public purpose or use, the governing body shall compensate by fee or other consideration the pr operty owner for such taking and the ordinance shall so state thereby notifying the owner of his right to seek such fee or other compensation. The provisions of Chapter 2 (§ 25.1-200 et seq.) of Title 25.1 shall apply to the taking of private propert y for a public purpose pursuant to such local ordinance. E. Violations of such local ordinance shall be punishable by civil penalties not to exceed $2,500 for each violation. F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to be in derogation of the authority granted to any county, city or town by the provision of any charter or other provision of law.

The total amount of the cash deposit or bond for any one acre shall not exceed $240. The judge shall cause the cash deposit or surety bond to be delivered to the State Forester, who shall hold the cash or surety bond in a special account until it is use d or released as hereinafter provided. The purpose of the cash or surety bond is to ensure that the general cutover area on which seed trees have been cut in violation of this article shall be planted with tree seedlings of the same species as the trees cut in violation of this article in a manner hereinafter specified. For each acre on which trees have been cut in violation of this article, a number up to 600, as determined by the State Forester, of tree seedlings shall be planted on the general cutover area on which seed trees were cut in violation. Each seedling shall be planted in a separate hole at least six feet from any other planted seedling. Seedlings shall be planted at least six feet from any sapling or tree which may shade the planted seedling from direct sunlight. If stems of noncommercial species prevent the planting of tree seedlings in the manner herein described on any area in violation, a sufficient number of such stems shall be cut, girdled or poisoned to permit th e required number of seedlings to be planted. The seedlings shall be planted during the period of the year when forest tree seedlings are customarily planted in the section of the Commonwealth in which the cutover area is located. After receipt of the tr ee seedlings from the nursery, care shall be taken to keep the seedling roots in a moist, uninjured condition at all times prior to actual planting, and the seedlings shall be planted in a careful, workmanlike manner. Planted seedlings shall be of the sa me tree species as the seed trees cut in violation, or if two or more seed tree species are cut in violation, the species of the planted seedlings shall be in proportion to the seed trees cut in violation. The above specified manner of planting and tree species planted shall be observed whether the planting is done by the person found in violation of this article or by the State Forester. A person convicted of violating this article may plant tree seedlings on the general cutover area of the species and in the manner specified herein within one year foll owing the date of conviction. Upon completion of the planting, the person shall immediately notify the State Forester in writing that the area has been planted. The State Forester or his representative shall then inspect the area and if he finds the plan ting to be done in accordance with the specifications set forth, he shall notify the person in writing and return the cash deposit or surety bond to the person depositing it. If, upon inspection, the State Forester finds that the general cutover area or any part thereof has not been planted in the manner and during the period of year specifi ed, or that the area has not been planted previous to one year following the date of conviction, the State Forester shall then plant the area during the next planting season, and do such forest cultural work as he deems necessary by reason of the delayed planting, keeping a careful and accurate account of all costs incurred, including a reasonable administrative cost. Following completion of the planting the State Forester shall prepare a certified statement showing the cost of planting, which shall be paid from the cash deposit, or if a surety bond has been deposited the State Forester shall collect the cost of planting from the bonding company.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Silvicultural activity.  Board of zoning appeals improperly concluded that a landowners clearing of a trail on its land of dead and diseased trees was not exempt from the countys performance standards as such activity was covered under Loudoun County, Va., Zoning Ordinance § 5-1503(B), as an agricultural operation, the activity was silvicultural activity as defined in § 10.1-1181.1, and there was no evidence that the landow ner was conducting illegal tree harvesting. Mount Aldie, LLC v. Loudoun Cnty. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 91 (Loudoun County Jan. 30, 2016). § 10.1-1181.2. Conduct of silvicultural activities; issuance of special orders. Text A. If the Stat e Forester believes that an owner or operator has conducted or is conducting or has allowed or is allowing the conduct of any silvicultural activity in a manner that is causing or is likely to cause pollution, he may enter upon the silvicultural operatio n for inspection to determine whether the activity is causing or likely to cause pollution and notify the owner or operator regarding the activity that is causing or likely to cause pollution and recommend (i) corrective measures and (ii) a reasonable ti me period to prevent, mitigate, or eliminate the pollution. If the owner or operator fails to take action to prevent, mitigate, or eliminate the pollution, the State Forester shall issue a special order pursuant to subsection B or C. Failure of the State Forester to notify an owner or operator of such corrective measures shall not impair the State Foresters authority to issue special orders pursuant to subsection B or C. B. The State F orester shall have the authority to issue special orders to any owner or operator who has conducted or is conducting, or has allowed or is allowing to be conducted, any silvicultural activity in a manner that is causing or is likely to cause pollution, t o cease immediately all or part of the silvicultural activities on the site, and to implement specified corrective measures within a stated period of time. Such special orders are to be issued only after the owner or operator has been given the opportuni ty for a hearing with reasonable notice to the owner or operator, or both, of the time, place and purpose thereof, and they shall become effective not less than five days after service as provided in subsection D. C. If the Stat e Forester finds that any owner or operator is conducting any silvicultural activity in a manner that is causing or is likely to cause an alteration of the physical, chemical or biological properties of any state waters resulting from sediment deposition presenting an imminent and substantial danger to (i) the public health, safety or welfare, or the health of animals, fish or aquatic life; (ii) a public water supply; or (iii) recreational, commercial, industrial, agricultural or other reasonable uses, the State Forester may issue, without advance notice or hearing, an emergency order directing the owner or operator, or both, to cease immediately all or part of the silvicultural activities on the site, and to implement specified corrective measures wit hin a stated period of time. The commencement of proceedings by the State Forester for the issuance of a special order pursuant to subsection B shall not impair the State Foresters authority to issue an emergency special order pursuant to this subsec tion. The State Forester shall provide an opportunity for a hearing, after reasonable notice as to the time and place thereof to the owner or operator, to affirm, modify, amend or cancel such emergency special order. D. The owner o r operator to whom such special order is directed shall be notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, sent to the last known address of the owner, or operator, or by personal delivery by an agent of the State Forester, and the time limits spec ified shall be counted from the date of receipt. E. The State F orester shall not issue a special order to any owner or operator who has incorporated generally acceptable water quality protection techniques in the operation of silvicultural activities, which techniques have failed to prevent pollution, if the State F orester determines that the pollution is the direct result of unusual weather events that could not have been reasonably anticipated. F. Any hearing required under this section shall be conducted in accordance with § 2.2-4020 unless the parties consent to informal proceedings. G. The State F orester shall not issue a notice under subsection A or a special order or emergency special order under subsection B or C more than one year after the silvicultural activity has occurred on the property. Any such notice, special order, or emergency speci al order shall remain in effect until the State Forester determines that corrective measures specified therein have been implemented. H. Prior to co mpletion but not later than three working days after the commencement of an operation, the operator shall notify the State Forester of the commercial harvesting of timber. For the purpose of this section, commercial harvesting of timber means the harvest ing of trees for the primary purpose of transporting to another site for additional manufacturing. The notification may be verbal or written and shall (i) specify the location and the actual or anticipated date of the activity, (ii) include an owners name or the owners representative or agent and contact information, and (iii) be provided in a manner or form as prescribed by the State Forester. If an operator fails to comply with the provisions of this subsection, the State Forester may assess a civil penalty of $250 for the initial violation and not more than $1,000 for any subsequent violation within a 24-month period by the operator. Such civil penalties shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Virginia Forest Water Quality Fund pursuant to § 10.1-1181.7.

The Departm ent, the Task Force and any advisory panels appointed by the Task Force shall be guided by the following definition of watershed planning: Watershed planning is the process of studying the environmental and land use features of a watershed to ide ntify those areas that should be protected and preserved, measures to be utilized to protect such areas, and the character of development in order to avoid and minimize disruption of natural systems. Its focus is not on directing development to particula r parcels of land but rather to identify critical resources, and measures to protect those resources, so that development, when it does occur, will not negatively impact water resources. In so doing watershed planning uses and protects ecological process es to lessen the need for structural control methods that require capital costs and maintenance. By including consideration of a watershed and its characteristics, cumulative impacts and interjurisdictional issues are more effectively managed than when s olely relying on single-site-permit approaches. Watershed planning can be an important tool for maintaining environmental integrity, economic development and watershed permitting. B. The Departm ent, the Task Force and any advisory panels appointed by the Task Force shall be guided by the principles contained in the following statement: Stream systems tend to reflect the character of the watershed they drain. Unchecked physical conversion in a w atershed accompanying urbanization leads to degraded streams and wetlands. As urbanization continues to spread across the state, natural vegetation, slope and water retention characteristics are replaced by impervious surfaces disrupting the dynamic bala nce of the natural hydrologic cycle. Poorly planned development can increase peak storm flows and runoff volume, lower water quality and aesthetics, and cause flooding and degradation of downstream communities and ecosystems.

The Virgini a Waste Management Board shall promulgate regulations to allow persons who own, operate, have a security interest in or enter into a contract for the purchase of contaminated property to voluntarily remediate releases of hazardous substances, hazardous w astes, solid wastes, or petroleum. The regulations shall apply where remediation has not clearly been mandated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Department or a court pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensat ion and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq.), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. § 6901 et seq.), the Virginia Waste Management Act (§ 10.1-1400 et seq.), the State Water Control Law (§ 62.1-44.2 et seq.), or other appl icable statutory or common law or where jurisdiction of those statutes has been waived. The regulations shall provide for the following: 1. The e stablishment of methodologies to determine site-specific risk-based remediation standards, which shall be no more stringent than applicable or appropriate relevant federal standards for soil, groundwater and sediments, taking into consideration scientifi c information regarding the following: (i) protection of public health and the environment, (ii) the future industrial, commercial, residential, or other use of the property to be remediated and of surrounding properties, (iii) reasonably available and e ffective remediation technology and analytical quantitation technology, (iv) the availability of institutional or engineering controls that are protective of human health or the environment, and (v) natural background levels for hazardous constituents; 2. The establishment of procedures that minimize the delay and expense of the remediation, to be followed by a person volunteering to remediate a release and by the Department in processi ng submissions and overseeing remediation; 3. The issuance of certifications of satisfactory completion of remediation, based on then-present conditions and available information, where voluntary cleanup achieves applicable cleanu p standards or where the Department determines that no further action is required; 4. Procedures to waive or expedite issuance of any permits required to initiate and complete a voluntary cleanup consistent with applicable federal law; and 5. Registration fees to be collected from persons conducting voluntary remediation to defray the actual reasonable costs of the voluntary remediation program expended at the site. B. Persons con ducting voluntary remediations pursuant to an agreement with the Department entered into prior to the promulgation of those regulations may elect to complete the cleanup in accordance with such an agreement or the regulations. C. Certificati on of satisfactory completion of remediation shall constitute immunity to an enforcement action under the Virginia Waste Management Act (§ 10.1-1400 et seq.), the State Water Control Law (§ 62.1-44.2 et seq.), Chapter 13 (§ 10.1-1300 et seq.) of this title, or any other applicable law. D. At the requ est of a person who owns, operates, holds a security interest in or contracts for the purchase of property from which the contamination to be voluntarily remediated originates, the Department is authorized to seek temporary access to private and public p roperty not owned by such person conducting the voluntary remediation as may be reasonably necessary for such person to conduct the voluntary remediation. Such request shall include a demonstration that the person requesting access has used reasonable ef fort to obtain access by agreement with the property owner. Such access, if granted, shall be granted for only the minimum amount of time necessary to complete the remediation and shall be exercised in a manner that minimizes the disruption of ongoing ac tivities and compensates for actual damages. The person requesting access shall reimburse the Commonwealth for reasonable, actual and necessary expenses incurred in seeking or obtaining access. Denial of access to the Department by a property owner creat es a rebuttable presumption that such owner waives all rights, claims and causes of action against the person volunteering to perform remediation for costs, losses or damages related to the contamination as to claims for costs, losses or damages arising after the date of such denial of access to the Department. A property owner who has denied access to the Department may rebut the presumption by showing that he had good cause for the denial or that the person requesting that the Department obtain access acted in bad faith.

Any person, including a person that owns an interest in the real property, the agency, or a municipality or other unit of local government, may be a holder. An environmental covenant may identify more than one holder. The interest of a holder is an interest in real property. B. A right of an agency under this chapter or under an environmental covenant, other than a right as a holder, is not an interest in real property. C. An agency i s bound by any obligation it assumes in an environmental covenant, but an agency does not assume obligations merely by signing an environmental covenant. Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound by the obligations the person assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does not change obligations, rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter except as provided in the covenant. D. The followi ng rules apply to interests in real property in existence at the time an environmental covenant is created or amended: 1. An in terest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmental covenant unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant. 2. This chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate that interest to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant. 3. A subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenant covering real property or in a separate record. If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a common interest community, the record may be signed by any person authorized by the governing board of the owners association. 4. An agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental covenant affects the priority of that persons interest but does not by itself impose any affirmative ob ligation on the person with respect to the environmental covenant or affect that persons existing liability.

An environm ental covenant shall: 1. State that the instrument is an environmental covenant executed pursuant to the Uniform Environmental Covenants Act (§ 10.1-1238 et seq. of the Code of Virginia); 2.

In addition to the information required by subsection A, an environmental covenant may contain other information, restrictions, and requirements agreed to by the persons who signed it, including: 1. Any r equirements for notice following transfer of a specified interest in, or concerning proposed changes in use of, applications for building permits for, or proposals for any site work affecting the contamination on, the property subject to the covenant; 2. Any requirements for periodic reporting describing compliance with the covenant, including a requirement that a qualified and certified professional engineer inspect, investigate and r eport on the compliance with the covenant; 3.

An environm ental covenant that complies with this chapter runs with the land. B. An environm ental covenant that is otherwise effective is valid and enforceable even if: 1. It is not appurtenant to an interest in real property; 2. It can be or has been assigned to a person other than the original holder; 3. It is not of a character that has been recognized traditionally at common law; 4. It imposes a negative burden; 5.

The owner of an interest subject to the environmental covenant and the holder are the same person. C. An instrume nt that creates restrictions or obligations with respect to real property that would qualify as activity and use limitations except for the fact that the instrument was recorded before the effective date of this chapter is not invalid or unenforceable be cause of any of the limitations on enforcement of interests described in subsection B or because it was identified as an easement, servitude, deed restriction, or other interest. This chapter does not apply in any other respect to such an instrument. D. This chapte r does not invalidate or render unenforceable any interest, whether designated as an environmental covenant or other interest, that is otherwise enforceable under the law of the Commonwealth.

When restrictions and obligations are imposed on real property in connection with an environmental response project, they m ay be drafted and recorded in any manner permissible under the laws of Virginia. This chapter applies only to activity and use limitations drafted and recorded in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. History History. 2010, c. 691; 2012, c. 278.

The Departm ent shall have the power to issue special orders to: (i) owne rs who are permitting or causing air pollution as defined by § 10.1-1300, to cease and desist from such pollution; (ii) owners who have failed to construct facilities in accordance with or have failed to comply with plans for the control of air pollution submitted by them to and approved by the Depar tment, to construct such facilities in accordance with or otherwise comply with, such approved plans; (iii) owners who have violated or failed to comply with the terms and provisions of any Department order or directive to comply with such terms and provisions; (iv) owners who have contravened duly adopted and promulgated air quality standards and policies, to cease such contravention and to comply with air quality standards and policies; (v) require any owner to comply with the provisions of this chapter and any Department decision; and (vi) require any person to pay civil penalties of up to $32,500 for each violation, not to exceed $100,000 per order, if (a) the person has been issued at least two written notices of al leged violation by the Department for the same or substantially related violations at the same site, (b) such violations have not been resolved by demonstration that there was no violation, by an order issued by the Director, or by other means, (c) at le ast 130 days have passed since the issuance of the first notice of alleged violation, and (d) there is a finding that such violations have occurred after a hearing conducted in accordance with subsection B. The actual amount of any penalty assessed shall be based upon the severity of the violations, the extent of any potential or actual environmental harm, the compliance history of the facility or person, any economic benefit realized from the noncompliance, and the ability of the person to pay the pena lty. The Department shall provide the person with the calculation for the proposed penalty prior to any hearing conducted for the issuance of an order that assesses penalties pursuant to this subsection. Penalties shall be paid to the state treasury and deposited by the State Treasurer into the Virginia Environmental Emergency Response Fund (§ 10.1-2500 et seq.). The issuance of a notice of alleged violation by the Department shall not be considered a case decision as defined in § 2.2-4001. Any no tice of alleged violation shall include a description of each violation, the specific provision of law violated, and information on the process for obtaining a final decision or fact finding from the Department on whether or not a violation has occurred, and nothing in this section shall preclude an owner from seeking such a determination. B.

Special orders; penalties. Text The Department is authorized to issue special orders in compliance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) requiring that an owner file with the Dep artment a plan to abate, control, prevent, remove, or contain any substantial and imminent threat to public health or the environment that is reasonably likely to occur if such source ceases operations. Such plan shall also include a demonstration of fin ancial capability to implement the plan. Financial capability may be demonstrated by the establishment of an escrow account, the creation of a trust fund to be maintained within the Department, submission of a bond, corporate guarantee based on audited f inancial statements, or such other instruments as the Department may deem appropriate. The Department may require that such plan and instruments be updated as appropriate. The Department shall give due consideration to any plan submitted by the owner in accordance with §§ 10.1-1410, 10.1-1428, and 62.1-44.15:1.1, in determining the necessity for and suitability of any plan submitted under this section.

The term shall not include the sale or transfer of a source in the ordinary course of business or a permit transfer in accordance with Boar d regulations. Any person who ceases operations and who knowingly and willfully fails to implement a closure plan or to provide adequate funds for implementation of such plan shall, i f such failure results in a significant harm or an imminent and substantial threat of significant harm to human health or the environment, be liable to the Commonwealth and any political subdivision thereof for the costs incurred in abating, controlling, preventing, removing, or containing such harm or threat. Any person who ceases operations and who knowingly and willfully fails to implement a closure plan or to provide adequate funds for implementation of such plan shall, i f such failure results in a significant harm or an imminent and substantial threat of significant harm to human health or the environment, be guilty of a Class 4 felony.

Severe ozone nonattainment areas; fees. Text A. Except as p rovided in subsection C, any owner of a stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 25 tons or more per year of volatile organic compounds or 25 tons or more of nitrogen oxides and is located in an area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a severe ozone nonattainment area shall pay a fee to the Department for deposit in the Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program Fund, established pursuant to § 46.2-1182.2 to be used for air quality evaluation and improvements, if the area fails to attain the ambient air quality standard for ozone by the applicable attainment date established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 7502 and 7511 of the Clean Air Act. Such fees shall be assessed for emissions in each calendar year beginning in the year after the attainment date and for each calendar year thereafter as set forth in this section and shall continue until the area is redesignated as an attainment area for the ozone standard. B. The fee sha ll be determined in accordance with the following: 1. The f ee shall equal $5,000, adjusted in accordance with subdivision B 3, per ton of volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides emitted by the stationary source during the previous calendar year in excess of 80 percent of the baseline amount, computed under subdivision B 2. 2. For purposes of this section, the baseline amount shall be the lower of (i) the amount of actual volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxide emissions or (ii) the amount of volatile o rganic compounds or nitrogen oxide emissions allowed under the permit applicable to the stationary source during the attainment year, or, if no such permit has been issued for the attainment year, the amount of volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxid e emissions allowed under the applicable implementation plan during the attainment year. The Department may calculate the baseline amount over a period of more than one calendar year, provided such determination is consistent with federal requirements. 3. The fee amount under subdivision B 1 shall be adjusted each year beginning in 1991 by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the most recent calendar year ending before the beginning of such year exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 1989. The Consumer Price Index for any calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers published by the U.S. Department of Labor as of the close of the 12-month period ending on August 31 of each calendar year. The revision of the Consumer Price Index that is most consistent with the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year 1989 shall be used. C. Notwithstan ding any provision of this section, no owner shall be required to pay any fee under subsection A with respect to emissions during any year that is treated as an extension year under 42 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(5) of the Clean Air Act and no owner shall be req uired to pay any fee under subsection A if such fees would not otherwise be imposed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 7511d. D. Payment is due by August 31 of each year. The Department shall issue annual notices of the fees to owners on or before August 1 of each year. Each notice shall include a summary of the data on which the fee is based. The Board may establish additional procedures fo r the assessment and collection of such fees. The failure to pay within 90 days from the receipt of the notice shall be grounds to institute a collection action against the owner of the stationary source. E. Fees collec ted pursuant to this section shall not supplant or reduce the general fund appropriation to the Department. F. These fees shall be used to pay expenses related to air quality monitoring and evaluation in the Commonwealth and measures to improve air quality in areas designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as severe nonattainment areas. The fees that may be gen erated may be used for matching grants.

CASE NOTES Denial of formal petition for hearing entitles owner aggrieved to judicial review.  A final decision on the part of the State Air Pollution Control Board to deny a formal petition for a hearing would, under this section, entitle any owner agg rieved by that decision a right to judicial review.

Pursuant to regulations adopted by the Board, permits may be issued, amended, revoked or terminated and reissued by the Department and may be enforced under the provisions of this chapter in the same manner as regulations and orders. Failure to comply with any cond ition of a permit shall be considered a violation of this chapter and investigations and enforcement actions may be pursued in the same manner as is done with regulations of the Board and orders of the Department under the provisions of this chapter. To the extent allowed by federal law, any person holding a permit who is intending to upgrade the permitted facility by installing technology, control equipment, or other apparatus that the permittee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director will res ult in improved energy efficiency, will reduce the emissions of regulated air pollutants, and meets the requirements of Best Available Control Technology shall not be required to obtain a new, modified, or amended permit. The permit holder shall provide the demonstration anticipated by this subsection to the Department no later than 30 days prior to commencing construction. B. The Board b y regulation may prescribe and provide for the payment and collection of annual permit program fees for air pollution sources. Annual permit program fees shall not be collected until (i) the federal Environmental Protection Agency approves the Boards operating permit program established pursuant to Title V of the federal Clean Air Act or (ii) the Governor determines that such fees are needed earlier to maintain primacy over the program. The annual fees shall be based on the actual emissions (as calc ulated or estimated) of each regulated pollutant, as defined in § 502 of the federal Clean Air Act, in tons per year, not to exceed 4,000 tons per year of each pollutant for each source. The annual permit program fees shall not exceed a base year amou nt of $25 per ton using 1990 as the base year, and shall be adjusted annually by the Consumer Price Index as described in § 502 of the federal Clean Air Act. Permit program fees for air pollution sources who receive state operating permits in lieu of Title V operating permits shall be paid in the first year and thereafter shall be paid biennially. The fees shall approximate the direct and indirect costs of administering and enforcing the permit program, and of administering the small business station ary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program as required by the federal Clean Air Act. The Board shall promulgate regulations establishing permit application fee amounts not to exceed $30,000 from applicants for a permit for a new major stationary source. The permit application fee amount paid shall be credited towards the amount of annual fees owed pursuant to this section during the first two years of the sources operation. The fees shall be exempt from statewide indirect c osts charged and collected by the Department of Accounts. C. When adopti ng regulations for permit program fees for air pollution sources, the Board shall take into account the permit fees charged in neighboring states and the importance of not placing existing or prospective industry in the Commonwealth at a competitive disa dvantage. D. On or befor e January 1 of every even-numbered year, the Department shall make an evaluation of the implementation of the permit fee program and provide this evaluation in writing to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations, the House Committee on Appropriations, the House Committee on Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources, and the House Committee on Finance. This evaluation shall include a report on the total fees collected, the amount of general funds allocated to the Department, the Departments use of the fees and the general funds, the number of permit applications received, the number of permits issued, the progress in eliminating permit backlogs, and the timeliness of permit processing. E. To the exte nt allowed by federal law and regulations, priority for utilization of permit fees shall be given to cover the costs of processing permit applications in order to more efficiently issue permits. F. Fees collec ted pursuant to this section shall not supplant or reduce in any way the general fund appropriation to the Department. G. The permit fees shall apply to permit programs in existence on July 1, 1992, any additional permit programs that may be required by the federal government and administered by the Department, or any new permit program required by the Code of Virginia.

Any permit issued by the Director pursuant to this article may be revoked, amended or suspended on any of the following grounds or on such other grounds as may be provided by the regulations of the Board: 1. The p ermit holder has violated any regulation or order of the Board, any condition of a permit, any provision of this chapter, or any order of a court, where such violation results in a release of harmful substances into the environment or poses a threat of r elease of harmful substances into the environment or presents a hazard to human health, or the violation is representative of a pattern of serious or repeated violations which, in the opinion of the Director, demonstrate the permittees disregard for or inability to comply with applicable laws, regulations or requirements; 2. The sanitary landfill or other facility used for disposal, storage or treatment of solid waste is maintained or operated in such a manner as to pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment; 3. The sanitary landfill, or other facility used for the disposal, storage or treatment of solid waste, because of its location, construction or lack of protective construction or measure s to prevent pollution, poses a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment; 4. Leachate or residues from the sanitary landfill or other facility used for the disposal, storage or treatment of solid waste pose a substantial threat of contamination or pollution of the air, surface waters or ground water; 5. The person to whom the permit was issued abandons or ceases to operate the facility, or sells, leases or transfers the facility without properly transferring the permit in accordance w ith the regulations of the Board; 6. As a result of changes in key personnel, the Director finds that the requirements necessary for issuance of a permit are no longer satisfied; 7. The applicant has knowingly or willfully misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in applying for a permit or in his disclosure statement, or in any other report or certifi cation required under this law or under the regulations of the Board, or has knowingly or willfully failed to notify the Director of any material change to the information in its disclosure statement; or 8. Any key personnel has been convicted of any of the following crimes punishable as felonies under the laws of the Commonwealth or the equivalent thereof under the laws of any other juri sdiction: murder; kidnapping; gambling; robbery; bribery; extortion; criminal usury; arson; burglary; theft and related crimes; forgery and fraudulent practices; fraud in the offering, sale, or purchase of securities; alteration of motor vehicle identifi cation numbers; unlawful manufacture, purchase, use or transfer of firearms; unlawful possession or use of destructive devices or explosives; violation of the Drug Control Act, Chapter 34 (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1; racketeering; violation of antitrust laws; or has been adjudged by an administrative agency or a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated the environmental protection laws of the United States, the Commonwealth or any other state and the Director determines that such conv iction or adjudication is sufficiently probative of the applicants inability or unwillingness to operate the facility in a lawful manner, as to warrant denial, revocation, amendment or suspension of the permit.In making such determination, the Direct or shall consider: (a) The nature and details of the acts attributed to key personnel; (b) The degree of culpability of the applicant, if any; (c) The applicants policy or history of discipline of key personnel for such activities; (d) Whether the applicant has substantially complied with all rules, regulations, permits, orders and statutes applicable to the applicants activities in Virginia; (e) Whether the applicant has implemented formal management controls to minimize and prevent the occurrence of such violations; and (f) Mitigation based upon demonstration of good behavior by the applicant including, without limitation, prompt payment of damages, cooperation with investigations, termination of em ployment or other relationship with key personnel or other persons responsible for the violations or other demonstrations of good behavior by the applicant that the Director finds relevant to its decision.

Admin.

The Board s hall promulgate regulations which ensure that if a facility for the disposal, transfer, or treatment of solid waste is abandoned, the costs associated with protecting the public health and safety from the consequences of such abandonment may be recovered from the person abandoning the facility. A facility that receives solid waste from a ship, barge or other vessel and is regulated under § 10.1-1454.1 shall be considered a transfer facility for the purposes of this subsection. B. The regulat ions may include provisions for bonding, the creation of a trust fund to be maintained within the Department, self-insurance, other forms of commercial insurance, or such other mechanism as the Department may deem appropriate. Regulations governing the a mount thereof shall take into consideration the potential for contamination and injury by the solid waste, the cost of disposal of the solid waste and the cost of restoring the facility to a safe condition. Any bonding requirements shall include a provis ion authorizing the use of personal bonds or other similar surety deemed sufficient to provide the protections specified in subsection A upon a finding by the Director that commercial insurance or surety bond cannot be obtained in the voluntary market du e to circumstances beyond the control of the permit holder. Any commercial insurance or surety obtained in the voluntary market shall be written by an insurer licensed pursuant to Chapter 10 (§ 38.2-1000 et seq.) of Title 38.2. C. No state go vernmental agency shall be required to comply with such regulations. D. Forfeiture of any financial obligation imposed pursuant to this section shall not relieve any holder of a permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this article of any other legal obligations for the consequences of abandonment of any facility. E. Any funds f orfeited prior to July 1, 1995, pursuant to this section and the regulations of the Board shall be paid over to the county, city or town in which the abandoned facility is located. The county, city or town in which the facility is located shall expend fo rfeited funds as necessary to restore and maintain the facility in a safe condition. F. Any funds f orfeited on or after July 1, 1995, pursuant to this section and the regulations of the Board shall be paid over to the Director. The Director shall then expend forfeited funds as necessary solely to restore and maintain the facility in a safe condition. Nothing in this section shall require the Director to expend funds from any other source to carry out the activities contemplated under this subsection. G. Any person who knowingly and willfully abandons a solid waste management facility without proper closure or without providing adequate financial assurance instruments for such closure shall, if such failure to close results in a significant harm or an imminent and substantial threat of significant harm to human health or the environment, be liable to the Commonwealth and any political subdivision for the costs incurred in abating, controlling, preventing, removing, or containing such harm or threat.Any person who knowingly and willfully abandons a solid waste management facility without proper closure or without providing adequate financial assurance instruments for such closure shall, if such failure to close results in a significant harm or an imminent and subs tantial threat of significant harm to human health or the environment, be guilty of a Class 4 felony.

The Board i s authorized to promulgate regulations specifying requirements for local and regional solid waste management plans.To implement regional plans, the Governor may designate regional boundaries. The governing bodies of the counties, cities and towns within any region so designated shall be responsible for the development and implementation of a comprehensive regional solid waste management plan in cooperation with any planning district commission or commissions in the region. Where a county, city or town i s not part of a regional plan, it shall develop and implement a local solid waste management plan in accordance with the Boards regulations. For purposes of this section, each region or locality so designated shall constitute a solid waste planning u nit. B. The Board s regulations shall include all aspects of solid waste management including waste reduction, recycling and reuse, storage, treatment, and disposal and shall require that consideration be given to the handling of all types of nonhazardous solid waste generated in the region or locality. In promulgating such regulations, the Board shall consider urban concentrations, geographic conditions, markets, transportation conditions, and other appropriate factors and shall provide for reasonable variances and exemptions thereto, as well as variances or exemptions from the minimum recycling rates specified herein when market conditions beyond the control of a county, city, town, or region make such mandatory rates unreasonable. C. The Board s regulations shall permit the following credits, provided that the aggregate of all such credits permitted shall not exceed five percentage points of the annual municipal solid waste recycling rate achieved for each solid waste planning unit: 1. A cre dit of one ton for each ton of recycling residue generated in Virginia and deposited in a landfill permitted under subsection M of § 10.1-1408.1; 2. A credit of two percentage points of the minimum recycling rate mandated for the solid waste planning unit for a source reduction program that is implemented with the solid waste plann ing unit. The existence and operation of such a program shall be certified by the solid waste planning unit; 3. A credit of one ton for each ton of any solid waste material that is reused; and 4. A credit of one ton for each ton of any nonmunicipal solid waste material that is recycled. D. Each solid waste planning unit shall maintain a minimum recycling rate for municipal solid waste generated within the solid waste planning unit pursuant to the following schedule: 1. Excep t as provided in subdivision 2, each solid waste planning unit shall maintain a minimum 25 percent recycling rate; or 2. Each solid waste planning unit shall maintain a minimum 15 percent recycling rate if it has (i) a population density rate of less than 100 persons per square mile according to the most recent United States Census, or (ii) a not seasonally adjusted civilian unemployment rate for the immediately preceding calendar year that is at least 50 percent greater than the state average as reported by the Virginia Employment Commission for such y ear.After July 1, 2007, no permit for a new sanitary landfill, incinerator, or waste-to-energy facility, or for an expansion, increase in capacity, or increase in the intake rate of an existing sanitary landfill, incinerator, or waste-to-energy facility shall be issued until the solid waste planning unit within which the facility is located has a solid waste management plan approved by the Board in accordance with the regulations , except as provided in this subsection. Failure to attain a mandated municipal solid waste recycling rate shall not be the sole cause for the denial of any permit or permit amendment, except as provided herein for sanitary landfills, incinerators, or wa ste-to-energy facilities, provided that all components of the solid waste management plan for the planning unit are in compliance with the regulations. The provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable to permits or permit amendments required for the operation or regulatory compliance of any existing facility, regardless of type, nor shall it be cause for the delay of any technical or administrative review of pending amendments thereto. E. Each solid waste planning unit or locality with a population of greater than 100,000 persons according to the most recent United States census shall prepare and submit a recycling survey report to the Department of Environmental Quality annually. Each solid waste p lanning unit or locality with a population of 100,000 or less according to the most recent United States census shall prepare and submit a recycling survey report to the Department of Environmental Quality once every four years. Recycling survey reports submitted once every four years shall only be required to include information for the most recent single year. The first reports submitted pursuant to this section shall be submitted by April 30, 2013, for the reporting year ending December 31, 2012. F. If a county levies a consumer utility tax and the ordinance provides that revenues derived from such source, to the extent necessary, be used for solid waste disposal, the county may charge a town or its residents, establishments and institutions an amount not to e xceed their pro rata cost, based upon population for such solid waste management if the town levies a consumer utility tax. This shall not prohibit a county from charging for disposal of industrial or commercial waste on a county-wide basis, including th at originating within the corporate limits of towns.

It shall be the duty of all persons to dispose of their solid waste in a legal manner. B. Any owner o f real estate in this Commonwealth, including the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof, upon whose property a person improperly disposes of solid waste without the landowners permission, shall be entitled to bring a civil action for such improper disposal of solid waste. When litter is improperly disposed upon land owned by the Commonwealth, any resident of the Commonwealth shall have standing to bring a civil action for such improper disposal of solid waste. When litter is improperly d isposed of upon land owned by any political subdivision of this Commonwealth, any resident of that political subdivision shall have standing to bring a civil action for such improper disposal of solid waste. When any person improperly disposes of solid w aste upon land within the jurisdiction of any political subdivision, that political subdivision shall have standing to bring a civil action for such improper disposal of solid waste. C. In any civi l action brought pursuant to the provisions of this section, when the plaintiff establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that (i) the solid waste or any portion thereof had been in possession of the defendant prior to being improperly disposed of o n any of the properties referred to in subsection A of this section and (ii) no permission had been given to the defendant to place the solid waste on such property, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the defendant improperly disposed of the so lid waste. When the solid waste has been ejected from a motor vehicle, the owner or operator of such motor vehicle shall in any civil action be presumed to be the person ejecting such matter. However, such presumption shall be rebuttable by competent evi dence. This presumption shall not be applicable to a motor vehicle rental or leasing company that owns the vehicle. D.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  While a permit may be required to move or alter a septic system, this section does not provide a private remedy. Since Virginia had no betterment statute providin g a remedy for misplaced improvements, the owner had no right to maintain any portion of his septic system on his neighbors lot, and it was not unlawful, nor did it give rise to any right of action by the owner so long as the truncation acts occurred wholly on the neighbors lot; however, the portion of the owners allegations intimating that the neighbor trespassed onto his property to effect the capping of the line was a viable claim.

For the pur poses of this section:Convenience center means a collection point for the temporary storage of wa ste tires provided for individuals who choose to transport waste tires generated on their own premises to an established centralized point, rather than directly to a disposal facility. To be classified as a convenience center, the collection point shall not receive waste tires from collection vehicles that have collected waste from more than one real property owner. A convenience center shall have a system of regularly scheduled collections and may be covered or uncovered. Speculatively accumulated waste tires means any waste tires that are accumulated before being used, reused, or reclaimed or in anticipation of potential use, reuse, or reclamation. Waste tires are not being accumulated speculatively when at least 75 percent of the waste tires accumulated are being removed from the site annually. B. It shall be unlawful for any person to store, dispose of, speculatively accumulate or otherwise place more than 100 waste tires on public or private property, without first having obtained a permit as required by § 10.1-1408.1 or in a manner inconsistent with an y local ordinance. No person shall allow others to store, dispose of, speculatively accumulate or otherwise place on his property more than 100 waste tires, without first having obtained a permit as required by § 10.1-1408.1. C. Any person who knowingly violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. However, any person who knowingly violates any provision of this section and such violation involves 500 or more waste tires shall be guilty of a Class 6 felon y. D. Salvage yar ds licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles shall be exempt from this section, provided that they are holding fewer than 300 waste tires and that the waste tires do not pose a hazard or a nuisance or present a threat to human health and the environme nt. E. As used in this section, the terms store and otherwise place shall not be construed as meaning the holding of fewer than 500 tires for bona fide uses related to the growing, harvesting or processing of agricultural or forest products. F. The provisi ons of this section shall not apply to the (i) storage of less than 1,500 waste tires in a container at a convenience center or at a salvage yard licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles, as long as the tires are not being speculatively accumulated, or (ii) storage of tires for recycling or for processing to use in manufacturing a new product, as long as the tires are not being speculatively accumulated. G. The provisi ons of this section shall not apply to the storage of tires for recycling or for processing to use in manufacturing a new product, as long as the tires are not being speculatively accumulated. H. Nothing in this section shall limit enforcement of the prohibitions against littering and the improper disposal of solid waste contained elsewhere in this chapter.

CASE NOTES Standing to challenge permit.  A church and a corporation of residents were aggrieved persons and had standing to challange the issuance of a landfill permit where he church, a legal en tity owning property adjacent to the landfill, alleged that its water well and cemetery would be affected by the landfill operations and the residents corporations members, many of whom were adjacent landowners, alleged injury to their water supplies and property values as a result of the operation of the landfill. Residents Involved in Saving the Env't., Inc. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Department of Waste Mgmt., 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 547 (Va. Ct. App. July 25, 2000). While the trial court erred in holding that the plain language of § 62.1-44.29 did not confer representational standing on two citizen groups in their challeng e against the issuance of a water protection permit to a developer, and they did not have standing to sue in their own right, said holding failed to address whether the citizens alleged sufficient injury to confer standing on a member of either of their groups in a personal and individual manner; thus, the matter was remanded for a determination as to whether the citizens alleged sufficient facts to grant them representational standing.

Materials recovery facil ity classification.  Departments classification of a facility as a materials recovery facility was proper; the department found the recyclable materials which were to come to the facility did not become exempt or excluded from regulation until after they were separated from all of the incoming solid waste, and the record supported the departments finding that approximately 30 percent of the materials coming to the facility wo uld have been non-recyclable. The department did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner when it determined more than a de minimis amount of solid waste would come to the facility. Frederick County Bus. Park, LLC v. Va.

ARTICLE I. POLICY AND PURPOSE There is hereby created the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact. The party states recognize and declare that each state is responsible f or providing for the availability of capacity either within or outside the state for disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders, except for waste generated as a result of defense activities of the federal government or federal r esearch and development activities. They also recognize that the management of low-level radioactive waste is handled most efficiently on a regional basis. The party states further recognize that the Congress of the United States, by enacting the Low-Lev el Radioactive Waste Policy Act (P.L. 96-573), has provided for and encouraged the development of low-level radioactive waste compacts as a tool for disposal of such wastes. The party states recognize that the safe and efficient management of low-level r adioactive waste generated within the region requires that sufficient capacity to dispose of such waste be properly provided. It is the policy of the party states to: enter into a regional low-level radioactive waste management compact for the purpose of providing the instrument and framework for a cooperative effort, provide sufficient facilities for the proper management of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region, promote the health and safety of the region, limit the number of facilities required to effectively and efficiently manage low-level radioactive waste generated in the region, encourage the reduction of the amounts of low-level waste generated in the region, distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of successful low-level radioactive waste management equitably a mong the party states, and ensure the ecological management of low-level radioactive wastes. Implicit in the Congressional consent to this compact is the expectation by the Congress and the party states that the appropriate federal agencies will actively assist the Compact Commission and the individual party states to this compact by: 1. Exped itious enforcement of federal rules, regulations and laws; and 2. Imposing sanctions against those found to be in violation of federal rules, regulations and laws; and 3. Timely inspections of their licensees to determine their capability to adhere to such rules, regulations and laws; and 4. Timely provision of technical assistance to this compact in carrying out their obligations under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act as amended. ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction: a. Commission or Compact Co mmission means the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission. b. Facility means a parcel of land, together with the structures, equipment and improvements thereon or a ppurtenant thereto, which is used or is being developed for the treatment, storage or disposal of low-level radioactive waste. c. Generator means any person who produces or possesses low-level radioactive waste in the course of or a s an incident to manufacturing, power generation, processing, medical diagnosis and treatment, research, or other industrial or commercial activity.

CASE NOTES Construction with other law.  Virginia Conservation Easement Act did not create a new right to burden land by a negative easement in gross for the purpose of land conservation and historic pre servation, but facilitated the continued creation of such easements by providing a clear statutory framework under which tax exemptions are made available to charitable organizations devoted to those purposes and tax benefits and incentives are provided to the grantors of such easements, contrary to the common law; moreover, the easement at issue was not of a novel character and is consistent with the statutory recognition of negative easements in gross for conservation and historic purposes. United Sta tes v. Blackman, 270 Va. 68, 613 S.E.2d 442, 2005 Va. LEXIS 69 (2005). Conservation easement interpretati on.  By leaving the strict construction principle in force with the passage of the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, the legislature must have viewed this principle as an appropriate additional incentive for those who draft the conservation easements to achieve clarity in light of the fact that they are subject to enforcement in perpetuity, and this is equally true of the constitutional policy to protect the environ ment, the Open Space Land Act, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, and the Virginia Land Conservation Incentives Act of 1999; like the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, none of these provisions address in any way the interpretive principles to be applied to a conservation easement.

CASE NOTES Conservation easement interpretati on.  By leaving the strict construction principle in force with the passage of the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, the legislature must have viewed this principle as an appropriate additional incentive for those who draft the conservation easements to achieve clarity in light of the fact that they are subject to enforcement in perpetuity, and this is equally true of the constitutional policy to protect the environ ment, the Open Space Land Act, the Virginia Outdoors Foundation, and the Virginia Land Conservation Incentives Act of 1999; like the Virginia Conservation Easement Act, none of these provisions address in any way the interpretive principles to be applied to a conservation easement.

There is he reby established in the state treasury a special permanent, nonreverting fund, to be known as the Virginia Water Quality Improvement Fund. The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. The Fund shall consist of sums appropriated to it by the General Assembly which shall include, unless otherwise provided in the general appropriation act, 10 percent of the annual general fund revenue collections that are in excess of the official estimates in the general appropriation act and 10 percent of any unrestricted and uncommitted general fund balance at the close of each fiscal year whose reappropriation is not required in the general appropriation act. The Fund shall also consist of such other sums as may be made available to it from a ny other source, public or private, and shall include any penalties or damages collected under this article, federal grants solicited and received for the specific purposes of the Fund, and all interest and income from investment of the Fund. Any sums re maining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. All moneys designated for the Fund shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund. Moneys i n the Fund shall be used solely for Water Quality Improvement Grants. Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller upon the written request of the Director of the Department of En vironmental Quality or the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation as provided in this chapter. B. Except as o therwise provided under this article, the purpose of the Fund is to provide Water Quality Improvement Grants to local governments, soil and water conservation districts, state agencies, institutions of higher education and individuals for point and nonpo int source pollution prevention, reduction and control programs and efforts undertaken in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The Fund shall not be used for agency operating expenses or for purposes of replacing or otherwise reducing any gene ral, nongeneral, or special funds allocated or appropriated to any state agency; however, nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the award of a Water Quality Improvement Grant to a local government in connection with point or nonpoint poll ution prevention, reduction and control programs or efforts undertaken on land owned by the Commonwealth and leased to the local government. In keeping with the purpose for which the Fund is created, it shall be the policy of the General Assembly to prov ide annually its share of financial support to qualifying applicants for grants in order to fulfill the Commonwealths responsibilities under Article XI of the Constitution of Virginia. C. For the fis cal year beginning July 1, 2005, $50 million shall be appropriated from the general fund and deposited into the Fund. Except as otherwise provided under this article, such appropriation and any amounts appropriated to the Fund in subsequent years in addi tion to any amounts deposited to the Fund pursuant to the provisions of subsection A shall be used solely to finance the costs of design and installation of nutrient removal technology at publicly owned treatment works designated as significant discharge rs or eligible nonsignificant dischargers for compliance with the effluent limitations for total nitrogen and total phosphorus of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan or applicable regulatory or permit requirements. Notwithstanding the p rovisions of this section, the Governor and General Assembly may, at any time, provide additional funding for nonpoint source pollution reduction activities through the Fund in excess of the deposit required under subsection A.At such time as grant agree ments specified in § 10.1-2130 have been signed by every significant discharger and eligible nonsignificant discharger and available funds are sufficient to implement the provisions of such grant agreements, the House Committee on Agriculture, Chesape ake and Natural Resources, the House Committee on Appropriations, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Senate Committee on Finance and Appropriations shall review the financial assistance provided under this se ction and determine (i) whether such deposits should continue to be made, (ii) the size of the deposit to be made, (iii) the programs and activities that should be financed by such deposits in the future, and (iv) whether the provisions of this section s hould be extended.

The Departm ent of Environmental Quality (the Department) shall be the lead state agency for determining the appropriateness of any grant related to point source pollution to be made from the Fund to restore, protect, or improve state water quality. B. The Directo r of the Department (the Director) shall, subject to available funds and in coordination with the Director of the Department of Conservation and Recreation, direct the State Treasurer to make Water Quality Improvement Grants in accordance with the guidel ines established pursuant to § 10.1-2129. The Director shall enter into grant agreements with all facilities designated as significant dischargers or eligible nonsignificant dischargers that apply for grants; however, all such grant agreements shall c ontain provisions that payments thereunder are subject to the availability of funds. C. Notwithstan ding the priority provisions of § 10.1-2129, the Director shall not authorize the distribution of grants from the Fund for purposes other than financing the cost of design and installation of nutrient removal technology at publicly owned treatment wor ks in the Chesapeake Bay watershed until such time as nutrient reductions of regulations, permits, or the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan are satisfied, unless he finds that there exists in the Fund sufficient funds for substantial and continuing progress in implementation of the reductions established in accordance with regulations, permits, or the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.In addition to the provisions of § 10.1-2130, all grant agreements related to nutrients shall include: (i) numerical technology-based effluent concentration limitations on nutrient discharges to state waters based upon the technology installed by the facility; (ii) enforceable provisions related to the maintenance of the numerical concentrations that will allow for exceedances of 0.8 mg/L for total nitrogen or no more than 10 percent, whichever is greater, for exceedances of 0.1 mg/L for total phosphorus or no more than 10%, and for exceedances caused by extraordinary conditions; and (iii) recognition of the authority of the Commonwealth to make the Virginia Water Facilities Revolving Fund (§ 62.1-224 et seq.) available to local governments to fund their share of the cost of designing and installi ng nutrient removal technology based on financial need and subject to availability of revolving loan funds, priority ranking, and revolving loan distribution criteria.If, pursuant to § 10.1-1187.6, the State Water Control Board approves an alternative compliance method to technology-based concentration limitations in Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, the concentration limitations of the grant agreement shall be suspended subject to the terms of such approval. The cost of the de sign and installation of nutrient removal technology at publicly owned treatment works meeting the nutrient reductions of regulations, permits, or the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan and incurred prior to the execution of a grant agreem ent is eligible for reimbursement from the Fund if the grant is made pursuant to an executed agreement consistent with the provisions of this chapter.Subsequent to the implementation of any applicable regulations, permits, or the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Wate rshed Implementation Plan, the Director may authorize disbursements from the Fund for any water quality restoration, protection, and improvements related to point source pollution that are clearly demonstrated as likely to achieve measurable and specific water quality improvements, including cost effective technologies to reduce loads of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, or nitrogen-containing ammonia in order to meet the requirements of regulations associated with the reduction of ammonia that have not yet been adopted and that are more stringent than regulations adopted by the State Water Control Board as of January 1, 2018.

Procedure for designating a historic district, building, structure, or site as a historic landmark; National Register of Historic Places, National Historic Landmarks; historic district defined. Text A. In any coun ty, city, or town where the Board proposes to designate a historic district, building, structure, object, or site as a historic landmark, or where the Director proposes to nominate property to the National Park Service for inclusion in the National Regis ter of Historic Places or for designation as a National Historic Landmark, the Department shall give written notice of the proposal to the governing body and to the owner, owners, or the owners agent, of property proposed to be so designated or nomin ated, and to the owners, or their agents, of all abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the property. B. Prior to th e designation or nomination of a historic district, the Department shall hold a public hearing at the seat of government of the county, city, or town in which the proposed historic district is located or within the proposed historic district. The public hearing shall be for the purpose of supplying additional information to the Board and to the Director. The time and place of such hearing shall be determined in consultation with a duly authorized representative of the local governing body, and shall be scheduled at a time and place that will reasonably allow for the attendance of the affected property owners. The Department shall publish notice of the public hearing once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published or having general circula tion in the county, city, or town. Such notice shall specify the time and place of the public hearing at which persons affected may appear and present their views, not less than six days nor more than twenty-one days after the second publication of the n otice in such newspaper. In addition to publishing the notice, the Department shall give written notice of the public hearing at least five days before such hearing to the owner, owners, or the owners agent, of each parcel of real property to be incl uded in the proposed historic district, and to the owners, or their agents, of all abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the included property. Notice required to be given to owners by this subsection may be given conc urrently with the notice required to be given to the owners by subsection A. The Department shall make and maintain an appropriate record of all public hearings held pursuant to this section. C. Any written notice required to be given by the Department to any person shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section if sent by first class mail to the last known address of such person as shown on the current real estate tax assessment books, pr ovided that a representative of the Department shall make an affidavit that such mailings have been made. D. The local g overning body and property owners shall have thirty days from the date of the notice required by subsection A, or, in the case of a historic district, thirty days from the date of the public hearing required by subsection B to provide comments and recomm endations, if any, to the Board and to the Director. E. For the pur poses of this chapter, a historic district means a geographically definable area which contains a significant concentration of historic buildings, structures or sites having a common historical, architectural, archaeological, or cultural heritage, and wh ich may contain local tax parcels having separate owners. Contributing properties within a registered district are historic landmarks by definition. F. All regulat ions promulgated by the Director pursuant to § 10.1-2202 and all regulations promulgated by the Board pursuant to § 10.1-2205 shall be consistent with the provisions of this section.
