At its 1954 session the General Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to revise the laws of Virginia relating to corporations generally, and particularly Title 13 relating to business corporations, and in September, 1955, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing the proposed revision. The report, which is entitled Report by the Code Commission of Virginia for Rev ision of the Laws Relating to Corporations, was published as House Document 5 of the 1956 session, and contains revisors notes and comments which, while valuable, are too voluminous for inclusion here. The Code Commissions draft of the revisi on, as amended by the General Assembly, became Chapter 428 of the Acts of 1956, which repealed Title 13 and enacted in lieu thereof Title 13.1 of the Code. Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. Acts 2020, c. 1289, Item 128 J, as added by Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 552, effective for the biennium ending June 30, 2022, provides: &amp;#8220;Notwithstanding § 2.2-1604, Code of Virginia, any cooperative association organized pursuant to Chapter 3 (§ 13.1-301 et seq.) of Title 13.1 of the Code of Virginia as a nonstock corporation that was certified as a small business by the Department of Small Business an d Supplier Diversity prior to July 1, 2017, may be recertified as a small business by the Department, provided that such cooperative association otherwise meets the requirements for certification as a small business pursuant to Article 1 (§ 2.2-1603 e t seq.) of Chapter 16.1 of Title 2.2 of the Code of Virginia and any other applicable provision of the Code of Virginia.&amp;#8221; The 2020 amendments. The 2020 amendment by c. 673 designated the existing provisions as subsections A and B and added subsection C; in subsection A, deleted of this title foll owing Chapter 9 and Chapter 10; and in subsection B, substituted or 10 for and Chapter 10 and deleted of this title preceding as the case may be. Law Review.

Coop., 222 Va. 270, 279 S.E.2d 400, 1981 Va. LEXIS 300 (1981). Any provision granting an immunity from taxes, whether called an exclusion, limitation or exemption, is narrowly construed. Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop ., 222 Va. 270, 279 S.E.2d 400, 1981 Va. LEXIS 300 (1981). The term farmers crops or products, which was used in this section prior to its 1982 amendment, has a clear and precise meaning. It refers to those items produced by the farmer himself, as opposed to those processed by a cooperative or other party. Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop., 222 Va. 270, 279 S.E.2d 400, 1981 Va. LE XIS 300 (1981). Includes some processing by farmer.  Use of both the words crops and products in this section, prior to its 1982 amendment, meant that the farmer could engage in some processing and s tay within the definition. Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop., 222 Va. 270, 279 S.E.2d 400, 1981 Va. LEXIS 300 (1981). The term agricultural products includes livestock and livestock products, poultr y and poultry products, and other farm products. It is broader than the term farmers crops and products. Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop., 222 Va. 270, 279 S.E.2d 400, 1981 Va. LEXIS 300 (1981). Processing by cooperative.  It is only when the cooperative itself processes what it receives from the farmers that it loses the benefit of this section. Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Co op., 222 Va. 270, 279 S.E.2d 400, 1981 Va. LEXIS 300 (1981). Processing is not a part of marketing, and that portion of a taxpayers business is n ot exempt from taxation. Forst v. Rockingham Poultry Mktg. Coop., 222 Va. 270, 279 S.E.2d 400, 1981 Va.

Rev. 899 (1982). CASE NOTES Statute of limitations.  Federal policy is best served by applying the state blue sky laws two-year statute of limitations to a suit involving the fraudulent sale of securities. Newma n v. Prior, 518 F.2d 97, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 14168 (4th Cir. 1975), overruled in part, Newcome v. Esrey, 862 F.2d 1099, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17053 (4th Cir. 1988). Even when state law furnishes the period of limitation, federal law controls its commencement. The statute does not begin to run until the fraud is either actuall y known or should have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence. Newman v. Prior, 518 F.2d 97, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 14168 (4th Cir. 1975), overruled in part, Newcome v. Esrey, 862 F.2d 1099, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17053 (4th Cir. 1988). Motion to dismiss denied when date plaintiff put on notice in issue.  Where, on the basis of the pleadings, the court could not conclude that the suit was barred by the two year limitations period, the facts bearing upon when the pl aintiff was put on notice being in controversy at this point and creating an issue which needed to be resolved by the factfinder at trial, the motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds was required to be denied provisionally. Land v. De an Witter Reynolds, Inc., 617 F. Supp. 52, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16140 (E.D. Va. 1985). Accrual of cause of action takes place at time of underlying action.  There is no discovery provision implied by the language of subsection D of § 13.1-522 and considering that § 13.1-522 applies to violations of the registrat ion provisions of § 13.1-504, as well as those for securities fraud, under this section, it is not surprising that the General Assembly should decide that the accrual of the cause of action should take place at the time of the underlying transaction. Cors v. Langham, 683 F. Supp. 1056, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5498 (E.D. Va. 1988). Materiality of misrepresentation.  District court erred in dismissing plaintiff investors complaint under §§ 13.1-502 and 13.1-522 of the Virginia Securities Act as a reasonable investor would have attached significance to whether defendant companys patents, represented by defendant officers as the companys most valuable and primary assets, were actually owned or whether the patents were only pending at the time defendants provid ed the investor with the investment memorandum; further, the plain language of §§ 13.1-502 and 13.1-522 did not impose on the investor the duty to investigate defendants statements, and subsection A of § 13.1-522 did not require either relia nce or causation. Dunn v. Borta, 369 F.3d 421, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 9734 (4th Cir. 2004). Unreasonable reliance on unsubstantiated oral statements.  Plaintiffs failed to raise an issue of fact regarding their unreasonable reliance on unsubstantiated oral statements that were in contradiction to terms of merger agreement, where the alleged statements were opinions and projections about future events. Poth v. Russey, 281 F. Supp. 2d 814, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15813 (E.D. Va. 2003), aff'd, 99 Fed. Appx. 446, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5861 (4th Cir. 2004). General merger clause disclaiming reliance ineffective to bar fraud claim.  A general merger clause purporting to supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations and undertakings between the parties is invalid u nder federal securities law and, because the language of the Virginia securities law is essentially similar to its federal counterpart, it follows that a state securities fraud claim is also not barred by such a clause. FS Photo, Inc. v. Picturevision, I nc., 61 F. Supp. 2d 473, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14743 (E.D. Va. 1999). Motion to dismiss denied.  Motion by a company and its chief executive officer to dismiss an investors securities fraud action was denied because the investor adequately pled false misr epresentations, and loss causation and scienter were not required elements to state a claim under the Virginia Securities Act. Carlucci v. Han, 907 F. Supp. 2d 709, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153676 (E.D. Va. 2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Meaning of seller under Virginia Securities Act is same as under Securities Act of 1933.  Meaning of seller is the same under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Virginia Securities Act, specifically §§ 13.1-502 and 13.1-522 A. Waterside C apital Corp. v. Nat'l Assisted Living, L.P., 59 Va. Cir. 466, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 359 (Norfolk Sept. 19, 2002). Attorneys may be liable.  Lawyers whose involvement in a securities transaction entails activities beyond the performance of professional services are potentially liable; the language and purposes of § 12(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 suggest that liability extends only to the person who successfully solicits the purchase, motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his own financial interests or those of the securities owner. W aterside Capital Corp. v. Nat'l Assisted Living, L.P., 59 Va. Cir. 466, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 359 (Norfolk Sept. 19, 2002). Liability for solicitation.  Typically, a person who solicits the purchase will have sought or received a personal financial benefit from the sale, such as where he anticipates a share of the profits or receives a brokerage commission; but a person who solicits the buyers purchase in order to serve the financial interests of the owner may properly be liable under § 12(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 without showing that he ex pects to participate in the benefits the owner enjoys. Waterside Capital Corp. v. Nat'l Assisted Living, L.P., 59 Va. Cir. 466, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 359 (Norfolk Sept. 19, 2002). Corporation, as a stock seller, could not be held liable pursuant to § 13.1-502 to the investors for statements that the corporation made in its Private Memora ndum Offering, as the corporation could not have known and passed along to the investors that the foreign aviation administration with which the corporation was aligned intended to sue an entity who had a business deal with the foreign aviation administr ation. However, the investors could sue the corporation for not disclosing the lawsuit after it was filed, as a reasonable investor would have considered that significant in making an investment decision. Kin-Sing Au v. ADSI, Inc., 74 Va. Cir. 219, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 287 (Loudoun County Oct. 1, 2007). Law firm liability.  Law firm representing a securities issuer has no liability under the securities laws if it provides only legal services, but if it solicits the sale for its clien t, it may; the United States Supreme Court has not exempted lawyers from liability if they are motivated to serve the financial interests of the issuer of the securities, and a law firm representing a securities issuer is vulnerable to allegations of sol icitation when it allows its partners to mix their personal interests with their professional responsibilities to the client. Waterside Capital Corp. v. Nat'l Assisted Living, L.P., 59 Va. Cir. 466, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 359 (Norfolk Sept. 19, 2002). Transaction involved no foreign parties.  As a fraudulent transaction did not involve a single foreign entity, given that a company advertised in Virginia and came into Virginia to solicit potential inves tors in an American company, and the investor, a Maryland resident, came to Virginia based on the companys advertisements, the case satisfied both prongs of Morrisons transactional test; thus, the company was not entitled to dismissal of the acti on. Ahn v. C2 Educ. Sys., 84 Va. Cir. 465, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 31 (Fairfax County Apr. 25, 2012). Statute of limitations.  Clients claim that a corporation and its employee violated the Act, §§ 13.1-502 and 13.1-504, was not barred by the statute of limitations contained in the Virginia Securities Act, subsection D of § 13.1-522, because the complaint was timely filed in the United States district court on November 23, 2010, and then immediately transferred to the circuit court after it was decided the federal court lack ed jurisdiction; the client had until November 28, 2010, to file a claim under the Act because he alleged that he entered into a contract with the corporation and employee to purchase stock on November 28, 2008. Ahn v. C2 Educ. Sys., 83 Va. Cir. 457, 201 1 Va. Cir. LEXIS 129 (Fairfax County Oct. 20, 2011). Complaint sufficient to allege violation.  Facts alleged in a clients complaint were sufficient to impute liability upon a corporation and its employee pursuant to the Virginia Securities Act, subsecti on C of § 13.1-522, because the corporation and employee could face liability for a violation of the Act, § 13.1-502; the client alleged sufficient facts to impose liability on the corporation and employee under the theory that they were acting as agents/principles of the actual seller when the fraud occurred, and the complaint sufficiently alleged that the corporation and employee orchestrated the fraud scheme to sell securities. Ahn v. C2 Educ. Sys., 83 Va. Cir. 457, 2011 Va. Cir.

It shall be unlawful for any person who receives directly or indirectly any consideration from another person primarily for advising such other person as to the value of securities or their purchase or sale, whether through the issuance of analyses or reports or ot herwise, 1. To em ploy any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud such other person, 2. To engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon such other person, 3. Acting as principal for his own account, knowingly to sell any security to or purchase any security from a client, or acting as broker for a person other than such client, knowingly to effect any sale or purchase of any security for the account of such client, without disclosing to such client in writing before the completion of such transaction the capacity in which he is acting and obtaining the consent of the client to such transac tion. The prohibitions of this subdivision shall not apply to any transaction with a customer of a broker-dealer if such broker-dealer is not acting as an investment advisor in relation to such transaction, or 4. To engage in dishonest or unethical practices as the Commission may define by rule. B. In the soli citation of advisory clients, it shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. C. Except as m ay be permitted by rule or order of the Commission, it shall be unlawful for any investment advisor to enter into, extend, or renew any investment advisory contract unless it provides in writing: 1. That the investment advisor shall not be compensated on the basis of a share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client; 2. That no assignment of the contract may be made by the investment advisor without the consent of the other party to the contract; and 3. That the investment advisor, if a partnership, shall notify the other party to the contract of any change in the membership of the partnership within a reasonable time after the change . D. Subdivision 1 of subsection C of this section shall not prohibit an investment advisory contract which provides for compensation based upon the total value of a fund averaged over a definite period, or as of definite dates or taken as of a definite date. E. Assignm ent as used in subdivision 2 of subsection C of this section includes any direct or indirect transfer or hypothecation of an investment advisory contract by the assignor or of a controlling block of the assignors outstanding voting securities by a security holder of the assignor. If the investment advisory is a partnership, no assignment of an investment advisory contract is considered to result from the death of withdrawal of a minority of the members of the investment advisor having only a min ority interest in the business of the investment advisor, or from the admission to the investment advisor of one or more members who, after admission, will be only a minority of the members and will have only a minority interest in the business. F. The Commiss ion may by rule or order adopt exemptions from subdivision 3 of subsection A and subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of subsection C of this section where such exemptions are consistent with the public interest and within the purposes fairly intended by the policy a nd provisions of this chapter.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality of registration requirement.  The simple requirement that brokers register with the State Corporation Commission pursuant to the Virginia Securities Act in order to do business with Virginia r esidents does not in any way offend the due process clause, the commerce clause, the supremacy clause, or the First Amendment. Underhill Assocs. v. Coleman, 504 F. Supp. 1147, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10266 (E.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 674 F.2d 293, 1982 U.S. Ap p. LEXIS 20689 (4th Cir. 1982). As this section applies evenly to both local and foreign broker-dealers and the only burden it places on interstate commerce is the requirement that all broker-de alers register and pay an annual fee, it does not violate Art. I, § 8, clause 3, of the United States Constitution.Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 20689 (4th Cir. 1982). The registration provisions of this section have not been preempted by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq., and are thus not violative of Article 6, clause 2, of the United States Constitution.Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 20689 (4th Cir. 1982). The registration provisions of this section neither regulate commercial speech nor prohibit the out-of-state discount securities brokers from advertising and thus this section does not violate First Amendment rights to advertise. Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 20689 (4th Cir. 1982). Virginia does not violate the due process clause by requiring out-of-state discount securities brokers to register with the State Corporation Commission, as it is in the Commonwealths interest to protect its citizens from possibly dishonest or incompetent securities dealers. Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 20689 (4th Cir. 1982). Constitutionality of administratively imposed in-state office requirement.  In an action instituted by three discount securities brokerage firms challenging the constitutionality of the registration requirements of the Virginia Securities Act, administratively imposed in-state office requirement was held to be unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs since its obvious effect was prejudicial to out-of-state brokers, who had to duplicate the expense of maintaining an office in Virginia in order to do business with its residents; thus, the State Corporation Commission could not, consistent with the commerce clause, deny plaintiffs or similarly situated brokers applications for registration solely on the grounds that the applicant did not have a regular place of business in Virginia. Underhill Assocs. v. Coleman, 504 F. Supp. 1147, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10266 (E.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 674 F.2d 293, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 20689 (4th Cir. 1982). Out-of-state discount securities brokers have substantial contact with the Commonwealth where they advertise widely, provide Virginians with a toll-free number, send various informational materials, check prospective customers financial data, run a credit check on customers, contact customers employers, maintain margin accounts and require customers to forward stock certificates to them. Underhill Assocs. v. Bradshaw, 674 F.2d 293, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 20689 (4th Cir. 1982). Accrual of cause of action takes place at time of underlying transaction.  There is no discovery provision implied by the language of subsection D of § 13.1-522 and considering that subsection D of § 13.1-522 applies to violations of the registration provisions of this section, as well as those for securities fraud, under § 13.1-502, it is not surprising that the General Assembly should decide that the accrual of the cause of action should take place at the time of the underlyi ng transaction.

Statute of limitations.  Clients claim that a corporation and its employee violated the Act, §§ 13.1-502 and 13.1-504, was not barred by the statute of limitations contained in the Virginia Securities Act, subsection D of § 13.1-522, because the complaint was timely filed in the United States district court on November 23, 2010, and then immediately transferred to the circuit court after it was decided the federal court lack ed jurisdiction; the client had until November 28, 2010, to file a claim under the Act because he alleged that he entered into a contract with the corporation and employee to purchase stock on November 28, 2008.

A broker-de aler, investment advisor, investment advisor representative or agent may be registered after filing with the Commission, or any entity designated by order or rule of the Commission, an application containing such relevant information as the Commission ma y require. He shall be registered if the Commission finds that: 1. He is a person (and, in the case of a corporation or partnership, the natural persons who are the officers, directors or partners or who otherwise control such corporation or partnership are persons) of good character and reputation; 2. He intends to maintain his business records in accordance with the rules of the Commission; 3. His business knowledge and conduct and his financial responsibility are such that he is a suitable person to engage in the business; 4. He has supplied all information required by the Commission; 5. He is not subject to the revocation provisions of § 13.1-506; and 6. He has paid the necessary fee. B. The Commiss ion may require as a condition of registration or renewal of registration the filing by a broker-dealer or investment advisor of a reasonable surety or other bond conditioned as the Commission may require for the protection of investors not in any case e xceeding $25,000 in penalty amount as evidence of financial responsibility except that no bond shall be required where the net worth of the broker-dealer or investment advisor exceeds $25,000.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality of administratively imposed in-state office requirement.  In an action instituted by three discount securities brokerage firms challenging the constitutionality of the registration requirements of the Virginia Securities Act, administratively imposed in-state office requirement was held to be unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs since its obvious effect was prejudicial to out-of-state brokers, who had to duplicate the expense of maintaining an office in Virginia in order to do business with its residents; thus, the State Corporation Commission could not, consistent with the commerce clause, deny plaintiffs or similarly situated brokers applications for registration solely on the grounds that the applicant did not have a regular place of business in Virginia.

CASE NOTES The purpose of the Virginia Securities Act, known as the Blue Sky Law, is primar ily to suppress the sale of stocks of little or no value. Stevens v. Abbott, Proctor &amp; Paine, 288 F. Supp. 836, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12133 (E.D. Va. 1968). Legislative intent.  The General Assembly intended for a buyer of securities to recover damages for any sale of securities in violation of the statute, regardless of whether the buyer happened to profit from other sales of securities in violation of the statute. Merchant v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., 568 F. Supp. 639, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14947 (E.D. Va. 1983), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 739 F.2d 165, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 20424 (4th C ir. 1984). There is no apparent reason to suppose that in employing the terms offer and accept, the Virginia General Assembly intended to incorporate into th e statute several centuries of technical common-law rules of contract formation. Merchant v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., 568 F. Supp. 639, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14947 (E.D. Va. 1983), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 739 F.2d 165, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 20424 (4th Cir. 1984). Statute is intended to govern those who sell securities within the state even though incorporated elsewhere and never entering into the state. Lintz v. Carey Manor Ltd., 613 F. Supp. 543, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19898 (W.D. Va. 1985). Virginia has a legitimate interest in applying its securities laws to operations conducted within the state, even if aimed at nonresidents. And if the General Assembly chooses to regulate these transactions through the imposition of statutory civil liability in addition to criminal liability, it is free to do so. Lintz v. Carey Manor Ltd. , 613 F. Supp. 543, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19898 (W.D. Va. 1985). Jurisdiction.  Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered blue sky liability by proving that a government-sponsored entity incurred irrevocable liability to purchase loan b acking private-label securitizations (PLS) in the Commonwealth where nothing required the FHFA to present testimony from someone who had direct knowledge about how and where the entitys PLS traders executed the trades at issue, and two entity employe es stated that the entitys PLS traders purchased PLS certificates generally from an office in Virginia. Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. Nomura Holding Am., Inc., 873 F.3d 85, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 18803 (2d Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 2679, 201 L. Ed. 2d 1073, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 3924 (2018), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 2697, 201 L. Ed. 2d 1073, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 3881 (2018). Act does not require scienter.  Unlike its federal counterpart, the Virginia Securities Act does not require scienter; a plaintiff need not establish that the fraudulent representation was made knowingly or with reckless indifference to its truth or falsity; the mere fact of the issuance of the statement is enough. Diaz Vicente v. Obenauer, 736 F. Supp. 679, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5061 (E.D. Va. 1990). Motion by a company and its chief executive officer to dismiss an investors securities fraud action was denied because the investor adequately pled false misr epresentations, and loss causation and scienter were not required elements to state a claim under the Virginia Securities Act. Carlucci v. Han, 907 F. Supp. 2d 709, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153676 (E.D. Va. 2012). Subsection D is designed to allow parties to avoid litigation and quickly settle their differences. The needs of such parties are different from the needs of parties negotiating a commercial transaction. In light of such considerations, the General Assembly more likely intended a common-sense inquiry into the parties intent to determi ne whether a statutory contract has been formed. Merchant v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., 568 F. Supp. 639, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14947 (E.D. Va. 1983), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 739 F.2d 165, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 20424 (4th Cir. 1984). The language of subsection D of this section reflects the fact that, under subsection A of this section, liability may be based on the sale of a single security i n violation of the statute; subsection D then allows the seller to make an offer concerning the security. Merchant v. Oppenheimer &amp; Co., 568 F. Supp. 639, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14947 (E.D. Va. 1983), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 739 F.2d 165, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 20424 (4th Cir. 1984). No discovery provision implied by language of subsection D.  Considering that this section applies to violations of the registration provisions of § 13.1-504, as well as those for securities fraud, under § 13.1-502, i t is not surprising that the General Assembly should decide that the accrual of the cause of action should take place at the time of the underlying transaction.

Where a Virginia resident agreed to distribute a product from a specified location within a designated Virginia territory, the required nexus existed; the focus of the act was not on whether a single vending machine, a distribution territory, or the distributors residence qualified independently as a place of business but whether the places where the distributor operated under the contract, disseminating the product, were within the state. Crone v. Richmond Newspapers, Inc., 238 Va. 248, 384 S.E.2d 77, 6 Va. Law Rep. 359, 1989 Va. LEXIS 136 (1989). Debtor had no cause of action under this Act because the relationship between the debtor and the manufacturer could not be deemed a franchise. Debtor introduced no evidence of any franchise fee or of its being substantially associated with creditors commercial symbol; more damaging, however, was the finding that no written distributorsh ip and parts and services agreement ever existed. JGB Indus., Inc. v. Simon-Telelect, Inc., 223 Bankr. 901, 1997 Bankr. LEXIS 2286 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1997), aff'd, 221 Bankr. 176, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7932 (E.D. Va. 1998). Payment of franchise fees.  Where the dealer alleged it paid a franchise fee, and it asserted it was required to purchase training videos and programs, make payments for the use of cooperati ve advertising, and purchase tools, parts, and other goods and/or services from the manufacturer, these factual assertions were directly contradicted by the contract. Paragraph 18(c) plainly stated: The Dealer has not paid any fee for this agreement.  Thus, the trial court did not have to accept as true the dealers allegations regarding payment of fees for videos and other services.

The franchisor shall have sev en business days from the date of the written notice from the Commission within which to file a written response to the matters addressed in the notice. If (i) the Commission notified, or reasonably attempted to notify, the franchisor in writing, (ii) it appears to be in the public interest, and (iii) either the Commission, after consideration of the franchisors response, reasonably believes the ground or grounds exist or a response is not filed in a timely manner, the Commission may summarily enter an order suspending the effectiveness of the franchisors registration pending final determination of any proceeding under this section. The Commission shall promptly send a copy of the suspension order to the franchisor and each of its subfranchisor s, if any are known to the Commission. At a minimum, the order shall set forth the basis for the suspension as well as the franchisors or subfranchisors right to file a written request for a hearing within twenty-one days after the date of entry of the order.

Annotations CASE NOTES This section requires that plaintiffs proceed under either § 13.1-565 or § 13.1-564. Principe v. McDonald's Corp., 463 F. Supp. 1149, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15077 (E.D. Va. 1979). Subsection (d) of this section in no way provides an additional remedy to plaintiffs und er the Virginia Retail Franchising Act. It merely saves to plaintiffs any other remedies they may have at common law or in equity. Picture Lake Campground, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 497 F. Supp. 858, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12822 (E.D.

This section provides for civil remedies only when there has been (1) an unlawful cancelation of a franchise; (2) undue influence to induce the surrender of a fra nchise right (§ 13.1-564); and (3) when a franchisee declares the franchise void (§ 13.1-565). With such a comprehensive and explicit enforcement scheme set forth in the statutes, no additional cause of action for the breach of fiduciary duty in th e franchise context can be implied from the policy statement set forth in § 13.1-558 or under this section.

Right to terminate.  Where under the franchise agreement, in clear language, the franchisor (as well as the franchisee) were given an unqualified right to terminate the agreement at t he end of the ten-year period the act of giving notice in strict conformity with the agreement was not the sort of mischief that § 13.1-564 was intended to prohibit.

At its 1983 session, the General Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to make a careful study of Chapters 1 (§ 13.1-1 et seq.) and 2 (§ 13.1-201 e t seq.) of this title and to report its findings in the form of a revision. The report, entitled Report of the Virginia Code Commission on the Revision of Chapters 1 and 2 of Title 13.1 of the Code of Virginia, was published as House Document 13 of the 1985 session, and contains revisors notes and comments which, while valuable, are too voluminous for inclusion here. The Code Commissions draft of the revision formed the basis of Chapter 522 of the Acts of 1985, which repealed Chapters 1 and 2 of this title and enacted in lieu thereof Chapters 9 (§ 13.1-601 et seq.), 10 (§ 13.1-801 et seq.), and 11 (§ 13.1-981 et seq.) of this title. Many of the cases cited in the notes under Chapters 9 and 10 were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. Law Review.

For purpose s of this chapter, except for notice to or from the Commission: 1. A not ice shall be in writing except that oral notice of any meeting of the board of directors may be given if expressly authorized by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. 2. Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, words in a notice or other communication under this chapter shall be in the English language. A notice or other communicat ion may be given by any method of delivery, except that electronic transmissions shall be in accordance with this section. If the methods of delivery are impracticable, a notice or other communication may be given by a broad non-exclusionary disseminatio n to the public, which may include a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the notice is intended to be given, or by radio, television, or other form of public communication in the area where the notice is intended to be given or other metho ds of distribution that the corporation has previously identified to its shareholders. 3. A notice or other communication to a domestic or foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth may be delivered to the corporations registered agent at it s registered office or to the secretary at the corporations principal office shown in its most recent annual report or, in the case of a foreign corporation that has not yet delivered an annual report, in its application for a certificate of authorit y. 4. A notice or other communication may be delivered by electronic transmission if consented to by the recipient or if otherwise authorized by subsection B. 5. Any consent under subdivision 4 may be revoked by the person who consented by written or electronic notice to the person to whom the consent was delivered. Any such consent is deemed r evoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive electronic transmissions given by the corporation in accordance with such consent and (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent or other person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications; however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 6. Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic transmission is received when: a. It enters an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic transmissions or information of the type sent, and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic transmission; and b. It is in a form capable of being processed by that system. 7. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subdivision 6 a establishes that an electronic transmission was received. However, such recei pt of an electronic acknowledgment, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received. 8. An electronic transmission is received under this section even if no individual is aware of its receipt. 9. A notice or other communication, if in a comprehensible form or manner, is effective at the earliest of the following: a. If in physical form, the earliest of when it is actually received or when it is left at: (1) A shareholders address shown on the corporations record of shareholders maintained by the corporation pursuant to subsection C of § 13.1-770; (2) A directors residence or usual place of business; (3) The corporations principal office; or (4) The corporations registered office when left with the corporations registered agent; b. If mailed postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a shareholder, upon deposit in the United States mail; c. If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a recipient other than a shareholder, the earliest of when it is actually received or: (i) if sent by re gistered or certified mail return receipt requested, the date shown on the return receipt, signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or (ii) five days after it is deposited in the United States mail; d. If an electronic transmission, when it is received as provided in subdivision 7; and e. If oral, when communicated. 10. A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if (i) the electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form, and (ii) the sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such form of electronic transmission. B. If this cha pter prescribes requirements for notices or other communications in particular circumstances, those requirements govern. If articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe requirements for notices or other communications not inconsistent with this section or other provisions of this chapter, those requirements govern. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may authorize or require delivery of notices of meetings of directors by electronic transmission. C. Without lim iting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to shareholders, any notice to shareholders given by a public corporation, under any provision of this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws, shall be effective if given in a manner permitted by the rules and regulations under the federal Securities Exchange Act of 1934, provided that the corporation has first received any affirmative written consent or implied consent required under those rules and regulations. D. If any prov isions of this chapter are deemed to modify, limit, or supersede the federal General Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. § 7001 et seq., the provisions of this chapter shall control to the maximum extent permitted by § 102(a)(2) of that federal act or any successor provision of that federal act. E. Whenever no tice would otherwise be required to be given under any provision of this chapter to a shareholder, the notice need not be given if: 1. Notic es to shareholders of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings during the period between two consecutive annual meetings, have been sent, other than by electronic transmission, to such shareholder at such shareholders address as s hown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable or could not be delivered; or 2. All, but not less than two, distributions to shareholders during a 12-month period, or two consecutive distributions to shareholders during a period of more than 12 months, have been s ent to such shareholder at such shareholders address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been returned undeliverable or could not be delivered.If any shareholder, for which notice is not required, delivers to the corporation a written notice setting forth such shareholders then-current address, the requirement that notice be given shall be reinstated.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Purposes of corporations.  A charter of incorporation may be granted by the State Corporation Commission to an association to conduct any business that an individual may lawfully conduct, b ut never to conduct a business which an individual may not lawfully conduct under existing laws. Hanger v. Commonwealth, 107 Va. 872, 60 S.E. 67, 1908 Va. LEXIS 148 (1908). Charte r may authorize corporation to form a partnership.  The corporate charter may contain a provision authorizing the corporation to enter into a partnership with another corporation. News-Register Co. v. Rockingham Pu blishing Co., 118 Va. 140, 86 S.E. 874, 1915 Va. LEXIS 133 (1915). Provisions lim iting control of stockholders valid.  The stockholders, by charter, gave a grant of plenary power to the directors for a certain time and thus bound themselves in advance to an affirmance of the acts of the directors, the intention being that the acts of the directors should bind the stockholders the same as if each stockholder had been present at the meeting of the directors and had voted as they did. The provisions of the charter are not in conflic t with acts which provide for annual meetings of the stockholders, and for meetings by them at any time upon the call of those who hold at least one-tenth of the stock for this is intended to apply to those companies in whose charters there is no agreeme nt to the contrary. Union Trust Co. v. Carter, 139 F. 717, 1905 U.S. App. LEXIS 4716 (C.C.D. Va. 1905). Charter restrictio ns on sale or transfer of stock.  Reasonable charter restrictions on the sale or transfer of stock, though strictly construed, are binding upon purchases of the stock upon the principle that the c harter is a contract between the corporation and the stockholders and between the stockholders themselves. Monacan Hills, Inc. v. Page, 203 Va. 110, 122 S.E.2d 654, 1961 Va. LEXIS 228 (1961). Where possible failure to comply literally with certain charter restrictions on the sale of stock was due to a mistake by counsel for the corporation, the corpora tion was not permitted to assert the possible discrepancy against the purchaser of the stock. Monacan Hills, Inc. v. Page, 203 Va. 110, 122 S.E.2d 654, 1961 Va. LEXIS 228 (1961). Ce rtificate conclusive as to location of principal office.  The declaration in the certificate of incorporation of a corporation incorporated under the laws of this State, as to the location of its principal office, is con clusive on that point, and the motive of the corporation in so declaring is immaterial. Loyd's Executorial Trustees v. City of Lynchburg, 113 Va. 627, 75 S.E. 233, 1912 Va. LEXIS 82 (1912). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Validity of right of first refusal.  Pursuant to § 8.01-184, the trial court declared that a right of first refusal in the articles of incorporation of a company was void ab initio, as this limita tion on the transfer of stock was an unreasonable restraint, and also violated the rule against perpetuities.

G. A water or sewer company that proposes to serve more than fifty customers shall incorporate as a public service company. A water or sewer company shall not serve more than fifty customers unless its articles of incorporation state that the corporation is to conduct business as a public service company. The two preceding sentences shall not apply to a water or sewer company incorporated before and operating a water or sewer system on January 1, 1970; however, as to any water or sewer system serving more than fifty customers, upon application to the Commission by a majority of the customers or by the company, a hearing may be held after thirty days notice to the company and the systems customers or a majority thereof, and the Commission may order such, if a ny, improvements or rate changes or both as are just and reasonable. Upon ordering into effect any rate changes or improvements found to be just and reasonable, the water or sewer system shall remain subject to the Commissions regulatory authority in the same manner as a public utility for such reasonable period as the Commission may direct.

The incorpo rators or board of directors of a corporation shall adopt initial bylaws for the corporation. B. The bylaws of a corporation may contain any provision that is not inconsistent with law or the articles of incorporation. C. The bylaws may contain one or more of the following provisions: 1. A req uirement that if the corporation solicits proxies or consents with respect to an election of directors, the corporation include in its proxy statement and any form of its proxy or consent, to the extent and subject to such procedures or conditions as are provided in the bylaws, one or more individuals nominated by a shareholder in addition to individuals nominated by the board of directors; and 2. A requirement that any or all internal corporate claims shall be brought exclusively in a circuit court or a federal district court in the Commonwealth and, if so specified, in any add itional courts in the Commonwealth or in any other jurisdictions in which the corporation maintains its principal office.

D. A provision of the bylaws adopted under subdivision C 2 shall not have the effect of conferring jurisdiction on any court or over any person or claim, and shall not apply if none of the courts specified by such provision has the requisite personal and subject matte r jurisdiction.

E. Notwithstan ding subdivision B 2 of § 13.1-714, the shareholders in amending, repealing, or adopting a bylaw described in subdivision C 1 may not limit the authority of the board of directors to amend or repeal any condition or procedure set forth in, or to add a ny procedure or condition to, such a bylaw to provide for a reasonable, practicable, and orderly process.

CASE NOTES Attorney who acted as one partys agent not disqualified from representing other party.  The fact that an attorney acted as registered agent for a party does not support its motion to disqualify him from representing the other party. A registered agen t may be any person over 18 who is either an officer or director of the corporation or a member of the Virginia State Bar or an appropriately registered professional corporation. As a practical matter, the single function of a registered agent is to act as the recipient of any process, notice, order or demand required or permitted by law, to be served upon the corporation. Such a function does not constitute the establishment of an attorney-client relationship. Chantilly Constr. Corp. v. John Driggs Co. , 39 Bankr. 466, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 5814 (Bankr. E.D.

WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Flow of interstate commerce not eliminated.  The Virginia takeover statutes do not completely eliminate the flow of interstate commerce in hostile takeover attempts of Virginia corporations. More to the poin t, they do not remove competition for corporate control or hoard a local resource. Any potential acquiror that makes an adequate offer may gain control of a Virginia corporation; the Virginia statutes just make it more expensive to do so. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Virginia need not define its corporations as other states do; it must only provide resid ents and nonresidents with equal access to them. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). No Williams Act preemption.  The Williams Act (§§ 15 U.S.C. 78m(d)-(e), 78n(d)-(f)), which regulates disclosure to shareholders and procedures required in tender offers, does not preemp t the Affiliated Transactions Act (§ 13.1-725 et seq.), the Control Share Acquisitions Act (§ 13.1-728.1 et seq.), the poison pill statute (this section), and the business judgment statute (§ 13.1-690), either separately or together. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Statutes not part of integrated sche me.  The Affiliated Transactions Act (§ 13.1-725 et seq.), the Control Share Acquisitions Act (§ 13.1-728.1 et seq.), the poison pill statute (this section), and the business judgment statute (§ 13.1-690) are not parts of an integrated program. They were enacted separately at separate times for separate purposes and with separate applications. Their only apparent link is that they all affect companys host ile takeover attempts. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Effect on tender offers.  Through this section, § 13.1-690, § 13.1-725 et seq., and § 13.1-728.1 et seq., Virginia has given certain tools to shareholders and management, acting i n the best interests of the corporation, to ensure that tender offers succeed only if they are consistent with the long-term interests of the corporation. Shareholders of Virginia corporations need not fear the coercive pressures of two-tiered tender off ers or the prospect of corporate raiders seeking to extract greenmail by threatening to immediately dismantle and sell a corporations assets. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). In vestors not impacted detrimentally by statutory scheme.  The Virginia statutory scheme makes tender offers for Virginia corporations more difficult than they would be absent the statutes. But although the statutes seem to give power to management with the same hand that takes it away from offerors, they do not do so to the detriment of investors. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419 , 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Poison pills may increase bids.  Provided that directors utilize poison pills in the best interests of the corporation, as this section requires, poison pills may be an effective method for incre asing the bid in tender offers. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Limitation on use of poison pill.  This section gives management a very strong tool to use to block a tender offer, but directors may not do so to the detriment of the shareholders. Any action by d irectors regarding poison pills is explicitly subject to the provisions of the business judgment statute, § 13.1-690. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). This section creates the potential for management to entrench itself at the expense of the shareholders, but the possibility of incurring personal liability for b reach of fiduciary duty provides a strong incentive for directors to use poison pills only to defeat inadequate offers. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S . Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994).

The article s of incorporation, the bylaws, an agreement among shareholders, or an agreement between shareholders and the corporation may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shar es issued before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favor of the restriction. B. A restricti on on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certi ficate or is contained in the information statement required by subsection B of § 13.1-648. Unless so noted or contained, a restriction is not enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction. C. A restricti on on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is authorized: 1. To ma intain the corporations status when it is dependent on the number or identity of its shareholders; 2.

CASE NOTES Shareholders termination from employment with corporation overcame pri ma facia showing of ownership.  Trial court did not err in sustaining an employers demurrer to an employees amended request for mandamus relief, as: (1) the employees stock ownership in the employer ceased upon the termination of his employment; and (2) no evidence was presented that the employer engaged in bad faith or that the separation agreement between the parties, or the addenda thereto, were executed in bad faith. Thus, the e mployee lacked the necessary standing when he filed his request. Barber v. VistaRMS, Inc., 272 Va. 319, 634 S.E.2d 706, 2006 Va.

B. Unless othe rwise provided for in the articles of incorporation, the shareholders of a corporation incorporated after December 31, 2005, do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporations unissued shares. C. Except to t he extent that the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise, when there are preemptive rights, the following apply: 1. The s hareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation s unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them. 2.

There is no preemptive right with respect to: a. Shares issued as compensation to officers, employees, or agents of the corporation, its subsidiaries, or affiliates; b. Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, employees, or agents of the corporation, its subsidiaries, or affiliat es; c.

Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights and without preferential rights to distributions have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions. 7. Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration se t by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights.

CASE NOTES Dilutive transaction may be challenged under law of fiduciaries.  While this section recognizes that a shareholders preemptive rights may be limited or denied by a corporations articles of incorporation it does not limit the directors fiduciary duty to a corporations shareholders. The directors authority to amend the articles of incorporation are limited where the effect of the amendment will be to eliminate shareholders preemptive rights; adopting such an amendment may constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary duties.

The board o f directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders, subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection C. B. The board o f directors may fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution. If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporations shares, the record date is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution. C. No distribu tion may be made if, after giving it effect: 1. The c orporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or 2. The corporations total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if t he corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. D. The board o f directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection C either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or o ther method that is reasonable in the circumstances. For any public corporation, reliance upon the most recent financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States shall be deemed t o be reasonable in the circumstances if the financial statements have been audited by independent certified public accountants whose certification does not include a going concern qualification. E. Except as p rovided in subsection G, the effect of a distribution under subsection C is measured: 1. In th e case of a distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporations shares, as of the earlier of (i) the date cash or other property is transferred or debt to a shareholder incurred by the corporation or (ii) the date the share holder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares; 2. In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and 3. In all other cases, as of (i) the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within 120 days after the date of authorization or (ii) the date payment is made if it occur s more than 120 days after the date of authorization. F. A corporati ons indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporations indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement. G. Indebtednes s of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection C if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest is made only if and to the extent that paymen t of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If such indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is ac tually made. H. This sectio n shall not apply to distributions in liquidation under Article 16 (§ 13.1-742 et seq.). History History.

CASE NOTES Shareholders exercising duties of directors.  The trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs claim against corporation shareholders for unlawful distribution of corporate assets because, although the defe ndant shareholders were not duly elected directors of the dealership, they had assumed and exercised the duties of directors without benefit of formal election; consequently, they were directors for purposes of this section and §§ 13.1-690 and 13.1-692.

A sole stockholder is constrained by the same rules that govern other corporations. For example, he may not distribute assets if the corporation otherwise cannot pay its debts. This ensures that a sole stockholder cannot avoid the corporations civil obligations and liabilities by treating corporate property as his personal property. Uni ted States v. Brandon, 651 F. Supp. 323, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 283 (W.D. Va. 1987) (decided under prior law).

Viol ation where distributions greater than liabilities.  Under this section, a violation of Chapter 9 may occur if, as a result of distributions made to shareholders, the corporation would not be able to pay its deb ts as they become due, or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities. Commonwealth Transp.

B. The article s of incorporation may authorize action by shareholders by less than unanimous written consent, provided that the taking of such action is consistent with any requirements that may be set forth in the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or this sectio n; however, unless the articles of incorporation of a public corporation authorized action by shareholders by less than unanimous written consent as of April 1, 2018, the shareholders of the public corporation shall not be entitled to act by less than un animous written consent even if so authorized by the articles of incorporation if the articles of incorporation or bylaws of such public corporation allow the holders of 30 percent or fewer of all votes entitled to be cast to demand the calling of a spec ial meeting of shareholders.

A written con sent may be revoked by a writing to that effect delivered to the corporations secretary before unrevoked written consents sufficient in number to take the corporate action are delivered to the corporation. E. A consent s igned pursuant to the provisions of this section has the effect of a vote taken at a meeting and may be described as such in any document. Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors provides for a reasonable d elay to permit tabulation of written consents, the action taken by written consent shall be effective when (i) written consents signed by the holders of shares having sufficient votes to adopt or take the action are delivered to the corporations secr etary or (ii) if an effective date is specified therein, as of such date provided such consent states the date of execution by the consenting shareholder. F. For purpose s of this section, a written consent and the signing thereof may be accomplished by one or more electronic transmissions. G. Any person, whether or not then a shareholder, may provide that a consent in writing as a shareholder shall be effective at a future time, including the time when an event occurs, but such future time shall not be more than 60 days after such provision is made. Any such consent shall be deemed to have been made for purposes of this section at the future time so specified for the consent to be effective, provided that (i) the person is a shareholder at such future time and (ii) the person did not revoke the consent prior to such future time. Any such consent may be revoked, in the manner provided in subsection D, prior to its becoming effective. H. If this cha pter requires that notice of a proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the action not more tha n 10 days after (i) written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporations secretary, or (ii) such later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection E. The notice shall r easonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under any provision of this chapter, would have been required to be sent to nonvoting shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the proposed action would ha ve been submitted to the shareholders for action. I. If action i s taken by less than unanimous written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation shall give its nonconsenting voting shareholders written notice of the action not more than 10 days after (i) written consents sufficient to take the action have b een delivered to the corporations secretary or (ii) such later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection E.

J. The notice requirements in subsections H and I shall not delay the effectiveness of actions taken by written consent, and a failure to comply with such notice requirements shall not invalidate actions taken by written consent, provided that this subsection shall no t be deemed to limit judicial power to fashion any appropriate remedy in favor of a shareholder adversely affected by a failure to give such notice within the required time period.

After fixin g a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to notice of a shareholders meeting. If the board of directors fixes a different record date under subsection E of § 13.1-660 to determine the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, a corporation also shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to vote at the meeting. A list shall be arranged by voting group, and within each voting group by class or series of shares, and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder. Nothing contained in this subsection shall require the corporation to include on such list the electronic mail address or other electronic contact information of a shareholder. B. The shareho lders list for notice shall be available for inspection by any shareholder, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, (i) at the corporations principal off ice or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the county or city where the meeting will be held or (ii) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to shareholders of the corporation. A shareholde rs list for voting shall be similarly available for inspection promptly after the record date for voting. The original share transfer books shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or to vote at any m eeting of shareholders. A shareholder, or the shareholders agent or attorney, is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of subsection D of § 13.1-771, to copy a list, during regular business hours and at the shareho lders expense, during the period it is available for inspection. C. If the meet ing is to be held at a place, the corporation shall make the list of shareholders entitled to vote available at the meeting, and any shareholder, or the shareholders agent or attorney, is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then such list shall also be open to such inspection during the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such lis t shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. D. If the corp oration refuses to allow a shareholder or the shareholders agent or attorney to inspect a shareholders list before or at the meeting, or to copy a list as permitted by subsection B, the circuit court of the county or city where the corporation s principal office, or if none in the Commonwealth its registered office, is located, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporations expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete. E. Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting. History History.

CASE NOTES Ownership of stock in corporate records is prima facie correct.  The ownership of stock as reflected in the corporate records is prima facie correct. However, neither the corporations records nor the outstanding stock cert ificates are a verity. Young v. Young, 240 Va. 57, 393 S.E.2d 398, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2573, 1990 Va. LEXIS 92 (1990). Undelivered securities overcame prima facie showing of ownership.  Where disputed certificated securities were never delivered to donors daughters nor to anyone designated by the daughters to receive them, no inter vivos gift was ever made. These undisputed facts were more than sufficient to overcome the prima facie showing of ownership made by the corporate records. Young v. Young, 240 Va. 57, 393 S.E.2d 398, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2573, 1990 Va. LEXIS 92 (1990). Shareholders termination from employment with corporation overcame pri ma facia showing of ownership.  Trial court did not err in sustaining an employers demurrer to an employees amended request for mandamus relief, as: (1) the employees stock ownership in the employer ceased upon the termination of his employment; and (2) no evidence was presented that the employer engaged in bad faith or that the separation agreement between the parties, or the addenda thereto, were executed in bad faith. Thus, the e mployee lacked the necessary standing when he filed his request. Barber v. VistaRMS, Inc., 272 Va. 319, 634 S.E.2d 706, 2006 Va.

Except as p rovided in subsections B, C, D, and E or unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, each outstanding share, regardless of class or series, is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on at a shareholders meeting. Only shares are entitle d to vote. B. Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, in the election of directors each outstanding share, regardless of class or series, is entitled to one vote for as many persons as there are directors to be elected at that time and for whose election the shar eholder has a right to vote. C. Redeemable shares are not entitled to vote after delivery of written notice of redemption is effective and a sum sufficient to redeem the shares has been deposited with a bank, trust company, or other financial institution under an irrevocable obligation to pay the holders the redemption price on surrender of the shares. D. Shares of a corporation are not entitled to vote if they are owned directly or indirectly through an entity of which a majority of the voting power is held directly or indirectly by the corporation or that is otherwise controlled by the corporation. E. If a corpor ation holds in a fiduciary capacity its own shares directly, or indirectly through an entity of which a majority of the voting power is held directly or indirectly by the corporation or that is otherwise controlled by the corporation, such shares shall n ot be deemed to be outstanding and entitled to vote unless: 1. The c orporation has authority to vote the shares only in accordance with directions of the principal or beneficiary; or 2. A co-fiduciary exists, pursuant to § 6.2-1011 or otherwise, in which event the co-fiduciary may vote the shares. F. Shares stan ding in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officers, agent, or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determin e. G. Shares stan ding in the name of a partnership may be voted by any partner. Shares standing in the name of a limited liability company may be voted as the articles of organization or an operating agreement may prescribe, or in the absence of any such provision as the managers, or if there are no managers, the members of the limited liability company may determine. H. Shares held by three or fewer persons as joint tenants or tenants in common or tenants by the entirety may be voted by any of such persons. If more than one of such tenants votes such shares, the vote shall be divided among them in proportion to the number of such tenants voting. I. Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator, committee, or curator representing the shareholder may be voted by such person without a transfer of such shares into such persons name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by t he trustee, but no trustee is entitled to vote shares held by the trustee without a transfer of such shares into the trustees name. J. Shares stan ding in the name of a receiver or a trustee in proceedings under the federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 may be voted by such person. Shares held by or under the control of a receiver or a trustee in proceedings under the federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 may be voted by such person without the transfer thereof into such persons name if authority to do so is contained in an order of the court by which such person was appointed. K.

A proxy apparently executed by one of several of such fiduciaries shal l be presumed to be valid until challenged and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger. History History.

Law Review. For article, The Status of the At-Will Employment Doctrine in Virginia after Bowman v. State Bank of Keysville, see 20 U. Rich. L. Rev. 267 (1986). CASE NOTES Threat of discharge unlawful as means to control voting by employee.  Because the voting rights conferred by this section are in furtherance of established public policy, an employer could not lawfully use the threat of discharge, o f an at-will employee as a device to control the otherwise unfettered discretion of a shareholder-employee to vote freely his or her stock in the corporation-employer. Consequently, the employee stated a cause of action in tort against the employer and i ts board of directors for improper discharge from employment. Bowman v. State Bank, 229 Va. 534, 331 S.E.2d 797, 1985 Va. LEXIS 228 (1985) (decided under former § 13.1-32). Bowman as except ion to employment at-will doctrine.  It seems clear that Bowman v. State Bank , 229 Va. 534, 331 S.E.2d 797 (1985), upon amplification by Miller v. SEVAMP, Inc. , 234 Va. 462, 362 S.E.2d 915 (1987), established a narrow public policy exception to the employment at-will doctrine. That exception is triggered only when the discharge is in response to the employees refusal to commit an unlawful act o r in the employees exercise of a statutory right. Haigh v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of Am., 676 F. Supp. 1332, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12113 (E.D. Va. 1987) (decided under former § 13.1-32). The Bowman v. State Bank , 229 Va. 534, 331 S.E.2d 797 (1985) exception applies where plaintiff alleges he was discharged for his refusal to commit an illegal act. This holding does not expand the rulings of Bowman and Miller v. SEVAMP, Inc., 234 Va. 462, 362 S.E.2d 915 (1987) but conforms to those decisions in adhering to the rule of law established therein since plai ntiffs termination would be in violation of established public policy as expressed in 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. and § 59.1-9.5.Haigh v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of Am., 676 F. Supp. 1332, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12113 (E.D. Va. 1987) (decided under for mer § 13.1-32). Tenants by the entirety.  As regards shares of corporate stock, it does seem reasonably clear that the General Assembly, in enacting this section and § 13.1-435, contemplated that such shares could be held by husband and wife as tenants by the entirety, and that the Genera...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_13.1-663"><akn:num>§ 13.1-663</akn:num><akn:heading>Proxies</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. A sharehold er may vote the shareholders shares in person or by proxy. B. A sharehold er, or the shareholders agent or attorney-in-fact, may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form or by an electronic transmission. An electronic transmission shall contain or be accompanied by informa tion from which the recipient can determine the date of the transmission and that the transmission was authorized by the sender or the senders agent or attorney-in-fact. C. An appointm ent of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspectors of election or the officer or agent of the corporation authorized to count votes. An appointment is valid for the te rm provided in the appointment form and, if no term is provided, is valid for 11 months unless the appointment is irrevocable under subsection D. D. An appointm ent of a proxy is revocable unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointments coupled with an interest include the appointment of: 1. A ple dgee; 2. A person who purchased or agreed to purchase the shares; 3. A creditor of the corporation who extended it credit under terms requiring the appointment; 4. An employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires the appointment; or 5. A party to a voting agreement created under § 13.1-671. E. The death o r incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxys authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the corporations secretary or other officer or agent authorized to count votes before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment. F. An appointm ent made irrevocable under subsection D is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. G. Unless it o therwise provides, an appointment made irrevocable under subsection D continues in effect after a transfer of the shares and a transferee takes subject to the appointment, except that a transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if the transferee did not know of its existence when acquiring the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates. H. Subject to § 13.1-665 and to any express limitation on the proxys authority stated in the appointment form or electronic transmission, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxys vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.

A public co rporation shall, and any other corporation may, appoint one or more inspectors to act at a shareholders meeting in connection with determining voting results. Each inspector shall verify in writing that the inspector will faithfully execute the dutie s of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of the inspectors ability. An inspector may be an officer or employee of the corporation.

Determine the validity of proxy appointments and ballots; 4. Count all votes; and 5. Make a written report of the results. C. No ballots, proxies, or votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto, may be accepted after the closing of the polls unless the circuit court of the city or county where the corporations principal office is located or, if none in the Commonwealth, wher e its registered office is located, upon application by a shareholder, shall determine otherwise. D. In performi ng their duties, the inspectors may examine (i) the proxy appointment forms or electronic transmissions and any other information provided in accordance with subsection B of § 13.1-663, (ii) any envelope or related writing submitted with those appoint ment forms, (iii) any ballots, (iv) any evidence or other information specified in § 13.1-665, and (v) the relevant books and records of the corporation relating to its shareholders and their entitlement to vote, including any securities position list provided by a depository clearing agency. E. The inspect ors also may consider other information that they believe is relevant and reliable for the purpose of performing any of the duties assigned to them pursuant to subsection B, including for the purpose of evaluating inconsistent, incomplete, or erroneous i nformation and reconciling information submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees, or similar persons that indicates more votes being cast than a proxy authorized by the record shareholder is entitled to cast. If the inspectors consider other information allowed by this subsection, they shall in their report under subsection B specify the information considered by them, including the purpose or purposes for which the information was considered, the person or persons from whom they obtai ned the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained, and the basis for the inspectors belief that such information is relevant and reliable.

An agreemen t among the shareholders of a corporation that complies with this section is effective among the shareholders and the corporation, even though it is inconsistent with one or more other provisions of this chapter in that it: 1. Elimi nates the board of directors or, subject to the requirements of subsection D of § 13.1-647 and subsection A of § 13.1-693, one or more officers or restricts the discretion or powers of the board of directors; 2.

Establishes who shall be directors or officers of the corporation, or their terms of office or manner of selection or removal; 4. Governs, in general or in regard to specific matters, the exercise or division of voting power by or between the shareholders and directors or by or among any of them, including use of weighted voting rights or director proxies; 5.

Otherwise governs the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship among the shareholders, the directors and th e corporation, or among any of them, and is not contrary to public policy. B. An agreemen t authorized by this section shall be: 1.

Subject to amendment only by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise. C. The existen ce of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement required by subsection B of § 13.1-648. If at the time of the agreement the corp oration has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificat e or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Any purchaser of shares who, at the time of purchase, did not have knowledge of the existence of the agreement shall be entitled to rescission o f the purchase. A purchaser shall be deemed to have knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or before the time of purchase of the shares.

E. An agreemen t authorized by this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board of directors shall relieve the directors of, and impose upon the person or persons in whom such discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement. F. The existen ce or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement. G. Incorporato rs or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares have been issued when the agreement is made. H. No action t aken pursuant to this section shall change any requirement to file articles or other documents with the Commission or affect the rights of any creditors or other third parties. I. Limits, if any, on the duration of an agreement authorized by this section shall be as set forth in the agreement, except that the duration of an agreement that became effective prior to July 1, 2015, remains 10 years unless the agreement provided otherwise or is s ubsequently amended to provide otherwise.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Stock purchase agreement that one shareholder did not sign held void.  Stock purchase agreement (SPA) was void for failing to comply with subdivision B 1 b of § 13.1-671.1, since one of the shareholders had not signed it. That a m ajority shareholder signed, as an individual, a consent containing a resolution authorizing him as president of the corporation to sign agreements necessary to sell stock of the company did not make his signature as president on the SPA his de facto indi vidual signature.

CASE NOTES Minority shareholder fairly and adequately represented the interests of corporation.  Applying the Jennings factors to the specific facts of a case involving a law firm with only two shareholders, the totality of the circumstances combined to show that the minority shareholder fairly and adequately represented the interests of the corporation as re quired under subsection A of § 13.1-672.1, and the remedy sought, the return of funds, misappropriated by an officer, to the corporation, was highly appropriate for a derivative claim. Cattano v. Bragg, 283 Va. 638, 727 S.E.2d 625, 2012 Va. LEXIS 86 ( 2012). Failure to make demand.  Former shareholder of a corporation could not maintain shareholder derivative claims for breach of fiduciary duties, waste, and civil conspiracy because: (1) unde r subsection A of § 13.1-735.1, the former shareholder lost her status as a shareholder when she returned an executed appraisal form; and (2) the former shareholder did not make a written demand on the corporation as required by subsection B of § 1 3.1-672.1.Firestone v. Wiley, 485 F. Supp. 2d 694, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34382 (E.D. Va. 2007).

Supp. 520, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8054 (E.D. Va. 1987) (decided under prior law). Sufficiency of pleading.  Shareholder had standing to pursue its derivative claims because it plausibly stated that it was a shareholder at the time of the alleged misconduct by defendants , still remained a shareholder, and followed the statutory notice requirements. DCG&amp;T ex rel. Battaglia v. Knight, 68 F. Supp. 3d 579, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174996 (E.D. Va. 2014), dismissed without prejudice, No. 3:14-cv-432, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4476 (E.D. Va. Jan. 14, 2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Futility.  Because a member and a manager of a limited liability company could not together refuse to act upon a request that certain derivative claims be asserted against t he manager, the company and the member lodged viable derivative corporation claims under §§ 13.1-1042 and 13.1-672.1 against the manager based on futility. Schrager v. Isquith, 69 Va. Cir. 31, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 349 (Richmond May 3, 2005). Sufficiency of demand.  Shareholder, before filing a derivative action, did not sufficiently demand redress of the alleged usurpation of corporate opportunities in the shareholders w ritten demands to a corporation, pursuant to subdivision B 1 of § 13.1-672.1, because the wrongs alleged in the shareholders written demands related to the corporations financial records and the shareholders lack of access to the records. Thus, the shareholder was permitted to proceed with regard to the alleged lack of access to the corporations financial records, but not with regard to the alleged usurpation of corporate opportunities. Willliams v. Stevens, 86 Va. Cir. 385, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 28 (Norfolk Apr. 1, 2013). Estate of a deceased shareholder in a corporation had standing to initiate a derivative action because an e-mail sent by a coexecutor of the estate to the preside nt of the corporation satisfied the requirements of a pre-suit written demand for the coexecutor to have standing to file a derivative action on behalf of the corporation. The estate held all of the nonvoting shares of stock, while the president owned al l of the voting shares of stock and the e-mail requested that the president return excessive compensation received by the president.

A derivativ e proceeding may not be settled or discontinued without the courts approval. If the court determines that a proposed discontinuance or settlement will substantially and adversely affect the interests of the corporations shareholders or a class or series of the corporations shareholders, the court shall direct that notice be given to the shareholders affected. B. Notice requ ired by subsection A shall be given in such manner as the court shall determine, and the costs of such notice shall be borne in such manner as the court shall direct.

Corporations, § 157. CASE NOTES Editors note.  Many of the cases below were decided under prior law. Directors are under regulation of stockholders.  The board of directors is under the regulation of the stockholders if no consent has been given in the charter by the stockholders for the directors to have the e xclusive management. Union Trust Co. v. Carter, 139 F. 717, 1905 U.S. App. LEXIS 4716 (C.C.D. Va. 1905). But corporat e powers are vested in board of directors.  All the powers of the corporation are vested in the board of directors. Sterling v. Trust Co., 149 Va. 867, 141 S.E. 856, 1928 Va. LEXIS 397 (1928). Board of directors may make contracts.  The board of directors have the widest of powers. All of the various acts and contracts which a corporation may enter into are entered into by and through the boa rd of directors. Taylor v. Sutherlin-Meade Tobacco Co., 107 Va. 787, 60 S.E. 132, 1908 Va. LEXIS 141 (1908) (see also Burr v. McDonald, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 215 (1846); Addison v. Lewis, 75 Va. 701 (1881)). Director cannot profit from transactions of the corporation.  A director of a private corporation cannot directly or indirectly, in any transaction in which he is under a duty to guard the interests of the corporation, acqui re any personal advantage, or make any profit for himself, and if he does so, he may be compelled to account therefor to the corporation. Giannotti v. Hamway, 239 Va. 14, 387 S.E.2d 725, 6 Va. Law Rep. 942, 1990 Va. LEXIS 3 (1990). Under the business judgment rule, directors are presumed to have acted properly and in g ood faith in the exercise of their business judgment, including the fixing of compensation, and are called to account for their actions only when they are shown to have engaged in self-dealing or fraud, or have acted in bad faith; however, when a plainti ff demonstrates that a director had an interest in the transaction at issue, the burden shifts to the director to prove that the transaction was fair and reasonable to the corporation. Giannotti v. Hamway, 239 Va. 14, 387 S.E.2d 725, 6 Va. Law Rep. 942, 1990 Va. LEXIS 3 (1990). Bestowing of authority on officers.  The powers of a private corporation so far as its dealings with third persons are concerned, are primarily lodged in its board of directors, from which source the officers, either expressly or by implication derive such authority as may be bestowed upon them. Clement v. Adams Bros.-Paynes Co., 113 Va. 546, 75 S.E. 294 (1912). Such as the president.  The office of president itself confers no power to bind the corporation or control its property. His power as an agent comes as a delegation of authority from the bylaws or the board of directors. Crump v. United States Mining Co., 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 352, 1851 Va. LEXIS 15 (1851); Hodges v. First Nat'l Bank, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 51, 1872 Va. LEXIS 4 (1872); Taylor v. Sutherlin-Meade Tobacco Co., 107 Va. 787, 60 S.E. 132, 1908 Va. LEXIS 141 (1908); Clement v. Adams Bros.-Paynes Co., 113 Va. 547, 75 S.E. 294, 1912 Va. LEXIS 69 (1912). Discharging of officers.  Directors may appoint officers and agents and may elect the president when the situation demands it, and as incident to this power of appointment, they may discha rge those appointed. Kaplan v. Block, 183 Va. 327, 31 S.E.2d 893, 1944 Va. LEXIS 158 (1944). Directors cannot be legisl ated out of office.  Limitations may be placed upon the powers of directors but they cannot be legislated out of office. Kaplan v. Block, 183 Va. 327, 31 S.E.2d 893, 1944 Va. LEXIS 15 8 (1944). A charter and bylaw provision that the directors should not have power to do anything without the consent of every stockholder is void. Kaplan v. Block, 183 Va. 3 27, 31 S.E.2d 893, 1944 Va. LEXIS 158 (1944). For directors are essentia l to a corporation.  A private business corporation without a board of directors is an impossible concept. Kaplan v. Block, 183 Va. 327, 31 S.E.2d 893, 1944 Va. LEXIS 158 (1944). A majority of the board of directors cannot undertake to act in their individual names for the board itself. They can only bind their railroad corporation by acti ng together as a board. Honaker v. New River, H. &amp; W.R.R., 116 Va. 662, 82 S.E. 727, 1914 Va. LEXIS 74 (1914). Board validly constituted.  A board of directors consisting of four persons, two of whom were nonresidents of the State and one of whom was not a stockholder, was validly constituted under t he provisions of this and the following sections. Koch v. Seventh St. Realty Corp., 205 Va. 65, 135 S.E.2d 131, 1964 Va. LEXIS 146 (1964). Individual directors are not agents of the corporation, and it is well settled, therefor e, that declarations and admissions of individual directors when not acting as a board are not binding on the corporation admissible as evidence against it, unless they were acting at the time as its authorized agents and within the scope of their author ity. Curbstone admissions or declarations of an individual director do not have the effect of binding the corporation in the absence of evidence that authority to make such declarations was duly conferred. Monacan Hills, Inc. v. Page, 203 Va. 110, 122 S. E.2d 654, 1961 Va. LEXIS 228 (1961). A shareholder generally has not the right to sue in his own name upon a cause of action existing in the corporation. Abella v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., 495 F. Supp. 713, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13181 (E.D. Va. 1980). For decision to sue is one for direc tors.  The decision of whether or not to institute legal proceedings on behalf of the corporation is commonly regarded as a matter of internal management to be left to t he discretion of the directors. Abella v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., 495 F. Supp. 713, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13181 (E.D. Va. 1980). But shareholder may sue in a derivative capacity.  Where the directors refuse to enforce the corporations right in court, a shareholder may then sue in a derivative capacity only upon a showing either that the managing agents are themselves the authors of the wrong, or that their refusal to bring suit in the name of the corporation is an act of bad faith, or an abuse of the discretionary power vested in them. Abella v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., 495 F. Supp. 713, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13181 (E.D. Va. 1980). And directors may not effect dismiss al.  Virginia law does not permit directors, interested or disinterested, to effect the dismissal of a derivative suit against a corporation and its directors, based s imply upon their business judgment that the suit is contrary to the corporations best interests. Abella v. Universal Leaf Tobacco Co., 495 F. Supp. 713, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13181 (E.D.

For related discussion, see 4B M.J. Corporations, § 149. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Minimum number is mandatory.  The provision that there should be not less than three (now one) directors is mandatory. Crump v. Bronson, 168 Va. 527, 191 S.E. 663, 1937 Va. LEXIS 250 (1937). This section was enacted to restrict action by the board of directors and insure ultimat e corporate control in the shareholders. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). It was not designed to inhibit the power granted to shareholders to remove directors at will. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). That this section is aimed at actions other than shareholder removal of incumbent directors is understood by reading it as an integral part of this title. Scott C ounty Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). The language of this section does not bar all actions which result in a foreshortened term of an incumbent director. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). It bars only a decrease in the number of directorships. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). Th us, directors may not decrease number by amending bylaws.  This section prevents the directors, by amending the bylaws to decrease the number of directors, from curtailing the term of duly elected directors. In this way, a boards ability to alter its composition between annual meetings is restricted while the benefits of § 13.1-714, which gives the board, in managing the corporation, the power to amend or repeal bylaws in the absence of a reservation of this power to the shareholders in the articles of incorporation, still obtain. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). The capacity of a board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors through bylaw amendment is an opportunity to effect usurpation of shareholder control of matters vital to their protection. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). The removal of all the position holders is not a decrease in the number of positions. Th us, the shortening of the terms of the 16 incumbent directors does not stem from the cause prohibited by this section. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). Where the stockholders removed the 16 incumbent directors and elected three new directors as a full board, the new board was validly constituted since the minimum number of directors permitted by law for a corporation is three (now one), the corporations articles of incorporation did not fix the number of directors, the original byl aws could not be located, and while the maximum number of directors was fixed in the bylaws as 16, there was no evidence that the bylaws fixed a minimum number.

Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). No Williams Act preemption.  The Williams Act (§§ 15 U.S.C. 78m(d)-(e), 78n(d)-(f)), which regulates disclosure to shareholders and procedures required in tender offers, does not preemp t the Affiliated Transactions Act (§ 13.1-725 et seq.), the Control Share Acquisitions Act (§ 13.1-728.1 et seq.), the poison pill statute (§ 13.1-646), and the business judgment statute (this section), either separately or together. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Statutes not part of integrated sche me.  The Affiliated Transactions Act (§ 13.1-725 et seq.), the Control Share Acquisitions Act (§ 13.1-728.1 et seq.), the poison pill statute (§ 13.1-646), an d the business judgment statute (this section) are not parts of an integrated program. They were enacted separately at separate times for separate purposes and with separate applications. Their only apparent link is that they all affect companys host ile takeover attempts. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Effect on tender offers.  Through § 13.1-646, this section, § 13.1-725 et seq., and § 13.1-728.1 et seq., Virginia has given certain tools to shareholders and management, acting i n the best interests of the corporation, to ensure that tender offers succeed only if they are consistent with the long-term interests of the corporation. Shareholders of Virginia corporations need not fear the coercive pressures of two-tiered tender off ers or the prospect of corporate raiders seeking to extract greenmail by threatening to immediately dismantle and sell a corporations assets. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). In vestors not impacted detrimentally by statutory scheme.  The Virginia statutory scheme makes tender offers for Virginia corporations more difficult than they would be absent the statutes. But although the statutes seem to give power to management with the same hand that takes it away from offerors, they do not do so to the detriment of investors. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 861 F. Supp. 1277, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11209 (W.D. Va.), dismissed, 869 F. Supp. 419 , 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). This section refers to the positive duties required of directors by the statute law. And erson v. Bundy, 161 Va. 1, 171 S.E. 501, 1933 Va. LEXIS 296 (1933) (decided under prior law); (see also).Marshall v. Fredericksburg Lumber Co., 162 Va. 136, 173 S.E. 553, 1934 Va. LEXIS 242 (1934). Good faith business judgment.  Decision making process engaged in by directors demonstrated that their actions were taken in compliance with their good faith business judgment of the best inter ests of the corporation. As a result, counterclaims alleging breaches of fiduciary duty must fail. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 869 F. Supp. 419, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17832 (W.D. Va. 1994). Summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants because plaintiffs failed to show that defendants breached their fiduciary duty as directors of the company be cause at the time defendants agreed to purchase plaintiffs company, defendants company was solvent and as such defendants decision did not involve fraud, bad faith or unconscionable conduct; therefore, defendants were entitled to Virginia s business judgment rule, § 13.1-690. Poth v. Russey, 281 F. Supp. 2d 814, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15813 (E.D. Va. 2003), aff'd, 99 Fed. Appx. 446, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 5861 (4th Cir. 2004). Protection only to a cts or omissions as director.  The protection of this section applies only to acts taken as a director, or any failure to take any action, and is confined to the exercise of business ju dgment on behalf of the corporation; when the acts in question do not meet these criteria, this section does not apply. Simmons v. Miller, 261 Va. 561, 544 S.E.2d 666, 2001 Va. LEXIS 48 (2001). Personal liability of director found.  Unless he complies with the applicable standards of conduct described in this section, a director who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of Chapter 9 of Title 13.1 of the Code is personally liable to the corporation and its creditors for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating Chapter 9. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Matyiko, 253 Va. 1, 481 S.E.2d 468, 1997 Va. LEXIS 1 (1997). No protection for organi zation of competitor.  Clearly, the organization of a competitor was not a corporate act of the corporation of which the defendant was a director and, in taking this action, the directo r was not exercising business judgment on behalf of the corporation; although implicating a common-law duty of loyalty, this act did not fall within the scope of this section and the defendant was not entitled to protection under the statutory business j udgment rule. Simmons v. Miller, 261 Va. 561, 544 S.E.2d 666, 2001 Va. LEXIS 48 (2001). Safe harbor ex ception to director liability.  Because section 13.1-692 conditions its imposition of personal liability upon a directors failure to comply with the standards of conduct described in this se ction, a safe harbor is provided to a director who does comply with those standards. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Matyiko, 253 Va. 1, 481 S.E.2d 468, 1997 Va. LEXIS 1 (1997). This section does not abrogate the common law duties of a director but does set the standard by which a director is to discharge those duties; if a director acts in accordance with that standard, the statute provides a safe harbor that shields a director from liability for any action taken as a director and for failure to take action. Willard v. Moneta Bldg. Supply, Inc., 258 Va. 140, 515 S.E.2d 277, 1999 Va. LEX IS 80 (1999).

A conflict of interests transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has an interest that precludes the director from being a disinterested director. A conflict of interests transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the directors interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true: 1. The m aterial facts of the transaction and the directors interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction; 2. The material facts of the transaction and the directors interest were disclosed to the shareholders entitled to vote and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction; or 3. The transaction was fair to the corporation. B. For purpose s of subdivision A 1, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors on the board of directors, or on the committee. A transaction shall not be aut horized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the disinterested directors vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presen ce of, or a vote cast by, a director who is not disinterested does not affect the validity of any action taken under subdivision A 1 if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection. C. For purpose s of subdivision A 2, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the shares entitled to be counted under this subsection. Shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who is not disinterested may not be counted in a vote of shareholders to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interests transaction under subdivision A 2. The vote of those shares, however, shall be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter. A majority of the shares, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action u nder this section. History History. Code 1950, § 13.1-39.1; 1975, c. 500; 1980, c. 341; 1985, c. 5 22; 2005, c. 765. Annotations Cross references. As to trustee standard of conduct, trustee liability and restrictions on liability limitations in governing instruments under the Virginia Business Trust Act, see § 13.1-1229. The 2005 amendments. The 2005 amendment by c. 765 substituted has an interest that precludes the director from being a disinterested director for has a direct or indirect personal interest in the first sentence in subsection A; deleted former subsection B, relating to directors with an indirect personal interest in transactions; and rewrote former subsections C and D and redesignated them as present subsections B and C. CASE NOTES The scope of Virginias director conflict law was narrowed from that previously provi ded under former § 13.1-39.1 when the General Assembly enacted this section. Under this section, transactions in which a director has an interest are not void, only voidable, a marked change from the previous statutory provision which rendered them vo id. Furthermore, a transaction in which a director has a direct or indirect interest is not voidable if certain statutory provisions apply. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 155 F.R.D. 142, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5645 (W.D. Va. 1994). Transaction with corporation required for conflict of interests.  This section defines a conflict of interests transaction as a transaction with the corporation, and there is no such transaction when the plaintiff alleges that t he director caused the corporation to waive its right of first refusal with respect to the purchase of the plaintiffs stock and that the director thereafter purchased the stock as a private individual. Byelick v. Vivadelli, 79 F. Supp. 2d 610, 1999 U .S. Dist. LEXIS 20345 (E.D. Va. 1999). Director conflict claim necessitates no knowledge of substance of advice given.  Irrespective of who carries the initial burden of proof and when during the course of litigation it might shift, the bottom line is that none of the elements of a director conflict claim or defense involves the need for knowing the substance of advice given the director before or during a transaction. WLR Foods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 155 F.R.D. 142, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5645 (W.D. Va. 1994). Dealings of director with corporation closely scrutinized.  The relationship between a director and his corporation is one of trust, and the court must subject the dealings of a director with his corporation to close and r igorous scrutiny. Adams Labs., Inc. v. Garrett, 3 Bankr. 495, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5347 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1980) (decided under prior law). Fairness of transaction.  No inflexible rule can be established by which to test the fairness of a transaction but, generally, a director must act in good faith and the transaction must, a s a whole, be open, fair and honest at the time it was consummated; a transaction in which a director has a conflict of interest should bear the earmarks of an arms length bargain in order to be deemed fair to the corporation. Willard v. Moneta Bldg. Supply, Inc., 258 Va. 140, 515 S.E.2d 277, 1999 Va. LEXIS 80 (1999). If the court determines that a transaction was fair to the corporation, it need not address whether the directors in fact had a conflict of interests. Willard v. Moneta Bldg. Supply, Inc., 258 Va. 140, 515 S.E.2d 277, 1999 Va. LEXIS 80 (1999). Director may not acquire personal advantage or profit in breach of duty to corporation.  A director of a private corporation cannot directly or indirectly, in any transaction in which he is under a duty to guard the interest of the corporation, acquir e any personal advantage or make any profit for himself, and if he does so, he may be compelled to account therefor to the corporation. Tanner's Transf. &amp; Storage of Va., Inc. v. Florance, 22 Bankr. 24, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3681 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982) (deci ded under prior law). When a conflict of interest exists, burden of proof shifts to directors.  A party challenging the actions of the board of directors has the burden of proving that the challenged action was not undertaken in accordance with the directors  good faith business judgment of the best interests of the corporation; however, when a conflict of interest as defined in this section exists, the burden shifts to the directors to show that their actions complied with the requirements of that secti on. Izadpanah v. Boeing Joint Venture, 243 Va. 81, 412 S.E.2d 708, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1771, 1992 Va. LEXIS 128 (1992). Shareholder in close corporation may challenge transaction.  Considered in perspective of the fiduciary duties in a closely held corporation, the legislative history of this section and supreme court dicta, a shareholder ca n challenge an interested director transaction in a close corporation under this section. Byelick v. Vivadelli, 79 F. Supp. 2d 610, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20345 (E.D. Va. 1999). Professional advice irrelevant.  In judging the fairness to a corporation of an interested director transaction, the substance of professional advice given to and relied upon by a defendant is im material because such advice is not probative of the nature of the conflict, nor of whether the transaction was fair to the corporation; fairness must be established irrespective of advice sought or given. Byelick v. Vivadelli, 79 F. Supp. 2d 610, 1999 U .S. Dist. LEXIS 20345 (E.D. Va. 1999). No duty existed for former member.  Regarding a former members claims against a limited liability company (LLC), equitable subordination was not warranted, because the LLC did not demonstrate a sufficient factual basis for the court to find inequitable conduct or harm since, inter alia, the court could not conclude that the former member breached the duty to refrain from self-dealing since the court could not find that such duty existed. In re Virginia Broadband, LLC, 521 Bankr. 539, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 4638 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2014), aff'd, 538 Bankr. 253, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122638 (W.D. Va. 2015). Shareholders claim.  Shareholders direct conflict of interest claim against directors was dismissed because the claim could be brought only through a shareholder derivative suit. DCG&amp;T ex rel. Battaglia v. Knight, 68 F. Supp. 3d 579, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174996 (E.D. Va. 2014), dismissed without prejudice, No. 3:14-cv-432, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4476 (E.D. Va. Jan. 14, 2015). Sufficiency of derivative claim.  Shareholders derivative conflict of interest claim against directors survived dismissal because the shareholder met its initial burden of asserting a conflict of interest among the directors and whether defendants could assert a full disclosure defense involved a question of fact that could not be resolved on a motion to dismiss. DCG&amp;T ex rel. Battaglia v. Knight, 68 F. Supp. 3d 579, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174 996 (E.D. Va. 2014), dismissed without prejudice, No. 3:14-cv-432, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4476 (E.D. Va. Jan. 14, 2015). Limitation of remedies.  Where shareholder sought to undo a merger, the limitation of remedies to appraisal rights did not apply if the merger was an interested transaction and the shareh older had plausibly alleged that the merger was an impermissible conflict of interest transaction. DCG&amp;T ex rel. Battaglia v. Knight, 68 F. Supp. 3d 579, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174996 (E.D. Va. 2014), dismissed without prejudice, No. 3:14-cv-432, 2015 U.S . Dist. LEXIS 4476 (E.D. Va.

A director who votes for or assents to a distribution in excess of what may be authorized and made pursuant to this chapter or the articles of incorporation is personally liable to the corporation and its creditors for the amount of the distribution that exceeds wh at could have been distributed without violating this chapter or the articles of incorporation if the party asserting liability establishes that when taking the action the director did not comply with § 13.1-690. B. A director held liable for an unlawful distribution under subsection A is entitled to: 1. Contr ibution from every other director who could be held liable under subsection A for the unlawful distribution; and 2. Recoupment from the shareholders who received the unlawful distribution in proportion to the amounts of such unlawful distribution received by them respectively. C. No suit sha ll be brought against any director for any liability imposed by subsection A except within two years after the right of action shall accrue. D.

The 2005 amendment by c. 765, in subsection A, deleted the beginning which read: Unless he complies with the applicable standards of conduct described in § 13.1 690 and added if the party asserting liability establishes that when taking the action the director did not comply with § 13.1-690 to the end; in subsection B, deleted of this section preceding is entitled to and dele ted contribution following is entitled to; rewrote subdivision B 1; added Recoupment to the beginning of subdivision B 2; substituted subsection A for this section in subsection C; and added subsection D. The 2019 amendments. The 2019 amendment by c. 734, in subsection A, substituted in excess of what may be authorized and made pursuant to for made in violation of. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 4B M.J. Corporations, § 110. CASE NOTES Corporations board of directors liability for a distribution must depend entirely on their premerger actions. Where the uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that the directors intended to transfer ownership of the corporation as a going enterprise and were not seeking to hide a distribution of the firms assets to the shareholders, n o unlawful distribution occurred. Further, to the extent the events associated with the buyout might have been considered a distribution, the defendants were no longer directors at the time it was approved by the board, so they could not be held liable. C-T of Va., Inc. v. Barrett, 124 Bankr. 694, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18483 (W.D. Va. 1990), aff'd, No. 91-1578, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 1029 (4th Cir. Jan. 29, 1992), aff'd, 958 F.2d 606, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 3571 (4th Cir. 1992). Personal liability of director found.  Unless he complies with the applicable standards of conduct described in § 13.1-690, a director who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of Chapter 9 of Title 13.1 of the Code is personally liable to the corporation and its creditors for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating Chapter 9. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Matyiko, 253 Va. 1 , 481 S.E.2d 468, 1997 Va. LEXIS 1 (1997). Because this section conditions its imposition of personal liability upon a directors failure to comply with the standards of conduct described in § 13.1-690, a safe harbor is provided to a director who does comply with those standards. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Matyiko, 253 Va. 1, 481 S.E.2d 468, 1997 Va. LEXIS 1 (1 997). Inapplicable to third party payments.  This section is aimed by its terms at actions taken by a corporation to enrich unjustly its own shareholders at the expense of creditors and to the detriment of t he continuing viability of the company. It does not cover third-party payments to acquire the stock of a corporation or the encumbering of assets after a change in corporate ownership and it is not intended to obstruct an arms-length acquisition of a n enterprise by new owners who have their own plans for commercial success. C-T of Va., Inc. v. Barrett, 958 F.2d 606, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 3571 (4th Cir. 1992). The two-year limitation is not applicable to all acts of directors as such. Anderson v. Bundy, 161 Va. 1, 171 S.E. 501, 1933 Va. LEXIS 296 (1933) (decided under prior law). Shareholders as directors.  The trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs claim against corporation shareholders for unlawful distribution of corporate assets because, although the defe ndant shareholders were not duly elected directors of the dealership, they had assumed and exercised the duties of directors without benefit of formal election; consequently, they were directors for purposes of this section and §§ 13.1-653 and 13.1-690.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Directors and majority shareholders personal liability established.  Where a majority shareholder directed that only a small portion of the proceeds from the sale of corporate property be wired to pay other debts into the corporate account, while instructing the buyer to wire the remaining amounts (more than 90 percent of the total paid at the sale) into his and a directors personal bank accounts, this evidence not only showed that the shareholder was aware of the collection p roceedings against the corporation, but that the acts of procuring a significant personal and pecuniary benefit from the sale of the corporate property were illegal to warrant personal liability to the corporations debtors and an insurer, who had pai d the corporate debt and became subrogated to a federal judgment creditor.

Except wher e shareholder approval of an amendment of the articles of incorporation is not required by this chapter, an amendment of the articles of incorporation shall be adopted in the following manner: 1. The p roposed amendment shall first be adopted by the board of directors. 2. After adopting the proposed amendment the board of directors shall submit the amendment to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall also recommend that the sha reholders approve the amendment, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shar eholders of the basis for that determination; and 3. The shareholders entitled to vote on the amendment shall approve the amendment as provided in subsection D. B. The board o f directors may set conditions for the approval of the amendment by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the amendment. C. If sharehol der approval is to be sought at a shareholders meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the proposed shareholders meeting in accordance with § 13.1-658. The notice shall state that the purpose , or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the amendment and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy of the amendment. D. Unless this chapter, the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors, acting pursuant to subsection B, requires a greater vote, approval of the amendment requires the approval of each voting group entitled to vote on the amendment by more than two-thirds o f all the votes entitled to be cast by that voting group. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this subsection or a vote by separate voting groups so long as the vote provided for is not less th an a majority of all the votes cast on the amendment by each voting group entitled to vote on the amendment at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists. E. If as a res ult of an amendment of the articles of incorporation one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to new interest holder liability, approval of the amendment requires the signing in connection with the amendment, by each such s hareholder, of a separate written consent to become subject to such new interest holder liability, unless in the case of a shareholder that already has interest holder liability the terms and conditions of the new interest holder liability (i) are substa ntially identical to those of the existing interest holder liability or (ii) are substantially identical to those of the existing interest holder liability other than changes that eliminate or reduce such interest holder liability. F. For purpose s of subsection E, new interest holder liability means interest holder liability of a person resulting from an amendment of the articles of incorporation if (i) the person did not have interest holder liability before the amendment becomes effect ive or (ii) the person had interest holder liability before the amendment becomes effective, the terms and conditions of which are changed when the amendment becomes effective. G. When an exc hange, reclassification, or change of shares is effected by amendment of the articles of incorporation, and a material difference in right results, or the corporate name is changed, the action of the board of directors or shareholders authorizing the ame ndment may prescribe a time after which the holders of the old shares shall no longer be entitled to receive distributions or to vote or to exercise any other rights as shareholders until certificates, if any, representing the old shares are surrendered in exchange for certificates representing the new shares. But upon such surrender all distributions not paid because of this provision shall be paid without interest. H. An amendmen t of the articles of incorporation may be further amended prior to the effective date of the certificate of amendment of the articles of incorporation; however, if the shareholders of the corporation are required by any provision of this chapter or the a rticles of incorporation to vote on the amendment of the articles of incorporation, the amendment of the articles of incorporation may not be further amended subsequent to approval of the amendment by such shareholders without the approval of the shareho lders.

CASE NOTES Amendment of voting threshold.  Subsection E of § 13.1-724 explicitly permits a corporation to create a lower voting threshold, but only by amending the articles of incorporation; subject to some exceptions, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act only allows a corporation to amend its articles of incorporation by a vote of more than two-thirds of the shareholders. Thus, if shareholders want to downgrade a supermajority voting threshold to a simp le majority, they must amend the articles of incorporation by that same supermajority. May v. R.A.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Title sanctions power of directors to amend bylaws.  This title gives statutory sanction to developing corporate law by giving the board of directors, in managing the corporation, the power to amend or repeal bylaws in the absence of a reservation of this power to the shareholders in the articles of incorporation. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). But th ere is danger of usurpation of shareholder control.  Inherent in granting power to a board of directors to amend the instrument regulating the intracorporate balance of power is the danger of usurpation of sharehold er control of those matters which may be most vital to their protection. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). The capacity of a board of directors to increase or decrease the number of directors through bylaw amendment is an opportunity to effect usurpation of shareholder control of matters vital to their protection. Scott County Tobacco Whses., Inc. v. Harris, 214 Va. 508, 201 S.E.2d 780, 1974 Va. LEXIS 168 (1974). Dire ctors cannot alter bylaw imposing limitation on them.  Though a bylaw of a corporation authorizes the directors to alter or amend the bylaws, the directors have no authority under said bylaw or otherwise to disregard or alter another bylaw which was intended to impose a limitation on their powers. Stevens v. Davison, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 819, 1868 Va. LEXIS 37 (1868). Section 13.1-677 prevents the directors, by amending the bylaws to decrease the number of directors, from curtailing the term of duly elected directors. In this way, a boards ability to alter its composition between annual meetings is restricted, while the benefits of amending bylaws in absence of a reservation of power to the sharehold ers still obtain.

CASE NOTES Cash-out m erger constitutes a share exchange.  Any cash-out merger which by its terms forces all shareholders to exchange their shares for other corporate securities or for cash effects or constitutes a share exchange. Barris Indus., Inc. v. Bryan, 686 F. Supp. 125, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4406 (E.D. Va. 1988) (decided prior to 2005 amendments). This section contemplates that share exchanges may consist of pure share-for-cash deals, such as those used in cash-out mergers. Thus, in proposing such a forced share exchange, the merger plan triggered the separate class voting requirement of § 13.1-718 F. 2. Barris Indus., Inc. v. Bryan, 686 F. Supp. 125, 1988 U.S. Dist.

The board of directors shall also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the plan or, in the case of an offer referred to in subsection G, that the shareholders tender their shares to the offeror in response to the offer, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination.

When a merg er becomes effective: 1. The d omestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity that is designated in the plan of merger as the survivor continues or comes into existence as the case may be; 2. The separate existence of every domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity that is merged into the survivor ceases; 3. All property owned by, and every contract right possessed by, each domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity that merges into the survivor is vested in the survivor without tr ansfer, reversion or impairment; 4. All debts, obligations, and liabilities of each domestic or foreign corporation or eligible entity that is merged into the survivor are debts, obligations, or liabilities of the surviv or; 5. The name of the survivor may, but need not be, substituted in any pending proceeding for the name of any party to the merger whose separate existence ceased in the merger; 6. If the survivor is a domestic corporation, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the survivor are amended to the extent provided in the plan of merger; 7. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of a survivor that is a domestic corporation created by the merger become effective; 8. The shares of each domestic or foreign corporation that is a party to the merger, and the eligible interests in a domestic or foreign eligible entity that is a party to the merger, tha t are to be converted under the plan of merger into shares, other securities, eligible interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities, or eligible interests, cash, other property or any combination of the foregoing, are converted, and the former holders of such shares or eligible interests are entitled only to the rights provided to them in the plan of merger or to any rights they may have under Article 15 (§ 13.1-729 et seq.) or the organic law governing the foreign corporation o r domestic or foreign eligible entity; 9. Except as provided by law or the plan of merger, all the rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities of each entity that was a party to the merger, other than the survivor, are the rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities of the survivor; and 10. If the survivor existed before the merger: a. All the property and contract rights of the survivor remain its property and contract rights without transfer, reversion, or impairment; b. The survivor remains subject to all its debts, obligations, and other liabilities; and c. Except as provided by law or the plan of merger, the survivor continues to hold all of its rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities. B. When a shar e exchange becomes effective, the shares or eligible interests in the acquired entity that are to be exchanged for shares and other securities, eligible interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares, other securities, eligible interests, cash, other p roperty, or any combination of the foregoing, are entitled only to the rights provided to them in the plan of share exchange or to any rights they may have under Article 15 (§ 13.1-729 et seq.) or under the organic law governing the acquired entity. C. Except as o therwise provided in the articles of incorporation of a domestic corporation or the organic law governing or organic rules of a foreign corporation or a domestic or foreign eligible entity, the effect of a merger or share exchange on interest holder liab ility is as follows: 1. A per son who becomes subject to a new interest holder liability in respect of an entity as a result of a merger or share exchange shall have that new interest holder liability only in respect of interest holder liabilities that arise after the merger or share exchange becomes effective. 2. If a person had interest holder liability with respect to a party to the merger or the acquired entity before the merger or share exchange becomes effective with respect to shares or e ligible interests of such party or acquired entity that were (i) exchanged in the merger or share exchange, (ii) were canceled in the merger, or (iii) the terms and conditions of which relating to interest holder liability were amended pursuant to the me rger: a. The merger or share exchange does not discharge that prior interest holder liability with respect to any interest holder liabilities that arose before the merger or share exchange becomes effective. b. The provisions of the organic law governing any entity for which the person had that prior interest holder liability shall continue to apply to the collection or discharge of any interest holder liabilities preserved by subdivision C 2 a, as if the merger or share exchange had not occurred. c. The person shall have such rights of contribution from other persons as are provided by the organic law governing the entity for which the person had that prior interest holder li ability with respect to any interest holder liabilities preserved by subdivision C 2 a, as if the merger or share exchange had not occurred. d. The person shall not, by reason of such prior interest holder liability, have interest holder liability with respect to any interest holder liabilities that arise after the merger or share exchange becomes effective. 3. If a person has interest holder liability both before and after a merger becomes effective with unchanged terms and conditions with respect to the entity that is the survivor by reason of owning the same shares or eligible interests before and after the merger becomes effective, the merger has no effect on such interest holder liability. 4. A share exchange has no effect on interest holder liability related to shares or eligible interests of the acquired entity that were not exchanged in the share exchange. D. Upon a merg er becoming effective, a foreign corporation or a foreign eligible entity that is the survivor of the merger is deemed to: 1. Appoi nt the clerk of the Commission as its agent for service of process in any proceeding (i) to enforce the rights of shareholders of each domestic corporation that was a party to the merger who exercise appraisal rights or (ii) based on a cause of action ag ainst a nonsurviving domestic corporation arising during the time it was in existence under the laws of the Commonwealth, which service of process shall be made on the clerk in accordance with § 12.1-19.1; and 2. Agree that it will promptly pay the amount, if any, to which such shareholders are entitled under Article 15 (§ 13.1-729 et seq.). E. No corporat ion that is required by law to be a domestic corporation, may, by merger, cease to be a domestic corporation, but every such corporation, even though a corporation of some other state, the United States or another country, shall also be a domestic corpor ation of the Commonwealth. F. Except as p rovided in the organic law governing a party to a merger or in its articles of incorporation or organic rules, the merger does not give rise to any rights that a third party would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of that party. The mer ger does not require a party to the merger to wind up the affairs of that party and does not constitute or cause its dissolution, termination, or cancellation. G. A bequest, devise, gift, grant, or promise contained in a will or other instrument of donation, subscription, or conveyance that is made to an entity that is a party to a merger that is not the survivor and that takes effect or remains payable after the merger inur es to the survivor. H. A trust obl igation that would govern property if transferred to a nonsurviving entity applies to property that is transferred to the survivor after a merger becomes effective. History History.

Text In the case of a domestication of a domestic corporation into a foreign jurisdiction, the plan of domestication shall be adopted in the following manner: 1. The p lan of domestication shall first be adopted by the board of directors. 2. After adopting the plan of domestication the board of directors shall submit the plan to the shareholders for their approval.In submitting the plan of domestication to the shareholders for approval, the board of directors shall recommend that the shareholders approve the plan, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendatio n, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination. 3. The board of directors may set conditions for approval of the plan of domestication by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the plan of domestication. 4. If the approval of the shareholders is to be sought at a shareholders meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, regardless of whether entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan of domestication is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan of domestication and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or sum mary of the plan. The notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy of the articles of incorporation and the bylaws as they will be in effect immediately after the domestication. 5. Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors, acting pursuant to subdivision 3, require a greater vote, approval of the plan of domestication requires (i) the approva l of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum exists consisting of more than two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan and (ii) except as provided in subdivision 6, the approval of each class or series of shares voting as a separate voting group at the meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists consisting of more than two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan by that voting group. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than tha t provided for in this section so long as the vote provided for is not less than a majority of all votes cast on the plan by each voting group entitled to vote on the plan at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists. 6. The articles of incorporation may expressly limit or eliminate the separate voting rights provided in clause (ii) of subdivision 5 as to any class or series of shares, except when the articles of incorporation of the foreign corporation resulting from the domestication include what would be in effect an amendment that would entitle the class or series to vote as a separate group under § 13.1-708 if it were a proposed amendment of t he articles of incorporation of the domestic domesticating corporation. 7.

A sale, lea se, exchange or other disposition of the corporations assets, other than a disposition described in § 13.1-723, requires approval of the corporations shareholders if the disposition would leave the corporation without a significant continuing business activity. The corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant continuing business activity if it retains a business activity that represented, for the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, (i) at least 20 percent of total assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, and (ii) at least 20 percent of either (a) income from continuing operations before taxes or (b) revenues from continuing operations, in each case for the most recently com pleted fiscal year. B. A dispositi on that requires approval of the shareholders under subsection A shall be initiated by adoption of a resolution by the board of directors authorizing the disposition. After adoption of such a resolution, the board of directors shall submit the proposed d isposition to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall also submit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the proposed disposition, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of c onflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall inform the shareholders of the basis for that determination. C. The board o f directors may set conditions for the approval of a disposition by the shareholders or the effectiveness of the disposition. D. If a dispos ition is required to be approved by the shareholders and if the approval is to be sought at a shareholders meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the shareholders meeting at which the dispositi on is to be submitted for approval in accordance with § 13.1-658. The notice shall also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the disposition and shall contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the agree ment pursuant to which the disposition will be effected. If only a summary of the agreement is sent to shareholders, the corporation also shall send a copy of the agreement to any shareholder who requests it. E. Unless the articles of incorporation or board of directors, acting pursuant to subsection C, requires a greater vote or a greater quorum, the approval of a disposition by the shareholders shall require at a meeting at which a quorum exists the approval of the holde rs of more than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the disposition. The articles of incorporation may provide for a greater or lesser vote than that provided for in this subsection or a vote by separate voting groups so long as the vote p rovided for is not less than a majority of all the votes cast on the disposition by each voting group entitled to vote on the disposition at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists. F. Unless the parties to the disposition have agreed otherwise, after a disposition has been approved by the shareholders, and at any time before the disposition has been consummated, it may be abandoned without action by the shareholders, subject to any contractual r ights of the parties to the disposition. G. A dispositi on of assets in the course of dissolution under Article 16 (§ 13.1-742 et seq.) is not governed by this section. H. The assets of a direct or indirect consolidated subsidiary shall be deemed to be the assets of the parent corporation for the purposes of this section. I. Notwithstan ding any other provision of this section, no corporation organized to conduct the business of a railroad or other public service or a banking business, or a savings institution, an industrial loan association or a credit union may sell, lease or exchange its properties for the conduct of such business in the Commonwealth except to a corporation of the Commonwealth organized for the same purpose or in the case of a bank to a savings and loan association or a corporation of the United States, and in the c ase of a savings and loan association to a bank or a corporation of the United States.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Supermajority voting threshold of subsection E of § 13.1-724 applies to any disposition that leaves a corporation without a significant continuing business act ivity; the apparent purpose of the statute is to protect minority shareholders. May v. R.A. Yancey Lumber Corp., 297 Va. 1, 822 S.E.2d 358, 2019 Va. LEXIS 1 (2019). Subsection E of § 13.1-724 explicitly permits a corporation to create a lower voting threshold, but only by amending the articles of incorporation; subject to some exceptions, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act only allows a corporation to amend its articles of incorporation by a vote of more than two-thirds of the shareholders. Thus, if shareholders want to downgrade a supermajority voting threshold to a simp le majority, they must amend the articles of incorporation by that same supermajority. May v. R.A.

Text As used in this article: Acquiring person, with respect to any public corporation, means any person who has mad e or proposes to make a control share acquisition of shares of such public corporation. Beneficial ownership means the sole or shared power to dispose or direct the dispositi on of shares, or the sole or shared power to vote or direct the voting of shares, or the sole or shared power to acquire shares, including any such power that is not immediately exercisable, whether such power is direct or indirect or through any contrac t, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise. A person shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such person until the tendered shares are accepted for purchase or exchange. A person shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares as to which such person may exercise voting power solely by virtue of a revocable proxy conferring the right to vote. A member of a national securities exchange shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of shares held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of another person solely because such member is the record holder of such securities and, pursuant to the rules of such exchange, may direct the vote of such shares, without instructi ons, on other than contested matters or matters that may affect substantially the rights or privileges of the holders of the shares to be voted but is otherwise precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without instructions. Control share acquisition means the direct or indirect acquisition, other than in an e xcepted acquisition, by any person of beneficial ownership of shares of a public corporation that, except for this article, would have voting rights and would, when added to all other shares of such public corporation which then have voting rights and ar e beneficially owned by such person, would cause such person to become entitled, immediately upon acquisition of such shares, to vote or direct the vote of, shares having voting power within any of the following ranges of the votes entitled to be cast in an election of directors: (i) one-fifth or more but less than one-third of such votes; (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority of such votes; or (iii) a majority or more of such votes. If voting rights are granted pursuant to this article in res pect of any such range to shares so acquired by any person, any acquisition by such person of additional shares shall not, for purposes of the preceding sentence, constitute a control share acquisition unless, as a result of such acquisition, the voting power of the shares beneficially owned by such person would be in excess of such range in respect of which voting rights had previously been granted. If this article applies to acquisitions of shares of a public corporation at the time of a control share acquisition of any shares of such corporation, then shares acquired by the same person within 90 days before or after such control share acquisition and shares acquired by the same person pursuant to a plan to make a control share acquisition are deemed to have been acquired in the same control share acquisition for the purposes of this article, regardless of the applicability of this article at the time of any other acquisitions of shares during such periods or pursuant to such a plan. Excepted acquisition means the acquisition of shares of a public corporation in any of the following circumstances: 1. Befor e January 26, 1988; 2. Pursuant to a binding contract in effect before January 26, 1988; 3. Pursuant to the laws of wills and decedents estates; 4. Pursuant to the satisfaction of a pledge or other security interest created in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this article; 5. Pursuant to a plan of merger or share exchange effected in compliance with Article 12 (§ 13.1-715.1 et seq.) if the public corporation is a party to the plan of merger or plan of sh are exchange; 6. Pursuant to a tender or exchange offer that is made pursuant to an agreement to which the public corporation is a party; 7. Directly from the public corporation, or from any of its wholly owned subsidiaries, or from any corporation having beneficial ownership of shares of the public corporation having at le ast a majority, before such transaction, of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors of such public corporation; or 8. In good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this chapter by or from any person (a transferor) whose voting rights had previously been authorized by shareholders in c ompliance with this article, or whose previous acquisition of beneficial ownership of shares would have constituted a control share acquisition but for any of subdivisions 1 through 7 in this definition; however, any acquisition described in this subdivi sion 8 shall constitute a control share acquisition if as a result thereof any person acquires beneficial ownership of shares of such issuing public corporation having voting power in the election of directors in excess of the range of votes within which the transferor was authorized by this article to exercise voting power immediately before such acquisition. Interested shares means the shares of a public corporation the voting of which in an e lection of directors may be exercised or directed by any of the following persons: (i) an acquiring person with respect to a control share acquisition; (ii) any officer of such public corporation; or (iii) any employee of such public corporation who is a lso a director of the corporation. Person includes an associate of any person. For this purpose, associate shall mean (i) any other person who directly or indirectly controls, or is controlled by or under common control with, any such person or who is acting or intends to act jointly or in concert with any such person in connection with the acquisition of or exerci se of beneficial ownership over shares; (ii) any corporation or organization of which any such person is an officer, director, manager or partner or as to which any such person performs a similar function; (iii) any other person having direct or indirect beneficial ownership of 10 percent or more of any class of equity securities of any such person; (iv) any trust or estate in which any such person has a beneficial interest or as to which any such person serves as trustee or in a similar fiduciary capac ity; and (v) any relative or spouse of any such person, or any relative of such spouse, any one of whom has the same residence as any such person. For this purpose, control shall mean the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or to cause the direction of the management or policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, arrangement or understanding, or otherwise. The votes e ntitled to be cast by any share shall, if any voting group is entitled to vote for less than the total number of directors to be elected at any election, be determined by multiplying the number of votes entitled to be cast by the holder of such share by the number of directors for whom such holder is entitled to vote; however, beneficial ownership of a majority of the shares comprising any such voting group shall be deemed to entitle such beneficial owner to cast all the votes of the shares in such voti ng group.

CASE NOTES Forum selection provision constitutes contractual forum selection clause.  Forum selection provision contained in § 13.1-740 is incorporated into the contract between Virginia corporations and their shareholders, and hence constitutes a contractual forum selection clause. In other words, when an individual purchases a share of stock in a Virginia corporation, the individual, in effect, enters into a contract with the corporation, and this contract incorporates the general corporation law of Virginia; thus, when an individual purchases stock in a Virginia corporation the individual has constructive notice that the individual is bound by the terms of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, § 13.1-601 et seq., and in making the purchase , the individual agrees to all of the statutory provisions, including the forum selection provision contained in § 13.1-740. Middleburg Training Ctr., Inc. v. Firestone, 477 F. Supp. 2d 719, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16086 (E.D. Va. 2007). Shareholder appraisal action had to be litigated in a state court because: (1) the forum selection provision in § 13.1-740 was part of the contractual arrangem ent between a corporation and its shareholders; (2) when the shareholder purchased a share of the corporation, the shareholder entered into an agreement with the corporation that incorporated the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, § 13.1-601 et seq., inc luding the forum selection provision applicable to shareholder appraisal remedies; and (3) the forum selection provision was not unreasonable. Middleburg Training Ctr., Inc. v. Firestone, 477 F. Supp. 2d 719, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16086 (E.D. Va. 2007). State court has exclusive jurisdiction over appraisal remedy.  This section precluded a former shareholder of a corporation from seeking a declaratory judgment as to her appraisal rights because the remedy sought, namely the valuation of shares, was the same remedy that the shareholder sought in a state court appraisal proceeding and the state court had exclusive jurisdiction over the shareholders appraisal remedy.

The court i n an appraisal proceeding commenced under § 13.1-740 shall determine all court costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess court costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts that the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article. B. The court i n an appraisal proceeding may also assess the expenses of the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable: 1. Again st the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of § 13.1-732, 13.1-734, 13.1-737 or 13.1-738; or 2. Against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the expenses are assessed acted arbitra rily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article. C. If the cour t in an appraisal proceeding finds that the expenses incurred by any shareholder were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly situated, and that such expenses should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may direct that such e xpenses be paid out of the amounts awarded the shareholders who were benefited. D. To the exte nt the corporation fails to make a required payment pursuant to § 13.1-737, 13.1-738 or 13.1-739, the shareholder may sue directly for the amount owed and, to the extent successful, shall be entitled to recover from the corporation all expenses of the suit.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. No discretion in Commission.  Upon the filing of a certificate of unanimous consent of stockholders to the dissolution of a corporation, with the State Corporation Commission, the sole questio n before that body was whether the company had complied with the law entitling it to a certificate of dissolution. If it had, it was the duty of the Commission to issue the certificate, and no court (except on appeal) could enter any order that would interfere with the Commission in the performance of its official duties (Va. Const., former § 156). And the appointment of a receiver for the corporation between the filing of the certificate of consent and its final amendment as to signature and execution, is no reason for refusing a certificate of dissolution, if otherwise it should have been granted. Jeffries v. Commonwealth, 121 Va. 425, 93 S.E. 701, 1917 Va. LEXIS 48 (1917). Former dissolution provisions considered in appeal from Tax Court.  See Shull v. Commissioner, 291 F.2d 680, 1961 U.S. App. LEXIS 4224 (4th Cir. 1961). Public has no vested right in operation of public service corporation.  Charters of incorporation are contracts between the incorporators and the State. The public has an interest in public service corporations, but it does not own th em. Private property invested in a railroad enterprise becomes impressed with a public service, but still remains the property of the stockholders and cannot be confiscated. The public has never yet been held to have a vested right in the perpetual opera tion of a railroad or other public service corporation. Jeffries v. Commonwealth, 121 Va. 425, 93 S.E. 701, 1917 Va. LEXIS 48 (1917). And a public service corporation has the same right of voluntary dissolution which is accorded to all other business corporations. Such corporations, so far as the general public is concerned, may always suspend their corporate functions in part or in whole, temporarily or finally, with the consent of the state. Jeffries v. Commonwealth , 121 Va. 425, 93 S.E. 701, 1917 Va. LEXIS 48 (1917). Section 56-9, relating to the sale under a deed of trust of the franchises and property of a corporation, § 56-12, relating to such a sale under the decree of a court, and former § 13-67, relating to proceedings by quo warranto in the event of nonuser or misuser by a corporation organized for works of internal improvement, in no way denied the right of a public service corporation to voluntarily dissolve.

CASE NOTES Successor corporation properly demanded reconveyance of property conveyed by predecessor.  Possibility of reverter acquired by a predecessor corporation when it conveyed property to the Commonwealth of Virginia for road use under a former version of § 33.1-90 in 1973 was a corporate asset when the predecessor was later dissolved; as trustee of the assets of the dissolved predecessor, its president, who became the president of a successor corporation, was the proper party to make demand on the Vir ginia Transportation Commissioner for reconveyance of the property, and the successors subsequent declaratory judgment action was properly filed in the successors name pursuant to § 13.1-745. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Windsor Indus., 272 Va. 64, 630 S.E.2d 514, 2006 Va. LEXIS 69 (2006). Ownership of service mark.  If an asset purchase agreement granted a current owner of a restaurant only a non-exclusive license to use the restaurants name, upon the dissolution of the c orporation that had owned and operated the restaurant, the ownership of a service mark in the restaurants name, absent contrary direction in the articles of dissolution, reverted by operation of law to a restaurant founder who had formed the corporat ion.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Officers action not consistent with winding up.  There is no evidence that a swimming pool was being installed at a youth community center in order to help dispose of the community center to an outside creditor or to distribute the property among the shareholders. Therefore, under §§ 13.1-745 and 13.1-752, the officers of the youth center could not, while acting as trustees in liquidation, have actual or apparent authority to grant a deed of trust to the bank for such a purpose once the youth centers corporate existence had ceased to exist for failure to pay registration fees.

The circuit court in any city or county described in subsection C may dissolve a corporation: 1. In a proceeding by a shareholder of a corporation that is not a public corporation if it is established that: a. The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock, and irreparable injury to the corporation is threatened or being suffered, or the business and affairs of the corporation can no l onger be conducted to the advantage of the shareholders generally, because of the deadlock; b. The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent; c. The shareholders are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose t erms have expired; or d.

The creditors claim has been reduced to judgment, the execution on the judgment returned unsatisfied, and the corporation is insolvent; or b. The corporation has admitted in writing that the creditors claim is due and owing and the corporation is insolvent; 3. In a proceeding by the corporation to have its voluntary dissolution continued under court supervision; 4.

Upon application by the board of directors when it is established that circumstances make it impossible to obtain a representative vote by shareholders on the question of dissolution a nd that the continuation of the business of the corporation is not in the interest of the shareholders but it is in their interest that the assets and business be liquidated; or 6. When the Commission has instituted a proceeding for the involuntary termination of corporate existence and entered an order finding that the corporate existence of the corporation shou ld be terminated but that liquidation of its business and affairs should precede the entry of an order of termination of corporate existence. B. The circuit court in the city or county named in subsection C shall have full power to liquidate the assets and business of the corporation at any time after the termination of corporate existence, pursuant to the provisions of this article upon the application of any person, for good cause, with regard to any assets or business that may remain. The jurisdiction conferred by this clause may also be exercised by any such court in any city or county where any property may be situated whether of a domestic or a forei gn corporation that ceased to exist. C. Venue for a proceeding brought under this section lies in the city or county where the corporations principal office is or was located, or, if none in the Commonwealth, where its registered office is or was last located. D. It is not n ecessary to make directors or shareholders parties to a proceeding to be brought under this section unless relief is sought against them individually. E.

This statute is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed. Baylor v. Beverly B ook Co., 216 Va. 22, 216 S.E.2d 18, 1975 Va. LEXIS 243 (1975). This section provides an additional remedy for protection of rights of stockholders, par ticularly minority stockholders. This remedy is in addition to the rights theretofore afforded stockholders under both the state law and the corporations charter and bylaws. Baylor v. Beverly Book Co., 216 Va. 22, 216 S.E.2d 18, 1975 Va. LEXIS 243 (1 975). This section supersedes a stockholders common-law right of action against directors for oppression, and limits a plaintiffs remedies to those available under the statute, namely dissolution or the appointment of a custodian. Jordon v. Bowman Apple Prods. Co., 728 F. Supp. 409, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 213 (W.D. Va. 1990). The word oppressive does not necessarily savor of fraud, and the absence of  mismanagement, or misapplication of assets, does not prevent a finding that the conduct of the dominant directors or officers has been oppressive. White v. Perkins, 213 Va. 129, 189 S.E.2d 315, 1972 Va. LEXIS 318 (1972). Oppressive is not synonymous with illegal and fraudulent. White v. Perkins, 213 Va. 129, 189 S.E.2d 315, 1972 Va. LEXIS 318 (1972). The word oppressive, as used in this section does not carry an essential inference of imminent disaster; it can contemplate a continuing course of conduct . White v. Perkins, 213 Va. 129, 189 S.E.2d 315, 1972 Va. LEXIS 318 (1972). As used in this section, oppressive means conduct by corporate managers toward stockholders which departs from the standards of fair dealing and violates the principles of fair play on which persons who entrust their funds to a corporation are entitled to rely. The term does not mean that a corporate disaster may be imminent and does not necessarily mean fraudulent conduct. Indeed, oppressive is not synonymous with the statutory terms illegal or fraudulent. The term can contemplate a continuous course of conduct and includes a lack of probity in corporate affairs to the prejudice of some of its shareholders. Giannotti v. Hamway , 239 Va. 14, 387 S.E.2d 725, 6 Va. Law Rep. 942, 1990 Va. LEXIS 3 (1990) (decided under former § 13.1-94). Weight of chancellors finding of oppressive conduct.  A finding of fact by the chancellor, hearing evidence ore tenus that conduct was oppressive under this section carries the weight of a jury verdict, and cannot be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. White v. Perkins, 213 Va. 129, 189 S.E.2d 315, 1972 Va. LEXIS 318 (1972). Procedure upon finding oppression.  It is clear from this section that the court, upon finding oppression, could have decreed dissolution. It is also clear that it could have appointed a custodian w ith power to continue the business, including the payment of dividends, if the chancellor was convinced from the evidence that this action was in the best interest of the stockholders. White v. Perkins, 213 Va. 129, 189 S.E.2d 315, 1972 Va. LEXIS 318 (19 72). Upon a finding of oppression under this section, it was error for the trial court to decree: that the corporation should declare a dividend; that the majority sto ckholders claims against the company should be disallowed; that the amount owing to the company by a business controlled by the majority stockholder should be kept reasonably current in the future; and that the minority stockholder, whose employment with the company had been terminated, should be paid severance pay. White v. Perkins, 213 Va. 129, 189 S.E.2d 315, 1972 Va. LEXIS 318 (1972). Power of courts of equity.  The General Assembly has cloaked courts of equity with, in the words of the statute, full power to liquidate in a proper case where oppressive conduct has been established. The remedy specified by the legislature, while discretionary, is exclusive, and does not permit the trial court to fashion other, apparently equitable remedies. Giannotti v. Hamway, 239 Va. 14, 387 S.E.2d 725, 6 Va. Law Rep. 942, 1990 Va. LEXIS 3 (1990) (decided under former § 13.1-94). Intervention of court not justified.  In action by majority stockholder to dissolve corporation because the principal purpose for which corporation was formed was alleged to have failed, it was held t hat the circumstances revealed by the evidence did not justify the intervention of a court of equity in the internal affairs of the corporation and a substitution of its judgment for the judgment of the board of directors.

Unless an e lection to purchase has been filed under § 13.1-749.1, a court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation may appoint one or more receivers to wind up and liquidate, or one or more custodians to manage while the proceeding is pending, the business and affairs of the corporation. The court shall hold a hearing, after notifying all parties to the proceeding and any interested persons designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or custodian. The court appointing a receiver or c ustodian has exclusive jurisdiction over the corporation and all its property wherever located. B. The court m ay appoint as a receiver or custodian an individual, a domestic corporation or eligible entity, or a foreign corporation or eligible entity authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs. C. The court s hall describe the powers and duties of the receiver or custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended from time to time. Among other powers: 1. The r eceiver (i) may dispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale; and (ii) may sue and defend in the receivers own name as receiver of the corporation in all courts of the Commonwealth; and 2. The custodian may exercise all of the powers of the corporation, through or in place of its board of directors or officers, to the extent necessary to manage the affairs of the corpora tion in the best interest of its shareholders and creditors. D. The court d uring a receivership may redesignate the receiver a custodian, and during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a receiver. E. The court f rom time to time during the receivership or custodianship may order compensation paid and expenses paid or reimbursed to the receiver or custodian from the assets of the corporation or proceeds from the sale of the assets.

For related discussion, see 4B M.J. Corporations, § 264. § 13.1-749.1. Election to purchase in lieu of dissolution. Text A. Unless othe rwise provided in the articles of incorporation, in a proceeding under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 to dissolve a corporation, the corporation may elect or, if it fails to elect, one or more shareholders may elect to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the shares. An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election. B. An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within 90 days after the filing of the petition under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purcha se is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within 10 days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice shall state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and n umber of shares owned by each electing shareholder and shall advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate shall file notice of their intention to joi n in the purchase no later than 30 days after the effectiveness of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of outstanding shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of the petitioners shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable t o the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale, or other disposition. C. If, within 60 days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioners shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioners shares upon the terms and conditio ns agreed to by the parties. D. If the part ies are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection C, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the proceedings under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 and determine the fair value of the petitioners shares as of the day bef ore the date on which the petition under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances. The determination of fair value shall include consideration of all relevant facts and cir cumstances, including, unless the court determines it would be unjust or inequitable to do so, (i) the petitioners minority status, (ii) the marketability of the petitioners shares, (iii) the relevant terms of any shareholders agreement, and (iv) if the court finds that the value of the corporation has been diminished by the wrongful conduct of controlling shareholders, the petitioners proportionate claim for any compensable corporate injury. In determining the fair value, the court may, in its discretion, select an appraiser to appraise the fair value of the petitioners shares and shall assess the cost of any such appraisal to the parties, to the corporation, or both, as the equities may appear to the court. E. Upon determ ining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating petiti oners shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or cl asses shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under subdivision A 1 b or d of § 13.1-747, it may award expenses to the petitioning shareholder. F. Upon entry of an order under subsection C or E, the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-747 and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, ex cept the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court, which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment. G. The purchas e ordered pursuant to subsection E shall be made within 10 days after the date the order becomes final. H. Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsection C or E, other than an award of expenses pursuant to subsection E, is subject to the provisions of § 13.1-653.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Stay for additional discovery.  Because the only issue to determine was the fair value of a shareholders shares, and because the corporation had provided and would continue to provide inform ation that related to its value, it would be meaningless to vacate an order granting a stay under § 13.1-749.1 to permit the shareholder unrestricted discovery. Hartley v. Marco Invs., Inc., 82 Va. Cir. 294, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 174 (Norfolk Feb. 24, 2 011). Valuation date.  In a case in which defendant and plaintiff were 50% shareholders in a corporation, the court found that the statutory valuation date of August 1, 2019, was both e quitable and appropriate because plaintiffs alleged actions since she filed for dissolution  even if they damaged the corporation  would not make the August 1, 2019, valuation date inequitable, and any alternative valuation date at the curren t stage in the litigation would be unduly burdensome; defendant had not proposed an alternative valuation date; and the April 16, 2020, order directed that plaintiff would be held liable to the corporation for any harm she caused the corporation since Se ptember 2019. Biton v. Kreinis, 105 Va. Cir. 86, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 69 (Norfolk May 1, 2020). Fair value determination.  Court did not err in finding the fair value of the companys equity using the discounted cash method was $532,582 and that plaintiffs shares were valued at $177,530 because application of the marketability discount would be unjust and inequitable as plaintiff established oppressive conduct by defendant and the third shareholder, and plaintiff should not receive less than the fair value of his shares simply where defendant elected to purchase plaintiffs shares in lieu of the corporate dissolution; and because the value of the corporation had not been diminished by the controlling shareholders. Jones v. A Town Smoke House &amp; Catering Inc., 106 Va. Cir. 1 68, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 478 (Waynesboro Oct. 19, 2020).

When a corp oration has distributed all of its assets to its creditors and shareholders and voluntary dissolution proceedings have not been revoked, it shall deliver to the Commission for filing articles of termination of corporate existence. The articles shall set forth: 1. The n ame of the corporation; 2. That all the assets of the corporation have been distributed to its creditors and shareholders; and 3. That the dissolution of the corporation has not been revoked. B. With the ar ticles of termination of corporate existence, the corporation shall file a statement certifying that the corporation has filed returns and has paid all state taxes to the time of the statement. In contemplation of submitting the required statement, the c orporation may file returns and pay taxes before such returns and taxes would otherwise be due. C. If the Comm ission finds that the articles of termination of corporate existence comply with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall by order issue a certificate of termination of corporate existence. When the certificate is effec tive, the existence of the corporation shall cease, except for the purpose of suits, other proceedings and appropriate corporate action by shareholders, directors and officers as provided in this chapter. D. The stateme nt that all the assets of the corporation have been distributed to its creditors and shareholders means that the corporation has divested itself of all its assets by the payment of claims or liquidating dividends or by assignment to a trustee or trustees for the benefit of claimants or shareholders. If any shareholder, certificate holder, member, bondholder, or other security holder, or a participating patron of a cooperative who is entitled to a share in the distribution of the assets cannot be found, the corporation may thereupon, and without awaiting the one year mentioned in § 55.1-2513, pay such persons share to the State Treasurer as abandoned property on complying with all applicable requirements of § 55.1-2524 except subdivisi on B 4.

CASE NOTES Effect of termination of corporate existence.  A corporate dissolution (now termination of corporate existence), by operation of law, under this unique Virginia statute, has the legal effect of causing a de jure dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) of the corporation as opposed to a de facto dissolution (now termination of corporate existence), because the statute declares a corporation thus delinquent shall ipso facto cease to exist. Moore v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17157 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law). Under this section, an automatic dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) works a forfeiture of the corporate charter by operation of law, thereby stripping the corporations legal mandate to exist. Moore v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17157 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided unde r prior law). If a Virginia corporation fails to pay its annual registration fee by September 1, the corporation is automatically terminated. An automatic dissolution under thi s section works a forfeiture of the corporate charter by operation of law, thereby stripping the corporations legal mandate to exist. A dissolved domestic corporation is no corporation at all. Hudgins v. IRS, 132 Bankr. 115, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102 02 (E.D. Va. 1991), aff'd, 967 F.2d 973, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 14136 (4th Cir. 1992). Upon dissolution directors become trustees of corporate assets.  Upon dissolution, the directors no longer function as directors of a corporation. This section provides that they become trustees in dissolution. The assets of th e corporation automatically pass to them in their new capacity. This is the res of the trust they must administer. Flip Mtg. Corp. v. McElhone, 841 F.2d 531, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 2831 (4th Cir. 1988). Under the Virginia Code, when a corporation is terminated for failure to pay its annual registration fees, the assets of the corporation pass to the directors as trustees in liquidation. The trustees are charged with disposing of the corporate assets, discharging the corporations debts, and distributing the remainder of the assets to the shareholders. The debts referred to by this section are the pre-existing debts of the corporation. Hudgins v. IRS, 132 Bankr. 115, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10202 (E.D. Va. 1991), aff'd, 967 F.2d 973, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 14136 (4th Cir. 1992). Directors liability.  People dealing with a corporation are obliged to look to the corporation for satisfaction of their claims; only in extraordinary circumstances are directors liabl e for corporate debts and this section and § 13.1-754 must be construed in a manner consistent with the strong public policy of shielding directors from individual liability for corporate debt and these sections do not impose any liability for corpora te debt on the directors simply because the corporation has been automatically dissolved. Even after dissolution, the directors are shielded from individual liability if they discharge the duties the statute places on them to marshal assets, pay pre-exis ting debts, and distribute the remaining funds, if any, to the shareholders. Moreover, the directors may temporarily continue the corporate business as an incident to its liquidation without incurring individual liability. The directors difficulty ar ises when they violate the law and carry on the business instead of liquidating it. They then become personally liable. Flip Mtg. Corp. v. McElhone, 841 F.2d 531, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 2831 (4th Cir. 1988). Liability of directors and officers for actions taken after termination of corporate existence.  Upon a corporations dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) by operation of law under this section, there is no corporation at all, and any actio ns performed by the directors or officers not looking to the dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) of the corporation should be deemed individual actions with concomitant individual liability therefor. Moore v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17157 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law). Any actions performed by the directors or officers after dissolution, if not related to the process of winding up the corporations affairs, should be deemed i ndividual actions, with concomitant individual liability therefor. If an entity is no corporation at all, the individuals who conduct its affairs must be personally liable for their acts. Hudgins v. IRS, 132 Bankr. 115, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10202 (E.D. Va. 1991), aff'd, 967 F.2d 973, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 14136 (4th Cir. 1992). This section, the Virginia corporate dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) statute, by its terms requires a finding of personal responsibility on t he part of the corporate directors for any liability created by any normal continuance of the corporate business after dissolution (now termination of corporate existence). Moore v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17157 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law).

Upon termination, the properties and affairs of the corporation shall pass automatically to its directors as trustees in liquidation. The tru stees then shall proceed to collect the assets of the corporation; sell, convey and dispose of such of its properties as are not to be distributed in kind to its shareholders; pay, satisfy and discharge its liabilities and obligations; and do all other a cts required to liquidate its business and affairs.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. How forfei ture of corporate franchise can be effected.  The forfeiture of corporate franchises can be effected only by the State or private persons under statutory authority. Elliott's Knob Iron, Steel &amp; Coal Co. v. SC C, 123 Va. 63, 96 S.E. 353, 1918 Va. LEXIS 6 (1918). Cannot be done collaterally.  A cause of forfeiture of the charter of a corporation, however great, cannot be taken advantage of collaterally or incidentally or in any other mode than by a dir ect proceeding for that purpose on behalf of the government. Pixley v. Roanoke Nav. Co., 75 Va. 320, 1881 Va. LEXIS 16 (1881); Dismal Swamp R.R. v. John L. Roper Lumber Co., 114 Va. 537, 77 S.E. 598, 1913 Va. LEXIS 115 (1913) (see Colonial Inv. Co. v. Ch errydale Cement Block Co., 194 Va. 454, 73 S.E.2d 419 (1952)). Applicable to any corporation whose activities are outside its charter.  This section is simply the statutory mechanism by which the Attorney General initiates Commission revocation of the charter of any corporation which has abused th e Commonwealths permission to use the corporate form of doing business for purposes set forth in that charter. The provision applies with equal force to any corporation whose activities are outside the permissible ambit of its charter. Croatan Books, Inc. v. Virginia, 574 F. Supp. 880, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11993 (E.D. Va. 1983), dismissed, 583 F. Supp. 857, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18236 (E.D. Va. 1984). Distribution of obscene materials.  Obscene material enjoys no protection under U.S. Const., Amend. I. Therefore, in no way could a corporation claim that the Commonwealth authorized it to purvey ob scene materials by allowing it to distribute novelties, magazines, books and newspapers.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Transfer of stock after termination.  Decedent had the right to transfer 100 shares of stock to his son even though the corporations existence had been terminated where, under subsection A of § 13.1-753, it appeared that the decedent had an expectation of future distribution, and there was no evidence that the corporations articles of incorporation, bylaws, or agreement restricted the transfer of shares.

A corporati on that has ceased to exist pursuant to this article may apply to the Commission for reinstatement within five years thereafter unless the corporate existence was terminated by order of the Commission (i) upon a finding that the corporation has continued to exceed or abuse the authority conferred upon it by law or (ii) entered pursuant to § 13.1-749 and the circuit courts decree directing dissolution contains no provision for reinstatement of corporate existence. B. To have its corporate existence reinstated, the corporation shall provide the Commission with the following: 1. An ap plication for reinstatement, which shall include the identification number issued by the Commission to the corporation, and which may be in the form of a letter signed by an officer or director of the corporation, or which may be by affidavit signed by a n agent of any shareholders interests stating that after diligent search by such agent, no officer or director can be found; 2. A reinstatement fee of $100; 3. All annual registration fees and penalties that were due before the corporation ceased to exist and that would have been assessed or imposed to the date of reinstatement if the corpora tions existence had not been terminated; 4. An annual report for the calendar year that corresponds to the calendar year of the latest annual registration fee that was assessed or that would have been assessed to the date of rei nstatement; 5. If the name of the corporation does not comply with the provisions of § 13.1-630 at the time of reinstatement, articles of amendment to the articles of incorporation to change the c orporations name to a name that satisfies the provisions of § 13.1-630, with the fee required by this chapter for the filing of articles of amendment; and 6. If the corporations registered agent has filed a statement of resignation and a new registered agent has not been appointed, a statement of change pursuant to § 13.1-635. C. If the corp oration complies with the provisions of this section, the Commission shall enter an order of reinstatement of corporate existence. Upon entry of the order, the corporate existence shall be deemed to have continued from the date of termination as if the t ermination had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the corporation or a director, officer, or other agent after the termination and before the reinstatement is determined as if the termination of the corporations existence had never occurre d.

For related discussion, see 4B M.J. Corporations, § 275. CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  The legislature intended that once a corporation achieves reinstatement, its corporate status relates back to the date of its termination and it is as if the corp oration had never been terminated and debtors action to achieve reinstatement after the filing of the petition for Chapter 11 supports its eligibility for Chapter 11 relief since, in the eyes of the State, it has been a corporation all along. In re W ine Farms, Inc., 94 Bankr. 410, 1988 Bankr. LEXIS 2188 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1988). Directors liability.  People dealing with a corporation are obliged to look to the corporation for satisfaction of their claims and only in extraordinary circumstances are directors li able for corporate debts. Section 13.1-752 and this section must be construed in a manner consistent with the strong public policy of shielding directors from individual liability for corporate debt and these sections do not impose any liability for corp orate debt on the directors simply because the corporation has been automatically dissolved. Even after dissolution, the directors are shielded from individual liability if they discharge the duties the statute places on them to marshal assets, pay pre-e xisting debts, and distribute the remaining funds, if any, to the shareholders. Moreover, the directors may temporarily continue the corporate business as an incident to its liquidation without incurring individual liability. The directors difficulty arises when they violate the law and carry on the business instead of liquidating it. They then become personally liable. Flip Mtg. Corp. v. McElhone, 841 F.2d 531, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 2831 (4th Cir. 1988). Liability of directors for actions taken between termination of corporate existence and reinstatement.  This section, the Virginia reinstatement statute, does not relieve the directors, who have continued the corporate business, of individual liability for actions i n the interim period between dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) and reinstatement. Moore v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17157 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law). In an action for damages by an information technology company and its sole owner against a former partner, his wife, and their new corporation, the trial court di d not err in refusing to strike all of plaintiffs evidence because the information technology companys corporate existence was terminated during the time of the alleged wrong where the companys reinstatement following termination had the retr oactive effect of placing it in a position as if its termination had never occurred. Syed v. Zh Techs., Inc., 280 Va. 58, 694 S.E.2d 625, 2010 Va. LEXIS 73 (2010). Directors, etc., not relieved of liability by reinstatement.  Language of this section, the Virginia reinstatement statute, is quite clear that reinstatement has no effect on any question of personal liability of the directo rs. Moore v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17157 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law). This section makes the revived corporation liable for any liabilities incurred in the interim period, but it declares at the same time, in unmistakable terms, tha t reinstatement will not relieve the directors of the personal liability they have already incurred by continuing the normal operations of the corporation during dissolution. Moore v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991, 1979 U.S. Ap p. LEXIS 17157 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law). Under § 13.1-752 and this section, the managing officers and directors of a corporation incurred personal liability as employers under the federal Occu pational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. § 651 et seq.) for violations between the dates of the corporations dissolution under § 13.1-752 and reinstatement under this section, and for the penalty assessed because of such violations, and the su bsequent reinstatement of the corporate charter did not relieve them of such liability. Moore v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm'n, 591 F.2d 991, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 17157 (4th Cir. 1979) (decided under prior law). Where a party alleges that the business affairs of a dissolved corporation have been carried on by the acts of certain officers, directors, or agents of the disso lved corporation, then those officers, directors, or agents can be held personally liable for contracts entered on behalf of the dissolved corporation. Any such personal liability incurred because of acts done during the period of corporate dissolution i s not relieved by the reinstatement of the corporation. McLean Bank v. Nelson, 232 Va. 420, 350 S.E.2d 651, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1423, 1986 Va. LEXIS 274 (1986). Upon dissolution directors become trustees of corporate assets.  Upon dissolution, the directors no longer function as directors of a corporation and § 13.1-752 provides that they become trustees in dissolution, the assets o f the corporation automatically pass to them in their new capacity and this is the res of the trust they must administer. Flip Mtg. Corp. v. McElhone, 841 F.2d 531, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 2831 (4th Cir. 1988). Burden on directors as trustees to produce accurate accounts of assets and affairs of trust created by § 13.1-752 and to prove any charges or other debts which they wish to advance to limit their liability. Flip Mtg. Corp. v. McElhone, 841 F.2d 531, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 2831 (4th Cir. 1988). When they breach their fiduciary duties as trustees directors incur personal liability to beneficiaries of trust created by § 13.1-752 and this section provides that such liability, once incurred, is not discharged by the reinstatement of the corporation. Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, by using the trust res for operation o f the business in violation of the statute instead of paying pre-existing obligations owed and for that reason they were personally liable for the damages caused by their breach of trust.

Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Liberal construction.  The simplification of procedures and the complete reversal of the common-law rule of abatement of actions upon dissolution (now termination of corporate existence ) are remedial measures entitled to a liberal construction to effectuate their purposes. United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th Cir. 1962). Strict construction.  Under the common law, once a corporations existence was terminated, its capacity to sue, or to be sued, likewise was terminated, irrespective of when the caus e of action arose. This section, however, partially changed the common-law rule. This section, being in derogation of the common law, therefore, must be strictly construed. Harris v. T.I., Inc., 243 Va. 63, 413 S.E.2d 605, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1751, 1992 Va. L EXIS 149 (1992). Ap plication of Virginia statutes to foreign corporations.  As to application to foreign corporations of former § 13-70, providing for continuation of corporate existence for three years following dissolution of a corpo ration for the purpose of winding up its affairs, and former § 13-72, providing that dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) of a corporation should not abate any pending action against it, see Bardach Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Tenenbaum, 136 V a. 163, 118 S.E. 502, 1923 Va. LEXIS 76 (1923); DuPont Eng'r Co. v. John P. Harvey Constr. Co., 156 Va. 582, 158 S.E. 891, 1931 Va. LEXIS 214 (1931). Section authorizes suits by or against corporation without limitation of time.  This section authorizes actions by or against a corporation, and in its corporate name, after dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) without a limit ation of time. United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th Cir. 1962). Under this section, passage of time after the date of dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) is without significance, although general statutes of l imitation referable to the accrual of the cause of action remain applicable. United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th Cir. 1962). And applies to corporations whose charters were revoked prior to its enactment.  This section applied to suits against corporations the charters of which had been revoked prior to the enactment of this section. United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th Cir. 1962). There was no retroactivity in the application of this section to corporations the charter of which had been revoked prior to the enactment of the section. It alte red no substantive right; it only altered the procedure by which substantive rights may be judicially enforced. United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th Cir. 1962). Court order continuing authority of directors or appointing receiver is no longer necessary.  Under this section a court order continuing the authority of directors or appointing a receiver is no longer a prerequisite to the institution of an action agains t a corporation in dissolution (now termination of corporate existence) at any time. United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th Cir. 1962). Corporation not relieved of obligations by dissolution (no w termination of corporate existence) after transfer of assets.  See Pepper v. Dixie Splint Coal Co., 165 Va. 179, 181 S.E. 406, 1935 Va. LEXIS 286 (1935). Pending action not abated.  See Shepherd v. Kress Box Co., 154 Va. 421, 153 S.E. 649, 1930 Va. LEXIS 225 (1930). Vo luntary petition in bankruptcy contemplated by section.  The legislature contemplated a voluntary petition in bankruptcy as one of the means empowering officers, directors and shareholders of a dissolved corporation (no w corporation which has ceased to exist), to proceed as is provided in this section in its corporate name. In re Rust Control, Inc., 1 Bankr. 303, 1979 Bankr. LEXIS 757 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1979). The filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy is one of the classic means of liquidating a defunct corporation, and the orderly processes of the bankruptcy sta tutes administered in the bankruptcy court protect the rights of all creditors in accordance with the validity and priorities of their respective claims and provide remedies for recovering property and voiding preferences which may have been granted some creditors. In re Rust Control, Inc., 1 Bankr. 303, 1979 Bankr. LEXIS 757 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1979). Claim survives termination of corporate existence.  A corporation which had been involuntarily dissolved (now corporation whose existence has been terminated) by the Commission had the capacity to seek a determinat ion that its claim against a debtor was non-dischargeable in bankruptcy. Mining Env'ts, Inc. v. Staley, 43 Bankr. 374, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4808 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1984). Liability for in jury occurring after dissolution.  A corporation cannot escape liability where, although the injury plaintiff complains of is related to a product purchased from defendant corporation, prior to dis solution, the claim did not arise until the injury occurred and the injury asserted occurred after dissolution. That result would be inconsistent with the clear intent of this section to abrogate the common-law rule which absolves a corporation of any li ability once that corporation is dissolved. Oliver v. AMC, 616 F. Supp. 714, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16484 (E.D. Va. 1985). Absent an ulterior motive there is no basis for distinguishing between the eligibility of a debtor to file a Chapter 7 proceeding as opposed to a Chapter 11 proce eding when it has been terminated by the state. In re Wine Farms, Inc., 94 Bankr. 410, 1988 Bankr. LEXIS 2188 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1988). A claim against a corporation must have existed or the liability of a corporation must have been incurred prior to the date of the corporations termination in order for the claim or liability to survive the termination. Thus, where executors cause of action did not arise until the accidental death of his decedent more than two years after corporation ceased to exist, the trial court correctly sustained co rporations demurrer. Harris v. T.I., Inc., 243 Va. 63, 413 S.E.2d 605, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1751, 1992 Va. LEXIS 149 (1992). Service of process upon president of a defunct corporation was proper, as this section e xpressly provides that a defunct corporation may be sued for liability incurred prior to the termination of its corporate existence, and since defendant defunct corporation could be sued as before, it could also be served with process as before. United S tates v. Moore, 698 F. Supp. 622, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15700 (E.D. Va. 1988). Surety provided notice of proceeding s.  Since a subcontractor had notice of proceedings against it, as well as the trial courts two orders compelling the subcontractor to make available a corporate officer to be deposed, and that knowledge was imputed to its surety; nonetheless, the fact that the subcontractor was a defunct corporation did not alleviate its responsibility to name an officer to be present for the deposition. Am. Safety Cas. Ins. Co. v. C.G. Mitchell Constr., 268 Va. 340, 601 S.E.2d 633, 2004 Va.

Constitutionality.  Former § 163 of the Constitution precluded foreign corporations from exercising their functions in this State, except upon compliance with its laws, and expres sly authorized the General Assembly to discriminate against them. The General Assembly could exclude foreign corporations from exercising their functions within this State, subject only to the inhibition of the federal Constitution. Knights of KKK v. Com monwealth ex rel. SCC, 138 Va. 500, 122 S.E. 122, 1924 Va. LEXIS 41 (1924). Transactions constituting transacting business.  Transacting business in the State by a foreign corporation pursuant to this section and § 13.1-758 imports the transaction of its ordinary and customary busine ss herein. Conversely, business transactions of such corporation within the State which are not a part of its ordinary business but instead are merely incidental thereto are insufficient to constitute transacting business pursuant to this section and § 13.1-758. Continental Properties, Inc. v. Ullman Co., 436 F. Supp. 538, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15906 (E.D. Va. 1977). A corporations sole connection to Virginia as a passive investor in notes secured by real estate located in the Commonwealth, did not constitute the transacti on of business in the state. Peterson v. Cooley, 142 F.3d 181, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 7687 (4th Cir. 1998). Business need not be commercial.  Doing business, as used in the statutes with reference to foreign corporations, is not confined to commercial or manufacturing functions only, but the exercise of its corporate functions by any foreign corporation within this State constitutes transacting business here within the meaning of the statutes. Knights of KKK v. Commonwealth ex rel. SCC, 138 Va. 500, 122 S.E. 122, 1924 Va. LEXIS 41 (1924). Thus, social business is included.  A patriotic, secret, social, benevolent, and foreign corporation, which established local organizations, initiated members and furnished them with paraphernalia, was exercising its functions and powers within this State, under the provisions of the statutes, and was therefore subject to the provisions thereof. Knights of KKK v. Commonwealth ex rel. SCC, 138 Va. 500, 122 S.E. 122, 1924 Va. LEXIS 41 (1924). A foreign corporation which solicits members, organizes lodges, distributes regalia, collects fees, and makes such contracts as are involved in or incidental to t hese acts, is protected under the provisions of law of this State, and the indirect connection with anything which could be fairly held to be interstate commerce is too remote to relieve it from the provisions of the statutes relating to foreign corporat ions. Knights of KKK v. Commonwealth ex rel. SCC, 138 Va. 500, 122 S.E. 122, 1924 Va. LEXIS 41 (1924). Illustrations of doing business.  The erection and installation within this State, by a foreign corporation, of a complete railway signal system, involving the employment of labor, skilled and uns killed, the stringing of wires, the construction of concrete foundations, and the erection and painting of signal mechanisms, all to be performed in this State, constitutes doing business in this State. General Ry. Signal Co. v. Commonwealth, 118 Va. 301 , 87 S.E. 598, 1916 Va. LEXIS 11 (1916), aff'd, 246 U.S. 500, 38 S. Ct. 360, 62 L. Ed. 854, 1918 U.S. LEXIS 1569 (1918). A foreign corporation which made a contract for the sale, installation and erection of certain gas machines and equipments in this State, involving extensive cons truction work, was doing business in this State, and therefore liable under § 13.1-758 for having failed to take out license therefor; the essence of the undertaking was the construction engaged in, the sale being a mere incident thereto. Commonwealth ex rel. SCC v. Western Gas Constr. Co., 11 Va. L. Reg. 737 (1926). The making of a contract out of this State by a foreign corporation, by which title to a tract of land within the State is acquired by such corporation, is not do ing business in the State, so as to render a director of the company liable for its debts under § 13.1-758, although the object of the purchase be to engage in mining in the State at a subsequent time. Goldsberry v. Carter, 100 Va. 438, 41 S.E. 858, 1 902 Va. LEXIS 42 (1902). A manufacturer which shipped goods on consignment to its exclusive distributor in Virginia, and, when the goods were sold by the distributor on conditional sales contracts, accepted assignment of the conditional sales contracts from the distributor, was not, under the facts, doing business in this State so as to subject it to the requirements of this article. Rock-Ola Mfg. Corp. v. Wertz, 249 F.2d 813, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 5431 (4th Cir. 1957). Entering into a purchase agreement for the sale of land to be used as a future manufacturing site does not constitute transacting business within the stat utory meaning of this section or § 13.1-758. Neither do the incidentals associated therewith, such as negotiating with and entering into construction contracts with an architectural firm, a general construction firm and a real estate development and i nvestment firm such as plaintiff. Continental Properties, Inc. v. Ullman Co., 436 F. Supp. 538, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15906 (E.D. Va. 1977). Although plaintiff building and loan association was neither doing business nor was it authorized to do business in Virginia in accordance with Vi rginia law, the fact is that, lawfully, it had a substantial number of customers in Virginia and had made a number of loans secured by the pledge of real estate in this jurisdiction. In the context of an alleged misappropriation of a trade name, the real ity of a building and loan associations doing business ought to be considered by the court. Kyhos v. Perpetual Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 480 F.2d 204, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9351 (4th Cir. 1973). Trademarks.  Although both the Georgia and Virginia Southern Christian Leadership Conferences (SCLC) operated in Virginia without proper authority, the Breakaway SCLCs reg istration of the service/trademarks did not defeat their continuous common-law use of the contested marks under § 59.1-92.3; therefore, the trial courts judgment that the Georgia SCLC and Virginia SCLC had a superior claim to the marks was not err oneous.

A foreign c orporation transacting business in the Commonwealth without a certificate of authority may not maintain a proceeding in any court in the Commonwealth until it obtains a certificate of authority. B. The success or to a foreign corporation that transacted business in the Commonwealth without a certificate of authority and the assignee of a cause of action arising out of that business may not maintain a proceeding based on that cause of action in any court in the Commonwealth until the foreign corporation or its successor obtains a certificate of authority. C. A court may stay a proceeding commenced by a foreign corporation, its successor, or assignee until it determines whether the foreign corporation or its successor requires a certificate of authority. If it so determines, the court shall further stay the proceeding u ntil the foreign corporation or its successor obtains the certificate. D. If a foreig n corporation transacts business in the Commonwealth without a certificate of authority, each officer, director, and employee who does any of such business in the Commonwealth knowing that a certificate of authority is required shall be liable for a pena lty of not less than $500 and not more than $5,000. Any such penalty may be imposed by the Commission or by any court in the Commonwealth before which an action against the corporation may lie, after the corporation and the individual have been given not ice and an opportunity to be heard. E. Notwithstan ding subsections A and B, the failure of a foreign corporation to obtain a certificate of authority does not impair the validity of its corporate acts or prevent it from defending any proceeding in the Commonwealth. F. Suits, acti ons, and proceedings may be begun against a foreign corporation that transacts business in the Commonwealth without a certificate of authority by serving process on any director, officer, or agent of the corporation doing such business, or, if none can b e found, on the clerk of the Commission or on the corporation in any other manner permitted by law. If any foreign corporation transacts business in the Commonwealth without a certificate of authority, it shall by transacting such business be deemed to h ave thereby appointed the clerk of the Commission as an agent for service of process upon the foreign corporation. Service upon the clerk shall be made in accordance with § 12.1-19.1. History History.

Furman, 163 F.2d 199, 1947 U.S. App. LEXIS 2244 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 332 U.S. 809, 68 S. Ct. 111, 92 L. Ed. 387, 1947 U.S. LEXIS 1716 (194 7). Engaging in business subjects foreign corporation to jurisdiction of state courts.  When a foreign corporation engages in the privilege of doing business in Virginia, it enjoys the benefits and protection of the laws of this Commonwealth. It ther eby subjects itself to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State for the purpose of litigating liabilities created during its stay here. Eure v. Morgan Jones &amp; Co., 195 Va. 678, 79 S.E.2d 862, 1954 Va. LEXIS 147 (1954). Defendant was a Massachusetts corporation with the principal office in New York. It had not been domesticated in Virginia, had no resident agent here, and had not designated the Secretary of the Commonwealth (now the Clerk of the Commission) as its agent for service of process. Under such circumstances, it was necessary that defendant be engaged in business in the State in order to validate service upon it under this section which provides for service only if a corporation is so engaged. Carnegie v. Art Metal Constr. Co., 191 Va. 136, 60 S.E.2d 17, 1950 Va. LEXIS 206 (1950), limited, Eure v. Morgan Jones &amp; Co., 195 Va. 678, 79 S.E.2d 862, 1954 Va. LEXIS 147 (195 4). A corporation which engages in business in the Commonwealth so as to enjoy the protections of its laws thereby subjects itself to the jurisdiction of the Commonwe alth. Pennington v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 576 F. Supp. 868, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11767 (E.D. Va. 1983). Which is not defeated by withdrawal from State.  A foreign corporation which does business in Virginia without domesticating or appointing a statutory agent nevertheless constitutes the Clerk of the Commission i ts agent for service of process. It may not, by withdrawing from the State, defeat an action growing out of business done in Virginia, and such action may be begun by substituted service. Eure v. Morgan Jones &amp; Co., 195 Va. 678, 79 S.E.2d 862, 1954 Va. L EXIS 147 (1954). The only prerequisite of this section is that the corporation sought to be served must b e transacting business within the Commonwealth. Pennington v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 576 F. Supp. 868, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11767 (E.D. Va. 1983). There is no discernible distinction between the terms transacting business and doing business. Pennington v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 576 F. Supp. 868, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11767 (E.D. Va. 1983). The terms transacting business and doing business are used interchangeably by Virginia courts to describe the same action. The United States District Court, Eastern District of Virginia, will do the same. Continental Properties, Inc. v. Ullman Co., 436 F. Supp. 538, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15906 (E.D. Va. 1977). Transactions constituting transacting business.  Transacting business in the State by a foreign corporation pursuant to § 13.1-757 and this section imports the transaction of its ordinary and customary busine ss herein. Conversely, business transactions of such corporation within the State which are not a part of its ordinary business but instead are merely incidental thereto are insufficient to constitute transacting business pursuant to § 13.1-75 7 and this section. Continental Properties, Inc. v. Ullman Co., 436 F. Supp. 538, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15906 (E.D. Va. 1977). Entering into a purchase agreement for the sale of land to be used as a future manufacturing site does not constitute transacting business within the statutory meaning of § 13.1-757 or this section. Neither do the incidentals associated therewith, such as negotiating with and entering into construction contracts with an archi tectural firm, a general construction firm and a real estate development and investment firm such as plaintiff. Continental Properties, Inc. v. Ullman Co., 436 F. Supp. 538, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15906 (E.D. Va. 1977). Merely ordering products or supplies in a forum state is not sufficient to find that a f oreign corporation is transacting business necessitating procurement of a certificate of authority. Questech, Inc. v. Liteco, AG, 735 F. Supp. 187, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4419 (E.D. Va. 1990). Where the tortious injury does not arise out of in-state activities, a stronger showing of contacts between the defendant and the forum is required. The regularity test is applied in a situation where the cause of action did not arise from the in-state activity. The regularity test looks toward the continuity of business activity wi thin the forum. Pennington v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 576 F. Supp. 868, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11767 (E.D. Va. 1983). Complian ce with section before judgment is sufficient.  Maintain means a continuation of the proceeding already begun, and compliance with the requirements of this section before judgment is sufficient to entit le the corporation to continue its prosecution. Video Eng'r Co. v. Foto-Video Elecs., Inc., 207 Va. 1027, 154 S.E.2d 7, 1967 Va. LEXIS 173 (1967). Compliance with this section by a foreign corporation transacting business in this State after it has commenced an attachment proceeding is sufficient to enable i t to continue the action. Video Eng'r Co. v. Foto-Video Elecs., Inc., 207 Va. 1027, 154 S.E.2d 7, 1967 Va. LEXIS 173 (1967). Construction of prohibition against noncomplying corporations maintaining suits in state courts.  The prohibition against noncomplying corporations maintaining law suits in Virginia courts is not so much a defense available to a litigants adversaries, and therefore plausibly waivable, but it is rather an absolute bar to the offenders use of the courts to press its claim until compliance with the statutes is effected. Moore v. Northern Homes of Pa., Inc., 80 F.R.D. 278, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15343 (W.D . Va. 1978). Effect of service on the Secretary of the Commonwealth.  Serving the Secretary of the Commonwealth pursuant to § 8.01-329 does not comply with the requirements of this section. Service upon the Secretary instead of t he Clerk of the Corporation Commission is ineffective. The defect is cured, however, by § 8.01-288 which states that [e]xcept for process commencing actions for divorce or annulment of marriage, process which has reached th...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_13.1-759"><akn:num>§ 13.1-759</akn:num><akn:heading>Application for certificate of authority</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. To obtain a certificate of authority to transact business in the Commonwealth, a foreign corporation shall deliver an application to the Commission. The application shall be made on a form prescribed and furnished by the Commission. The application shall be signed in the name of the foreign corporation and set forth: 1. The n ame of the foreign corporation, and if the foreign corporation is prevented by § 13.1-762 from using its name in the Commonwealth, a designated name that satisfies the requirements of subsection B of § 13.1-762; 2. The foreign corporations jurisdiction of formation, and if the foreign corporation was previously authorized or registered to transact business in the Commonwealth as a foreign cor poration, limited liability company, business trust, limited partnership, or registered limited liability partnership, with respect to every such prior authorization or registration, (i) the name of the entity; (ii) the entity type; (iii) the state or ot her jurisdiction of incorporation, organization, or formation; and (iv) the entity identification number issued to it by the Commission; 3. The foreign corporations original date of incorporation, organization, or formation as an entity and its period of duration; 4. The street address of the foreign corporations principal office; 5. The address of the proposed registered office of the foreign corporation in the Commonwealth (including both (i) the post office address with street and number, if any, and (ii) the na me of the county or city in which it is located) and the name of its proposed registered agent in the Commonwealth at such address and that the registered agent is either (a) an individual who is a resident of Virginia and either an officer or director o f the corporation or a member of the Virginia State Bar or (b) a domestic or foreign stock or nonstock corporation, limited liability company, or registered limited liability partnership authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth, the business o ffice of which is identical with the registered office; 6. The names and business addresses of the foreign corporations directors and principal officers; and 7. The number of shares the foreign corporation is authorized to issue, itemized by class. B. The foreign corporation shall deliver with the completed application a copy of its articles of incorporation and all amendments and corrections thereto duly authenticated by the Secretary of State or other official having custody of corporate records in its jurisdi ction of formation. C. A foreign c orporation is not precluded from receiving a certificate of authority to transact business in the Commonwealth because of any difference between the law of the foreign corporations jurisdiction of formation and the law of the Commonwealth. D. If the Comm ission finds that the application complies with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall issue a certificate of authority to transact business in the Commonwealth.

CASE NOTES Reincorporation necessary to act as public service corporation.  To conduct business in Virginia, a foreign corporation must merely register with the State Corporation Commission. However, a foreign corporation must reincorpora te in Virginia in order to act as a public service company. Johnson v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 830 F. Supp. 309, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12582 (E.D. Va. 1993). Diversity jurisdiction lacking in action against pipeline company.  Even though pipeline company defendant was incorporated in Virginia, and its Virginia incorporation was an involuntary addition to its incorporation in Delaware, both plaintiffs and the defendant were citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and thus diversity jurisdiction was lacking under § 56-49 which requires a foreign corporation must reincorporate in Virginia in order to act as a public service corporat ion.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Constitutionality of former statutes .  Former §§ 13-214 to 13-216, requiring foreign corporations doing business in this State to appoint the Secretary of the Commonwealth their agent for service of process, were not unconstitutional, as violating former § 11 of the Constitution of Virginia and § 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, for the reason that they did not provide that a return upon a process executed thereunder should show that the process has been brought to the attention of or actually served upon a foreign corporation; that is, that the Secretary of the Commonwealth forthwith mailed a copy of the process to the defendant. American Ry. Express Co. v. Fleishman, Morris &amp; Co., 149 Va. 200, 141 S.E. 253, 1928 Va. LEXIS 357 (1928), cert. denied, 278 U.S. 652, 49 S. Ct. 177, 73 L. Ed. 562, 1929 U.S. LEXIS 404 (1929). Former §§ 13-214 to 13-216 were not subject to the objection that a foreign corporation engaged in interstate commerce cannot be made to conform to the cond itions precedent to its doing business in Virginia. American Ry. Express Co. v. Fleishman, Morris &amp; Co., 149 Va. 200, 141 S.E. 253, 1928 Va. LEXIS 357 (1928), cert. denied, 278 U.S. 652, 49 S. Ct. 177, 73 L. Ed. 562, 1929 U.S. LEXIS 404 (1929). This section is permissive and for the benefit of the party seeking to obtain service of process. Trueblood v. Grayson Shops of Tenn., Inc., 32 F.R.D. 190, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10401 (E.D. Va. 1963). Foreign corporations accountable for wrongs committed in Virginia.  The opinion in Travelers Health Assn v. Commonwealth , 188 Va. 877, 51 S.E.2d 263 (1949), affd, 339 U.S. 643, 70 S. Ct. 927, 94 L. Ed. 1154 (1950), strongly suggests the inclination of Virginias courts to construe her protective and remedial statutes so as to hold foreign corporations accountable in her courts for wrongs committed in Virginia, except only as that court has felt itself limited by constitutional restraints. Westcott-Alexander, Inc. v. Dailey, 264 F.2d 853, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 5464 (4th C ir. 1959). Necessity that corporation has been doing business in State.  In order for a corporation to be amenable to service of process on the clerk of the Corporation Commission under this section and § 8.01-301, it must have been doing business in Virginia. Sikes v. Rexall Drug Co., 176 F. Supp. 33, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2752 (D. Va. 1959). It is required by both Virginia and federal law that a corporation be doing business or transacting affairs in Virginia to be subject to service. Goldrick v. D.M. Picton Co., 56 F.R.D. 639, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11988 (D. Va. 1971). The phrase doing business is ephemeral and not easily defined and each case must turn upon its own particular facts. Sikes v. Rexall Drug Co., 176 F. Supp. 33, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2752 (D. Va. 1959). And each case must be decided on o wn facts.  In determining whether a foreign corporation is doing business within the state, each case must be decided on its own facts. Moore-McCormack Lines v. Bung e Corp., 307 F.2d 910, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 4164 (4th Cir. 1962). Jurisdiction is not dependent upon the connection of the nonresident defendant with the transaction that gives rise to the suit before the court. What the defendant may have done in the particular case is relevant, but not conclusive, upon the question of jurisdiction. The latter must be decided after considering the sum total of the defe ndants intrastate transactions. Moore-McCormack Lines v. Bunge Corp., 307 F.2d 910, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 4164 (4th Cir. 1962). Jurisdiction to enforce subpoena.  In a case in which a website appealed a judgment of the court of appeals affirming an order of the circuit court holding the website in civil contempt for failing to comply with a nonparty subpoena duces tecum served upon it by a carpet cleaning business, the Supreme Court concluded that the circuit co urt was not empowered to enforce the nonparty subpoena against the website, which was headquartered in California. Subpoena power was not conferred upon the circuit court by the websites act in registering to conduct business in Virginia or designati ng a registered agent for service of process in the Commonwealth. Bradshaw v. Booth, 129 Va. 19, 105 S.E. 555, 1921 Va. LEXIS 73 (1921), overruled in part, Howard v. Ball, 289 Va. 470, 770 S.E.2d 476, 2015 Va. LEXIS 46 (2015) (overruled in part by Howa rd v. Ball, 770 S.E.2d 476 (Va. 2015) (to the extent Bradshaw can be interpreted to allow a party to rely on adverse possession as an affirmative defense without expressly pleading it in an ejectment action or an action to establish boundary lines)). The test of traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice should be given great weight in ascertaining in a particular case whether the activities of a foreign corporation within the state are sufficient to subject it to constructive service of process. Moore-McCormack Lines v. Bunge Corp., 307 F.2d 910, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 4164 (4th Cir. 1962). Substituted service upon a nonresident is valid if he has had such minimum contacts within the state that the maintenance of the suit would not offend traditional notions of due process and fair play. Moore-McCormack Lines v. Bunge Corp., 307 F.2d 910, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 4164 (4th Cir. 1962). Corpor ation must do more than maintain soliciting agent.  The general rule is that in order to be doing business and thus subject to statutory service such as contemplated by § 8.01-301 and this section a corp oration must maintain more than a mere soliciting agent within a state. Sikes v. Rexall Drug Co., 176 F. Supp. 33, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2752 (D. Va. 1959). But solicitation of business may be taken into consideration.  In the determination of whether there exists such minimum contacts within the state as would not offend traditional notions of due process and fair play by the ma intenance of a suit against a foreign corporation, the solicitation of business by the employees of the nonresident within the state may be taken into consideration. Moore-McCormack Lines v. Bunge Corp., 307 F.2d 910, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 4164 (4th Cir. 1962). Acti vities insufficient to constitute doing business.  Where only activity of soliciting agents of defendant corporation other than soliciting orders was assisting the customers in the use of advertising media and the display of products and the payment of push money, this was not enough to meet the solicitation plus test indicated in International Harvester Co. of Am. v. Kentucky, 1914 U.S. LEXIS 1109, 234 U.S. 579, 34 S. Ct. 944, 58 L. Ed. 1479 (191 4); Sikes v. Rexall Drug Co., 176 F. Supp. 33, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2752 (D. Va. 1959). Doing of business by subsidiary does not confer jurisdiction over parent.  The doing of business of a subsidiary corporation in a state does not without more confer jurisdiction over the nonresident parent corporation. Goldrick v. D.M. P icton Co., 56 F.R.D. 639, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11988 (D. Va. 1971). And service on parent does not confer jurisdiction over subsidiary.  The service of process on the parent company does not permit the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over the wholly owned subsidiary, if they are two separat e distinct entities and so operate. Goldrick v. D.M. Picton Co., 56 F.R.D. 639, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11988 (D. Va. 1971). Contacts required where plaintiffs injury does not arise out of something done in forum state.  If plaintiffs injury does not arise out of something done in the forum state, then other contacts between the corporation and the state must be fairly extensi ve before the burden of defending a suit there may be imposed upon it without offending traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Goldrick v. D.M. Picton Co., 56 F.R.D. 639, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11988 (D. Va. 1971).

A foreign c orporation authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth may withdraw its certificate of authority by applying to the Commission for a certificate of withdrawal. The application shall be on a form prescribed and furnished by the Commission, which s hall set forth: 1. The n ame of the foreign corporation and its jurisdiction of formation; 2. If applicable, a statement that the foreign corporation was a party to a merger permitted by the laws of its jurisdiction of formation and that it was not the surviving entity of the m erger, has consolidated with another entity, or has converted to another type of entity under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation; 3. That the foreign corporation is not transacting business in the Commonwealth and that it surrenders its authority to transact business in the Commonwealth; 4. That the foreign corporation revokes the authority of its registered agent to accept service on its behalf and appoints the clerk of the Commission as an agent for service of process u pon the foreign corporation in any proceeding based on a cause of action arising during the time it was authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth; 5. A mailing address to which the clerk of the Commission may mail a copy of any process served on the clerk under subdivision 4; and 6. A commitment to notify the clerk of the Commission in the future of any change in the mailing address of the corporation. B. The Commiss ion shall not allow any foreign corporation to withdraw its certificate of authority unless such corporation files with the Commission a statement certifying that the corporation has filed returns and has paid all state taxes to the time of the statement or a statement that no such returns are required to be filed or taxes are required to be paid. In such case the corporation may file returns and pay taxes before they would otherwise be due. If the Commission finds that the application complies with the requirements of law and that all required fees have been paid, it shall issue a certificate of withdrawal. C. Before any foreign corporation authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth terminates its corporate existence, it shall file with the Commission an application for withdrawal. Whether or not such application is filed, the termination of the corporate existe nce of such foreign corporation shall not take away or impair any remedy available against such corporation for any right or claim existing or any liability incurred prior to such termination. Any such action or proceeding against such foreign corporatio n may be defended by such corporation in its corporate name. The shareholders, directors and officers shall have power to take such corporate or other action as shall be appropriate to protect such remedy, right or claim. The right of a foreign corporati on that has terminated its corporate existence to institute and maintain in its corporate name actions, suits or proceedings in the courts of the Commonwealth shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation. D. Service of process on the clerk of the Commission is service of process on a foreign corporation that has withdrawn its certificate of authority pursuant to this section. Service upon the clerk shall be made in accordance with § 12.1-19.1 and service upon the fo reign corporation may be made in any other manner permitted by law. History History.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 4B M.J. Corporations, § 130. CASE NOTES Federal court lacked jurisdiction to grant declaratory judgment regarding inspection rights.  Court lacked jurisdiction to grant a declaratory judgment regarding a former shareholders right under § 13.1-771 to inspect a corporations books and re cords, because § 13.1-773 provided a remedy and required the former shareholder to pursue her remedy in the circuit court in the city or county where the corporations principal office was located. Firestone v. Wiley, 485 F. Supp. 2d 694, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34382 (E.D. Va. 2007). The provisions of this section do not materially differ from the rules of the common law with respect to the rights of a stockholder to inspect the books and records of a corporation. At common law a stockholder is entitled to inspect corporate books and records at a proper time and place and for a proper purpose. This right is not absolute and uncontrolled but must be exercised in good faith and for some reasonable purpose germane to his interest as a stockholder. Bank of Giles County v. Mason, 199 Va. 176, 98 S.E.2d 905, 1957 Va. LEXIS 177 (1957) (decided under prior law). Mandamus to enforce right of inspe ction.  The writ of mandamus is a proper remedy, both under the statute and at common law, available to a stockholder who has been improperly denied his right of inspecti on, but the petition must state plainly and concisely the grounds of the application.

United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th C ir. 1962). The provisions of this section relate primarily to the transition from the old statutes to the new. United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th Cir. 1962). It is important in the public interest that the same rules apply to present corporations and securities as to new ones and thus that this title apply in full force to corporations existing and securities outstanding at its effective date; and in view of the broad scope of the reserved power to amend in Virginia this is within the power of the General Assembly. United States v. Village Corp., 298 F.2d 816, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 6290 (4th Cir. 1962). Corporations the charters of which had been revoked prior to the enactment of this section were existing within the meaning of this section. United States v.

CASE NOTES Virginia International Terminal not alter ego of state.  While noting that Virginia International Terminal (VIT), has many attributes of a state agency, the court was compelled to place particular significance on the fa ct that state treasury funds cannot be used to satisfy any judgment against VIT. This factor, combined with VITs independent corporate existence, compels the conclusion that VIT is not a mere alter ego of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes. Th is conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Virginia, by the attorney generals opinion, has expressed the view that VIT is not an agency of the state. Artist v.

CASE NOTES The charter is a contract between the state and the incorporators. One of the unwritten provisions of that contract is that the trustees of the corporation shall have the right to conduct its affairs as they might, in their sound discretion, see fit. Inherent in the charter is the understanding that, except as provided by law, the state wil l not interfere in the corporations internal affairs. Khoury v. Community Mem. Hosp., 203 Va. 236, 123 S.E.2d 533, 1962 Va. LEXIS 133 (1962) (decided under prior law). Court held without authority to nullify discretion of hospital trustees.  Where the trustees of a private hospital corporation, in their sound discretion, excluded a doctor from the use of the facilities of the hospital, the court was w ithout authority to nullify that discretion by injunction process. There were no constitutional or statutory rights of the doctor, or of his patients who might wish to be treated in the hospital by him, which warranted such interference. Khoury v. Commun ity Mem.

Virginia International Terminal not alter ego of state.  While noting that Virginia International Terminal (VIT), has many attributes of a state agency, the court was compelled to place particular significance on the fa ct that state treasury funds cannot be used to satisfy any judgment against VIT. This factor, combined with VITs independent corporate existence, compels the conclusion that VIT is not a mere alter ego of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes. Th is conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Virginia, by the attorney generals opinion, has expressed the view that VIT is not an agency of the state. Artist v.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 4B M.J. Corporations, § 222. CASE NOTES Voidable acts.  A challenge to a voidable corporate act is subject to a defense of the statute of limitations. A contrary conclusion is untenable because it would require the Sup reme Court of Virginia to assume, in the absence of any authority, that the Virginia General Assembly intended to render innumerable corporate transactions, imperfectly executed but within a corporations power to act, subject to attack in perpetuity. In addition, such a conclusion would blur the bright line presently existing between an ultra vires act, in which a corporation lacks power to act, and a voidable act, which is within the lawful scope of a corporations power.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Demand futile.  In a derivative action by three members, a formal demand was unnecessary because notice in the form of a demand was not necessary to file a complaint under the Vi rginia Nonstock Corporation Act, § 13.1-801 et seq., and a demand would have been futile where the directors charged with wrongdoing constituted a majority of the board.

A corporati on may appoint one or more inspectors to act at a meeting of members in connection with determining voting results. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall certify in writing that the inspector will faithfully execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. B. The inspect ors shall (i) ascertain the number of members and the voting power of each, (ii) determine the number of the members represented at a meeting and the validity of proxy appointments and ballots, (iii) count all votes, (iv) determine, and retain for a reas onable period a record of the disposition of, any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the number of members represented at the meeting and their count of the votes. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of their duties, and may rely on information provided by such persons and other persons, including those appointed to tabulate votes, unless the inspectors believe reliance is u nwarranted. In any court proceeding there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the report of the inspectors is correct. C. No ballot, proxies, or votes, nor any revocations thereof or changes thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless the circuit court of the city or county where the corporations principal office is located or, if none in the Commonwealth, where its registered office is located, upon application by a member, shall determine otherwise.

If the inspectors consider other reliable information for the limited purpose permitted herein, they shall specify, at the time that they make their certification pursuant to clause (v) of subs ection B, the precise information that they considered, including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained, and the basis for their belief that such information is accurate and reliable. E. If authoriz ed by the board of directors, any member vote to be taken by written ballot may be satisfied by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission by the member or the members proxy, provided that any such electronic transmission shall either set forth or be submitted with information from which it may be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the member or the members proxy.

A conflict of interests transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has an interest that precludes him from being a disinterested director. A conflict of interests transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely be cause of the directors interest in the transaction if any one of the following is true: 1. The m aterial facts of the transaction and the directors interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; 2. The material facts of the transaction and the directors interest were disclosed to the members entitled to vote and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or 3. The transaction was fair to the corporation. B. For purpose s of subdivision A 1, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors on the board of directors, or on the committee. A transaction shall not be aut horized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the disinterested directors vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presen ce of, or a vote cast by, a director who is not disinterested does not affect the validity of any action taken under subdivision A 1 if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection. C. For purpose s of subdivision A 2, a conflict of interests transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. The votes controlled by a director who is not disinterested ma y not be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interests transaction under subdivision A 2. The directors votes, however, may be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved und er other sections of this Act. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

CASE NOTES Settlement agreement required approval by majority of board of directors.  With respect to proposed settlement of litigation involving debtors and condominium association, settlement agreement was not approved by required majority of boa rd of directors because just two of six directors present voted in favor of settlement, while four abstained, which was not sufficient to approve motion to pass.

Settlement agreements in ban kruptcy cases.  Bankruptcy court appointed a disinterested individual to act as amicus curiae to conduct a full, fair, and transparent review of a settlement agreement that was p roposed by an LLC that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy and a condominium association because three members of the associations board of directors were either owners of the LLC or a relative of an owner, stated that procedures under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9 014 that applied to contested matters would apply to the review the amicus curiae conducted, and directed the parties to cooperate with the person who was appointed. Although the existence of a conflict of interest did not preclude a settlement or necess arily prevent directors who were affiliated with the LLC from participating in the settlement process, the requirements of § 13.1-871 had to be satisfied.

Vote b y board of directors did not satisfy subdivision A 1.  With respect to proposed settlement of litigation involving debtors and condominium association, vote by associations board of directors to approve settlement did not satisfy subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-871 because it was conflict of interests transaction, and it was not approved by a majority of disinterested directors; therefore, because no valid settlement contract existed, a Fed.

A director s taking advantage, directly or indirectly, of a business opportunity may not be the subject of equitable relief or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions against the director in a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation on the ground that such opportunity should have first been offered to the corporation, if before becoming legally obligated respecting the opportunity the director brings it to the attention of the corporation and: 1. Direc tors action disclaiming the corporations interest in the opportunity is taken in compliance with the procedures set forth in subdivision A 1 of § 13.1-871, as if the decision being made concerned a directors conflict of interests transacti on; or 2.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Standing.  Because the cy pres doctrine precluded the corpus of a testamentary trust from reverting to the decedents estate under subdivision A 3 of § 13.1-907 and fo rmer § 55-31, the decedents cousin lacked standing to file a lawsuit to be allowed to inspect the records of the charity. Booker v. Chastain Home for Gentlewomen, Inc., 69 Va. Cir. 299, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 318 (Halifax County Nov. 14, 2005). Directors and majority shareholders personal liability established.  Where a majority shareholder directed that only a small portion of the proceeds from the sale of corporate property be wired to pay other debts into the corporate account, while instructing the buyer to wire the remaining amounts (more than 90 percent of the total paid at the sale) into his and a directors personal bank accounts, this evidence showed not only that the shareholder was aware of the collection p roceedings against the corporation, but that the acts of procuring a significant personal and pecuniary benefit from the sale of the corporate property were illegal and warranted personal liability to the corporations debtors and an insurer, who had paid the corporate debt and became subrogated to a federal judgment creditor.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Fiduciary duties.  Absence of language defining fiduciary duties among limited liability company (LLC) members in the Virginia Limited Liability Company Act (LLC Act), § 13.1-100 0 et seq., is intentional; the Virginia general assemblys express imposition of fiduciary duties among partners in a partnership under subsection A of § 50-73.102, demonstrates that the general assembly is conscious of the language needed to impos e fiduciary duties if desired, and the decision to omit similar duty-imposing language in the LLC Act is clear evidence that the general assembly intends that LLC members owe no fiduciary duty to other LLC members. WAKA, LLC v. Humphrey, 73 Va. Cir. 310, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 96 (Fairfax County May 2, 2007). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Taxation of single member limited liability companies.  Property that is owned by a single member limited liability company that does not independently qualify as an institution of learning not conducted for profit  is not eligible for tax exemption by classification under subdivision A 4 of § 58.1-3606, notwithstanding that the sole owner of the entity is a non-profit corporation operating as an institution of learning. See opinion of Attorney General to T he Honorable Philip J. Kellam, Commissioner of the Revenue for Virginia Beach, 18-027, (8/9/19). Certain receipts, including gifts and contributions, of a domestic single member limited liability company (SMLLC) that is classified as a disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes and solely owned by a charitable organization that qualifies for charitable deductions under the Internal Revenue Code, may be excluded from business, professional and occupational license (BPOL) taxation, if applicable requir ements of subdivision C 18 of § 58.1-3703 have been satisfied.

History History. 1991, c. 168. § 13.1-1001.1. Construction. Text A. Unless disp laced by particular provisions of this chapter, the principles of law and equity supplement this chapter. B. Sections 9- 406 and 9-408 of the Uniform Commercial Code, including §§ 8.9A-406 and 8.9A-408, do not apply to any interest in a limited liability company, including all rights, powers and interests arising under the articles of organization or operating agreem ent of a limited liability company or this chapter. This provision prevails over §§ 8.9A-406 and 8.9A-408, and is expressly intended to permit the enforcement as a fundamental matter of contract among the members of a limited liability company of a ny provision of an operating agreement that would otherwise be ineffective under § 9-406 or § 9-408 of the Uniform Commercial Code. C. This chapte r shall be construed in furtherance of the policies of giving maximum effect to the principle of freedom of contract and of enforcing operating agreements. History History. 1993, c. 113; 2003, c. 340. Annotations The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 340, effective July 1, 2003, designated the first paragraph as subsection A and added subsections B and C. CASE NOTES Futility exception.  With respect to the futility exception, the 2011 amendment has the effect of replacing an express textual provision in § 13.1-1042 with an incorporation by ref erence of a rule drawn from case law; the combined force of the textual provisions of subsection A of § 13.1-1001.1 and § 13.1-1044 lead to the conclusion that the General Assembly did not abrogate the futility exception when it amended § 13.1-1 042 in 2011.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Contract entered into prior to limited liability companys formal incorporation.  A limited liability companys contract with the foundation was valid, as such signed by one of the proposed principals and incorporators 12 days prior to the L LC obtaining its corporate status in Virginia. Geographic Network Affiliates-Int'l, Inc. v. Enter. for Empowerment Found., 68 Va. Cir. 185, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 237 (Norfolk June 27, 2005). Standing to sue.  Operating agreement showed the parties intent to operate a business together as a limited liability company or a business as a partnership up to the time the limited liability company came into being; thus, when the investor wrote checks, the funds became the property of the business entity. A cause of action for conversion would require that the entity in place that received the funds be named, and a recover y by that entity, the limited liability company, by way of a derivative claim, would then be distributable to the members according to their interests; therefore, the investor had no standing to sue for conversion under § 13.1-1007 because the funds a lleged to have been converted belonged to the business entity after the investor wrote four checks payable to the entity, which was operating either as a partnership or a limited liability company.

CASE NOTES Failure to state a claim.  As the employees action for wrongful discharge sounded in tort, the individually named defendants (with the exception of an executive director), whose existen ce in the case was predicated only on their status as members, managers, or agents, were dismissed as parties to the common-law wrongful discharge claim. McFarland v. Va. Ret. Servs. of Chesterfield, L.L.C., 477 F. Supp. 2d 727, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 156 88 (E.D. Va. 2007). Representative of limited liability company was not an applicant for insurance.  Insurance company wrongfully rescinded a limited liability companys insurance policy due to material misrepresentation after learning the representative who s igned the policy on behalf of the LLC had a criminal record for insurance fraud, because the term applicant refers only to the party seeking to purchase insurance. There was nothing in the record to suggest that the applicant was acting individua lly when he completed and signed the application on behalf of the LLC; the policy covered property owned by the LLC.

Insurance coverage.  Coverage under an insurance policy did not exist for fire damage to a building owned by a subsidiary of an insured limited liability company because the policy s coverage-extension provision for newly acquired buildings could not be fairly read to apply to the property of a newly acquired subsidiary that was neither a named, nor an additional insured on the policy.

Van Buren v. Earl Ronald Poston &amp; Old Meadow, LLC, 97 Va. Cir. 229, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 335 (Loudoun County Nov. 30, 2017). Members of limited liability company found personally liable.  The fiction of a limited liability company (LLC) was to be set aside in an action and the managing officers and members of the LLC were to be held personally liab le for the acts of the LLC because the LLC operated to defraud the claimant and the LLC began operating as a sham in which the managing officers and members used the LLC as their personal bank account. Mid Atl. Eng'g Tech. Servs. v. Miller Hardman Design s, LLC, 86 Va. Cir. 337, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 74 (Chesapeake Mar. 25, 2013). Piercing corporate veil not warrante d.  Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate the extraordinary circumstances necessary to pierce the corporate veil of a business, as plaintiffs did not show unity of interes t between the business and either the LLC or its sole member, no evidence showed that the business failed to observe corporate formalities or that the LLC or member were de facto or equitable owners of the business, plus plaintiffs were sophisticated par ties and when they entered into a contract with the business, they took risks that are inherent in such a contract. Krauss v. Apex Custom Homes, LLC, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1203 (Loudoun County Nov. 26, 2019). Plaintiffs failed to pierce the corporate veil of the limited liability company (LLC); no evidence established that the LLCs sole member failed to abide by th e terms of the operating agreement, LLCs were permitted to have just one member, the LLC maintained a bank account separate from the personal account of the member, and the LLCs general ledger showed that it was well-capitalized. Krauss v. Apex Custo m Homes, LLC, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1203 (Loudoun County Nov. 26, 2019). Failure to state a claim.  Complaint which alleged that defendant was a principal owner of a Virginia limited liability company that gave an annexation notice to the Commission on Local Gov ernment, but which stated no facts from which the trial court could conclude that the corporate veil could be pierced, was insufficient to state a claim against the owner under § 15.2-3201, because pursuant to § 13.1-1019, a member of a lim ited libility company had no personal obligation for the limited liability companys liabilities. Wash. County v. City of Bristol, 63 Va. Cir. 450, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 323 (Washington County Dec. 12, 2003). Motion to set aside verdict granted.  Motion to set aside a verdict for the homeowners under § 8.01-430 was granted as: (1) the overwhelming evidence showed that the owners only contracted with the limited liability companies, and not member two individually; (2) both contracts, all of the change orders and the payments, with the exception of one check, noted the limited liability companies as parties or payees; (3) member two did not benefit pers onally from a check made payable to him; (4) there was no evidence that member two acted in any capacity other than as an agent for the limited liability companies when dealing with the owners; and (5) member two was not a proper party to the case under §§ 13.1-1019 and 13.1-1020. Horne v. Eco-Logic Constr., 85 Va. Cir. 106, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 68 (Chesterfield County July 2, 2012). Demurrer sustained.  Mere allegation that plaintiff wrote a few checks to the member personally did not rise to the level required for piercing the corporate veil of the limited liabi lity company, and there was no indication that the LLC was the alter ego of the member or a sham, plus nothing showed that the member controlled the LLC to perpetuate a crime; the demurrer was sustained. Van Buren v. Earl Ronald Poston &amp; Old Meadow, LLC, 97 Va. Cir. 229, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 335 (Loudoun County Nov. 30, 2017).

Derivative claim.  Member of a limited liability company (LLC) was able to pursue derivative claims on behalf of the LLC against the managing member of the LLC because the member an d the managing member were the only members of the LLC. Furthermore, the futility exception was applicable in that the managing member managed the financial affairs of LLC, and as the intended target of the action, it was reasonable to assume that a dema nd upon the managing member to pursue a claim on behalf of the LLC against the managing member would have been useless. Dixon v. Wilkerson (In re Wilkerson), 644 Bankr. 349, 2022 Bankr. LEXIS 2547 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2022). Insurance contract.  Coverage under an insurance policy did not exist for fire damage to a building owned by a subsidiary of an insured limited liability company because the policy s coverage-extension provision for newly acquired buildings could not be fairly read to apply to the property of a newly acquired subsidiary that was neither a named, nor an additional insured on the policy.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Managers personal liability.  Manager of a limited liability company subcontractor was not personally liable on a contract with a general contractor that incorrectly identified the limited lia bility company as a corporation because (1) the general contractor clearly thought the subcontractor was a corporation, not an individual, (2) the managers signature did not bind the limited liability company, as nothing showed the corporation listed existed, and the managers failure to identify the limited liability company on the contract did not create personal liability, as all parties clearly considered the signature to be a corporate act, (3) the contract did not provide for any partys personal liability, and (4) using Inc. on the contract was a misnomer that did not affect the parties intent.

Cause of action for rescission against companies and member.  Evidence was sufficient to find that the members acts on behalf of the companies were in the ordinary course of the business and the investor could seek a def ault judgment against them; considering the investors brain injury and the grossly inadequate consideration of .01 percent interest in exchange for the investors $190,000 investment, this was further support of the findings of undue influence, an d the investor established a cause of action for rescission against the companies, separate and apart from the member as an individual, on the grounds of fraud and undue influence.

CASE NOTES Observance of formalities.  Any informality in the way a limited liability company conducted its affairs did not justify ignoring subsection E of § 13.1-1022 and subsection C of § 13.1 -1027, which required the written consent of all the members to ratify the managers oral waiver of a members payment of a note representing his capital contribution. Gowin v. Granite Depot, LLC, 272 Va. 246, 634 S.E.2d 714, 2006 Va. LEXIS 90 (200 6). Membership found.  Articles of Organization of plaintiff limited liability company did not list any managers for the limited liability company and the limited liability company did not have an operating agreement, but since Virginia law dictated that the management of a limited liability company without an operating agreement vested in its members, one or more members of the limited liability company had to exist. The court turned to extrinsic evidence to determine the membership of the company, concluding that defendant debtor was one of two initial members because defendant was listed as an organizer, he signed numerous documents binding the company, he incurred significant expe nses on the companys behalf, he filed tax returns for the company, and he held himself out as president. Spain v. Williams, 455 Bankr. 485, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 1866 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2011). Fiduciary duties.  Although a state court determined that a debtor breached his fiduciary duty, it was not clear to a bankruptcy court, in the context of a dischargeability complain t under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4), in what capacity the debtor stood to a limited liability company (LLC), i.e., whether he was a managing member or a member of a member-managed LLC (subsection A of § 13.1-1022); what management duties, if any, he ha d (subsection A of § 13.1-1024.1); whether he was winding up the LLC; or whether the remaining members intended to continue in the business after his withdrawal. Thus, summary judgment on the issue of the nondischargeability of debts incurred as a res ult of defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity was denied, as the court could not determine whether or not he had fiduciary duties to the LLC and, under Virginia law, determined that he had no fiduciary duties to the other members. Credit Expert s, LLC v. Santos (In re Santos), No. 11-17783-BFK, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 3076 (Bankr. E.D. Va. July 2, 2012). Regarding a former members claims against a limited liability company (LLC), equitable subordination was not warranted, because the LLC did not demonstrate a sufficient factual basis for the court to find inequitable conduct or harm since, inter alia, the LLC did not prove violation of a fiduciary duty based on self-dealing or inaction. In re Virginia Broadband, LLC, 521 Bankr. 539, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 4638 (Ba nkr. W.D. Va. 2014), aff'd, 538 Bankr. 253, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122638 (W.D. Va. 2015). LLC s representative was not an applicant for insurance.  Insurance company wrongfully rescinded a limited liability companys insurance policy due to material misrepresentation after learning the representative who s igned the policy on behalf of the LLC had a criminal record for insurance fraud, because the term applicant refers only to the party seeking to purchase insurance. There was nothing in the record to suggest that the applicant was acting individua lly when he completed and signed the application on behalf of the LLC; the policy covered property owned by the LLC.

The m embers of a limited liability company may enter into any operating agreement to regulate or establish the affairs of the limited liability company, the conduct of its business and the relations of its members. A limited liability company is bound by its operating agreement whether or not the limited liability company executes the operating agreement. An operating agreement may contain any provisions regarding the affairs of a limited liability company and the conduct of its business to the extent that s uch provisions are not inconsistent with the laws of the Commonwealth or the articles of organization. An operating agreement may provide rights to any person, including a person who is not a party to the operating agreement, to the extent set forth in t he operating agreement. 2. If a limited liability company has only one member, an operating agreement shall be deemed to include: a. Any writing signed by the member, without regard to whether the writing constitutes an agreement, that relates to the affairs of the limited liability company and the conduct of its business. b. Any agreement, regardless of whether the agreement is in writing, between the member and the limited liability company, that relates to the affairs of the limited liability compan y and the conduct of its business, provided that the limited liability company has a manager that is a person other than the member. B. Adoption an d amendment. 1. An op erating agreement must initially be agreed to by all of the members. Unless the articles of organization or a written operating agreement specifically requires otherwise, an operating agreement need not be in writing. 2. If the articles of organization or an operating agreement does not provide for the manner by which an operating agreement may be amended, then all of the members must agree to any amen dment of an operating agreement. 3. If the articles of organization or the operating agreement provide for the manner by which an operating agreement may be amended, including by requiring the approval of a person who is not a party to the operating agreement or requiring the satisfaction of conditions, an operating agreement may be amended only in that manner or as otherwise permitted by law; provided that (i) the approval of any person may be waived by that person an d (ii) any conditions may be waived by all persons for whose benefit the conditions were intended. C. Enforcement of operating agreement. 1. A cou rt of equity may enforce an operating agreement by injunction or by such other relief that the court in its discretion determines to be fair and appropriate in the circumstances. 2. As an alternative to injunctive or other equitable relief, when the provisions of § 13.1-1047 are applicable, the court may order dissolution of the limited liability company.

CASE NOTES Assignment of financial interest onl y.  Circuit court did not err in holding that under the Virginia Limited Liability Company Act, § 13.1-1039, a daughter inherited only her fathers financial in terest in a limited liability company because the father was dissociated from the company upon his death under the Act, § 13.1-1040.1, and the daughter became a mere assignee under the Act, § 13.1-1040.2; it was not within the fathers power und er the companys operating agreement unilaterally to convey to the daughter his control interest and make her a member of the company upon his death because the agreement could not confer that power on him, and since the daughter was not a member of t he company, she lacked authority to remove the companys managing member and successor managing member. Ott v. Monroe, 282 Va. 403, 719 S.E.2d 309, 2011 Va. LEXIS 214 (2011) (Amendment to § 13.1-1039 by Acts 2013, c. 772, specifically overturned th is decision). Transfer of ownership interest.  Purported transfer of ownership interests was null and void because it exceeded the authority conferred by the operating agreement and was thus ultra vires. Becau se a person who was listed as a member in the operating agreement without consent did not thereby become a member, the operating agreement was effective without the persons agreement. Yeon K. Han v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors (In re Min Si k Kang), 664 Fed. Appx. 336, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 21313 (4th Cir. 2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Regulation of affairs.  Trial court granted the majority members motion for summary judgment on the issue of whether they had the power to revoke the law firms authority to repre sent the LLCs; the relevant operating agreement expressly granted that power to a majority of the membership seeking to exercise it and the majority members could exercise the power because they had a 60 percent majority of the membership interests in th e LLCs. Davis v. Davis, 72 Va. Cir. 523, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 10 (Arlington County Feb. 16, 2007). Enforcement of operating agreements.  Even if the traditional prerequisites for injunction were not met, the court was empowered by subsection C of § 13.1-1023 to enforce the provision in the LLC s operating agreements that required the managers resignation given that his decision not to resign was a clear violation of the agreements. CG Riverview, LLC v. 139 Riverview, LLC, 98 Va. Cir. 59, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 3 (Norfolk Jan. 9, 2018). Piercing corporate veil not warrante d.  Plaintiffs failed to pierce the corporate veil of the limited liability company (LLC); no evidence established that the LLCs sole member failed to abide by th e terms of the operating agreement, LLCs were permitted to have just one member, the LLC maintained a bank account separate from the personal account of the member, and the LLCs general ledger showed that it was well-capitalized.

No fiduciary duty found.  Regarding a former members claims against a limited liability company (LLC), equitable subordination was not warranted, because the LLC did not demonstrate a sufficient factual basis for the court to find inequitable conduct or harm since, inter alia, the court could not conclude that the former member breached the duty to refrain from self-dealing since the court could not find that such duty existed, and th e LLC did not prove the violation of the fiduciary duty of care.

CASE NOTES Protection only for exercise of business judgment in good faith.  A manager is entitled to protection from liability under subsection B only for acts related to the exercise of business judgment in good faith on behalf of the co rporation of which he was the director. Flippo v. CSC Assocs. III, L.L.C., 262 Va. 48, 547 S.E.2d 216, 2001 Va. LEXIS 84 (2001). Following legal advice regarding personal interests no defense.  A manager breached his fiduciary duty to a limited liability company notwithstanding his claim that he acted on the advice of counsel where the law firm in questi on had not been representing the company but the individual manager with respect to his estate planning; the fact that the advice upon which the manager acted involved acts that could legally be taken by a manager was irrelevant to the prerequisi te for protection under subsection B, namely, whether an act was taken with the intent of benefiting the company. Flippo v. CSC Assocs. III, L.L.C., 262 Va. 48, 547 S.E.2d 216, 2001 Va. LEXIS 84 (2001). Fiduciary capacity.  Although a state court determined that a debtor breached his fiduciary duty, it was not clear to a bankruptcy court, in the context of a dischargeability complain t under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4), in what capacity the debtor stood to a limited liability company (LLC), i.e., whether he was a managing member or a member of a member-managed LLC (subsection A of § 13.1-1022); what management duties, if any, he ha d (subsection A of § 13.1-1024.1); whether he was winding up the LLC; or whether the remaining members intended to continue in the business after his withdrawal. Thus, summary judgment on the issue of the nondischargeability of debts incurred as a res ult of defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity was denied, as the court could not determine whether or not he had fiduciary duties to the LLC and, under Virginia law, determined that he had no fiduciary duties to the other members.

Law firms conflict of interest in advising manager no defense.  The fact that a law firm may have had a conflict of interest because it represented both the manager and the company, did not affect the managers motivation f or seeking estate planning advice, the advice given by the law firm and the managers decision to follow that advice and, thus, was no defense to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty; the managers actions to further his estate planning goals based on advice directed toward that end alone violated his fiduciary duty and any conflict of interest under which the law firm operated was immaterial to the managers conduct.

Annotations CASE NOTES Fiduciary duties.  Although a state court determined that a debtor breached his fiduciary duty, it was not clear to a bankruptcy court, in the context of a dischargeability complain t under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4), in what capacity the debtor stood to a limited liability company (LLC), i.e., whether he was a managing member or a member of a member-managed LLC (subsection A of § 13.1-1022); what management duties, if any, he ha d (subsection A of § 13.1-1024.1); whether he was winding up the LLC; or whether the remaining members intended to continue in the business after his withdrawal. Thus, summary judgment on the issue of the nondischargeability of debts incurred as a res ult of defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity was denied, as the court could not determine whether or not he had fiduciary duties to the LLC and, under Virginia law, determined that he had no fiduciary duties to the other members.

The contrib utions of a member to a limited liability company may be in cash, property, or services rendered or a promissory note or other binding obligation to contribute cash or property or to perform services. B. Except as p rovided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, a member is obligated to the limited liability company to perform any enforceable promise to contribute cash or property or to perform services, even if he is unable to perform because of death, disability or any other reason. If a member does not make the required contribution of property or services, he is obligated at the option of the limited liability company to contribute cash equal to that portion of the value, as stated in the li mited liability company records required to be kept by § 13.1-1028, of such contribution that has not been made. C. Unless othe rwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property paid or distributed in violation of this chapter may be compromised only by consent of all the m embers. Notwithstanding the compromise, a creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on the original obligation may enforce the original obligation to the extent that, in extending credit, the creditor reason ably relied on the obligation of a member to make a contribution or return. A conditional obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property to a limited liability company may not be enforced unless the conditions of the obli gation have been satisfied or waived as to or by such member. Conditional obligations include contributions payable upon a discretionary call of a limited liability company prior to the time the call occurs. D. The article s of organization or an operating agreement may provide in writing that the interest of any member who fails to make any contribution that he is obligated to make shall be subject to specified penalties for, or specified consequences of, such failure. Su ch penalty or consequence may take the form of reducing or eliminating the defaulting members proportionate interest in a limited liability company, subordinating his interest in the limited liability company to that of nondefaulting members, a force d sale of his interest in the limited liability company, forfeiture of his interest in the limited liability company, the lending by other members of the amount necessary to meet his commitment, a fixing of the value of his interest in the limited liabil ity company by appraisal or by formula and redemption or sale of his interest in the limited liability company at such value, or other penalty or consequence. E. No promise by a member to contribute to a limited liability company is enforceable unless set out in a writing signed by the member. F. The contrib utions of a corporation to a limited liability company of which such corporation is a member may be in the form of an asset for which an application for a project requiring a certificate has been approved by the Commissioner pursuant to the provisions of Title 32.1. No further approval by such Commissioner shall be required as a condition to the validity of the members contribution of such an asset to the limited liability company if (i) both the member and the limited liability company have their p rincipal offices within the same city or county of the Commonwealth, (ii) such contributing member owns at least one-third of the membership interests of the limited liability company, and (iii) the assets contributed by such member to the limited liabil ity company comprise not more than ten percent of such assets of the member.

L. Rev. 273 (2007). CASE NOTES Contributions made by promissory not e.  As promissory note representing a members capital contribution to a limited liability company (LLC) was a demand note under § 8.3A-108(a), neither the LLC nor its manager had made a demand for payment, and the note had not been outstanding for an unreasonable period of time, the LLC had no authority under subsection D of § 13.1-1027 and the articles of organization to remove him as a member for failing to make a required contribution. Gowin v. Granite Depot, LLC, 272 Va. 246, 634 S.E.2d 714, 2006 Va. LEXIS 90 (2006). Failure to make contribution.  If a person becomes a member of a limited liability company by delivering a promissory note as allowed by an operating agreement, his failure to make payment on s uch note is a failure to make a contribution he is obligated to make under subsection D of § 13.1-1027. Gowin v. Granite Depot, LLC, 272 Va. 246, 634 S.E.2d 714, 2006 Va. LEXIS 90 (2006). Any informality in the way a limited liability company conducted its affairs did not justify ignoring subsection E of § 13.1-1022 and subsection C of § 13.1 -1027, which required the written consent of all the members to ratify the managers oral waiver of a members payment of a note representing his capital contribution. Gowin v. Granite Depot, LLC, 272 Va. 246, 634 S.E.2d 714, 2006 Va. LEXIS 90 (200 6). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Standing.  Member of limited liability company who became a member only after certain other members had allegedly failed to make required contributions lacked standing to pu rsue a derivative action against the limited liability company (nominally) and the other members. Pathak v. Trivedi, L.L.C., 64 Va. Cir. 21, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 52 (Chesterfield County Feb. 9, 2004). Member did not lack standing to bring his lawsuit against the manager of the limited liability company; although it was true, as the manager and limited liability company claimed that the member had not made payments on the promissory note that he signed as his capital contribution, the manager waived any obligation on the members part to make those payments because the manager told him that the limited liabi lity company would take care of the promissory note payments, which prompted the member to not make such payments; accordingly the membership of the member had not been terminated and he had standing to pursue his action against the manager.

Waiver of rights.  Because a limited liability company (LLC) and its manager claimed that the manager did not have the legal power to waive the LLCs rights under subsections C a nd E of this section, the court granted reconsideration as to the issue of whether there was a valid waiver.

CASE NOTES Member cannot unilaterally alienate personal control interest.  It is not possible for a member unilaterally to alienate his or her personal control interest in a limited liability company because the words unless otherwis e provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement in Virginia Limited Liability Company Act, § 13.1-1039, make it possible for a limited liability company to restrict the assignment of members financial interests since they modify the remainder of the sentence, which continues a membership in a limited liability company is assignable in whole or in part; the words unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement do not make it poss ible for a limited liability company to allow a member to assign his or her control interest because they do not modify the separate sentence, which states that an assignment does not entitle the assignee to participate in the management and affairs of t he limited liability company or to become or to exercise any rights of a member.

Assignment found.  In the absence of an operating agreement for plaintiff limited liability company or an explicit limitation on assignment in the articles of organization, the cour t found that one of the initial members of the limited liability company assigned his membership interest in the company, pursuant to subsection A of § 13.1-1039, to plaintiff claimant at some point in order to secure plaintiffs financial commitme nt to the company. Such an assignment was consistent with the representations the individual made to plaintiff about her membership in the company that prompted her to expend significant sums to fund the companys activities, and such an assignment wa s not inconsistent with the individuals later repudiation of his membership interest in the company. Spain v. Williams, 455 Bankr. 485, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 1866 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2011). Assignment of financial interest onl y.  Circuit court did not err in holding that under the Virginia Limited Liability Company Act, § 13.1-1039, a daughter inherited only her fathers financial in terest in a limited liability company because the father was dissociated from the company upon his death under the Act, § 13.1-1040.1, and the daughter became a mere assignee under the Act, § 13.1-1040.2; it was not within the fathers power und er the companys operating agreement unilaterally to convey to the daughter his control interest and make her a member of the company upon his death because the agreement could not confer that power on him, and since the daughter was not a member of t he company, she lacked authority to remove the companys managing member and successor managing member.

Whether option contract is executory.  Where an option contract giving a creditor the right to purchase debtors interest in a limited liability company formed under § 13.1-1000 et seq., the cont ract was held to be executory and debtors rejection notice pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 365(a) and Fed.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Estates interest in profits.  Although the sisters death converted her status as a member to that of an assignee, the administrator of the estate continued to have interest in the profits, losses and distributions of the limited liability company (LLC), and her estate was still subject to the derivative claims made on behalf of the LLC by her brother.

Except as o therwise provided in writing in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, an assignee of an interest in a limited liability company may become a member only by the consent of a majority of the member-managers (other than the assignor member ) of a manager-managed limited liability company of which one or more members is a manager, or by a majority vote of the members (other than the assignor member) of any other limited liability company. B. An assignee who has become a member has, to the extent assigned, the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the articles of organization, any operating agreement and this chapter. An assignee who becomes a member al so is liable for any obligations of his assignor to make contributions and return distributions as provided in Articles 5 (§ 13.1-1022 et seq.) and 6 (§ 13.1-1029 et seq.) of this chapter. However, an assignee who becomes a member is not obligated for liabilities of the assignor unknown to him at the time he or it became a member. C.

CASE NOTES Debtor in bankruptcy.  Because both plaintiff claimant and defendant husband were dissociated from a limited liability company when each party filed for bankruptcy under subdivision 6 a of § 13.1-1040.1, the parties only retained the economic rights of membership but did not retain other rights inherent to membership, including the right to wind up the affairs of the limited liability company, under § 13.1-1048; thus, there was n o one remaining to wind up the affairs of plaintiff limited liability company or to distribute interpled funds, and it was necessary for the court to appoint a liquidating trustee under subsection A of § 13.1-1048 for that purpose. Spain v. Williams, 455 Bankr. 485, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 1866 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2011). Assignment of financial interest onl y.  Circuit court did not err in holding that under the Virginia Limited Liability Company Act, § 13.1-1039, a daughter inherited only her fathers financial in terest in a limited liability company because the father was dissociated from the company upon his death under the Act, § 13.1-1040.1, and the daughter became a mere assignee under the Act, § 13.1-1040.2; an assignee of a financial interest has no control interest in a limited liability company without becoming a member.

Events causing members dissociation. Text Except as otherwise provided in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, a member is dissociated from a limited liability company upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 1. To th e extent resignation of a member is provided for in writing in the articles of organization or an operating agreement, the limited liability companys having notice of the members express will to resign as a member on a later date specified by the member in the notice or, if no later date is specified, the date of notice; 2. An event agreed to in the articles of organization or an operating agreement as causing the members dissociation; 3. The members expulsion pursuant to the articles of organization or an operating agreement; 4. The members expulsion by the unanimous vote of the other members if: a. It is unlawful to carry on the business of the limited liability company with that member; or b. There has been an assignment or transfer of all or substantially all of that members membership interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the members interest; 5. On application by the limited liability company or another member, the members expulsion by judicial determination because: a. The member engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the business of the limited liability company; b. The member willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the articles of organization or an operating agreement; or c. The member engaged in conduct relating to the business of the limited liability company which makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the member; 6. The members: a. Becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; b. Executing an assignment for the benefit of creditors; c. Seeking, consenting to, or acquiescing in the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of that member or of all or substantially all of that members property; or d.

In the case of a member who is an individual: a. The members death; b. The appointment of a guardian, committee or conservator for the member; or c. A judicial determination that the member has otherwise become incapable of performing the members duties under the articles of organization or an operating agreement; 8. In the case of a member that is a trust or is acting as a member by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, distribution of the trusts entire transferable interest in the limited lia bility company, but not merely by reason of the substitution of a successor trustee; 9. In the case of a member that is an estate or is acting as a member by virtue of being a personal representative of an estate, distribution of the estates entire transferable intere st in the limited liability company, but not merely by reason of the substitution of a successor personal representative; 10. Termination of a member who is not an individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, trust, or estate; 11. The expiration of ninety days after the limited liability company notifies a corporate member that it will be expelled because it has filed articles of dissolution or the equivalent , its existence has been terminated or its charter has been revoked, or its right to conduct business has been suspended by the jurisdiction of its incorporation, if there is no revocation of the certificate of dissolution or no reinstatement of its exis tence, its charter or its right to conduct business; or 12.

CASE NOTES Wrongful conduct.  Trial court properly ruled that the other company owner could be expelled from the limited liability company in which he was part owner, as the evidence showed th at he engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the business of the limited liability company; however, the trial court erred in also ordering that the limited liability company be dissolved as the record did not show that it was not reasonably practicable to carry on the business of the limited liability company.

Members bankruptcy.  There was no merit to Committee of Unsecured Creditors claim that Virginia LLCs Chapter 11 bankruptcy case had to be dismissed pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 1112 because member of LLCs board was disassociated from LLC pursuant to § 13.1-1040.1 when he declared Chapter 13 bankruptcy, such that the vote he cast in favor of placing LLC into bankruptcy was invalid; members economic and noneconomi c interests in LLC became property of his bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C.S. § 541 and revested in him pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. § 349 when his case was dismissed in September 2012, and vote he cast in November 2012, which placed LLC into bankruptcy was valid vote....</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_13.1-1041"><akn:num>§ 13.1-1041</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 2004, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>601. Annotations Editors note. Former § 13.1-1041, relating to rights of creditor, was enacted by Acts 1991, c. 168. § 13.1-1041.1. Members transferable interest subject to charging order. Text A. On applicat ion by a judgment creditor of a member or of a members assignee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the transferable interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the right to re ceive any distribution or distributions to which the judgment debtor would otherwise have been entitled in respect of the interest. B. A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtors transferable interest in the limited liability company. C. This chapte r does not deprive a member or a members assignee of a right under exemption laws with respect to the judgment debtors interest in the limited liability company. D. The entry o f a charging order is the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or of a members assignee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtors transferable interest in the limited liability company. E. No creditor of a member or of a members assignee shall have any right to obtain possession of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with respect to, the property of the limited liability company.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Judgment creditor not entitled to regular financial reports of LLC.  Because, strictly construed, Virginias limited liability company (LLC) laws would not allow the court to charge outside the scope of transferable interest wit h respect to the property of the LLC, the court would not be able to order the LLC to provide the judgment creditors with regular financial reports as that would go beyond the language of the statute; thus, to the extent the motion for entry of charging order asked the court to require additional annual financial documents, the motion could not be granted.

CASE NOTES Standing and rights of members.  Where plaintiff Virginia company sought to prevent arbitration of a dispute over the rights to proceeds of a patent infringement case, and defendant, a Columbian company, asserted counterclaims, arguing that it was a member in a limited liability company (LLC) formed with the Virginia company, to which the Virginia company had allegedly licensed the patent, the Columbian company was not asserting the rights of th e LLC derivatively and had no standing; even though the Columbian company could in certain circumstances have asserted the LLCs claim against the Virginia company on the LLCs behalf derivatively, the Columbian company had not done that in its cou nterclaims. Gen. Tech. Applications, Inc. v. Exro Ltda, 388 F.3d 114, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 22449 (4th Cir. 2004). Neither the Operating Agreement nor Virginia law conferred standing on the member to bring an adversary proceeding asserting, on behalf of the company, setoff rig hts against its members. This section prohibited derivative suits by a member of a limited liability company unless certain conditions were met, and the member had not demonstrated compliance with these conditions. Belle v. Shaia (In re Nedrick), No. 10- 34772-KLP, No. 16-03258-KLP, 2017 Bankr. LEXIS 886 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Mar. 31, 2017). Futility exception.  Circuit court erred in dismissing a mothers complaint alleging that her sons breached their fiduciary duties towards a limited liability company on the ground that she had not made a proper demand; the 2011 amendment to the statute does not abolish the futility exception to the demand requirement as established in case law preceding enactment of the statute. Davis v. MKR Dev., LLC, 295 Va. 488, 814 S.E.2d 179 , 2018 Va. LEXIS 63 (2018). With respect to the futility exception, the 2011 amendment has the effect of replacing an express textual provision in § 13.1-1042 with an incorporation by ref erence of a rule drawn from case law; the combined force of the textual provisions of subsection A of § 13.1-1001.1 and § 13.1-1044 lead to the conclusion that the General Assembly did not abrogate the futility exception when it amended § 13.1-1 042 in 2011. Davis v. MKR Dev., LLC, 295 Va. 488, 814 S.E.2d 179, 2018 Va. LEXIS 63 (2018). Member of a limited liability company (LLC) was able to pursue derivative claims on behalf of the LLC against the managing member of the LLC because the member an d the managing member were the only members of the LLC. Furthermore, the futility exception was applicable in that the managing member managed the financial affairs of LLC, and as the intended target of the action, it was reasonable to assume that a dema nd upon the managing member to pursue a claim on behalf of the LLC against the managing member would have been useless. Dixon v. Wilkerson (In re Wilkerson), 644 Bankr. 349, 2022 Bankr. LEXIS 2547 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2022). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to submit demand letter.  Limited liability company (LLC) member failed to comply with the statute because he never submitted a demand letter to the LLC; the statute clearly allows a suit prior to the ninety days in the event of an allegation of irreparable injury, but the same is not true on the issue of futility. Wright v. Dee, 87 Va. Cir. 148, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 168 (Hanover County Oct. 7, 2013). Futility.  Because a member and a manager of a limited liability company could not together refuse to act upon a request that certain derivative claims be asserted against t he manager, the company and the member lodged viable derivative corporation claims under this section and § 13.1-672.1 against the manager based on futility. Schrager v. Isquith, 69 Va. Cir. 31, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 349 (Richmond May 3, 2005). Conversion.  Because the action of a limited liability companys co-principal amounted to conversion, and even arguably embezzlement, pursuant to §§ 13.1-1040.1(5)(a) , (b), (c), 13.1-1042, and 13.1-1044, the co-principal was dissociated. Schrager v. Isquith, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 124 (Richmond County July 18, 2006). Standing and rights of members.  Without any facts showing that the investor had a personal contract with the artists, he had no standing to sue. Since the invetor brought suit against the limite d liability company member in his personal capacity rather than in a derivative suit and he failed to show that he complied with § 13.1-1042, the demurrer was sustained. Schur v. Sprenkle, 84 Va. Cir. 418, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 132 (Richmond Apr. 11, 20 12).

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Standing to maintain suit.  Circuit court had to look to Delaware law, where a limited liability company (LLC) was organized, to determine whether it could maintain a suit against a county a lleging erroneous tax assessments in its name, and as there had been no trustee or receiver appointed by the Delaware Court of Chancery under Delaware law, the LLC could not continue to prosecute the suit.

Cancellation.  Limited liability companys (LLC) suit did not survive cancellation of its status as a Delaware entity because the statute did not apply; subsection C spoke on ly to actions against a foreign LLC and would allow the LLC to defend itself subsequent to its cancellation in any suit brought against it prior to the cancellation, but it did not give the LLC the power to maintain a suit as plaintiff.

If the foreign limited liability company fails to file the statement of change on or befo re the last day of the second month immediately following the month in which the impending cancellation notice was mailed, the foreign limited liability company shall automatically cease to be authorized to transact business in the Commonwealth and its c ertificate of registration shall be automatically canceled as of that day. C. The automat ic cancellation of a foreign limited liability companys certificate of registration constitutes the appointment of the clerk of the Commission as the foreign limited liability companys agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cau se of action arising during the time the foreign limited liability company was registered to transact business in the Commonwealth. Service of process on the clerk of the Commission under this subsection is service on the foreign limited liability compan y and shall be made on the clerk in accordance with § 12.1-19.1. D.
