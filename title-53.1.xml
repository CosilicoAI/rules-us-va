At its regular session of 1980, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to make a study of Title 53 and report its findings to the Governor and General Assembly in the form of a recodification of that title. In January of 1982, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 53. This report, which was published as Senate Document No. 19 of the 1982 Session, contains revisers notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commissions draft of the revision of Title 53, as amended by the General Assembly, became c. 636 of the Acts of 1982 . It repeals Title 53 of the Code and enacts in lieu thereof a new Title 53.1. In addition to its revision by c. 636, former Title 53 was amended by certain other acts passed at the 1982 Session. As required by § 30-152 and Acts 1982, c. 636, cl. 7, these amendments have been incorporated into new Title 53.1. Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 53 and earlier statutes.

That the rules and regulations of the State Board of Corrections and the Virginia Parole Board in effect on the effective date of this act shall continue i n effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated under this act. 4. That this recodification of Title 53 as Title 53.1 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any member of a board, council, co mmittee or other appointed body referred to in Title 53.1, and each such officer and member shall continue to serve the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 53. 7. That this act shall be deemed to have been enacted prior to any other act enacted in the 1982 regular session of the General Assembly, and any act purporti ng to amend and reenact any law contained in Title 53 or Title 53.1 of the Code of Virginia is deemed to be added to, amendatory of, or a repealer of, as the case may be, any corresponding law contained in this act; provided, that effect shall be given t o such other or subsequent act only to the extent of any apparent changes in the law as it existed prior to the commencement of such session. Acts 1995, c. 811, cl. 2, effective April 6, 1995, provides: That in keeping with the purposes of this act and to induce eligible state employees to voluntari ly resign from employment with the Commonwealth, any full-time employee of the Commonwealth (i) whose position is covered by the Virginia Personnel Act (§ 2.1-110 et seq.

The director shall report monthly to the Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security and the Department of Planning and Budget on the number of inmates housed in the state co rrectional system, the number of inmate beds available, and the number of offenders housed in local and regional jails that meet the criteria set out in § 53.1-20 A. and B. The 1997 amendment rewrote this section. The 2020 amendments. The 2020 amendment by c. 526 added subsection F. CASE NOTES Editors note. Many of the cases annotated below were decided under former Title 53. The equal protection clause prohibits arbitrary differences in treatment given to state prisoners held for more than 90 days after sentencing in local jails and that accorded similarly situated inmates in state facilities. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). A state prisoner should not be subject to substantially worse conditions of confinement merely because the Virginia Department of Corrections happens to place him in a local jail, rather than in a state institution; such a treatment differential qualifies as arbitrary. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). Receiving unit.  When read in conjunction with the statute, it appears that a receiving unit is merely a generic term for the facility where a person is first received  into Department of Corrections custody; it does not refer to the specific facility where a person is assigned to serve his or her sentence. Duhart v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 256 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2019). Any failure of the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) to transfer defendant from local jail to state prison amounted only to a mere procedural violation which did not implicate the Due Process Clause; assuming that this section did mandate that all felons be transferred from local jail into the custody of the VDOC within sixty days o f conviction, such requirement is only a procedural device governing the location of a prisoner. For constitutional purposes, confinement is confinement, whether it be in a local jail, state prison, another states prison, or federal prison. Counts v. Newhart, 951 F. Supp. 579, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18235 (E.D. Va. 1996), aff'd, 116 F.3d 1473, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 22052 (4th Cir. 1997). Precise equality between long-term felons held in Commonwealth and local jails is not required; only substantial equality is mandated. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). City jails are not required to adopt the Virginia Department of Corrections procedural regulations when holding a long-term felon for the Commonwealth, as their application would not further the felons equal protection rights and would constitute an undue intrusion into the jails administration. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185 , 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). But the Virginia Department of Corrections has sufficient authority to compel local jails to comply with its substantive regulations in holding long-term felons. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). Delays in classification for state prisoners held in the city jail must be no longer tha n those encountered by inmates of state facilities. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). Privileges, opportunities, etc., of long-term felons in local jails.  The Virginia Department of Corrections must provide long-term felons held in local jails with all of the work opportunities mandated by state law and VDOC regulat ions, as well as the same technical training, visitation privileges, recreation opportunities, and counseling services, and equalize the overcrowding. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). Inmates sentenced to state incarceration who remained placed in a county jail more than 60 days after their sentences were imposed, rather than being transferred to state facilities, had no equal protection claim arising from the allegedly inferior conditions of their confinement, as compared to state facilities, because they were not similarly situated to those housed in state facilities, and if they were simila rly situated to those housed in state facilities, they were not a suspect class, their incarceration status was not an immutable characteristic, nor an invidious basis of classification, and there was a rational relationship between their confinement in a local facility and the legitimate state interests of relieving overcrowding in state facilities and preserving uniformity of treatment between inmates who were incarcerated together. Khaliq v. Angelone, 72 Fed. Appx. 895, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 14548 (4t h Cir. 2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Procedural violation not a vehicle for constitutional relief.  Because the time limit in subsection B of § 53.1-20 for transferring prisoners from a county jail to the state prison was merely a procedural device, it was no t a vehicle for Constitutional relief; therefore, defendants petition for a writ of mandamus was dismissed. Commonwealth v. Wade, 64 Va. Cir. 339, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 75 (Fairfax County Apr. 7, 2004). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Medical costs.  Compensation Board is required to reimburse local correctional facilities for the medical costs of all inmates who are State Responsible while those inmat es are in the temporary custody of a local correctional facility, beginning on the sixty-first day after notice of the commitment order is provided. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable C.T. Woody, Jr., Sheriff, City of Richmond, 15-079, 2016 Va. AG LEXIS 16 (9/1/16). Change of sentences from death to life imprisonment is self-executing.  Following the abolishment of the death penalty, the Virginia Department of Corrections is required to administratively recalculate the sentences of inmates senten ced to death to reflect the change to life imprisonment according to the provisions of the law.

Peter son v. Davis, 421 F. Supp. 1220, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13025 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd, 562 F.2d 48 (4th Cir. 1977). Nor to remain in a particular prison.  Under Virginia law, prisoners have no liberty interest in remaining in a particular prison. Ward v. Johnson, 437 F. Supp. 1053, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13537 (E.D. Va. 1977). State prisoners liberty interest in remaining in a particular correctional facility was not protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment be cause the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections had the authority to transfer inmates into and between correctional facilities. Lamp v. Wallace, No. 3:04CV317, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43932 (E.D. Va. Mar. 23, 2005), aff'd, 205 Fed. Appx. 151, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 25472 (4th Cir. 2006). Equal protection does not require the Virginia Department of Corrections to transfer all felons into Commonwealth facilities from local jails, as such transfer is strictly within the discretion of the department and cannot be demanded by prisoners. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). When the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC) holds an inmate in a local jail more than 90 days, it is leasing a prison space from the local government, which is permissible as long as the VDOC treats the leased space as part of the state correctional system and requires the local authorities to confine the prisoner in accordance with the substantive regulations applying to inmates of state facilities.

The furlough program is a statutory creation. Brooks v. Dunn, 376 F. Supp. 976, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8354 (W.D. Va. 1974). A prisoner does not have a constitutional right to a furlough. Brooks v. Dunn, 376 F. Sup p. 976, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8354 (W.D. Va. 1974). There is no right under the general provisions of the Constitution itself for prisoners to participate in furlough and work-release programs. Durkin v. Taylor, 44 4 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). And there is no statutory ri ght to a furlough.  The plain language of the State statutory provisions on furloughs reveals neither a right to receive a furlough nor to be free from revocation of a furlough that has been granted, save under certain conditions. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). But prisoners are enti tled to equal protection.  Prison inmates are entitled to equal protection of the law, and even a discretionary determination such as a denial of furlough must comport with this prescriptio n. Brooks v. Dunn, 376 F. Supp. 976, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8354 (W.D. Va. 1974). A proper exercise of discretion by the appropriate official is not reviewable under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983. Brooks v. Dunn, 376 F. Supp. 976, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8354 (W.D. Va. 1974). In order to establish a constitutional deprivation cognizable under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983, a prisoner must show that the furlough committee determination was so arbitrary or capricious as to be devoid of due process or that the determination was designed as a form of punishment. Brooks v. Dunn, 376 F. Supp. 976, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8354 (W .D. Va. 1974). No liberty interest created.  Statutes creating such discretionary privileges as this section do not create any liberty interest entitling the inmate to federal due process protections. Hipes v. Braxton, 878 F. Supp. 56, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3805 (W.D. Va. 1995). This section sets no mandatory criteria under which a furlough must be granted, but rath er states that the director may, in his discretion, grant furloughs. Hipes v. Braxton, 878 F. Supp. 56, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3805 (W.D. Va. 1995). A commendable record while incarcerated is not the only factor considered by the furloug h committee in judging furlough applications. Brooks v. Dunn, 376 F. Supp. 976, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8354 (W.D. Va. 1974). Commission of crime not sole ground for denial or revocation of furlough.  Provision now codified in § 53.1-38 that prisoners who have committed major crimes while on furloughs shall not be granted additional furloughs does not amount to a command that furloughs are to be denied or revoked only in such cases. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). Furlough may be summarily revoked.  A regional superintendent for work-release did not deprive prisoner of any liberty or property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment when he summarily revoked h is furlough and suspended him from participation in work-release. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). A finding that correction officials could not, consistently with the Constitution, revoke a single furlough and temporarily suspend participation in a work-releas e program without prior notice and a hearing would place the courts astride the day-to-day functioning of State prisons and involve the judiciary in issues and discretionary decisions that are not the business of federal judges. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). Cancellation of furlough, etc., for use of vulgar language not violative of right of free speech.  Cancellation of a prisoners furlough, two days suspension from participation in work-release program and disciplinary action which was imposed directly on acc ount of vulgar and insolent language used by the prisoner on the phone to a corrections official did not violate his right of free speech as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U .S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). Distinction between subsections D and E is element of willfulness; a felony offense must be willful. Every other failure to return within the prescribed time to the designated location is a misdemeanor unless the prisoner establishes that the failure to return was authorized or with just cause. Lambert v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 360, 367 S .E.2d 745, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2737, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (1988). To obtain a felony conviction under subsection D, the Commonwealth was required to prove the element of willfulness. Lambert v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 360, 367 S.E.2d 745, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2737, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (1988). Plain language of this section requires Commonwealth to prove willfulness beyond reasonable doubt. That element of the crime will not be inferred from an absence of evidence to the contrary. Lambert v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 360, 367 S.E.2d 745, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2737, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (1988). Mere failure to notify police or to call does not establish willful failure. When a crim inal offense is defined by a willful failure to perform a certain act, it is not sufficient to support a conviction merely to establish that the accused did not do a certain act, without establishing circumstances that warrant an inference that the failu re to act was intentional or by design. In the absence of evidence explaining inmates failure to return or to notify the local police, or showing his whereabouts, or detailing how and when he was returned to custody, the Commonwealth did not prove be yond a reasonable doubt that he acted willfully. Lambert v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 360, 367 S.E.2d 745, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2737, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (1988). Leaving designated area was escape .  Where parole officer ordered defendant to remain in the lobby of the parole office, warning that noncompliance could result in a charge of escape, he spec ifically established new and more restrictive limits of confinement governing defendants furlough; defendants subsequent departure from the premises therefore constituted an escape in violation of this section.

For article on right of prisoner access to the courts, see 22 U. Rich. L. Rev. 19 (1987). CASE NOTES Editors note. Many of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. As sistance of counsel as viable alternative to law library.  In an action to determine whether prisoners were denied adequate legal assistance in the form of a law library, the court held that an attorneys legal assista nce, which was provided for in accordance with this section, was a viable alternative to the requirement of a law library. Almond v. Davis, 639 F.2d 1086, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 20394 (4th Cir. 1981). Correctional officials constitutional obligation to inmates not afforded access to an adequate law library is satisfied by making available the assistance of counsel pursuant to this section. Peterson v. Davis, 421 F. Supp. 1220, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13025 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd, 562 F.2d 48 (4th Cir. 1977). Although the Virginia attorney assistance program would unquestionably benefit from the participation of additional lawyers, the program is basically an acceptabl e alternative to an adequate legal research facility. Peterson v. Davis, 421 F. Supp. 1220, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13025 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd, 562 F.2d 48 (4th Cir. 1977). Prisoners not denied access to courts when notified of availability of counsel.  A prisoner who had no access to a law library as a result of his confinement in maximum security and a prisoner who had access to a law library only three times a month were not denied adequate access to legal materials or to the courts. So long as prisoners are notified of the availability of counsel for consultation under this section, the States system adequately insures that prisoners will have their clai ms reviewed and presented to the courts. Williams v. Leeke, 584 F.2d 1336, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 8621 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 911, 99 S. Ct. 2825, 61 L. Ed. 2d 276, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 2280 (1979). Rule prohibiting a prisoner from seeking or receiving help from fellow inmates does not interfere with his right of access to the courts, for even if the State is required to provide a prisoner with some form of personal assistance in his legal matters, the provision for a court-appointed attorney fulfills that obligation. Graham v. Hut to, 437 F. Supp. 118, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (E.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 571 F.2d 575 (4th Cir. 1978). Prisoners right of access to legal materials of courts held violated.  Where a prisoners access to the law library in the Richmond City Jail was restricted to 45 minutes at a time, three days a week, with no research assistance p rovided, and counsel for the city could neither assure the Court that the prisoner had a right to seek assistance of counsel under this section, nor that notice of such a right, if it did exist, was posted at the jail, the prisoner was denied his right o f access to legal materials and to the courts. Williams v. Leeke, 584 F.2d 1336, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 8621 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 911, 99 S. Ct. 2825, 61 L. Ed. 2d 276, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 2280 (1979). Prisoners bald assertion insufficient to raise doubt as to effectiveness of counsel.  Prisoners bald assertion that the court-appointed attorney for inmates represents the interests of the prison system, unsupported by facts, is insufficient to raise genuine doubts as to the effectiveness of the legal counseling provided by the attorney. Graham v. Hutto, 437 F. Supp. 118, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13878 (E.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 571 F.2d 575 (4th Cir. 1978). Duties of attorneys under section.  Attorneys appointed under this section are to advise an inmate as to problems pertaining to his incarceration. Particularly, the attorneys are to aid in the prepa ration of writs of habeas corpus and suits relating to the conditions of confinement. These attorneys are expected to informally present an inmates grievance relating to conditions of incarceration to prison officials prior to taking any formal adver sarial action. Attorneys appointed under the program do not represent individual inmates, but merely advise and assist them. Peterson v. Davis, 421 F. Supp. 1220, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13025 (E.D. Va. 1976), aff'd, 562 F.2d 48 (4th Cir. 1977). As to immunity of attorney appointed under this section from duty by prisoner alleging a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, see Minns v. Paul, 542 F.2d 899, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 7640 (4th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1102, 97 S. Ct. 1127, 51 L. Ed. 2d 552, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 771 (1977). But see Hall v. Quillen, 631 F.2d 1154, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 13044 (4th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1141, 102 S. Ct. 999, 71 L. Ed. 2d 293, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 327 (1982). § 53.1-40.01.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  The portion of this section permitting the Director of the Department of Corrections to use interest earned on the investment of funds belonging to prisoners for the benefit of the prisoners did not result in an unconstitutional taking without just compensation, where the interest was returned on a proportionate basis to the various correctional facilities and used by them to purchase items for the benefit of all prisoners, such as library books, newspaper and magazine subscriptions, recreation equipment, items for family visiting days and other collectively used extras. Washlefske v.

Because an inmates limited right to the funds in his prison accounts does not derive from any traditional principle of common law but from a Virginia statute, he is not deprived of any property, for the purposes of a takings clause analysis, when the department of corrections follows the dictates of this statute in using the interest generated from those accounts.

Use of interest on inmat es funds not a taking.  The director of corrections use of the interest on inmate funds held in a trust account for the benefit of the prisoners under his care pursuant to this secti on does not constitute a taking under the constitution for which the government is required to provide just compensation.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. A prisoner has no right to participate in a work-release program. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F . Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). There is no right under the general provisions of the Constitution itself for prisoners to participate in furlough and work-release programs. Durkin v. Taylor, 44 4 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). Nor any expectation of non-terminati on.  A prisoner has no expectation that his participation in a work-release program can be terminated only under certain limited, defined conditions under the State st atutory scheme regulating work-release. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). Summary suspension, etc., not unconstitutional.  A regional superintendent for work-release did not deprive prisoner of any liberty or property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment when he summarily revoked h is furlough and suspended him from participation in work-release. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). A finding that correction officials could not, consistently with the Constitution, revoke a single furlough and temporarily suspend participation in a work-releas e program without prior notice and a hearing would place the courts astride the day-to-day functioning of State prisons and involve the judiciary in issues and discretionary decisions that are not the business of federal judges. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). Suspension from work-release, etc., for use of vulgar language not violative of right of free speech.  Cancellation of a prisoners furlough, two days suspension from participation in work-release program and disciplinary action imposed directly on account of vu lgar and insolent language used by the prisoner on the phone to a corrections official did not violate prisoners right of free speech as guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Durkin v. Taylor, 444 F. Supp. 879, 1977 U .S. Dist. LEXIS 13007 (E.D. Va. 1977). Employed convicts entitled to workmens compensation.  There is nothing in this section to indicate that once a convict has started his days work he is controlled in his activities other than by his employer. His pay is the same as other employees doing like work, and he is obviously afforded the benefits of the Virginia Workers Compensation law as is the case with other employees. Owens v. Swift Agric. &amp; Chem. Corp., 477 F. Supp. 91, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98 87 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 612 F.2d 1309 (4th Cir. 1979). § 53.1-60.1. Duties of Director in collecting court-imposed debt. Text Upon receipt of a valid court order or judgment against a person confined in a state correctional facility, the Director or his designee shall satisfy, to the extent po ssible, the amount required to be paid by the order or judgment from the inmates trust account. The Director shall promulgate regulations governing the process of collecting funds from inmates to be used for (i) the satisfaction of judgments or order s granting monetary relief or imposing fines or other monetary sanctions or (ii) payment of court costs and fees.

The jailer shall keep a (i) record describing each person committed to jail, the terms of confinement, for what offense or cause he was committed, and when received into jail; (ii) record of each prisoner; and (iii) written policy stating the criteria for and condi tions of earned credit in the facility and the revocation of such credit.Unless he is serving a mandatory minimum sentence of confinement, each prisoner sentenced to 12 months or less for a misdemeanor or any combination of misdemeanors shall earn good c onduct credit at the rate of one day for each one day served, including all days served while confined in jail prior to conviction and sentencing, in which the prisoner has not violated the written rules and regulations of the jail.Prisoners eligible for parole under § 53.1-151, 53.1-152 or 53.1-153 shall earn good conduct credit at a rate of 15 days for each 30 days served with satisfactory conduct.The jailer may grant the prisoner additional credits for performance of institutional work assignments , participation in classes, or participation in local work force programs, if available at the facility, at the rate of five days for every 30 days served. The time so deducted shall be allowed to each prisoner for such time as he is confined in jail.

Criminal Procedure, §§ 83, 92. CASE NOTES Eligibility to earn good conduct credit prior to conviction and sentencing.  Because eligibility for parole cannot be determined until after the time of conviction and sentencing, petitioners did not qualify before that time as prisone r[s] not eligible for parole within the meaning of this section as it then read, and, therefore, were not eligible to earn good conduct credit pursuant to the said section at the rate of one day for each one day served while confined in jail prior to conviction and sentencing.

Use of habeas in challenging withholding of good conduct credits.  A writ of habeas corpus is the proper vehicle for challenging the length of confinement resulting from good conduct credits being withheld. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Determination of sentencing credits.  Jailer of all local correctional facilities was designated as the repository for all of the information needed to determine sentence credits; the court was withou t jurisdiction to determine the issue of defendants claimed sentence credit, as this decision rested solely within the discretion of the Department of Corrections and its designees. Commonwealth v. Bertini, 68 Va. Cir. 255, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 118 (F airfax County July 15, 2005). Unused jail credit applied to senten ce.  Section 53.1-187 required that the days of unused jail credit be applied to defendants sentence arising out of a detainer from another county, notwithstanding the sheriffs policy of reserving unused jail credit for potential future revocations, because the statute only required jail credit on the offense for which defendant was awaiting trial. Commonwealth v. Carter, 93 Va. Cir. 129, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 4 2 (Fairfax County Apr. 4, 2016). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Because § 53.1-116 applies solely to prisoners serving criminal sentences, the sheriff or jail superintendent responsible for determining the length of a jail inmates term of confinement must ascertain whether the individual is bein g detained pursuant to a civil or a criminal contempt finding and award only those prisoners serving criminal contempt sentences good conduct credits. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable E. Stuart Kitchen, Jr., Sheriff for Sussex County, 04- 005 (3/3/04). Good conduct credit.  Prisoner charged as a juvenile but sentenced under § 16.1-284 is eligible for the good conduct credit established in § 53.1-116 if the offense for which he is being sentenced would be classified as a misdemeanor if committed by an adult. However, if the offense for which he is being sentenced would be classified as a felony if committed by an adult, the good conduct credit established in § 53.1-116 does not apply. If the prisoner is sentenced for violating a court order or the terms of probation or parole, the nature of the underlying conviction (felony or misdemeanor) governs eligibility for good conduct credit. See opinion of Attorney General to The H onorable Robert L. Bushnell, Judge, Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, City of Martinsville and Counties of Henry and Patrick, 14-016, 2014 Va.

C. The sheriff shall have the sole responsibility for the identity of the deputies designated for courtroom security. D. Any county or city, through its governing body, may assess a sum not in excess of $20 as part of the costs in each criminal or traffic case in its district or circuit court in which the defendant is convicted of a violation of any statute or ordinance.

See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Paula N. Wyatt, Sheriff for the City of Hopewell, 02-016 (2/20/02). Judges a uthority pertaining to courtroom security.  A district court judge may designate the number, type, and working schedules of courtroom security deputies only by agreement with the sheriff and then only withi n the parameters established by the relevant appropriation act; for cases presenting substantial security risks, a judge may order a sheriff to provide additional security, but may not designate the specific personnel. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Robert J. McCabe, Sheriff for the City of Norfolk, 04-072 (10/7/04). While the chief judge and, collectively, the judges of a judicial circuit, do possess legal authority to establish rules regarding courthouse security, such power may not be delegated to a circuit court administrator. The chief judge and, collectively, the circuit judges, possess the legal authority to establish a general rule that cellular telephones are permitted in the courthouse. Nonetheless, the sheriff poss esses the legal authority to take action in any specific instance in which a cellular telephone causes a disturbance, or otherwise endangers public safety within the courthouse. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable William O. Watson, Sheriff, City of Portsmouth, 12-065, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 48 (7/12/13). Fees assessed for courtroom security, which are subsequently appropriated by the governing body to the sheriffs office, may only be used to compensate a deputy sheriffs salary for the time ac tually spent performing duties related to courthouse security and to fund equipment and other personal property related to courthouse security. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Franklin P. Slavin, Jr., County Attorney for Bland County, 04-077 (10/1 9/04). Courthouse security.  While judges and sheriffs should work together to resolve any issues or concerns about courthouse security, judges retain rule-making authority over courthouse se curity, and the sheriff is responsible for enforcing the rules and responding to any security threats or disturbances.

CASE NOTES Right to work release.  Prisoners claim that a regional jail authority, a city, and the jail officials violated his constitutionally protected right to participate in a work release program would fail because under subsection A of § 53.1-131, the state courts order sentencing the prisoner did not make payment of costs and fines the only condition for work release, but contemplated that jail officials were to make an independe nt determination of a prisoners eligibility for work release.

Only prior c ommitments interrupted by a persons being at liberty, or resulting from the commission of a felony while in a correctional facility of the Commonwealth, of any other state or of the United States, shall be included in determining the number of times such person has been convicted, sentenced and committed for the purposes of subdivisions 2, 3 and 4 of subsection A. At liberty as used herein shall include not only freedom without any legal restraints, but shall also include release pending tri al, sentencing or appeal, or release on probation or parole or escape. In the case of terms of imprisonment to be served consecutively, the total time imposed shall constitute the term of the imprisonment; in the case of terms of imprisonment to be serve d concurrently, the longest term imposed shall be the term of imprisonment. In any case in which a parolee commits an offense while on parole, only the sentence imposed for such offense and not the sentence or sentences or any part thereof from which he was paroled shall constitute the term of imprisonment.The Department of Corrections shall make all reasonable efforts to determine prior convictions and commitments of each inmate for the enumerated offenses.

Any person convicted of three separate felony offenses of manufacturing, selling, giving, distributing or possessing with the intent to manufacture, sell, give or distribute a controlled substance, when such offenses were not part of a common act, transaction or s cheme, and who has been at liberty as defined in this section between each conviction, shall not be eligible for parole. C. Any person sentenced to life imprisonment for the first time shall be eligible for parole after serving fifteen years, except that if such sentence was for a Class 1 felony violation or the first degree murder of a child under the age of eight in violation of § 18.2-32, he shall be eligible for parole after serving twenty-five years, unless he is ineligible for parole pursuant to subsection B1 or B2.

Many of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Under Virginia law a prisoner has a right to be considered for parole. Franklin v. Shield s, 569 F.2d 784, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 13217 (4th Cir. 1978). And this right is protected by statutory safeguards. Franklin v. Shields, 569 F.2d 784, 1 978 U.S. App. LEXIS 13217 (4th Cir. 1978). The parole eligibility statute in effect on the date of the offenses for which the felon is convicted is the statute that controls the convicts eligibility for parole. Brown v. Virginia Dep't of Cors., 886 F. Supp. 531, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7201 (E.D. Va. 1995). Subsection B violates Constitution.  Subsection B expressly rescinded preexisting eligibility  and to that extent runs afoul of the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const., Art. 1, § 10. Fender v. Thompson, 883 F.2d 303, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 12824 (4th Cir. 1989). Under the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const., Art. 1, § 10, subsection B cannot be applied to revoke the petitioners preexisting eligibility for parole on the life sentence imposed in connection with his 1973 convictions. Fender v. Thompson, 883 F.2d 303, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 12824 (4th Cir. 1989). Subsection B did not violate ex post facto clause as applied to petitioner.  Subsection B was enacted before petitioner committed the acts for which he was now incarcerated without parole. Petitioner was on notice that he would not be elig ible for parole if convicted of three or more acts defined in the statute. Thus, subsection B did not violate the ex post facto clause as applied to petitioner...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_53.1-152"><akn:num>§ 53.1-152</akn:num><akn:heading>Eligibility of persons sentenced for combinations of felony and misdemeanor offenses</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Every person who is convicted of a felony and also convicted of a misdemeanor and sentenced and committed for the same under the laws of this Commonwealth or of its pol itical subdivisions shall be eligible for parole on the combination of said sentences in the same manner as provided in § 53.1-151.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, in the case of a parole revocation, if such person is otherwise eligible for parole, the Board shall review and decide his case no later than that part of the calendar ye ar one year subsequent to the part of the calendar year in which he was returned to a facility as provided in § 53.1-161. Thereafter, his case shall be reviewed as specified in this section. The Board, in addition, may review the case of any prisoner eligible for parole at any other time and may review the case of any prisoner prior to that part of the year otherwise specified.

Text The Director is authorized to determine those prisoners who may be suitable parole risks and whose interests and those of society will be served by their early parole r elease and to recommend such prisoners to the Parole Board for early parole consideration. In making such recommendation, the Director shall take into account the prisoners criminal history record, mental and physical condition, employability, instit utional adjustment and such other factors as may be appropriate, including the risk of violence to others. The case of any such prisoner so recommended may be reviewed by the Parole Board prior to such prisoners date of eligibility for parole. Upon a ppropriate review the Parole Board may release on parole prior to the date of eligibility for parole any prisoner so recommended by the Director. However, no prisoner shall be released until he has served at least one-fourth of the term of imprisonment i mposed, or until he has served twelve years of the term of imprisonment imposed if one-fourth of the term of imprisonment imposed is more than twelve years, except as such time is reduced by any other provision of law.

No person s hall be released on parole by the Board until a thorough investigation has been made into the prisoners history, physical and mental condition and character and his conduct, employment and attitude while in prison. The Board shall also determine that his release on parole will not be incompatible with the interests of society or of the prisoner. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to persons released on parole pursuant to § 53.1-159. B. An investig ation conducted pursuant to this section shall include notification that a victim may submit to the Virginia Parole Board evidence concerning the impact that the release of the prisoner will have on such victim. This notification shall be sent to the las t address provided to the Board by any victim of a crime for which the prisoner was incarcerated. If additional victim research is necessary, electronic notification shall be sent to the attorney for the Commonwealth and the director of the victim/witnes s program, if one exists, of the jurisdiction in which the offense occurred. The Board shall endeavor diligently to contact the victim prior to making any decision to release any inmate on discretionary parole. The victim of a crime for which the prisone r is incarcerated may present to the Board oral or written testimony concerning the impact that the release of the prisoner will have on the victim, and the Board shall consider such testimony in its review. Once testimony is submitted by a victim, such testimony shall remain in the prisoners parole file and shall be considered by the Board at every parole review. The victim of a crime for which the prisoner is incarcerated may submit a request in writing or by electronic means to the Board to be no tified of (i) the prisoners parole eligibility date and mandatory release date as determined by the Department of Corrections, (ii) any parole-related interview dates, and (iii) the Boards decision regarding parole for the prisoner. The victim ma y request that the Board only notify the victim if, following its review, the Board is inclined to grant parole to the prisoner, in which case the victim shall have forty-five days to present written or oral testimony for the Boards consideration. If the victim has requested to be notified only if the Board is inclined to grant parole and no testimony, either written or oral, is received from the victim within at least forty-five days of the date of the Boards notification, the Board shall rende r its decision based on information available to it in accordance with subsection A. The definition of victim in § 19.2-11.01 shall apply to this section.Although any information presented by the victim of a crime for which the prisoner is incarcerate d shall be retained in the prisoners parole file and considered by the Board, such information shall not infringe on the Boards authority to exercise its decision-making authority.

I, c. 545, effective July 1, 2021, in subsection B in the first paragraph, inserted the third sentence and substituted request in writing or by electronic means for written request. CASE NOTES No liberty interest created.  This section, far from creating a presumption that release will be granted, absolutely prohibits parole unless the parole board decides otherwise. Because the par ole board has such unfettered discretion, this section creates no protected liberty interest. James v. Robinson, 863 F. Supp. 275, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12962 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 45 F.3d 426, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 40374 (4th Cir. 1994). Due process clause not invoked.  Neither the parole statutes nor any parole regulation has created a liberty interest in parole sufficient to invoke the due process clause. James v. Robinson, 863 F. Supp. 275, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12962 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 45 F.3d 426, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 40374 (4th Cir. 1994). Since plaintiff violent offender inmates statistics showed defendant parole board members still granted parole to violent offenders, though at lower rates, wi th, in over half of denials, giving reasons other than the seriousness of the offense, the inmates Due Process claim failed; the facts showed the board was making individual determinations with respect to violent offenders, as it was releasing numero us such offenders despite the crimes of which they were convicted, and, in many cases, it was not only considering but also relying on reasons other than the seriousness of the crime and its attendant circumstances in deciding to deny parole. Burnette v. Fahey, 687 F.3d 171, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 13925 (4th Cir. 2012). A prisoner has no entitlement to due process property interest in parole release. 962 F. Supp. 827 (E.D. Va. 1997). Absolute immunity of parole bo ard members.  State prisoners 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 action against the members of the state parole board for allegedly violating the prisoners constitutional rights in denying the prisoners various requests for parole was dismissed because the parole board members were entitled to absolute immunity as to the prisoners claims. Robinson v. Fahey, No. 3:04CV149, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7735 (E.D. Va. Apr. 15, 2005), aff'd, 174 Fed. Appx. 757, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 8341 (4th Cir. 2006). § 53.1-155.1. Participation in residential community program prior to final release. Text The Department may give nonviolent prisoners who have not been convicted of a violent crime and who have been sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of at least thre e years the opportunity to participate in a residential community program, work release, or a community-based program approved by the Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security within six months of such prisoners projected or mandatory release date. The Secretary shall prescribe guidelines to govern the residential community programs, work release, or community-based programs. Any wages earned pursuant to this section by a prisoner may be paid to the director or administrator of the program after standard payroll deductions required by law. D istribution of such wages shall be made for the following purposes: 1. To pa y an amount to defray the cost of his keep; 2. To pay travel and other such expenses made necessary by his work release, employment, or participation in a residential community program or a community-based program; 3. To provide support and maintenance for his dependents or to make payments to the local department of social services or the Commissioner of Social Services, as appropriate, on behalf o f dependents who are receiving public assistance as defined in § 63.2-100; or 4. To pay any fines, restitution, or costs as ordered by the court. Any balance at the end of his sentence shall be paid to the prisoner upon his release.

Constitutionality.  There is no constitutional defect in the Virginia procedure which denies to a parole violator any credit on his reinstated sentences for the time spent on parole. Hamrick v. Peyton, 349 F.2d 370, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 4817 (4th Cir. 1965). Legislative intent.  The General Assembly intended that a parolee is not entitled to have his parole time, either before or after the issuance of a warrant for his arrest, credited up on his sentence. Burgess v. Cunningham, 205 Va. 623, 139 S.E.2d 110, 1964 Va. LEXIS 228 (1964). Meaning of at large on parole.  The words at large on parole must be considered together; they apply to any prisoner who has been released from the penitentiary (now state correctional f acility) or other place of confinement subject to parole provisions. Burgess v. Cunningham, 205 Va. 623, 139 S.E.2d 110, 1964 Va. LEXIS 228 (1964). A parole operates as a suspension of the convicts sentence during the liberty so gra nted, so that, on a violation of its terms, the convict may be compelled to serve the full portion of his term which was unexpired when the parole was granted.

Persons w ho are so released on parole shall be subject to a minimum of six months supervision and an additional period of parole ending on the date upon which the parolee would have served the maximum term of confinement, or any period the Board otherwise dee ms appropriate in accordance with § 53.1-156. Such persons shall also be subject, for the entire period of parole fixed by the Board, to such terms and conditions prescribed by the Board in accordance with § 53.1-157. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, if within thirty days of a release scheduled pursuant to this section, new information is presented to the Bo ard which gives the Board reasonable cause to believe that the release poses a clear and present danger to the life or physical safety of any person, the Board may delay the release for up to six months to investigate the matter and to refer it to law-en forcement, mental health or other appropriate authorities for investigation and any other appropriate action by such authorities. No person released on parole pursuant to § 53.1-136, and whose parole is subsequently revoked, shall be released on parole pursuant to this section until at least si x months have elapsed from the date of the decision revoking his parole. No person released on parole pursuant to this section, whose parole is subsequently revoked, shall thereafter be released on parole pursuant to this section. Final discharge may be extended to require the prisoner to serve the full portion of the term imposed by the sentencing court which was unexpired when the prisoner was released on parole. For purposes of this section, (i) maximum term of confinement means the maximum term of incarceration established by law as punishment for the offense, (ii) mandatory release date means that date which is six months prior to the scheduled date of release and takes into consideration good conduct credits, and (iii) final discharge and discharge from parole mean that a prisoner is released from confinement having satisfied the full term imposed by the sentencing court without regard to good conduct credit. Nothing contained herein shall be const rued to create a right or entitlement to parole. History History.

Annotations CASE NOTES Constitutionality of manda tory DNA testing.  To the extent that the first five words of the third paragraph of § 19.2-310.2: Notwithstanding the provisions of § 53.1-159 authorize a modificati on of mandatory parole, § 19.2-310.2 violates the ex post facto clause. Therefore, those five words are unconstitutional and may not be enforced to modify the mandatory parole period. Otherwise, though, the mandatory DNA testing imposed on all incarce rated felons withstands constitutional scrutiny. Jones v.

CASE NOTES Limited applicability of e xclusionary rule.  Although a probation, parole, or suspended sentence revocation proceeding is not criminal in nature, the outcome of such a proceeding may result in the loss of on es liberty. Nevertheless, unless the evidence shows that the police officers who illegally seized the evidence also acted in bad faith, the exclusionary rule should not be used to prevent the evidence from being admitted into evidence in a secondary proceeding, such as a probation revocation hearing.

Where petitioner used up his good time credits to win early release on parole, and then violated that parole, the Virginia Parole Board legally exercised its discretion to revoke petitioners parole and order him incarcerated for the unserved portion of the original term of imprisonment.

That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called sending state), to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or relea sed on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called receiving state), while on probation or parole, if: a. Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there; b. Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there. Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person. A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this compact, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted. 2. That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees. 3. That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalit ies will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until disch arged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense. 4. That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference. 5. That the Governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regu lations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact. 6. That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing. When executed it shall have the full forc e and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state. 7. That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending six months notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party hereto.

In addition, this Compact will: create an Interstate Commission, which will establish uniform pr ocedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies and which will promulgate rul es to achieve the purpose of this Compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection , access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of State Councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor com pliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The Compacting States recognize that there is no right of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this Compact and the Bylaws and Rules promulgated hereunder.

It contains no specific requirement for the sequence of sentences to be served. Peyton v. Williams, 206 Va. 595, 145 S.E.2d 147, 1965 Va. LEXIS 240 (1965); Conner v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 455, 150 S.E.2d 478, 1966 Va. LEXIS 243 (1966). This section does not control the sequence of sentence service. Perkins v. Peyton, 369 F.2d 590, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 4298 (4th Cir. 1966). Nothing in this section nor any other statutory provision specifies the sequence in which sentences must be served. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). It must be read in conjunction with former § 19.1-294 (now § 19.2-308), and must g ive way to such section in the event of conflict. Hudson v. Youell, 179 Va. 442, 19 S.E.2d 705, 1942 Va. LEXIS 237, cert. denied, 317 U.S. 630, 63 S. Ct. 47, 87 L. Ed. 508, 1942 U.S. LEXIS 290 (1942); Wilkinson v. Youell, 180 Va. 321, 23 S.E.2d 356, 1942 Va. LEXIS 174 (1942); Conner v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 455, 150 S.E.2d 478, 1966 Va. LEXIS 243 (1966). The provisions of this section must be read with former § 19.1-294 (now § 19.2-308). Perkins v. Peyton, 369 F.2d 590, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 4298 (4th Cir. 19 66). This section must be read in conjunction with, and when in conflict must give way to, former § 19.1-294 (now § 19.2-308), which provides that multiple sente nces shall run consecutively and not concurrently, unless otherwise directed by the court. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). Sentence commences from date of final judgment. Grace v. Peyton, 207 Va. 688, 152 S.E.2d 292, 1967 Va. LEXIS 124 (1967). And not from date prisoner is received at penitentiary (now state cor rectional facility) or committed thereto.  This section does not provide that a sentence begins from the date the prisoner is received at the penitentiary, nor from the date of his commitment thereto, nor from the date the commitment is received by the penitentiary officials. Grace v. Peyton, 207 Va. 688, 152 S.E.2d 292, 1967 Va. LEXIS 124 (1967). Discrimination between those who choose to appeal their convictions and those who do not is constitutionally intolerable because it tends to impede open and equal access to appellate review since it may deter a defendant from appealing because of a fear that the sentencing judge will not give him credit for the time that he has spent i n jail pending appeal. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). And may inhibit exercise of appeal right.  Since, in Virginia, where a convicted criminal defendant appeals his conviction, his sentence does not begin to run until final disposition of the appeal, if a co nvicted person were not given post-conviction confinement credit toward his sentence, then he might be inhibited from exercising his right of appeal. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Effect of failure to give post-conviction credit is to punish person twice.  The failure to give post-conviction credit to a convicted person who remains in confinement pending appeal effectively punishes that person twice for the same off ense. Punishment is exacted once by confining the person from conviction to final disposition of his appeal, and is exacted again when the convicted person begins service of his sentence. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E. D. Va. 1975). So State must fully credit post-conviction confinement.  In order to preclude the possibility, therefore, that a convicted person will suffer multiple punishment for the same offense in violation of the double jeopa rdy clause, the State must fully credit post-conviction confinement toward the sentence to be served by a criminal defendant, because it is punishment already exacted. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Both the nature and sequence of service of multiple sentences are determined by the court or courts rendering judgment. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). Kind, amount, and sequence of punishment must be clearly specified.  So long as the kind, amount, and sequence of punishment are clearly specified before petitioner begins to serve any of the sentences, none of his constitutional r ights are violated. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). Sentences need n ot be served in order of imposition.  There is no constitutional or statutory requirement that sentences must be served in the order in which they are imposed by judgment. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). Term of confinement may be computed from date of first valid sentence.  At the date of prisoners sentence, when he was being improperly held on a void sentence, there was no reason why the provision of this section should not be a pplied and the term of his confinement be computed from the date of the subsequent, valid sentence. Peyton v. Christian, 208 Va. 105, 155 S.E.2d 335, 1967 Va. LEXIS 190 (1967). Commencement of subsequent consecutive sentences where time served on void convictions.  Where a prisoner has been serving a number of consecutive sentences in prison, and where the Attorney General concedes the invalidity of four of the prisoners convictions, while the prisoner is not entitled to credit for time served on the void convictions, the invalidity of his first four convictions leaves nothing to postpone the commencement of his subsequent sentences from the date of imposition of senten ce which will necessarily result in an advancement of his release. Morris v. Superintendent of Va. State Penitentiary, 212 Va. 656, 187 S.E.2d 200, 1972 Va. LEXIS 226 (1972). Where a prisoners parole was revoked after he had been imprisoned for another offense, he could not attack, at present, the validity of his original sentence since he would not begin serving the remainder of it until after he had served the new sentence. Peyton v. Williams, 206 Va. 595, 145 S.E.2d 147, 1965 Va. LEXIS 240 (1965); Grace v. Peyton, 207 Va. 688, 152 S.E.2d 292, 1967 Va. LEXIS 124 (1967). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Change of sentences from death to life imprisonment is self-executing.  Following the abolishment of the death penalty, the Virginia Department of Corrections is required to administratively recalculate the sentences of inmates senten ced to death to reflect the change to life imprisonment according to the provisions of the law.

Such credit for time shall include any time spent in pretrial confinement or detention on separate, dismissed, or nolle prosequi charges that are from the same act as the violation for which the person is convi cted and sentenced to a term of confinement. When entering the final order in any such case, the court shall provide that the person so convicted be given credit for the time so spent. In no case shall a person be allowed credit for time not actually spent in confinement or in detention.

Escape, § 1. CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Consideration. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Many of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Constitutional right to credit for jail time awaiting trial and pending appeal.  The right of credit for jail time awaiting trial on a bailable offense and pending appeal is not a matter of legislative grace but is a right constitutionally man dated, available to state prisoners as well as federal prisoners. Durkin v. Davis, 538 F.2d 1037, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 12246 (4th Cir. 1976). The right to sentence credit is bottomed squarely upon the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dis t. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). The Sixth Amendment, made obligatory upon the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that a convicted person be given credit toward his sentence for all pre-conviction confinement served. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Whether convicted individual is indigent or not.  It is now the law in the Fourth Circuit that an individual convicted of a crime has a constitutional entitlement to pre-conviction confinement sentence credit, wh ether indigent or not. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Equal protection clause commands that indigent criminal defendant be given pre-conviction confinement credit toward his sentence. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 24 9, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Should a convicted indigent be incarcerated pending appeal because he is too poor to make bail, where bail would have been otherwise available, the equal protecti on clause commands that he be given sentence credit for all post-conviction confinement served. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Or else invidious discrimination may result.  The failure to give pre-conviction confinement credit to that class of persons who are too poor to make bail would work an invidious discrimination against them s olely because of their indigency. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). There is no rational justification for validating a system which requires the poor to suffer greater punishment than the wealthy solely because of their indigency , and the failure to credit a convicted indigents sentence with all pre-conviction confinement served constitutes invidious discrimination against the poor. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Becaus e of inability to make bail.  Convicted indigents who served pre-conviction confinement because they were too poor to make bail would have to pay a greater penalty than those convicted for the same crimes who were wealthy enough to make bail. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Right to pre-conviction and post-conviction credit on sentence constit utes liberty.  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. The right to pre-convi ction and post-conviction confinement sentence credit constitutes an interest in liberty because when such credit is withdrawn, the sentence that a State prisoner must serve is automatically increased and the date for parole eligibility is, there by, extended. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). And is absolute.  In light of the liberty interest involved, the right to pre-conviction and post-conviction confinement sentence credit is sourced in the United States Con stitution and is, therefore, absolute. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Failure to give pre-conviction sentence credit to convicted criminal defendant may burden Sixth Amendment right to plead not guilty and be tried by a jury. The prospect of lingering in jail until trial and earning no credit toward ones sentence, if found guilty, may induce the defendant to give a quick guilty plea so that he can start serving off his sentence. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). And discourage exploration of defenses.  Knowledge that pre-conviction confinement may not be credited to ones sentence should one be convicted might discourage a defendant from exploring defenses, s uch as the insanity defense, which require substantial pretrial time to develop. Durkin v. Davis, 390 F. Supp. 249, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13783 (E.D. Va. 1975). Confin ement required for credit.  Trial court did not err in refusing to grant defendant credit against his sentence for time spent on bail and in home electronic monitoring because he was not confined while on the home electronic monitoring program and was not entitled to credit against his sentence for the time he was on bail; defendant, though subject to the conditions of the home electronic monitoring program, was admitted to bail while awaiting trial, and he was not actually in a state or local correctional facility. Md. v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 483, 877 S.E.2d 537, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 440 (2022). Language in the statute is clear, unambiguous, and does not permit credit for time not actually spent in confinement or in detention; statute grants a trial c ourt no authority to grant credit against a sentence for the time a defendant was admitted to pretrial bail and was not actually confined. Md. v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 483, 877 S.E.2d 537, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 440 (2022). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction.  Exercising a strict reading of § 53.1-187, jail credit should only apply to the offenses for which the defendant is awaiting trial. Therefore, time served for one matter cannot apply to sentences for any potential future trials, nor any past convictions. Credit can only be applied to sentences far convictions directly stemming from charges the defendant is awaiting trial for. A logical common sense reading sup ports the interpretation that this section applies to time spend in pretrial detention on charges that result in conviction. Commonwealth v. Batra, 106 Va. Cir. 361, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 477 (Fairfax County Nov. 25, 2020). Plain terms of § 53.1-187 did not grant the circuit court the authority to apply credit for unrelated offenses. Moreover, the court was without jurisdiction to grant the requested relief, as the authority to apply credits rested within the discretion of the executive branch of government, namely, the Virginia Department of Corrections. Commonwealth v. Batra, 106 Va. Cir. 361, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 477 (Fairfax C ounty Nov. 25, 2020). Credit for all time in jail awai ting trial.  Defendant must be given credit for all of his or her time in jail awaiting trial; the corollary to this principle is that no jail credit can be reserved for possi ble use in the future if it can be applied to a sentence directly associated with the defendants detention. Commonwealth v. Carter, 93 Va. Cir. 129, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 42 (Fairfax County Apr. 4, 2016). Determination of sentencing credits.  Jailer of all local correctional facilities was designated as the repository for all of the information needed to determine sentence credits; the court was withou t jurisdiction to determine the issue of defendants claimed sentence credit, as this decision rested solely within the discretion...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_53.1-188"><akn:num>§ 53.1-188</akn:num><akn:heading>Conduct records to be kept</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The Director shall keep a record of the conduct of each person confined in a state correctional facility.

For survey of the law in the Fourth Circuit on habeas corpus and prisoners rights, see 34 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 625 (1977). CASE NOTES Editors note. Many of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Right to earn good time not merely matter of grace.  The argument that the right to earn statutory good time are matters of mere legislative or administrative grace fails in the face of current constitutiona l doctrine. Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11004 (E.D. Va. 1971). Minimum due process standards are necessary when solitary confinement, transfer to maxim um security confinement, or loss of good time are imposed or a prisoner is held in padlock confinement more than ten days. Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11004 (E.D. Va. 1971). Requirements for adjudicat ory proceedings.  In adjudicatory proceedings, certain due process rights are necessary and will not unduly impede legitimate prison functions. First, the decision to punish must b e made by an impartial tribunal. This bars any official who reported a violation from ruling. Second, there shall be a hearing. Disposition of charges on the basis of written reports is insufficient. Necessarily a hearing encompasses the right to present evidence in defense, including the testimony of voluntary witnesses. A hearing must be preceded by notice in writing of the substance of the factual charge of misconduct. Only with written notice can a prisoner prepare to meet claims and insist that the hearing be kept within bounds. A reasonable interval to prepare a defense must be allowed as well. Cross-examination of adverse witnesses likewise is necessary. Fundamental to due process is that the ultimate decision be based upon evidence presented at the hearing, which the prisoner has the opportunity to refute. Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11004 (E.D. Va. 1971). The tribunal should permit a prisoner to select a lay adviser to present his case. This may be either a member of the noncustodial staff or another inmate, serving on a voluntary basis. Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11004 (E.D. Va. 1971). How claim of arbitrary denial of good time may be brought in federal court.  Prevailing precedent in the Fourth Circuit permits claims that good behavior time has been arbitrarily denied and that injunctive relief is therefore owing, to be litigated in actions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and disapproves the use of habeas corpus. Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11004 (E.D. Va. 1971). Use of habeas in challenging withholding of good conduct credits.  A writ of habeas corpus is the proper vehicle for challenging the length of confinement resulting from good conduct credits being withheld. Hill v. Hutto, 537 F. Supp. 1185, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12085 (E.D. Va. 1982). Revocation of prisoners good-conduct time is an integral statutory provision to the crime of escape. Zaczek v. Huber, 437 F. Supp. 402, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14327 (W.D. Va. 1977), aff'd, 570 F.2d 346 (4th Cir. 1978). Prisoners constitutional rights not violated during proceeding resulting in such loss.  An inmates constitutional rights were not violated during a proceeding resulting in the loss of his good-conduct time where the prisoner had been convicted of escape at a trial at which the inmate was not deprived of any constitutional right. Zaczek v. Huber, 437 F. Supp. 402, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14327 (W.D.

The Director shall determine the amount of any such credit for each such service or injury. In unusual circumstances a prisoner may receive credit for donating blood, under regulations prescribed by the Director, to blood banks licensed by or subject to regulations of the State Board of Health. The Director may allow the credit permitted by this section to a prisoner who has been sentenced to the Department of Corrections but who is confined in a local correctional facility. Except as provided hereafter, any credit allowed under the provisions of this section shall be applied as provided in § 53.1-199. A prisoner who has been sentenced t o a term of life imprisonment or to two or more life sentences shall be eligible for credits allowed under the provisions of this section. One-half of such credit shall be applied to reduce the period of time such prisoner shall serve before being eligib le for parole.

CASE NOTES ICC hearing differs fr om disciplinary hearing.  An Institutional Classification Committee (ICC) hearing held for the purpose of adjusting an inmates good conduct allowance (GCA) assignment differs from a di sciplinary hearing in two substantial respects. First, a negative outcome at an ICC hearing does not have the stigma of wrongdoing or punishment attached to it. Second, while the outcome at a disciplinary hearing turns on a very precise set of facts, the ICCs GCA assessment involves a holistic approach to both the inmates record and the goals of the institution. Holmes v. Cooper, 872 F. Supp. 298, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 694 (W.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, No. 95-6102, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 12533 (4th Cir. May 23, 1995). No protected liberty interest in cla ss.  The applicable statutes authorize, but do not mandate, awards of good conduct allowances (GCA) to inmates. Accordingly, the statutes themselves do not create a pr otected liberty interest in any particular GCA class. James v. Robinson, 863 F. Supp. 275, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12962 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 45 F.3d 426, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 40374 (4th Cir. 1994). Department of Corrections is within discretion in applying credits to sentence.  The Department of Corrections is well within its discretion, as the implementing agency of § 53.1-191 and this section, in applying a prisoners extraordina ry credits to an original sentence. Coffin v. Murray, 983 F.2d 563, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 32613 (4th Cir. 1992), amended, No. 92-6630 (4th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1019, 113 S. Ct. 1817, 123 L. Ed. 2d 448, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 2600 (1993). The Virginia Code does not create a liberty interest in being placed in any particular good conduct allowance classification or in earning any particular number of credits; inmates have only a liberty interest in the opportunity to earn good conduct credits within a four-level classification system. Ewell v. Murray, 813 F. Supp. 1180, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21516 (W.D. Va.), aff'd, 11 F.3d 482, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 32160 (4th Cir. 1993). Effect of good time credits on life sentence. If an inmate is serving a life sentence, g ood time credits count only towards hastening his parole eligibility date, not his release date, since he has no release date and, once the inmate has become eligible for parole, additional good time credits have no further effect. Jennings v. Parole Bd. , 61 F. Supp. 2d 462, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6190 (E.D. Va.), dismissed, 61 F. Supp. 2d 471, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12248 (E.D. Va. 1999). Mandatory nature of section.  Because this section and 53.1-201, which govern good time credits, are framed in mandatory language, it follows that petitioner, who was serving a sentence subjec t to these statutes, had a liberty interest in the opportunity to earn good time credits while incarcerated. Brown-El v. Virginia Parole Bd., 948 F. Supp. 558, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18215 (E.D. Va. 1996). Due process hearing.  Although the regulations themselves require that an inmate receive a due process hearing before his good conduct allowance (GCA) status is changed, plaintiff does not become constitutionally entitled to any procedural protections unless there are also substantive predicates which, if met, mandate a particular result. Holmes v. Cooper, 872 F. Supp. 298, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 694 (W.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, No. 95-6102 , 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 12533 (4th Cir. May 23, 1995). Plaintiff would have been entitled to some level of due process if the change in his good conduct allowance (GCA) status was intended as a punishment or a discipl inary action. Holmes v. Cooper, 872 F. Supp. 298, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 694 (W.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, No. 95-6102, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 12533 (4th Cir.

Every perso n who is convicted of a felony offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, and who is sentenced to serve a term of incarceration in a state or local correctional facility shall be eligible to earn sentence credits in the manner prescribed by this arti cle. Such eligibility shall commence upon the persons incarceration in any correctional facility following entry of a final order of conviction by the committing court. As used in this chapter, sentence credit and earned sentence credit  mean deductions from a persons term of confinement earned through adherence to rules prescribed pursuant to § 53.1-25, through program participation as required by §§ 53.1-32.1 and 53.1-202.3, and by meeting such other requirements as m ay be established by law or regulation. One earned sentence credit shall equal a deduction of one day from a persons term of incarceration. B. A juvenile convicted as an adult and sentenced as a serious juvenile offender under clause (i) of subdivision A 1 of § 16.1-272 shall be eligible to earn sentence credits for the portion of the sentence served with the Department of Juvenile Justice in the manne r prescribed by this article. Consideration for earned sentence credits shall require adherence to the facilitys rules and the juveniles progress toward treatment goals and objectives while sentenced as a serious juvenile offender under § 16.1 -285.1.

CASE NOTES Comment during sentencing.  Trial court erred in failing to declare mistrial following prosecutors comments about defendants eligibility for parole, and its own remarks about defenda nts ability to have his sentence reduced for good time. Davis v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 82 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 8, 2000). Jury instructions.  Because, at the time a jury assesses punishment it does not and cannot have a factual basis upon which to factor the provisions for good-behavior credit into its determination of an appropriate sentence and because such an effort would be an exercise in pure speculation, juries are not to be instructed with regard to the statutory provisions governing such credit. Fishback v. Commonwealth, 260 Va. 104, 532 S.E.2d 629, 2000 Va.

Correction of ruling.  Circuit court did not err in revoking defendants suspended sentence and in transferring defendant from the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice to Tennesse e Department of Corrections custody because the courts order of clarification to correct a ministerial error accurately reflected the courts disposition from a review hearing and did not modify or change the ruling from more than 21 days earlier. The court did not abuse its discretion in entering the order because the evidentiary basis for correcting the record was clear and convincing. Martinez v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. App. 318, 836 S.E.2d 1, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 285 (2019). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Good conduct credit.  Prisoner charged as a juvenile but sentenced under § 16.1-284 is eligible for the good conduct credit established in § 53.1-116 if the offense for which he is being sentenced would be classified as a misdemeanor if committed by an adult. However, if the offense for which he is being sentenced would be classified as a felony if committed by an adult, the good conduct credit established in § 53.1-116 does not apply. If the prisoner is sentenced for violating a court order or the terms of probation or parole, the nature of the underlying conviction (felony or misdemeanor) governs eligibility for good conduct credit.

Classification between prisoners and nonprisoners not invidious.  There is nothing violative of the Constitution in this section. Fact that identical conduct by nonprisoners may result in a lesser penalty does not by itself offe nd the equal protection clause. Because the classification between prisoners and nonprisoners is not an invidious or suspect one, such as one based on race or religion, or does not regulate a fundamental interest, such as free speech or voting, this clas sification need only be rationally related to a legitimate State purpose.

Therefore, his conviction under this section for possession of hacksaw blades while an inmate in the jail was proper. Kelly v. Cox, 353 F. Supp. 1050, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10627 (W.D. Va. 1972). Mistaken indication that proceeding was under § 18.2-477 held not an election by Commonwealth.  Where, prior to the defendants arraignment and plea, in response to an inquiry by defense counsel, the attorney for the Commonwealth mistakenly indicated that he was proceeding against the defendant under § 18.2-477, the defendants claim that this was an election by the Commonwealth which limited his punishment to the maximum of five years provided by that section was without merit since the defendant, prior to his plea, was advised by both his counsel and the trial court that the prosecution was being conducted under this section, and was also advised that he, as an inmate of a penal institution, was subject to a maximum penalty of twenty years impri sonment if he had inflicted bodily injury on the guard from whose custody he escaped, a fact that was later established by uncontroverted evidence.

(21 Gratt.) 790, 1871 Va. LEXIS 89 (1871). In order to justify transfer of trial from courthouse to another location, the trial cou rt must adopt and implement adequate measures that will not unduly infringe upon the public trial guarantee and will assure freedom of access to the trial. Provision should be made for reasonable notice to the parties and general population who have a ri ght to expect the trial to be held at the courthouse in accordance with the statute. Furthermore, administrative convenience is insufficient, standing alone, to justify a transfer of a criminal trial from the courthouse. These standards govern the decisi on to transfer a criminal trial from a courthouse courtroom to a prison courtroom. Vescuso v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 59, 360 S.E.2d 547, 4 Va.

Burden of proving trial inside prison was public trial.  The burden was upon defendants to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that they were denied a public trial. However, upon a showing that the trial was held w ithin the perimeter walls of a medium security prison, the defendants proved a prima facie case of denial of a public trial.

The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing spee dy trials of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures. As used in this agreement: ARTICLE II. (a) State  shall mean a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Ri co. (b) Sending state shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof. (c) Receivi ng state shall mean the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to Article III or Article IV hereof. ARTICLE III. (a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information or comp laint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within 180 days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officers juri sdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint; provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the cour t having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under whic h the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. (b) The writte n notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the cert ificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. (c) The warden , commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the i ndictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based. (d) Any reques t or final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other officials having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoners request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoners written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, informatio n or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice. (e) Any reques t for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiv er of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law. (f) Escape fro m custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request. ARTICLE IV. (a) The approp riate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available i n accordance with Article V (a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated; provided that the court having jurisdiction of such ind ictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request; and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which pe riod the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner. (b) Upon recei pt of the officers written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor . (c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this article, trial shall be commenced within 120 days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdic tion of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. (d) Nothing co ntained in this article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery. (e) If trial i s not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoners being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V (e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any furt her force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice. ARTICLE V. (a) In respons e to a request made under Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint i s pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this a greement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoners presence in federal custody at the place of trial, whichever custod ial arrangement may be approved by the custodian. (b) The office r or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand: (1) Prop er identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given.

The party states, desiring by common action to fully utilize and improve their institutional facilities and provide adequate programs for the confinement, treatment and rehabilitation of various types of offenders, declare that it is the policy of each of the party states to provide such facilities and programs on a basis of cooperation with one another, and with the Federal Government, thereby serving the best interes t of such offenders and of society and effecting economies in capital expenditures and operational costs. The purpose of this compact is to provide for the mutual development and execution of such programs of cooperation for the confinement, treatment an d rehabilitation of offenders with the most economical use of human and material resources. ARTICLE II. As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: a. State  means a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. b. Sending state means a state party to this compact in which conviction or court commitment was had. c. Receivi ng state means a state party to this compact to which an inmate is sent for confinement other than a state in which conviction or court commitment was had. d. Inmate  means a male or female offender who is committed, under sentence to or confined in a penal or correctional institution. e. Institu tion means any penal or correctional facility, including but not limited to a facility for individuals with mental illness or intellectual disability, in which inmates as defined in d above may lawfully be confined.

Whenever th e duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is n ecessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the rec eiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state. b. The appropr iate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution. c.

Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The recei ving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final dete rmination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state. g. Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to i ts territory. h. Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceedi ng in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state. i. The parents , guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact. ARTICLE V. a. Any decisio n of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an ins titution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharge from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through an y and all states party to this compact without interference. b. An inmate w ho escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending o r receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdic tion directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee. ARTICLE VI. Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally-aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that if such pr ogram or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Revocation of consent.  Governor did not violate § 53.1-220 when revoking the Commonwealths consent to the transfer of a prisoner to Germany pursuant to the Council of Europes Convention on Transfer of Sentenced Persons. The federal enabling legislation, 18 U.S.C.S. § 4107(b)(4), was silent as to whether a state government or the federal government was able to revoke consent, and the U.S. Attorney General specifically stat ed that there was nothing in the Convention or federal law that prohibited the governor from revoking consent prior to the physical transfer of the prisoner.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Many of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. History of chapter.  This chapter is the outgrowth of an earlier statute designed to alleviate the consequences of the common-law rule which permitted one convicted of a felony to be sued but not to appear in court to defend his case. Almond v. Kent, 459 F.2d 200, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 10178 (4th Cir. 1972) see also Merchant's Adm'r v. Shry, 116 Va. 437, 82 S.E. 106, 1914 Va. LEXIS 49 (1914). Nonapplicability of § 8.01-9.  There is no legislative intent that § 8.01-9, which provides when appointment of a guardian ad litem for a person under disability is appropriate, should apply to this chapter pertaining to the appointment of committees for convict defendants. Dunn v. Terry, 216 Va. 234, 217 S.E.2d 849 (1975). But see Buchanon County v. Blakenship, 406 F. Supp.2d 642 (W.D. Va. 2005), as to effect of statutory changes to § 8 .01-9. Right of convict to waive appointment of committee.  There are no statutes or rules to deny a convict, already within the civil jurisdiction of the court at the time of his felony conviction and incarceration, the p rivilege of waiving the appointment of a committee and proceeding to trial and judgment in a law action in which he is represented by counsel of his own choosing. Dunn v. Terry, 216 Va. 234, 217 S.E.2d 849, 1975 Va. LEXIS 274 (1975). Waiver by failing to move for ap pointment.  By electing to continue to utilize services of attorneys who represented him rather than to move for the appointment of a committee, a convict waived such appoint ment. Dunn v. Terry, 216 Va. 234, 217 S.E.2d 849, 1975 Va. LEXIS 274 (1975). Dismissal of action brought by convict for lack of committee held error.  Where a convict filed an action and where the action was dismissed on the ground that he could not proceed without the appointment of a committee, such dismissal was error since a convict is free to waive the appointment of a committee if so desired. Cross v. Sundin, 222 Va. 37, 278 S.E.2d 805, 1981 Va. LEXIS 269 (1981). Appointment of committee not required for suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  To require a committee to be appointed pursuant to this chapter in the case of a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 would serve only to delay the assertion of federal rights and to frustrate them, if the appointment of a committee and the institution of suit by the committee could not be accomplished before the bar of limitations was interposed. Almond v. Kent, 459 F.2d 200, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 10178 (4th Cir. 1972) . Evidence of grounds of jurisdiction to appoint.  If the existence of any one or more of the grounds of jurisdiction to appoint a committee is challenged, evidence that the grounds so challenged do exist must be furnished. Gilmer v. Redwine, 131 Va. 55, 108 S.E. 857, 1921 Va. LEXIS 7 (1921). When a convict objected that he had no estate to be committed, and that the party making the motion for the appointment of his committee had no interest in the ap pointment, these facts were in issue and should have been affirmatively established, in order to support the jurisdiction of the trial court. Gilmer v. Redwine, 131 Va. 55, 108 S.E. 857, 1921 Va. LEXIS 7 (1921). Appointment of committee was not discretionary under former § 53-305.  Former § 53-305, predecessor to this section, did not appear to make the appointment of a committee discretionary. Almond v. Kent, 459 F.2d 200, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 10178 (4th Cir. 1972). Appointment of committee not required in proceeding to enforce child support.  Detainee awaiting a final determination of felony charges for a misdemeanor was not entitled to the appointment of a committee before the court enforced a child s upport order against him. Only prisoners incarcerated for felonies were entitled to a committee pursuant to § 53.1-223; the paternity petition was filed and the order entered before the detainee was incarcerated for any felony. Tucker v. Wimer, 42 Va. App. 42, 590 S.E.2d 73, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 675 (2003). Sections deal with tangible property and not intangible driving right.  This section through § 53.1-223 deal with tangible property, personal or real. There is no indication that the legislature intended for these sections to prot ect a prisoners intangible right to drive on the highways of the Commonwealth. Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 488, 393 S.E.2d 425, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2742, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 116 (1990), overruled, Pigg v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 756, 441 S.E.2d 216, 10 Va. Law Rep. 921, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (1994). Dedication of property by convict to payment of debts and support of family.  The provisions of this chapter do not apply when the convict has exercised the right to dedicate his property to the payment of debts and support of his family be fore the appointment of a committee. Haynes v. Peterson, 125 Va. 730, 100 S.E. 471, 1919 Va. LEXIS 62 (1919). As to application of section to citizen confined in penitentiary of another state, see G uarantee Co. of N. Am. v. First Nat'l Bank, 95 Va. 480, 28 S.E. 909, 1898 Va. LEXIS 4 (1898). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Incarcerated complainant.  Delaying a divorce petition brought by an incarcerated complainant until his release is inadvisable, even where transportation of the incarcerated complainant is inappropriate; the appointment of a committee is appropriate under subsection B of § 53.1-221 and where transportation of inmate is not a viable option, the court may consider alternative means of evidence collection.

Most of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. History of chapter.  The present chapter is the outgrowth of an earlier statute designed to alleviate the consequences of the common-law rule which permitted one convicted of a felony to be sued but not to appear in court to defend his case. Almond v. Kent, 459 F.2d 200, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 10178 (4th Cir. 1972) see also Merchant's Adm'r v. Shry, 116 Va. 437, 82 S.E. 106, 1914 Va. LEXIS 49 (1914). The powers given the committee of a lunatic are strikingly similar to those conferred up on the committee of a convict. Merchant's Adm'r v. Shry, 116 Va. 437, 82 S.E. 106, 1914 Va. LEXIS 49 (1914). This section does not grant to a convict immunity from claims and demands against him an d his estate. Such claims and demands may be asserted against the committee appointed for him. This section relates to the remedy and not to the right to assert liability against the convict. Scott v. Nance, 202 Va. 355, 117 S.E.2d 279, 1960 Va. LEXIS 23 0 (1960). This section contains no prohibition against actions or suits instituted by or against the convict prior to his conviction. Dunn v. Terry, 216 Va. 234, 217 S.E.2d 849, 1975 Va. LEXIS 274 (1975). Prison inmate may proceed in state court with or without appointment of committee. Al-Mus tafa Irshad v. Spann, 543 F. Supp. 922, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13674 (E.D. Va. 1982). Right of convict to waive appointment of committee.  There are no statutes or rules to deny a convict, already within the civil jurisdiction of the court at the time of his felony conviction and incarceration, the p rivilege of waiving the appointment of a committee and proceeding to trial and judgment in a law action in which he is represented by counsel of his own choosing. Dunn v. Terry, 216 Va. 234, 217 S.E.2d 849, 1975 Va. LEXIS 274 (1975). Waiver of sect ion by failing to move for appointment.  By electing to continue to utilize services of attorneys who represented him rather than to move for the appointment of a committee, a convict waived the procedur al provision of this section available to him. Dunn v. Terry, 216 Va. 234, 217 S.E.2d 849, 1975 Va. LEXIS 274 (1975). Dismissal of action brought by convict for lack of committee held error.  Where a convict filed an action and where the action was dismissed on the ground that he could not proceed without the appointment of a committee pursuant to this section, such dismissal was error since a convict is free to waive the appointment of a committee if so desired. Cross v. Sundin, 222 Va. 37, 278 S.E.2d 805, 1981 Va. LEXIS 269 (1981). Appointment of committee not required for suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  To require a committee to be appointed pursuant to this chapter in the case of a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 would serve only to delay the assertion of federal rights and to frustrate them, if the appointment of a committee and the institution of suit by the committee could not be accomplished before the bar of limitations was interposed.

CASE NOTES Applicability of section.  In trial for fraudulently obtaining an advance payment for construction work to be performed in the future, in violation of § 18.2-200.1, the defendants co ntention that he was a person under a disability as defined by subdivision 6 a of § 8.01-2, and as such, was entitled to an appointment of a guardian ad litem pursuant to § 8.01-9, or a committee, pursuant to § 53.1-223, was without meri t, as defendant introduced no evidence to show that he was in jail on a felony charge, and furthermore, these sections apply only to civil proceedings.

Defendant was not entitled to appointment of a guardian ad litem pursuant to § 8.01-9 or a committee, pursuant to § 53.1-223 once the victim forwarded the n otice requesting the return of construction funds she advanced to defendant, while defendant was in jail, as defendant did not show defendant was a person under a disability because defendant did not show defendant was in jail on a felony; also, neither § 8.01-9 nor § 53.1-223 applied under the circumstances as they only applied to civil proceedings, and not defendants criminal case.

Detainee awaiting a final determination of his felony charges and parole violation was not entitled to the appointment of a committee before the court enforced a child support order against him. Only prisoners incarcerated for felonies were entitled to a committee; the paternity petition was filed and the order entered before the detainee was incarcerated for any felony. Tucker v. Wimer, 42 Va. App. 42, 590 S.E.2 d 73, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 675 (2003). Section 53.1-223 applies where the petitioner is both convicted of a felony and incarcerated on that conviction. Tucker v.

Guardian ad litem did not satify committee requirement.  Where a trial court awarded a wife real estate parcels in her divorce case against her prisoner husband, it was required that a committee be appointed by the tria l court for the husband before that property determination; the appointment of a guardian ad litem representing the husband did not satisfy the committee requirement.
