History History. Code 1950, § 8-2; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE This section provides some latitude to the court in applying the provisions of Title 8.01 to causes of action arising prior to October 1, 1977, the effective date of the title. However, Title 8 statutes of limitations continue to apply to such causes of action. Cross references. For text of rules of court adopted by the Virginia Supreme Court, see Volume 11. Editors note. The General Assembly at its regular session of 1972 directed the Virginia Code Commission, by House Joint Resolution No. 31, to make a study of Title 8 of the Cod e of Virginia and to report its findings in the form of a recodification of that title. In November of 1976, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 8, along with revisers notes and other explanatory matter, which was published as House Document No. 14 of the 1977 session. The Commissions draft of the revision of Title 8, as amended by the General Assembly, became c. 617 of the Acts of 1977. Effective October 1, 1977, it repeale d Title 8 of the Code and enacted in lieu thereof a new Title 8.01. In addition to its revision by c. 617, former Title 8 was also amended by certain other acts passed at the 1977 session, which acts took effect July 1, 1977, or e arlier. As required by § 9-77.11 (now § 30-152) and also by Acts 1977, c. 617, cl. 4, the Code Commission incorporated most of these amendments into new Title 8.01. One such 1977 act, Acts 1977, c. 224, amended § 8-313, dealing with the circumst ances under which a deposition may be read in a case at law. Section 8-313, along with other sections relating to depositions, was not carried over into the new Title 8.01, since it was contemplated that the entire subject would be covered by the revisio n of Part Four of the Rules of the Supreme Court. Therefore, the amendment to § 8-313 was not codified by the Code Commission in new Title 8.01; however, the substance of the amendment was incorporated by the Supreme Court in revised Rule 4:7. Another 1977 act, Acts 1977, c. 621, added a new § 8.01-66.1, which, although enacted as a part of new Title 8.01, contained no effective date provision, and so took effect July 1, 1977. A companion bill to c. 617, making conforming changes in various sections of titles of the Code other than Title 8, and transferring certain sections of Title 8 t o other titles, was enacted as Acts 1977, c. 624. The revisers notes from the Code Commission report, House Document No. 14 of the 1977 session of the General Assembly, have been reviewed, in some instances c ondensed, and re-edited by the original consultants to the Code Commission in the preparation of Title 8.01, and appear under the appropriate sections herein. However, the revisers notes have not been edited to reflect subsequent amendments to the se ctions under which they appear or any other provisions. Law Review.

In an action in which a patient alleged that she suffered injuries as a result of the failure of batteries in a surgically implanted pulse generator, there was a possibility that the patients claim against a hospital for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability was not covered by the Virginia Medical Malpractice Act because the patients claim accrued before § 8.01-581.1 was amended to include breach of contract claims.

CASE NOTES An action and a cause of action are quite different: action is d efined by this section, and cause of action is defined as a set of operative facts which, under the substantive law, may give rise to a right of action. Because of that difference, there are no express terms in the nonsuit statute, § 8.01-380 , making it specifically applicable to condemnation proceedings. Trout v. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r, 241 Va. 69, 400 S.E.2d 172, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1305, 1991 Va. LEXIS 1 (1991). Action.  Car purchaser and car manufacturer entered into a settlement agreement due to the purchasers car having had numerous mechanical difficulties, which settlement resolved all issues except as to attorneys fees and costs, and thereafter, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the manufacturer, denying the purchasers claim for attorneys fees and costs as the successful party in the action pursuant to § 59.1-207.14; such a denial was proper, as the action, as that term is defined in subdivision 1 of § 8.01-2, did not end in favor of the consumer, and the fact that she maintained that she achieved the remedies that she sought did not change the conclusion that in the court action, she was not the successful party because the order terminating the action was in favor of the manufacturer. Chase v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 266 Va. 544, 587 S.E.2d 521, 2003 Va. LEXIS 116 (2003). Insured asserted three new rights of action, two for breach of contract, and one for declaratory relief, that all arose out of the same set of operative facts as the umpire proceeding, and given the broad scope of an action as defined by Virginia law, which included all civil proceedings whether upon claims at law, in equity, or statutory in nature, the umpire proceeding was an action that was non suited. Thus, pursuant to subdivision E 3 of § 8.01-229, the act of nonsuiting that action, tolled the two year statute of limitations under § 38.2-2105 for all rights of action arising from that cause of action, including the insureds present right of action for breach of contract and declaratory relief; liberal construction of the tolling statutes to include an umpire proceeding as an action the nonsuit of which tolled her right to file the instant action for damages, was therefore a ppropriate. Vaughan v. First Liberty Ins. Corp., No. 3:09cv364, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108045 (E.D. Va. Nov. 13, 2009). The statutory definition of fiduciary is not an exclusive one. Rather, it simply specifi es that certain kinds of fiduciaries are included in the term. Moreover, there is no indication in the statute or in Virginia decisional law that the General Assembly intended this section to supplant the well-settled common law pursuant to which an acco unting is available to redress a breach of the fiduciary responsibility inherent in an agency relationship or in the special relationship shown to have existed between husband and wife in the instant case. McClung v. Smith, 870 F. Supp. 1384, 1994 U.S. D ist. LEXIS 18453 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd in part, 89 F.3d 829, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 34515 (4th Cir. 1996). Son as fiduciary to fathers estate.  A son clearly stands in a fiduciary relationship to his fathers estate when he is appointed as his fathers committee. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Byrd, 15 Bankr. 15 4, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 2666 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981). Section not applicable to crimin al trial.  In trial for fraudulently obtaining an advance payment for construction work to be performed in the future, in violation of § 18.2-200.1, the defendants co ntention that he was a person under a disability as defined by subdivision 6 a of § 8.01-2, and as such, was entitled to an appointment of a guardian ad litem pursuant to § 8.01-9, or a committee, pursuant to § 53.1-223, was without meri t, as defendant introduced no evidence to show that he was in jail on a felony charge, and furthermore, these sections apply only to civil proceedings. Holsapple v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 480, 566 S.E.2d 210, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 376 (2002), aff'd, 39 Va. App. 522, 574 S.E.2d 756, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2003). Trial court properly convicted defendant of construction fraud when the victim sent notice requesting return of funds for construction not completed to defendant in prison; defendant could not show imprisonment was for a felony and could not be a person under a disability in any event, since the definition in this section is for civil proceedings only. Holsapple v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 522, 574 S.E.2 d 756, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 76, aff'd, 266 Va. 593, 587 S.E.2d 561, 2003 Va. LEXIS 96 (2003). Judgment aga inst incarcerated person only voidable.  Where defendants disability, incarceration for a felony, arose under § 8.01-2 and defendants status as an incarcerated felon was a material fact clearl y known by a court that adjudicated him a habitual offender, defendant was not entitled to have a guardian ad litem appointed pursua...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-3"><akn:num>§ 8.01-3</akn:num><akn:heading>Supreme Court may prescribe rules; effective date and availability; indexed, and annotated; effect of subsequent enactments of General Assembly</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-3 combines former law on rules promulgated by the Supreme Court. Subsection A combines former §§ 8-1, 8-1.1, 8-1.2, and the first paragraph of former § 8-86.1 pertaining to the rule-making authority of the Supreme Cour t. Sections 17-116.4 and 16.1-69.32 impose on the Supreme Court the duty to consult with the chairmen of the House and Senate Courts of Justice Committees and with the executive committees of the judicial conferences of Virginia for the circuit and distr ict courts. Since Title 8 deals with civil procedure, the authority in former § 8-1.1 regarding criminal practice was deleted. The second paragraph of former § 8-86.1 is changed in subsection B and reference is made to new § 2.1-543.1 which requires printing and distribution of rule s as public documents. Clerks of courts are directed to maintain the rules in a special book. New rules and amendments are not effective until sixty days after adoption; however, to permit advance familiarization they are to be distributed upon adoption. Former § 8-1.2 is amplified in subsection C to require that the Virginia Code Commission publish, index and annotate the Rules of the Supreme Court and all ame ndments thereto. Subsection D restates the power granted the General Assembly by Va. Const., Art. VI, § 5. Cross references. For text of rules of court adopted by the Virginia Supreme Court, see Volume 11. Editors note. Acts 2012, cc. 688 and 708, cl. 3 provides: That the Supreme Court of Virginia has prepared and adopted Rules of Evidence in accordance with its rulemaking au thority under § 8.01-3 of the Code of Virginia. Acts 2012, cc. 688 and 708, cl. 4 provides: That the Rules of Evidence prepared and adopted by the Supreme Court of Virginia have been submitted to and approv ed by the Virginia Code Commission as required by subsection E of § 8.01-3 of the Code of Virginia and by § 30-153 of the Code of Virginia. Acts 2012, cc. 688 and 708, cl. 5 provides: That, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection E of § 8.01-3 of the Code of Virginia and § 30-153 of the Code of Virginia, Rule 2:102 of the Rules of Evidence shall contain the following language, approved by the Supreme Court of Virginia, as its third sentence: Common law case authority, whether decided before or after the effective date of the Rules of Evidence, may be argued to the courts and considered in interpreting and applying the Rules of Evidence.  Acts 2012, cc. 688 and 708, cl. 7 provides: That the provisions of this act shall become effective on July 1, 2012, and that the Rules of Evidence shall becom e effective on July 1, 2012. Acts 2012, cc. 688 and 708, cl. 8 provides: That the Rules of Evidence shall be applicable in all proceedings held on or after the effective date of this act in any civil action or criminal case pending on that date or commenced thereafter. Acts 2012, cc. 688 and 708, cl. 9 provides: That in the event of any conflict between any enactment of the General Assembly and any rule contained in the Rule s of Evidence, the enactment of the General Assembly shall control. Acts 2020, Sp. Sess. I, c. 56, cl. 10 provides: That an emergency exists and the provisions of Enactment 9 of this act shall become effective on November 15, 2020, contingent upon the passage of an amendment to the Constitution of Virginia on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November 2020, establishing the Virginia Redistricting Commission by amending Section 6 of Article II and adding in Article II a ne w section numbered 6-A. If such amendment is not approved by the voters, the provisions of this act shall not become effective. The amendment passed and became effective November 15, 2020. The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 280, in subsection B, substituted availability for printing and distribution; maintenance by clerks of courts, 60 for sixty, and made available to all courts, members of the bar, and the public for printed and distributed as public documents pursuant to § 17.1-318. Such rules and amendments shall be maintained in a special book kept for such purpose by the clerks of court to which they are distributed. The 2012 amendments. The 2012 amendment by cc. 688 and 708 are identical, and deleted the subsection headings in subsections A through D; rewrote subsection E, which formerly read: The rules of evidence prepared by the Supreme Court shall be submitted to the Virginia Code Commission for approval as provided in § 30-153 and shall be codified upon enactment by the General Assembly; and added subsection F. The 2020 Sp. Sess. I amendments. The 2020 amendment by Sp. Sess. I, c. 56, cl. 9, effective November 15, 2020, inserted subsection B and redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly; and su bstituted subsection E for subsection D in subsection D. The 2022 Sp. Sess. I amendments. The 2022 amendment by Sp. Sess. I, c. 1 amended this section without change. Law Review.

Such rules shall be limited to those rules n ecessary to promote proper order and decorum and the efficient and safe use of courthouse facilities and clerks offices. No rule of any such court shall be prescribed or enforced which is inconsistent with this statute or any other statutory provisio n, or the Rules of Supreme Court or contrary to the decided cases, or which has the effect of abridging substantive rights of persons before such court. Any rule of court which violates the provisions of this section shall be invalid. The courts may prescribe certain docket control procedures which shall not abridge the substantive rights of the parties nor deprive any party the opportunity to presen t its position as to the merits of a case solely due to the unfamiliarity of counsel of record with any such docket control procedures. No civil matter shall be dismissed with prejudice by any district or circuit court for failure to comply with any rule created under this section. History History. Code 1950, § 8-1.3; 1970, c. 366; 1977, c. 617; 1999, c. 839; 2000, c. 803; 2014, c. 348. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-4 comports former § 8-1.3 with the 1973 district and circuit court reorganization acts. The phrase in former § 8-1.3 the orderly management of court dockets was omitted because it might lead to promulgation of local rules which would create lack of uniformity in procedure. Former § 8-4.3 (Order for medical examination. . .) has been deleted since in substance it has been incorporated in Rule 4:10. The 1999 amendment, effective July 1, 2000, rewrote this section, which formerly read: The district courts and circuit courts may, from time to time, prescribe for their respective districts and circuits such rules as may be reasonably appropriate to promot e proper order and decorum, and the convenient and efficient use of courthouses and clerks offices. No rule of any such court shall be prescribed or enforced which is inconsistent with any statutory provision, or the Rules of the Supreme Court, or co ntrary to the decided cases, or which has the effect of abridging substantive rights of persons before such Court. The 2000 amendments. The 2000 amendment by c. 803, in the first paragraph, substituted limited to those rules necessary for strictly limited to only those rules absolutely necessary in the second sentence and inserted or the Rules of Supreme Court in the third sentence; and added the second paragraph. The 2014 amendments. The 2014 amendment by c. 348 in the second paragraph added the last sentence. Law Review. For survey of Virginia law on practice and pleading for the year 1969-1970, see 56 Va.

CASE NOTES Rule may not add to statutes regulating practice of law by judges.  The General Assembly expressly limited its grant of rule-making power by excluding rules inconsistent with any statutory provision. The General Assembly h as seen fit to adopt statutes regulating the practice of law by judges of courts not of record. If rule adopted by judge adds to these regulations, the rule does not fall within his statutory rule-making power. Davis v. Sexton, 211 Va. 410, 177 S.E.2d 52 4, 1970 Va. LEXIS 262 (1970) (decided under prior law). Custom not sufficient evidence.  Trial court did not err, in the creditors promissory note action against the debtor, in denying the creditors post-verdict motion for attorney fees despit e the fact that a promissory note provision would permit the creditor to recover attorney fees; the debtor had a state constitutional and statutory right to have the issue of awarding attorney fees submitted to the jury, the jury considered the issue, an d the jury returned a verdict with its monetary award, and, thus, the creditor was not entitled to claim that a custom existed that the issue of attorney fees was decided in a post-verdict motion, especially since he did not offer evidence to support tha t claim. Lee v. Mulford, 269 Va. 562, 611 S.E.2d 349, 2005 Va. LEXIS 40 (2005). The practice of allowing any circuit judge to handle any probation violation does not vi olate § 17.1-503 as it pertains to this section. Gurley v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 166, 538 S.E.2d 361, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 836 (2000). Circuit court rule on homest ead exemptions.  Where Chapter 7 debtors timely delivered properly executed homestead deeds with fees paid to the county setting the property apart as exempt pursuant to §§ 34-6 and 34-17, but the debtors did not comply with a local county rule until the time period under § 34-17 had expired, the county rule did not render the claimed exemption void because enforcement of the local rule would have been inconsistent with the statutory provisions for claiming exemptions under Title 34 of the Virginia Code and would also have abridged the substantive rights of the debtors. In re Alley, 354 Bankr. 783, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 2976 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2006). Violation of scheduling order.  Trial court did not err in finding that the wife violated the scheduling order because her sworn answer regarding the value of the five excluded properties was th at the fair market values were unknown, and had to be determined by appraisal; her unknown answer and representation that the values would be determined by appraisal, which the husband fairly relied upon, were not formally updated until after the trial b egan; and, by the time the husband was aware of her position on the values of the excluded properties, it was too late for him to review and act on that information. Moore v. Moore, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 260 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 27, 2020). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Discretion in controlling cour ts docket.  Court continued the wifes jury trial pending resolution of the husbands appeals in two separate case as the husbands notice of appeal, as it pertained to the case in which the wifes jury trial was pending, was effectively interlocutory in nature, and had the husband properly effectuated an interlocutory appeal, the court would certainly be permitted to enter an order staying the proceedings; thus, under this statute, the court could stay the matter pending the outcome of the appeal in the sound exercise of its discretion in controlling its docket. Reese v. Priority Imps. Battlefield, Inc., 97 Va. Cir. 427, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 263 (Chesapeake Sept . 17, 2015). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Judges authority may not be dele gated.  While the chief judge and, collectively, the judges of a judicial circuit, do possess legal authority to establish rules regarding courthouse security, such power may not be delegated to a circuit court administrator. The chief judge and, collectively, the circuit judges, possess the legal authority to establish a general rule that cellular telephones are permitted in the courthouse. Nonetheless, the sheriff poss esses the legal authority to take action in any specific instance in which a cellular telephone causes a disturbance, or otherwise endangers public safety within the courthouse. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable William O. Watson, Sheriff, City of Portsmouth, 12-065, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 48 (7/12/13). Courthouse security.  While judges and sheriffs should work together to resolve any issues or concerns about courthouse security, judges retain rule-making authority over courthouse se curity, and the sheriff is responsible for enforcing the rules and responding to any security threats or disturbances. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Paul W. Higgs, Sheriff, City of Fredericksburg, 13-096, 2013 Va. AG LEXIS 93 (12/3/3). § 8.01-4.1. How jurisdiction determined when proceeding is on penal bond. Text When a proceeding before a court is on a penal bond, with condition for the payment of money, the jurisdiction shall be determined as if the undertaking to pay such mon ey had been without a penalty. And when jurisdiction depends on the amount of a judgment, if it be on such a bond, the jurisdiction shall be determined by the sum, payment whereof will discharge the judgment. History History. Code 1950, § 8-3; 1977, c. 617. Annotations CASE NOTES The claim that a bond sued on does not constitute a contract, but simply provides for a penalty, is unavailing to oust a court of equity of jurisdiction. Kabler v. Spencer, 114 Va. 589, 77 S.E. 504, 1913 Va. LEXIS 120 (1913) (decided under prior law). § 8.01-4.2. Who may execute bond for obtaining writ or order.

History History. Code 1950, § 8-96; 1954, c. 333; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-5 carries forward the policy of former § 8-96 by providing that parties may be added to or dropped from an action without prejudice until all part ies necessary for the just disposition of the case are before the court. See also Rules 2:15, 3:9A and 3:14 which provide for the addition of parties to an action. Omitted from § 8.01-5 are those parts of former § 8-96 which exempt a party from being added if the action could not be maintained against him for specifie d reasons  i.e. a new party who was neither a resident of the Commonwealth nor subject to service of process therein, or where the action was barred by the statute of limitation or under the provisions of Chapter 1 of Title 11 (Contracts  General Provisions).

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . The Virginia statutes are liberal in their provisions for adding new parties in cases of nonjoinder. McDaniel v. North Carolina Pulp Co., 198 Va. 612, 95 S.E.2d 201, 1956 Va. LEXIS 248 (1956), overruled, Harmon v. Sadjadi, 273 Va. 184, 639 S.E.2d 294, 2007 Va. LEXIS 1 (2007). The purpose of a former version of this section was to extend the power of the court by further providing that in any suit or action when it appeared there was a nonjoinder of necessary parties, then the court, in the exercise of its discretion, could compel the joinder of such parties, and not to end in one suit or action the rights of a p laintiff and the liabilities of those who otherwise might be defendants in future litigation. Hogan v. Miller, 156 Va. 166, 157 S.E. 540, 1931 Va. LEXIS 185 (1931). Nonjoinder defined.  Nonjoinder means that a party has been omitted who ought to be joined with an existing party, not substituted for an existing party. Bardach Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. T enenbaum, 136 Va. 163, 118 S.E. 502, 1923 Va. LEXIS 76 (1923). This section relates to nonjoinder and misjoinder, and not to substitution of one sole p laintiff for another sole plaintiff. Bardach Iron &amp; Steel Co. v. Tenenbaum, 136 Va. 163, 118 S.E. 502, 1923 Va. LEXIS 76 (1923). The word may means the same as shall in a statute of this kind which is in furtherance of justice. Lee v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Ass'n, 97 Va. 160, 33 S.E. 556, 1899 Va. LEXIS 23 (1899). This is purely a procedural statute and in no wise changes the nature of tort liability. The effect of the statute as to nonjoinder is that the omission of a defendant necessary for the maintenance of the plaintiffs action can be corrected by the method provided. Hogan v. Miller, 156 Va. 166, 157 S.E. 540, 1931 Va. LEXIS 185 (1931). Nonjoinder not grounds for dismissal.  The alleged nonjoinder of parties plaintiff was not a proper ground for dismissing action. Indeed, if the defendants had desired to pursue the matter, they and th e trial court should have followed the procedures set forth in the statute and the rule for determining whether the purported partners were necessary parties. Fox v. Deese, 234 Va. 412, 362 S.E.2d 699, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1248, 1987 Va. LEXIS 272 (1987). Misjoinder of parties should be raised by a motion to drop the improperly joined parties , not by a demurrer. Powers v. Cherin, 249 Va. 33, 452 S.E.2d 666, 1995 Va. LEXIS 17 (1995). Wards suit in own name not subject to amendment.  Under § 37.1-141, [now § 37.2-1026] any action on behalf of a ward must be brought by the wards guardian and this section did not permit amendment of a pleading to comply with the statute where a ward had attempted to bring suit in her own name. Cook v. Radford Community Hosp., Inc., 260 Va. 443, 536 S.E.2d 906, 2000 Va. LEXIS 133 (2000). Rule that cotrespassers jointly and severally liable not changed.  The settled rule in Virginia, which has not been disturbed by the enactment of this section, is that cotrespassers are jointly and severally liable, and the party injured may sue all of them jointly, or two or more of them jointly or one of them severally, as he may see proper; and § 8.01-443 fortifies this conclusion. Hogan v. Miller, 156 Va. 166, 157 S.E. 540, 1931 Va. LEXIS 185 (1931). Joinder of co-administrator.  This section § 8.01-5 permitted the joinder of a second co-administrator to a wrongful death action under the Virginia Wrongful Death Act, § 8.01-50, becaus e the first co-administrator was already a party plaintiff; the claims in the suit did not change as a result of the joinder; and the first co-administrators initial filing, without the second co-administrator, of the wrongful death claim tolled the statute of limitations for that claim under subsection B of § 8.01-244. Addison v. Jurgelsky, 281 Va. 205, 704 S.E.2d 402, 2011 Va. LEXIS 16 (2011). Insure r may be added as party defendant at its own request.  This section is undoubtedly for the benefit of the insurer and does not foreclose the right to be added as a party defendant at its request where it is clear that the insurer has a definite interest in the action. Matthews v. Allstate Ins. Co., 194 F. Supp. 459, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3267 (E.D. Va. 1961). Action of plaintiffs in making insurer a party defendant was premature where liability o f the insured had not been determined. Laws v. Spain, 51 F.R.D. 307, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10051 (E.D. Va. 1970). Even if a state court plaintiff wanted to name a defendants liability insurer as an additional defendant in an effort to have the duty to indemnify decision m ade in the same case, such state court plaintiff would be precluded from doing so because, in Virginia, an injured person must reduce his claim to judgment before bringing an action against the tortfeasors liability insurer; moreover, § 8.01-5, pr ohibits the joinder of an insurance company on account of the issuance of an insurance policy to or for the benefit of any party to any cause. Builders Mut. Ins. Co. v. Futura Group, L.L.C., 779 F. Supp. 2d 529, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45137 (E.D. Va. 2011 ). Joinder of an insurance company.  As Virginia law required a determination of the facts and reduction of a claim to judgment before the party alleging injury brought an action against an insurer, the legal analysis necessary for the duty to indemnify determination could not take place until after the ultimate factual findings were made in the state court suit. Builders Mut. Ins. Co. v. Futura Group, L.L.C., 779 F. Supp. 2d 529, 2011 U.S. Dist. LE XIS 45137 (E.D. Va. 2011). Section inapplicable to insurer prosecuting contribution suit between tort-feasors.  This section has no application to a situation where the sole real party in interest is an insurance company prosecuting a contribution suit between tort-feasors. Laws v. Spain, 51 F.R.D. 307, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10051 (E.D. Va. 1970). Limited liability company is necessary party in derivative action.  Limited liability company was a necessary party in a derivative action brought by one of the members against the other members, pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:12. Siska Trust v. Milestone Dev., 282 Va. 169, 715 S.E.2d 21, 2011 Va. LEXIS 180 (2011). Election of cause of action.  In an action for malicious prosecution against a corporation and a special officer employed by it, when it developed that plaintiffs causes of action were not the same as to both defendants, and that they could not properly be sued jointly as to two torts alleged to have been committed against plaintiff, plaintiff should have been required to elect which caus...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-6"><akn:num>§ 8.01-6</akn:num><akn:heading>Amending pleading; relation back to original pleading</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A misnomer in any pleading may, on the motion of any party, and on affidavit of the right name, be amended by inserting the right name. An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted, whether to correct a misnomer or otherwise, relates back to the date of the original pleading if (i) the claim asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth in the origin al pleading, (ii) within the limitations period prescribed for commencing the action against the party to be brought in by the amendment, that party or its agent received notice of the institution of the action, (iii) that party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and (iv) that party knew or should have known that but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against that party.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-276 obviates the need for reference to the former use of pleas in abatement for misnomer. Otherwise, § 8.01-6 does not change the substance of for mer § 8-97. Cross references. As to indictments, see §§ 19.2-216 through 19.2-238. The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendments by cc. 141 and 326 are identical, and in the last sentence, inserted or its agent in clause (ii), inserted the clause (iii) and (iv) d esignations, substituted party for he in clause (iii), substituted that party for he and that party for him in clause (iv), and made minor stylistic changes.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. Amendment to cure defect in signature on complaint does not relate back.  Because of the strong public policy considerations underlying § 8.01-271.1, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:4 and 1A:4(2), the Supreme Court of Virginia construes them to re quire that a lawyer who files a pleading in a Virginia tribunal must append his personal, handwritten signature to a pleading; thus, a complaint signed on behalf of a licensed Virginia attorney by an attorney not licensed in Virginia was a nullity and as none of the relation back situations for amending pleadings applied, the defect could not be cured by providing the appropriate signature. Shipe v. Hunter, 280 Va. 480, 699 S.E.2d 519, 2010 Va. LEXIS 231 (2010). Misnomer arises when the right person is incorrectly named, not where the wrong defendant is named. Swann v. Marks, 252 Va. 181, 476 S.E.2d 170, 1996 Va. LEXIS 80 (1996). The personal representative of a decedent and the decedents estate are two separate entities; the personal representative is a living individual while the estate is a collection of property. Thus, one cannot be substituted for another under the concept of correcting a misnomer. Swann v. Marks, 252 Va. 181, 476 S.E.2d 170, 1996 Va. LEXIS 80 (1996). This section was not applicable where a ward had attempted to bring suit in her own name as this was not a case in which the right person, that being the ward s guardian, was incorrectly named but one in which the wrong person, that being the ward, was named. Cook v. Radford Community Hosp., Inc., 260 Va. 443, 536 S.E.2d 906, 2000 Va. LEXIS 133 (2000). Trial court properly denied, for lack of standing, a bankruptcy debtors motions to amend the named plaintiff in her pleadings to her bankruptcy trustee, due t o a misnomer, or to be substituted as the proper plaintiff because not only did she fail to properly schedule her personal injury cause of action with the requisite specificity and affirmatively represented that no such existed in the area where the trus tee would expect to find any such causes of action, there was no misnomer inasmuch as the debtor and the trustee were not the same person, and since the debtor lacked standing to bring the suit, the trustee could not be substituted as the proper plaintif f. Ricketts v. Strange, 293 Va. 101, 796 S.E.2d 182, 2017 Va. LEXIS 5 (2017). In action seeking review of board of zoning appeals decision, circuit court properly denied petitioners motion to amend its petition to include city council a s party because reasonable reader would not understand that council was party against whom petitioner was bringing appeal as word council was not mentioned once in entire petition, but rather, petition made repeated references to Roanoke City , which, on its face, would indicate that petition was directed at city rather than council; Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-6 was inapplicable because Roanoke City was misnomer for city, not council, and because city was not proper party to petition , repeated references to Roanoke City amounted to a misjoinder. Marsh v. Roanoke City, 873 S.E.2d 86, 2022 Va. LEXIS 44 (Va. 2022). A misnomer is a mistake in name but not person. Rockwell v. Allman, 211 Va. 560, 179 S.E. 2d 471, 1971 Va. LEXIS 216 (1971). An amendment is permitted where the right party is before court, although under a wrong name. Rockwell v. Allman, 211 Va. 560, 179 S.E.2d 471, 1971 Va. LEXIS 216 (1971). But where the wrong person is named, it cannot be corrected by labelling it a misnomer. Rockwell v. Allman, 211 Va. 560, 179 S.E.2d 471, 1971 Va. LEXIS 216 (1971). No correction allowed for materi al error.  When the mistake in the name of a corporation, whether plaintiff or defendant, is slight, and it clearly appears what corporation is meant  or as it is someti mes expressed, where the pleading incorrectly names a corporation, but correctly describes it  the mistake is amendable. But where the error is so material (especially in the name of the defendant) that no such corporation exists, it is fatal at the trial; and the former version of this section does not obviate the result stated. Leckie v. Seal, 161 Va. 215, 170 S.E. 844, 1933 Va. LEXIS 313 (1933); Baldwin v. Norton Hotel, Inc., 163 Va. 76, 175 S.E. 751, 1934 Va. LEXIS 165 (1934). Naming locality instead of Board of Supervisors was not a misnomer.  First landowners bill of complaint challenging a boards issuance of a conditional use permit was dismissed with prejudice, as she failed to name the board as a party to the action, as required by subsection F of § 15.2-2285, and the terms locality and board of supervisors were not synonymous or interchangeable. Further, she could not employ the statutory remedy provided by § 8.01-6 f or correcting a misnomer. Miller v. Highland County, 274 Va. 355, 650 S.E.2d 532, 2007 Va. LEXIS 119 (2007). Language naming the decedents estate, administrator.  Trial court erred in finding that a decedents administrator was the defendant in a personal injury action as, although a motion to amend the judgment under su bdivision B 2 b of § 8.01-229 was proper, language naming the decedents estate, administrator, in the caption was ambiguous when the motion to amend the judgment was read as a whole; the wrong defendant was named, § 8.01-6 did not apply, and th e misjoinder could not be legitimized by substituting the correct party. Estate of James v. Peyton, 277 Va. 443, 674 S.E.2d 864, 2009 Va. LEXIS 60 (2009) (decided prior to enactment of § 8.01-6.3). When amendment to cure misnomer allowed notwithstanding statute of limitations.  If the right party is before the court although under a wrong name, an amendment to cure a misnomer will be allowed, notwithstanding the running of the statute of limitations, provided there is no change in the cause of action originally stated. Jacobson v. Southern Biscuit Co., 198 Va. 813, 97 S.E.2d 1, 1957 Va. LEXIS 143 (1957). There was no legislative intent to impair the protective preconditions Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-6 provided to a newly added defendant when a plaintiff corrected a misnomer, whether by amending the complaint or by taking a nonsuit and filing a new complaint against the correctly named defendant. Edwards v. Omni Int'l Servs., 301 Va. 125, 872 S.E.2d 428, 2022 Va. LEXIS 39 (2022). Omission of incorporated.  Where a corporation defendant is misdescribed simply by the omission of the word incorporated, and there is no other corporation of the name stated, the plaintiff should be permitted to insert the omitted word in the proper place in his declaration. Arminius Chem. Co. v. White's Adm'x, 112 Va. 250, 71 S.E. 637, 1911 Va. LEXIS 79 (1911). An action against a corporation in its former name cannot be defeated by showing that it had changed its name without any change of its membership. Welfley v.

Estabrooks, 61 Va. Cir. 724, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 315 (Fairfax County Dec. 12, 2002). Section inapplicable w here wrong party is sued.  Section § 8.01-6 was inapplicable where there was no evidence that a corporation doing business under a trade name was the right defendant; in filing a second suit, the injured party took the position that the correct defendant was a condominium unit owner association, not a corporation, and there was no evidence that the corporate name was merely an incorrect name for the condominium association. Gearing v. E very Citizen Has Opportunities, Inc., 59 Va. Cir. 41, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 118 (Loudoun County Mar. 19, 2002). In a motor vehicle accident case, defendants plea in bar was sustained as plaintiffs failure to name the correct defendant was a mistake in identification and was not a misnomer, but a misjoinder, because, when plaintiff named the drivers estranged ex-husband as the defendant, that was not a mistake in the spelling o...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-7"><akn:num>§ 8.01-7</akn:num><akn:heading>When court may add new parties to suit</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In any case in which full justice cannot be done, or the whole controversy ended, without the presence of new parties to the suit, the court, by order, may direct the c lerk to issue the proper process against such new parties, and, upon the maturing of the case as to them, proceed to make such orders or decrees as would have been proper if the new parties had been made parties at the commencement of the suit.

I.Decisions Under Current Law. Suit on behalf of child could not be brought by parents in own name.  Trial court properly dismissed a suit, as violative of § 8.01-8, brought by a minor childs parents in their own name as next friend of the child. Herndon v . St. Mary's Hosp., Inc., 266 Va. 472, 587 S.E.2d 567, 2003 Va. LEXIS 94 (2003). Parents may initiate action as childs next friend.  First sentence of § 8.01-8 authorizes a minor child to bring an action by his next friend, and the second sentence, when considered together with the first sen tence, does not plainly manifest an intent to authorize parents to bring a childs action in the parents own name, but merely specifies that either or both parents may act as next friend on behalf of their minor child; thus, the 1998 amendment to § 8.01-8 reflects the general assemblys intent to clarify the fact that either or both parents may initiate a single action as their childs next friend. Herndon v. St. Mary's Hosp., Inc., 266 Va. 472, 587 S.E.2d 567, 2003 Va. LEXIS 94 (2003). Mother of a handicapped child had standing to bring a claim, which challenged the handicap accessibility in the City of Richmond, in both an independent and repre sentational capacity under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 12131 et seq., had representational standing under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.S. § 794 and the Virginians with Disabilities Act of 1985, in that she was suing as her minor childs next friend, and alleged an injury in fact in that she sought prospective relief that would enable her and her son to attend events at schools city-wide in addition to those listed in the complaint. Bacon v. City of Richmon d, 386 F. Supp. 2d 700, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21376 (E.D. Va. 2005). Self-representing parents may not litigate their minor childrens claims.  Non-attorney parents generally may not litigate the claims of their minor children in federal court. Myers v. Loudoun County Pub. Schs, 418 F.3d 395, 2005 U.S. Ap p. LEXIS 16722 (4th Cir. 2005). Father, a non-attorney, was not authorized to litigate pro se the claim of his minor children that subsection C of § 22.1-202, which provided for daily, volunt ary recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in Virginias public schools, violated the Establishment Clause. Myers v. Loudoun County Pub. Schs, 418 F.3d 395, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 16722 (4th Cir. 2005). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Next friend need not be formally appointed.  Any person may bring a suit in the name of an infant as its next friend and ordinarily the court will recognize him as such next friend, and take cognizance of th e case as properly brought and prosecuted. If it appears to the court that the suit is not for the benefit of the infant or that the person named as next friend is not a suitable person for the purpose, the court may dismiss the suit without prejudice, o r assign another person to prosecute it as next friend of the infant, and the court may, if it think fit, direct an inquiry by a commissioner to ascertain whether the person prosecuting it as next friend is a fit person for the purpose. Wilson v. Smith, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 493, 1872 Va. LEXIS 41 (1872). According to the procedure in this jurisdiction, suits may be commenced and prosecuted by the next friend of an infant without previous appointment or formal orde r of admission. In such case the admission and approval by the court of the person acting as next friend is implied unless expressly disallowed. The courts are disposed to regard convenience and substance rather than form in mere matters of procedure. Ja ckson v. Counts, 106 Va. 7, 54 S.E. 870, 1906 Va. LEXIS 99 (1906). The practice in Virginia is for such suits to be instituted in the name of the infant by one of the parents or other near relative without formal appointment. If the suit or action proceeds without objection, it is a recognition by the court that the infant is a party to the proceeding. Womble v. Gunter, 198 Va. 522, 95 S.E.2d 213, 1956 Va. LEXIS 238 (1956) (commented on in 14 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 338 (1957)). The suit of an infant by his next friend must be brought in the infants name and not in that of the next friend, that is, the infant and not the next friend must be the real party plaintiff. And a suit in the name of the next friend on behalf of the infant cannot be maintained. Kirby v. Gilliam, 182 Va. 111, 28 S.E.2d 40, 1943 V a. LEXIS 138 (1943). This section requires that the suit be brought in the infants name and not that of the next friend when the infant is the real party plaintiff. Bolen v. Bolen , 409 F. Supp. 1371, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17130 (W.D. Va. 1976). And the consent of the infant is not necessary to authorize a suit on his behalf by a ne xt friend, but any person may file a bill on behalf of an infant and even against the latters will. Upon objection, the court will order an inquiry by a master to ascertain whether the suit is for the infants benefit and whether some other person is best entitled to act as prochein ami, and will make such order as seems best for the interests of the infant. Kirby v. Gilliam, 182 Va. 111, 28 S.E.2d 40, 1943 Va. LEXIS 138 (1943). Consent of the infant was not necessary for a suit to be maintained in her name by her next friend. Womble v. Gunter, 198 Va. 522, 95 S.E.2d 213, 1956 Va. LEXIS 238 (1956) (commented on in 14 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 338 (1957)). But infant must be real party plaintiff.  The mother of an infant consort cannot maintain in her own name an action to annul the marriage of her daughter. Kirby v. Gilliam, 182 Va. 111, 28 S.E.2d 40, 1943 Va. LEXIS 138 (1943). Infant is bound by s uit.  An infant, having sued under this section, is bound to the same degree, and the same extent as an adult. Gimbert v. Norfolk S.R.R., 152 Va. 684, 148 S.E. 680, 192 9 Va. LEXIS 201 (1929). In the absence of fraud an infant is as much bound by a decree or judgment of a court as is an adult. The law recognizes no distinction between a decree against a n infant and a decree against an adult, and, therefore, an infant can impeach it only upon grounds which would invalidate it in case of an adult party. Womble v. Gunter, 198 Va. 522, 95 S.E.2d 213, 1956 Va. LEXIS 238 (1956) (commented on in 14 Wash. &amp; L ee L. Rev. 338 (1957)). But decree may be vacated if section not followed.  In a suit by an infant seeking to annul her marriage, relief was denied because of the insufficiency of the evidence. The cause was instituted and prosecuted to f inal decree in the name of the infant instead of by her next friend, in spite of the provisions of this section. Because the failure to institute and prosecute the suit by a next friend cast substantial doubt on the validity of the decree, the Supreme Co urt remanded the cause with direction that the decree be vacated and the cause proceeded in by the next friend of the infant complainant. Kilbourne v. Kilbourne, 165 Va. 87, 181 S.E. 351, 1935 Va. LEXIS 275 (1935). And next friend cannot waive infants rights.  It is not competent for the next friend of infant plaintiffs to waive the rights of the latter, and it is error to decree on such waiver. Hite v. Hite, 23 Va. (2 Rand.) 409, 1824 Va. LEXIS 16 (1824); Armstrong's Heirs v. Walkup, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 372, 1852 Va. LEXIS 21 (1852). Dismissa l without prejudice.  If a suit be brought in the name of the next friend and not in the infants name, the suit must be dismissed without prejudice to the right of the next friend to refile the suit in the name of the infant. Bolen v. Bolen, 409 F. Supp. 1371, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17130 (W.D. Va. 1976). A child can maintain a suit for negligently inflicted prenatal injuries. Bolen v. Bolen, 409 F. Supp. 1371, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17130 (W.D. Va. 1976). Next friend should bring suit to annul marriage.  In this State an infant wife cannot bring suit in her own name to annul her marriage, but under this section must sue for this purpose by her next friend. Kirby v . Gilliam, 182 Va. 111, 28 S.E.2d 40, 1943 Va. LEXIS 138 (1943). Suits for personal injuries.  An action for an assault and battery committed upon an infant, ought not to be brought in the name of the guardian of such infant, but in the name of such infant by his or her next friend. Stewart v. Crabbin's Guardian, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 280, 1819 Va. LEXIS 6 (1819). Infants held bound by no contest provision in will.  Infant beneficiaries who joined in the contest of a will by their parents as next friends were bound by a no contest provision in the will equally with the adult contestants, where it was the testators clearly expressed intention to restrain all beneficiaries from a contest. Womble v. Gunter, 198 Va. 522, 95 S.E.2d 213, 1956 Va. LEXIS 238 (1956) (commented on in 14 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 338 (1957)).

A suit wher ein a person under a disability is a party defendant shall not be stayed because of such disability, but the court in which the suit is pending, or the clerk thereof, shall appoint a discreet and competent attorney-at-law as guardian ad litem to such def endant, whether the defendant has been served with process or not. If no such attorney is found willing to act, the court shall appoint some other discreet and proper person as guardian ad litem. Any guardian ad litem so appointed shall not be liable for costs. Every guardian ad litem shall faithfully represent the estate or other interest of the person under a disability for whom he is appointed, and it shall be the duty of the court to see that the interest of the defendant is so represented and prote cted. Whenever the court is of the opinion that the interest of the defendant so requires, it shall remove any guardian ad litem and appoint another in his stead. When, in any case, the court is satisfied that the guardian ad litem has rendered substanti al service in representing the interest of the person under a disability, it may allow the guardian reasonable compensation therefor, and his actual expenses, if any, to be paid out of the estate of the defendant. However, if the defendants estate is inadequate for the purpose of paying compensation and expenses, all, or any part thereof, may be taxed as costs in the proceeding. In a civil action against an incarcerated felon for damages arising out of a criminal act, the compensation and expenses o f the guardian ad litem shall be paid by the Commonwealth out of the state treasury from the appropriation for criminal charges. If judgment is against the incarcerated felon, the amount allowed by the court to the guardian ad litem shall be taxed agains t the incarcerated felon as part of the costs of the proceeding, and if collected, the same shall be paid to the Commonwealth. By order of the court, in a civil action for divorce from an incarcerated felon, the compensation and expenses of the guardian ad litem shall be paid by the Commonwealth out of the state treasury from the appropriation for criminal charges if the crime (i) for which the felon is incarcerated occurred after the date of the marriage for which the divorce is sought, (ii) for which the felon is incarcerated was committed against the felons spouse, child, or stepchild and involved physical injury, sexual assault, or sexual abuse, and (iii) resulted in incarceration subsequent to conviction and the felon was sentenced to confinem ent for more than one year. The amount allowed by the court to the guardian ad litem shall be taxed against the incarcerated felon as part of the costs of the proceeding, and if collected, the same shall be paid to the Commonwealth. B. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection A or the provisions of any other law to the contrary, in any suit wherein a person under a disability is a party and is represented by an attorney-at-law duly licensed to practice in this Commonwealth, who shall have ent ered of record an appearance for such person, no guardian ad litem need be appointed for such person unless the court determines that the interests of justice require such appointment; or unless a statute applicable to such suit expressly requires that t he person under a disability be represented by a guardian ad litem. The court may, in its discretion, appoint the attorney of record for the person under a disability as his guardian ad litem, in which event the attorney shall perform all the duties and functions of guardian ad litem.Any judgment or decree rendered by any court against a person under a disability without a guardian ad litem, but in compliance with the provisions of this subsection, shall be as valid as if the guardian ad litem had been appointed.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-9 combines former §§ 8-88 and 8-88.1. Former § 8-88 has been expanded to include all persons under a disability (as defined in § 8.01-2) whenever such persons are party defendants to a suit. Ot herwise this subsection is substantially the same as former § 8-88 except that unnecessary references to the judge in vacation have been eliminated, and it has been made clear that an attorney appointed as guardian ad litem is not liable for costs. Co mpensation and expenses of the guardian ad litem may be taxed as costs in the proceeding if the estate of the person under a disability is inadequate. Two principal changes have been made to former § 8-88.1. First, the provision permitting the court to dispense with the appointment of a guardian ad litem has been amended; if a statute requires in a particular suit that the guardian ad litem file an answer, see e.g. § 8.01-73, then one must be appointed under this section. Where a guardian ad litem is to be appointed, the second change permits the court t o appoint the attorney of record for the person under a disability. The attorney must be licensed to practice in Virginia. Former § 8-89 (When fact of defendants nonresidence to be returned, and suit abated) has been deleted as obsolete and unnecessary.

Legislative intent.  The General Assembly did not intend to require a circuit court to appoint a guardian ad item whenever the court issues a subpoena to compel a juveniles testim ony or where the circuit court initiates criminal contempt proceedings against the juvenile where juvenile is represented by counsel. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 318, 477 S.E.2d 7, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 651 (1996). Statute irrelevant to suits by persons under disabilities.  This section recognizes that persons under disabilities may be sued in their own names and is concerned with the protection of such persons by appointment of a gu ardian ad litem but nothing in the statute provides any basis for concluding that, in the converse situation, a suit in his own name by a person under a disability who has a duly appointed fiduciary is valid. Cook v. Radford Community Hosp., Inc., 260 Va . 443, 536 S.E.2d 906, 2000 Va. LEXIS 133 (2000). Section not applicable to criminal trial.  In trial for fraudulently obtaining an advance of payment for construction work to be performed in the future, in violation of § 18.2-200.1, defendants con tention that he was a person under a disability as defined by subdivision 6 a of § 8.01-2, and as such, was entitled to an appointment of a guardian ad litem pursuant to § 8.01-9, or a committee, pursuant to § 53.1-223, was without merit , as defendant introduced no evidence to show that he was in jail on a felony charge, and furthermore, these sections apply only to civil proceedings. Holsapple v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 480, 566 S.E.2d 210, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 376 (2002), aff'd, 39 V a. App. 522, 574 S.E.2d 756, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2003). In a construction fraud proceeding, defendant was not entitled to appointment of a guardian ad litem pursuant to this section or a committee, pursuant to § 53. 1-223 once the victim forwarded the notice requesting the return of construction funds she advanced to defendant, who was in prison; defendant did not shown he was imprisoned for a felony and could not be a person under a disability, and neither this sec tion nor § 53.1-223 applies to criminal proceedings.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Bond payable to administrator.  An administrator may declare in the debet and detinet on a bond executed to himself as such, and his executor or administrator has the right to bring an action up on it. Bowden v. Taggart, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 513, 1813 Va. LEXIS 7 (1813). Where an administrator is one of the obligors in a bond for the payment of a sum of mone y to the decedent he cannot maintain an action against his co-obligors to enforce the payment of the money. Rodes v. Rodes, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 256, 1874 Va. LEXIS 8 (1874). Where executor d ied before forthcoming bond taken.  An executor recovered judgment against a debtor of his testator, and sued out execution thereon. Before the execution was delivered to the sheriff, the executor d ied. The execution being then delivered to the sheriff, he levied it on property of defendant, and took a forthcoming bond payable to the executor in his official capacity. It was held that the execution was properly levied, though the executor was dead before it was delivered, and the forthcoming bond was rightly taken to the executor in his official capacity, and was good. Thereupon, a motion for award of execution on the forthcoming bond was made by the executor of aforesaid execution. It was held th at the forthcoming bond belonged to the original testators estate, and the second executor was entitled to the motion, and to award of execution on the bond, as the representative of the original testator, not as the representative of the first execu tor. Turnbull v. Clairborne, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 392, 1831 Va. LEXIS 59 (1831). Contribution and subrogation between partners not affected.  This section does not affect the rules as to contribution between partners and subrogation of a partner to the rights of partnership creditors whose debts he has paid. Sands v. Durham, 99 Va. 263, 38 S.E. 145, 1901 Va. LEXIS 38 (1901). Order of priority as to partners.  The social assets are applicable first to the social debts, and if insufficient, the social creditors come in as general creditors pari passu, with separate credi tors of the same class upon the separate estate of the deceased partner. This principle has the sanction of the deliberate and unanimous decision of this court in Ashby v. Porter, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 455, 465 (1875), and an implicit legislative adoption o f this section taken word for word, from section 13, chapter 144, Code of 1849, with the construction which it had received by this court, and that construction has been followed and reaffirmed by the court in the case of Robinson v. Allen, 85 Va. 721, 8 S.E. 835 (1889); Pettyjohn v. Woodruff, 86 Va. 478, 10 S.E. 715, 1890 Va. LEXIS 7 (1890). Section does not affect ma rshaling of assets.  This section does not change or affect the order in which the assets of the decedent are to be applied in the payment of debts as prescribed by § 64.1-157 [now § 64.2-528]. Robinson v. Allen, 85 Va. 721, 8 S.E. 835, 1889 Va. LEXIS 85 (1889). No r principle as to loss of remedy upon grounds not personal.  The statute in relation to joint obligations, though it gives an action against the personal representative of a deceased joint obligor, does not affect the princ iple that the defeat of the remedy against one joint obligor upon a ground not personal to himself, defeats it as to all obligors. Brown v. Johnson, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 644, 1857 Va. LEXIS 25 (1857). Pendency of two suits.  Where two suits having same object are pending, a decree in one for account, suspends the other. A suit to administer a deceased partners separate property fo r his separate creditors, and a suit to administer partnership property for the partnership creditors, not having the same object, this rule does not apply.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Equity rule modified.  The equitable rule that a suit in equity must invariably be brought in the name of the real party in interest and not in the name of another has been modified and changed in Virginia by this section. Stuart Court Realty Corp. v. Gillespie, 150 Va. 515, 143 S.E. 741, 1928 Va. LEXIS 332 (1928). Suit by assignee/real estate broker.  A real estate broker brought his action for commissions against the administrator of a landowner. The landowner had placed his property in the hands of another br oker for sale, who had asked plaintiff to assist him in making a sale and agreed to share commissions with him. It was held that the contract between the brokers was in effect an equitable assignment by the original broker to plaintiff of a one-half inte rest in the contract with the landowners, and that the plaintiff, under this section, had the right to maintain an action in his own name to enforce the collection of his commission against the landowners administrator. Arwood v. Hill's Adm'r, 135 Va . 235, 117 S.E. 603, 1923 Va. LEXIS 11 (1923). Assignment of judgment does not carry right to sue sheriff.  The assignment of a judgment does not carry with it, as an incident, the right to sue the sheriff and the sureties on his official bond for a breach of the condit ion thereof occurring prior to the assignment. Commonwealth v. Wampler, 104 Va. 337, 51 S.E. 737, 1905 Va. LEXIS 104 (1905). Pleading and practic e.  In an action in the name of one for the use of another, it is usual to state the fact in the declaration, or on it, or on the writ. But this is not necessary. The indorsement may be made at any time during the progress of the suit. It is sometimes not made until after execution is issued, which is then indorsed for the benefit of the party for whose benefit the suit was brought. Hayes v. Virginia Mut. Protection Ass'n, 76 Va. 225, 1882 Va. LEXIS 23 (1882) (see also Clarksons v. Doddridge, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 42 (1857); Fadeley v. Williams, 96 Va. 397, 31 S.E. 515 (1899); Consumers Ice Co. v.

I.General Consideration. Editors note. Many of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, sometimes refers to former provisions. This section does not create any new cause of action, and has no application to cases in which there is no assignment. Commonwealth v. Wampler, 104 Va. 337, 51 S.E. 737, 1905 Va. LEXIS 104 (1905). Applicable to law, not equity, actions.  The terminology of this section connotes its applicability to actions at law rather than to suits in equity. Moreover, there is a valid distinction between the ac crual of the equitable, inchoate right to contribution that arises at the time of jointly negligent acts and the maturation of the right to recover contribution that arises only after payment of an equally large share of the common obligation. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Minnifield, 213 Va. 797, 196 S.E.2d 75, 1973 Va. LEXIS 234 (1973). It is limited in its application to nonnegotiable instruments, and cannot be construed t o apply to negotiable instruments negotiated after maturity, because an instrument negotiable in its origin continues to be negotiable until it has been restrictively indorsed or discharged by payment or otherwise. Stegal v. Union Bank &amp; Fed. Trust Co., 163 Va. 417, 176 S.E. 438, 1934 Va. LEXIS 194 (1934). This section does not apply to negotiable paper, though such paper has been transferred after due. Davis v. Miller, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 1, 1857 Va. LEXIS 21 (1857) . It imposes no conditions on the assignees right to sue, but allows the assignee to b ring in his own name any suit which the assignor may have brought. United States ex rel. Shade Shop, Inc. v. R.B. McDanel Co., 16 F. Supp. 905, 1936 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1907 (D. Va. 1936). Section enacted primarily for benefit of plaintiff.  The history of this section shows that it was enacted primarily for the benefit, convenience and protection of the plaintiff or an assignee of the plaintiff, and not for the benefit or protection of the defendant whose rights are amply safeguarded. Miller v. Tomlinson, 194 Va. 367, 73 S.E.2d 378, 1952 Va. LEXIS 240 (1952). Rules of evi dence not changed.  This section cannot be construed to change the rules of evidence applicable. Noland Co. v. Wagner, 153 Va. 254, 149 S.E. 478, 1929 Va. LEXIS 261 (1929). As to history of former law, see Carozza v. Boxley, 203 F. 673, 1913 U.S. App. LEXIS 118 7 (4th Cir. 1913). II.What May Be Assigned. Assignable rights of action.  A right of action for mere personal torts, such as assault and battery, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, defamation and deceit, which die with the party and do not survive, cannot be assigned, but a right of action to recover damages for an injury to property, real or personal, may be assigned. Dillard v. Collins, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 343, 1874 Va. LEXIS 63 (1874); Norfolk &amp; W.R.R. v. Read, 87 Va. 185, 12 S.E. 395, 1890 Va. LEXIS 108 (1890). A right of action in pending suit against railroad company for negligently setting fire to plaintiffs property may be assigned in whole or in part. Tyler v. R icamore, 87 Va. 466, 12 S.E. 799, 1891 Va. LEXIS 95 (1891). When a lower proprietor of land is damaged by the permanent diversion of water from a stream by a city, and after the diversion such proprietor sells and conveys his property thus damaged to a third person and assigns to him all the assignors rights which belonged to the owner of the property at the time of the diversion, the purchaser is thus clothed with all rights which belonged to the owner at the time of diversion, and has the right to recover the damages resulting from such diversion. Such damages are a legitimate subject of assignment, and it is immaterial that the assignee was also the grantee of the land who purchased it at a reduced price in conseq uence of the diversion. City of Lynchburg v. Mitchell, 114 Va. 229, 76 S.E. 286, 1912 Va. LEXIS 131 (1912). A right of action against a common carrier for injury to goods while in course of transportation is assignable. Norfolk &amp; W.R.R. v. Read, 87 Va. 185, 12 S.E. 395, 1890 Va. LEXIS 108 (1890). Legal malpractice claims not assignable.  Estate beneficiary lacked standing to pursue a legal malpractice claim against the attorney representing her mothers estate because § 8.01-13 did not abrog ate the common-law rule prohibiting the assignment of legal malpractice claims, and the attorney represented the estate, not the beneficiary. Johnson v. Hart, 279 Va. 617, 692 S.E.2d 239, 2010 Va. LEXIS 55 (2010). Indemnitors as assignees of right of contribution against joint tort-feasors.  Under this section and § 55-22, an action was properly brought by a transit company to secure contribution from other joint tort-feasors for the benefit of ins urance companies that had indemnified the transit company for a settlement made with a passenger injured in one of its buses. The indemnitors were assignees and the beneficial owners of the right of the transit company to enforce contribution against suc h tort-feasors, and they had the right to proceed in the name of the transit company for their own use and benefit. McKay v. Citizens Rapid Transit Co., 190 Va. 851, 59 S.E.2d 121, 1950 Va. LEXIS 175 (1950). Assignment of benefits payable to an insured under a health insurance policy is a contin gent entitlement to certain benefits, i.e., an entitlement which may or may not vest sometime in the future. That entitlement, however, is one coupled with an interest, an interest derived from contract. As such, it is a proper subject of assignment. Kel ly Health Care, Inc. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 226 Va. 376, 309 S.E.2d 305, 1983 Va. LEXIS 294 (1983). Health care provider was held not to be an assignee of an insureds benefits under a health insurance policy where one of the documents on which it relied did no more than appoint the health care provider as the insureds special agent with entitlement to collect payments from the insurer as the insureds entitlements fell due and the other document granted the insurer authority in the nature of a power of attorney to make such payments. Kelly Health Care, Inc. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 226 Va. 376, 309 S.E.2d 305, 1983 Va. LEXIS 294 (1983). A contingent or future interest may be assigned. Prince v.

Co., 112 Va. 630, 72 S.E. 129, 1911 Va. LEXIS 129 (1911). Mechanics lien.  The contract and mechanics lien under the statute may be assigned, and the assignee may enforce the lien in the same mode that the mechanic might do it. Iaege v. Bossieux, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 83, 1859 Va. LEXIS 5 (1859). Open accounts.  A debt due from another, though evidenced by an open account, is a chose in action, and the beneficial owner thereof may maintain an action therefor in his own na me under this section. Phillips v. City of Portsmouth, 115 Va. 180, 78 S.E. 651, 1913 Va. LEXIS 21 (1913). Under this section an ordinary running account between parties, showing an alleged indebtedness from the one to the other, is assignable. Porter v. Young, 85 Va. 49, 6 S.E. 803, 1888 Va. LEXIS 10 (1888). Personal service con tracts.  Where the personal services of another are expressly contracted for, or are necessarily involved in the subject matter of the contract, the contract is founded on personal trust and confidence, and is not assignable until the services have been performed. Epperson v. Epperson, 108 Va. 471, 62 S.E. 344, 1908 Va. LEXIS 55 (1908); McGuire v. Brown, 114 Va. 235, 76 S.E. 295, 1912 Va. LEXIS 132 (1912). III.What Constitutes an As signment. A.In General.

Long v. Pence, 93 Va. 584, 25 S.E. 593, 1896 Va. LEXIS 115 (1896) (decided under prior law). Note necessary as evidence.  In a proceeding by an assignee of a note against a remote assignor to recover on the contract implied by the assignment, the note is a necessary piece of evidence for the plaintiff in order to prove the assignment, and also to show the measure of plaintiffs recovery.

Ed. 710, 1934 U.S. LEXIS 413 (1934). Unincorporated association defined.  The words unincorporated association denote a voluntary group of persons joined together by mutual consent for the purpose of promoting some stated object ive. Such an association suggests an organized group made up of persons who become members of the association voluntarily, but subject to certain rules or bylaws; the members are customarily subject to discipline for violations or non-compliance with the rules of the association.

In any lega l proceeding commenced anonymously, any party may move for an order concerning the propriety of anonymous participation in the proceeding. The trial court may allow maintenance of the proceeding under a pseudonym if the anonymous litigant discharges the burden of showing special circumstances such that the need for anonymity outweighs the publics interest in knowing the partys identity and outweighs any prejudice to any other party. The court may consider whether the requested anonymity is inten ded merely to avoid the annoyance and criticism that may attend any litigation or is to preserve privacy in a sensitive and highly personal matter; whether identification poses a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm to the requesting party or to i nnocent nonparties; the ages of the persons whose privacy interests are sought to be protected; whether the action is against a governmental or private party; and the risk of unfairness to other parties if anonymity is maintained. B. If the cour t initially permits a party to proceed anonymously, the issue of the propriety of continued anonymous participation in the proceedings may be raised at any stage of the litigation when circumstances warrant a reconsideration of the issue. In all cases, a ll parties have the right to know the true identities of all other parties under such provisions of confidentiality as the court may deem appropriate. C. If the cour t orders that the anonymous litigant be identified, the pleadings and any relevant dockets shall be reformed to reflect the partys true name, and the identification shall be deemed to relate back to the date of filing of the proceeding by the anonymo us party. D. In any lega l proceeding in which a party is proceeding anonymously, the court shall enter appropriate orders to afford all parties the rights, procedures and discovery to which they are otherwise entitled.

CASE NOTES Standing to bring federal claim.  Because plaintiff, classified as a sexually violent offender, alleged harm from not being able to access church property (due to Sunday schools) or the property o f defendant school board under subsection A of § 18.2-370.5, but she had not attempted to petition a state court (which she could have done anonymously), the board, or the churches, for access as provided in §§ 8.01-15.1 and 18.2-370.5, she lack ed standing to bring claims of constitutional violations under U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV, based on not being able to associate with the school community and not being able to attend churches of her choosing. Doe v. Va.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Motion to proceed under a pseu donym denied.  Injured partys motion to proceed under a pseudonym in an action against a minister alleging sexual molestation and assault was denied, because the injured par ty failed to meet the requirements set out in § 8.01-15.1, as the injured party failed to show that her identification posed a risk of retaliation, and allowing the injured party to proceed under a pseudonym could have caused a risk of unfairness to t he minister. Doe v. Briscoe, 61 Va. Cir. 96, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Roanoke Apr. 24, 2003). Special circumstances not proven .  Unnamed person did not satisfy any of the factors to weigh in order to satisfy the burden imposed under this section to show special circumstances that ou tweighed the publics interest in knowing the identity of a petitioner and prejudice to the petitioner to allow anonymity because § 46.2-208, which protected disclosure of driving records, applied only to Department of Motor Vehicles and not court proceedings. Doe v. Commonwealth, 85 Va. Cir. 419, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 151 (Richmond Oct. 9, 2012). While the churches could amend their pleadings, their special pleas and motions to dismiss were overruled because their special pleas attempted to attack a fact t hat the sexual-abuse victim would be required to prove in order to prevail on the merits, the burden to establish the employment or agency relationship between a former pastor and churches fell to the victim not the churches, and the churches were entitl ed to identification of the victim since she did not present any evidence in support of maintaining anonymity or that special circumstances outweighed the publics interest in knowing her identity.

The term this section, as used below, may refer to former provisi ons. Death after notice of appeal.  Where plaintiffs death occurred after the trial court lost jurisdiction of his action and after the notice of appeal had been filed, the appeal was ordered to proceed in the decedents name as if the death had not occurred. Locke v. Johns-Manville Corp., 221 Va. 951, 275 S.E.2d 900, 1981 Va. LEXIS 233 (1981). Death after appeal allowed.  Where an appeal is allowed or writ of error awarded before the death of a party to a suit or action, the case is from that moment a case pending in the appellate court, and under this section there is no abatement in the appellate court because of the death. The same was very nearly true at common law. The statute effected no other change in the procedure than that it expressly leaves it to the discretion of the appellate court, where the death is made known to such court and is suggested on its record, to proceed with the case and enter judgment or decree as if such death had not occurred; whereas prior to the statute, a practice had grown up requiring, in case of death of either party, if made known to the appellate court and suggested on its record, a revival of the appeal or writ of error by consent. Poff v. Poff, 128 Va. 62, 104 S.E. 719, 1920 Va. LEXIS 93 (1920). Although the appellant died during the pendency of an appeal, the appeal did not abate. The Supreme Court of Virginia retained jurisdiction and entered judgment a s if such event had not occurred. Kambis v. Considine, 290 Va. 460, 778 S.E.2d 117, 2015 Va. LEXIS 165 (2015). Death before appeal allowed.  Where the death of a party to a suit or action occurs before an appeal is allowed or writ of error is awarded, the suit or action abates as to the deceased party. If an appeal or writ of error is sought in behalf of the estate of such deceased party, the application must be made by petition of his representative. Poff v. Poff, 128 Va. 62, 104 S.E. 719, 1920 Va. LEXIS 93 (1920). An appeal or writ of error cannot be granted to one who is dead and the appellate court is without authority under this section to enter judgment in a case in whi ch the appellate proceedings were begun after the death of the alleged plaintiff in error. Booth v. Dotson, 93 Va. 233, 24 S.E. 935, 1896 Va. LEXIS 69 (1896). Applicability.  Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-20 has no application when a death occurs before an appeal or writ of error is awarded. Loewinger v. Estate of Loewinger, 64 Va. App. 1, 7 63 S.E.2d 826, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 345 (2014). Divorce suit.  In a suit for divorce by a wife against her husband, the trial court decreed a divorce to the husband on his cross-bill. The husband died pending appeal by his wi fe after the case was argued and submitted to the Supreme Court. By virtue of this section the appellate court may, in its discretion, enter its decree dealing with the adjudications of the original decree as if no death of any party to the cause had occ urred. Cumming v. Cumming, 127 Va. 16, 102 S.E. 572, 1920 Va. LEXIS 29 (1920). Suggestion of bankruptcy.  In a proceeding for refund of taxes a District of Columbia corporation obtained a decree declaring an Arlington County license tax invalid and a refund was paid b y the county. Pending the countys appeal counsel for the corporation filed a suggestion of bankruptcy and made a motion for dismissal. The rules of court being inapplicable to actions for refund of taxes, it was held under this section that the mere suggestion of bankruptcy when no motion had been made to substitute the trustee and no formal proof of bankruptcy or any stay order by the bankruptcy court had been offered did not justify dismissal of the appeal. County Bd. v. Kent Stores of Wash., Inc. , 196 Va. 929, 86 S.E.2d 44, 1955 Va. LEXIS 163 (1955). § 8.01-20.1. Certification of expert witness opinion at time of service of process. Text Every motion for judgment, counter claim, or third party claim in a medical malpractice action, at the time the plaintiff requests service of process upon a defendant, or requests a defendant to accept service of process, shall be deemed a certification that the plaintiff has obtained from an expert witness whom the plaintiff reasonably believes would qualify as an expert witness pursuant to subsection A of § 8.01-5 81.20 a written opinion signed by the expert witness that, based upon a reasonable understanding of the facts, the defendant for whom service of process has been requested deviated from the applicable standard of care and the deviation was a proximate ca use of the injuries claimed. This certification is not necessary if the plaintiff, in good faith, alleges a medical malpractice action that asserts a theory of liability where expert testimony is unnecessary because the alleged act of negligence clearly lies within the range of the jurys common knowledge and experience. The certifying expert shall not be required to be an expert witness expected to testify at trial nor shall any defendant be entitled to discover the identity or qualifi cations of the certifying expert or the nature of the certifying experts opinions. Should the certifying expert be identified as an expert expected to testify at trial, the opinions and bases therefor shall be discoverable pursuant to Rule 4:1 of the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia with the exception of the experts status as a certifying expert. Upon written request of any defendant, the plaintiff shall, within 10 business days after receipt of such request, provide the defendant with a certification form that affirms that the plaintiff had obtained the necessary certifying expert opinion at the time service was requested or affirms that the plaintiff did not need to obtain a certifying expert witness opinion. The court, upon good cause shown, may conduct an i n camera review of the certifying expert opinion obtained by the plaintiff as the court may deem appropriate. If the plaintiff did not obtain a necessary certifying expert opinion at the time the plaintiff requested service of process on a defendant as r equired under this section, the court shall impose sanctions according to the provisions of § 8.01-271.1 and may dismiss the case with prejudice.

CASE NOTES Expert testimony required to prove medical malpractice.  In a Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.S. § 2671 et seq., action, an inmate alleged that the prison medical staff negligently failed to diagnose and tre at his neurological impairment; however, the undisputed facts demonstrated: (i) that the inmate did not comply with Virginias expert certification requirement, § 8.01-20.1; and (ii) that the inmate could not establish medical malpractice without t he aid of expert testimony, as the matter was not one in which the act or omission was clearly negligent within the common knowledge of laymen. In essence, the case foundered on the absence of an expert witness for the inmate and the governments moti on for summary judgment was granted. Parker v. United States, 475 F. Supp. 2d 594, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12760 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 251 Fed. Appx. 818, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 24838 (4th Cir. 2007). Circuit court properly dismissed, with prejudice, a patients medical malpractice action against a family practice physician because the patient failed to desi gnate an expert to testify concerning proximate causation of her injuries where, although the patient alleged that the physician engaged in conduct involving unsolicited and unwanted sexual comments and innuendo and made vulgar and inappropriate comments that aggravated her preexisting conditions of post-traumatic stress disorder, fibromyalgia, depression, and radiculopathy, a lay jury was not equipped from common experience with the knowledge of what could cause the aggravation of complex preexisting m edical problems.

Sections 8.01-21, 8.01-25, 8.01-50, and 8.01-56 compared.  The requirements of the survival and wrongful death statutes, §§ 8.01-25, 8.01-50 and 8.01-56, apply when the death occurs before a final verdict, whereas t his section applies where the death occurs after the verdict. Boyd v. Bulala, 647 F. Supp. 781, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18099 (W.D. Va. 1986), amended, 678 F. Supp. 612, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186 (W.D.

Sections 8.01-25 and 8.01-56 are not in conflict with this section. They were enacted to extend the application of § 8.01-50, the wrongful death statute, those situations not covered by the original Lord Campbells Act, in which a plaintiff who has filed an action for personal injuries, dies of those injuries before a verdict is retur ned. It was unnecessary at common law to amend, revive, or convert the action of the party who survived the return of a verdict, and it is equally unnecessary under the present statutory scheme. Bulala v. Boyd, 239 Va. 218, 389 S.E.2d 670, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1399, 1990 Va. LEXIS 44 (1990). Death of child aft er medical malpractice verdict.  Death of a child born with birth defects after a medical malpractice verdict did not require converting her claim into one for wrongful death. This section direc tly so provides, by directing that in such cases, judgment may be entered as if [death] had not occurred. Sections 8.01-25 and 8.01-56 are not in conflict. They deal with the situation where death occurs before verdict. Boyd v. Bulala, 905 F.2d 764, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 9498 (4th Cir. 1990). Death of plaintiff after trial not grounds for new trial or admission of new evidence.  Motion by defendant in medical malpractice action either to grant a new trial or to open the record to admit new evidence, which motion was prompted by the death of the infant plaintiff some six weeks after the trial, on grounds that had she died before trial, the parents could not have recovered certain elements of damages, including her future medical costs, was denied. Under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59 and 60(b)(2), newly discovered evidence must pertain to facts which existed at the time of trial. Were the rule otherwise, litigation would never end. Moreover, this section specifically provides for the entry of judgment when a party dies after the ver dict. Boyd v. Bulala, 672 F. Supp. 915, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10455 (W.D. Va. 1987). Convict s privilege to waive appointment of committee.  There are no statutes or rules to deny a convict, already within the civil jurisdiction of the court at the time of his felony conviction and incarceration, the p rivilege of waiving the appointment of a committee and proceeding to trial and judgment in a law action in which he is represented by counsel of his own choosing.

History History. Code 1950, § 8-146; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Since Rules 2:16 and 3:15 provide an adequate procedure for substitution of a party if he dies, etc., former § 8-146 is altered to give the court discretion to halt the entire proceedings pending the appointment of a successor or to permit the action to proceed against the living parties severing the decedent and preserving a separate action as to him. Since § 8.01-25 provides that all actions survive, the provision in former § 8-146 regarding the question of survivability has been deleted. Cross references.

CASE NOTES Before appeal is allowed.  Where the death of a party to a suit or action occurs before an appeal is allowed or writ of error is awarded, the suit or action abates as to the deceased party. If an appeal or writ of error is sought in behalf of the estate of such deceased party, the application must be made by petition of his representative. Poff v.

As used in this section, the term death shall include the death of an individual or the termination or dissolution of any other entity. History History.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE The section removes various limitations imposed by case and statutory law and provides that all causes of action survive the death of the plaintiff or defendant. Cf. § 64.1-145. Thus the former problem of determining what was indirect and direct injury to property has been eliminated and with it the question of determining whether there was a statute of limitations of one or five years. Compare, e.g., Cover v. Critcher, 143 Va. 357, 130 S.E. 238 (1925), with Trust Co. v. Fletcher, 152 Va. 868, 148 S.E. 785 (1929), and Worrie v. Boze, 198 Va. 533, 95 S.E.2d 192, affd on rehearing, 198 Va. 891, 96 S.E.2d 799 (1957). See Herndon v. Wickham, 198 Va. 824, 97 S.E.2d 5 (1957) and annotations under former §§ 8-628.1 and 8-24. The first proviso pertaining to the award of punitive damages codifies case law. See Dalton v. Johnson, 204 Va. 102, 129 S.E.2d 647 (1963). The second proviso codifies case law that the Virginia wrongful death statute is not a survival statute but creates a new right in the personal representa tive of the decedent who dies as a result of a previous tortious injury. Grady v. Irvine, 254 F.2d 224 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 358 U.S. 819, 79 S. Ct. 30, 3 L. Ed. 2d 60 (1958); Wilson v. Whittacker, 207 Va. 1032, 154 S.E.2d 124 (1967). Formerly, in the absence of statute, only causes of action which survive may be assigned. Winston v. Gordon, 115 Va. 899, 80 S.E. 756 (1914); City of Richmond v .

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Legislative intent.  It was the obvious intent of the legislature to give to survivors of decedents the cause of action set forth in this section rather than have it expire upon the d eath of the party having same. In re Musgrove, 7 Bankr. 892, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 5203 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). The sweeping language of the opening sentence of this section manifests an intent to preserve a right of recovery after the death of either or both of the parties in interest, while the subsequent limiting language has the effect of confining wrongful death relief to that allowable under the wrongful death statutes. Miltier v. Beorn, 696 F. Supp. 1086, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11549 (E.D. Va. 1988). Sections 8.01-21, 8.01-50, 8.01-56 and this section compared.  The requirements of the survival and wrongful death statutes, §§ 8.01-50, 8.01-56 and this section, apply when the death occurs before a final verdict, wher eas § 8.01-21 applies where the death occurs after the verdict. Boyd v. Bulala, 647 F. Supp. 781, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18099 (W.D. Va. 1986), amended, 678 F. Supp. 612, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186 (W.D. Va. 1988), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 877 F.2d 1191, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 8364 (4th Cir. 1989). This section and § 8.01-56 are not in conflict with § 8.01-21. They were enacted t o extend the application of § 8.01-50, the wrongful death statute, those situations not covered by the original Lord Campbells Act, in which a plaintiff who has filed an action for personal injuries, dies of those injuries before a verdict is ret urned. It was unnecessary at common law to amend, revive, or convert the action of the party who survived the return of a verdict, and it is equally unnecessary under the present statutory scheme. Bulala v. Boyd, 239 Va. 218, 389 S.E.2d 670, 6 Va. Law Re p. 1399, 1990 Va. LEXIS 44 (1990). Death of a child born with birth defects after a medical malpractice verdict did not require converting her claim into one for wrongful death. Section 8.01-21 di rectly so provides, by directing that in such cases, judgment may be entered as if [death] had not occurred. This section and § 8.01-56 are not in conflict. They deal with the situation where death occurs before verdict. Boyd v. Bulala, 905 F.2d 764, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 9498 (4th Cir. 1990). Section changes common law.  Prior to this section, no action for personal injuries not resulting in death could be maintained against the wrongdoer unless such action was brought by the inju red party prior to his death. Predecessor versions of this section changed this rule of common law. Sherley v. Lotz, 200 Va. 173, 104 S.E.2d 795, 1958 Va. LEXIS 173 (1958) (decided under prior law). Statute of limitations not changed.  There was no intent on the part of the legislature when it enacted the former version of this section to change the statute of limitations from one to five years on causes of action for personal injury. Herndon v. Wickham, 198 Va. 824, 97 S.E.2d 5, 1957 Va. LEXIS 145 (1957); Sherley v. Lotz, 200 Va. 173, 104 S.E.2d 795, 1958 Va. LEXIS 173 (1958) (decided under prior law). Standing.  Testators daughters did not have standing to bring the claims asserted because the testators son remained the personal representative of the testators estate, and he was the only party entitled to bring suit on behalf of the estate; the daughters claims relating to the rescission of inter vivos transfers were inherently on behalf of the estate as they would have belonged to the testator during his lifetime. Platt v. Griffith, 299 Va. 690, 858 S.E.2d 413, 2021 Va. LEXIS 59 (2021). Any claim for the rescission of a transaction between the decedent and a trustee belonged to the decedents estate as it would have belonged to the decedent, a nd, upon the decedents death, any viable claim relating to the sale of the decedents minority interest in a limited liability company passed to the decedents estate and only may have been pursued by the estates personal representative. Th us, the remainder beneficiaries, neither of whom was the personal representative of the decedents estate, lacked standing to bring such a claim. Kittrell v. Fowler, 301 Va. 25, 870 S.E.2d 210, 2022 Va. LEXIS 18 (2022). The cause of action that this section provides shall not be lost is not a new cause. Bagl ey v. Weaver, 211 Va. 779, 180 S.E.2d 686, 1971 Va. LEXIS 265 (1971) (decided under prior law). It is the same cause of action that an injured person was prosecuting or could have prosecuted prior to his death from an unrelated cause. Bagley v. Weaver, 211 Va. 779, 180 S.E.2d 686, 1971 Va. LEXIS 265 (1971) (decided under prior law). Acti ons that survive must exist prior to decedents death.  Survival of actions is limited to those that existed prior to a decedents death; where estate executor alleged that legal malpractice in drafting the decedents testamentary instruments had caused the estate additional tax liability, since damages due to the alleged legal malpractice did not arise until after the decedents death, the cause of action did not survive and its dismissal was affirme d. Rutter v. Jones, Blechman, Woltz &amp; Kelly, P.C., 264 Va. 310, 568 S.E.2d 693, 2002 Va. LEXIS 101 (2002). Choice of recovery t heory in malpractice action.  The plain language contained in this section and § 8.01-56 unequivocally mandates that a person may not recover for the same injury under the survival statute and the wrongful death statute. There can be but one recovery. Hence, the plaintiffs, as a matter of law, could not have recovered in the underlying tort action against defendants on both theories of wrongful death and survival. Therefore, in malpractice action, at an appropriate time after discovery has been completed, the plaintiffs must be required to elect whether they wil...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-26"><akn:num>§ 8.01-26</akn:num><akn:heading>Assignment of causes of action</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Only those causes of action for damage to real or personal property, whether such damage be direct or indirect, and causes of action ex contractu are assignable. The p rovisions of this section shall not prohibit any injured party or his estate from making a voluntary assignment of the proceeds or anticipated proceeds of any court award or settlement as security for new value given in consideration of such voluntary as signment. History History. 1977, c. 617; 1991, c. 256. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Formerly, the test of assignability was survival, and only those causes of action which would survive to the personal representative were assignable; actions whic h survived and therefore were assignable were those which grew out of breach of contract or were for direct injury to real or personal property. See Winston v. Gordon, 115 Va. 899, 80 S.E. 756 (1914); Richmond Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Laburnum Cons tr. Corp., 195 Va. 827, 80 S.E.2d 574 (1954). Section 8.01-25 allows all causes of actions to survive. Section 8.01-26 separates the issue of assignability from that of survival  i.e. no longer will an ac tion be assignable simply because it survives. Instead, unless the action falls within § 8.01-26, it is not assignable even though it is an action which survives under § 8.01-25. However, with the exception of the elimination of the illogical disti nction between direct and indirect damage to property, the section codifies existing case law on the assignment of actions. See Birmingham v. Chesapeake &amp; O.R.R., 98 Va. 548, 37 S.E. 17 (1900) also cited in Maynard v. General Elec. Co., 486 F.2d 538 at 5 40 (5th Cir. 1973); Friedman v. Peoples Serv.

Bankruptcy, §§ 59, 67, 79, 93; 18 M.J. Subrogation, § 2. CASE NOTES Tort claims for interference with business are assignable, since the right to do busines s is a valuable property right. Grey Line Auto Parts, Inc. v. Snead, 1 Bankr. 551, 1979 Bankr. LEXIS 753 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1979). Claim under Federal Employ ers Liability Act.  The language of this section makes it clear that an unliquidated and contingent claim such as a Federal Employers Liability Act claim is neither assignable nor su bject to the reach of creditor process under Virginia law and is therefore exempt property pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 522(b)(2)(A). In re Musgrove, 7 Bankr. 892, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 5203 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1981). Legal malpractice claims not ass ignable.  Section specifying which causes of action are assignable does not abrogate the common law rule which prohibits the assignment of legal malpractice claims. MNC Cre dit Corp. v. Sickels, 255 Va. 314, 497 S.E.2d 331, 1998 Va. LEXIS 49 (1998). Estate beneficiary lacked standing to pursue a legal malpractice claim against the attorney representing her mothers estate because § 8.01-26 precluded ass ignment of legal malpractice claims, and in any event, the attorney represented the estate, not the beneficiary. Johnson v. Hart, 279 Va. 617, 692 S.E.2d 239, 2010 Va. LEXIS 55 (2010). Assignment of settlement proceeds or insurance benefits distinguished.  Although this section prohibits the assignment of a cause of action for personal injuries, there is a legally significant distinction between an assignment of a p ersonal injury cause of action and an assignment of the settlement proceeds or insurance benefits thereof. Community Hosp. v. Musser, 24 Bankr. 913 (W.D. Va. 1982). Assignment of proceeds of personal injury cause of action sub judice is permissible. In r e Duty, 78 Bankr. 111, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1523 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1987). Applicability to hospitals seeking recovery limited to value of services actually rendered.  The reasons underlying the common-law rule against assignment of tort claims (now codified in this section), namely, the prevention of champerty and maintenance, do not support its application to hospitals seeking recoveries limited to the value of services actually supplied to the debtors, where the debtors retained complete control over their personal injury cases, the hospitals rights exist only in the pro ceeds, not in the debtors causes of action, and the hospitals had no right to proceed against the third-party tort-feasors even if the debtors decided not to pursue their tort claims. Community Hosp. v. Musser, 24 Bankr. 913 (W.D. Va. 1982). Equitable assignment to hospital of sums to be recovered from tort-feasor.  The prohibition against assignments of causes of action for personal injury does not proscribe a hospital from obtaining an equitable assignment of the sums to be recovered by an individual from a tort-feasor to the extent of the value of the services provided by the hospital in treatment of the individuals personal injuries. Community Hosp. v. Musser, 24 Bankr. 913 (W.D. Va. 1982). Contract claims for real e state commissions.  Because assignments of individual real estate agents contract claims against their former employer to their new employer were permissible and because the appl icable Virginia Real Estate Regulations neither expressly, nor implicitly by their purpose, prohibited the assignment of claims of this sort, the assignments were valid under Virginia law. Long &amp; Foster Real Estate, Inc. v. NRT Mid-Atlantic, Inc., 357 F. Supp. 2d 911, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2524 (E.D. Va. 2005). Assignment of personal injury claim invalid where import of act not understood.  Purported assignment of a personal injury claim executed by a native of the Philippines with a halting grasp of English at the direction of the hospital which was treating him for his extensive injuries, the import of which was not understood by the assignor, was invalid under this section. Roanoke Mem. Hosp. Ass'n v. Baylon, 21 Bankr. 54, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 4705 (Bankr. W.D. Va.), aff'd, 24 Bankr. 913, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15805 (W.D. Va. 1982). A cause of action for wrongful death is an asset of the bankruptcy estate and may not be assigned. In re Tidwell, 19 Bankr. 846, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 4257 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). Guarantors claim.  Co-guarantor of debtors obligation to a lender was properly assigned the right to enforce the nondischargeability, under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(4), of the de btors guaranty of the same debt under §§ 8.01-26 and 49-27, and a settlement agreement with the lender. Padgett v. Hadley (In re Hadley), No. 09-73717-FJS, No. APN: 09-07140-FJS, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 3188 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Aug. 19, 2011). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Warranty claims are ex-contractu and assignable.  Warranty (including implied warranty) claims are considered ex contractu and are therefore assignable under § 8.01-26. Bay Point Condo. Ass'n v. RML Corp., 57 Va. Cir. 295, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 10 (Norfolk Jan. 28, 2002). Assignment of personal injury claim valid and enforceable despite bankruptcy discharge.  Injured plaintiff had executed, in favor of a hospital to which she owed medical bills, an assignment of the proceeds of any personal injury award she recovered. The assignment survived plaintiffs bankruptcy discharge and was valid, because the assignment of the proceeds of a personal injury award, which are uncertain and contingent, is not the same as the assignment of a personal injury cause of action, whic h is barred by § 8.01-26. Dodd v. Lang, 71 Va. Cir. 235, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 151 (Roanoke June 29, 2006). No assignment of cause of action.  Banks demurrer to a sons conversion claim was sustained because only the personal representative of a decedents estate had standing to bring the claim ; a reading of the power of attorney the decedent gave the son was clear that the son was given authority to sue in the decedents name, but the conversion suit was brought in the sons personal capacity, and there was no allegation that any cause of action was assigned to him personally. Lance v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 99 Va. Cir. 115, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Chesapeake Feb. 21, 2018). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Assignment of medical benefits p ayments.  Assignments of medical benefits payable under automobile insurance policies where the policyholder assigns these benefits to a chiropractor who provided treatment covered by the policy are enforceable. Provisions of insurance contracts seeking to limit or preclude this kind of assignment are unenforceable so long as the assignment does not materially alter the risk or obligation of the insurer.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . The purpose of this section, like that of its ancestors, is to expedite the adjudication of certain claims for the payment of money by preventing the delay that results from the dilatory assertion of sham defenses. Sheets v. Ragsdale, 220 Va. 322, 257 S.E.2d 858, 1979 Va. LEXIS 267 (1979). This section was intended to prevent delay caused to plaintiffs by continuances upon dil atory pleadings when no real defenses exist, and to simplify and shorten the proceedings. Grigg v. Dalsheimer, 88 Va. 508, 13 S.E. 993, 1891 Va. LEXIS 63 (1891); L.E. Mumford Banking Co. v. Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank, 116 Va. 449, 82 S.E. 112, 1914 Va. LEX IS 50 (1914); Gehl v. Baker, 121 Va. 23, 92 S.E. 852, 1917 Va. LEXIS 5 (1917). Section and Rule 1:10 construed to gether.  This section, relating to when a plaintiff is to be granted judgment in an action for payment of money in which the defendant fails to deny plaintiffs claim u nder oath, and Rule 1:10, providing that the statutory benefit provided a plaintiff will be waived unless the plaintiff timely claims it, read together in light of their respective histories and prevailing case law, are fully compatible and complementary . This section creates only an optional benefit; Rule 1:10 simply defines one mode of waiver. Sheets v. Ragsdale, 220 Va. 322, 257 S.E.2d 858, 1979 Va. LEXIS 267 (1979). Substantial compliance is sufficient .  This section was enacted to prevent the filing of sham pleadings merely for delay, and a substantial compliance with its provisions is all that is required. Carpe nter v. Gray, 113 Va. 518, 75 S.E. 300, 1912 Va. LEXIS 66 (1912); Paris v. Brown, 143 Va. 896, 129 S.E. 678, 1925 Va. LEXIS 312 (1925) (see also, Levitin v. Norfolk Natl Bank, 163 Va. 694, 177 S.E. 205 (1934)). And strict rule as to affidavits is not to be applied.  The strict rule applied in construing affidavits in attachment cases in equity, where the jurisdiction of the court is involved, is not to be applied to the affid avit allowed by this section. Carpenter v. Gray, 113 Va. 518, 75 S.E. 300, 1912 Va. LEXIS 66 (1912). The affidavit need not in express terms state that the affiant is the plaintiff in the a ction, but is sufficient if the language plainly shows that fact. Carpenter v. Gray, 113 Va. 518, 75 S.E. 300, 1912 Va. LEXIS 66 (1912). It should state time from which interest is claimed.  The affidavit filed with a motion under this section should state the time from which the plaintiff claims interest. Merriman Co. v. Thomas &amp; Co., 103 Va. 24, 48 S.E. 490, 1904 Va. LEXIS 3 (1904). And time stated in affidavit is controlling.  The fact that an account filed with a motion claimed interest from January 1, 1910, did not affect the validity of the affidavit filed under this section, which c laimed interest from March 1, 1910, since the date fixed by the latter was in favor of the defendant, and would control in entering up judgment if no defense was made. Carpenter v. Gray, 113 Va. 518, 75 S.E. 300, 1912 Va. LEXIS 66 (1912). Defendant must file written pleading denying indebtedness.  The final sentence of the statute and the appended revisers note make it evident that the legislative purpose is to place upon the defendant the burden of fil ing a written pleading under oath, denying his indebtedness, if he wishes to preclude the entry of judgment on the affidavit without further evidence. Snead v. Bendigo, 240 Va. 399, 397 S.E.2d 849, 7 Va. Law Rep. 812, 1990 Va. LEXIS 139 (1990). Affidavit of bookkeeper is insuf ficient.  This section requires the affidavit of the plaintiff or his agent, and, in the absence of evidence on the subject, a bookkeeper will not be held to be suc h agent. Merriman Co. v. Thomas &amp; Co., 103 Va. 24, 48 S.E. 490, 1904 Va. LEXIS 3 (1904); Taylor v. Sutherlin-Meade Tobacco Co., 107 Va. 787, 60 S.E. 132, 1908 Va. LEXIS 141 (1908). An affidavit that the matters stated in the annexed pleadings are true is a subs tantial compliance with the provisions of this section. Jackson v. Dotson, 110 Va. 46, 65 S.E. 484, 1909 Va. LEXIS 115 (1909). Section may be waived.  A plaintiff in an action may waive, or be estopped from asserting, his right to have judgment entered in his favor for the amount claimed by him in the affidavit filed with his motion, although the defendant has failed to comply with the provisions of this section entitling him to make defense to the claim asserted, and such waiver may be express or implied. Carpenter v. Gray, 113 Va. 518, 75 S.E. 300, 1912 Va. L EXIS 66 (1912). The benefit this section bestows is not self-executing; it becomes available to the plaintiff only if he elects to claim it and does so in the manner the section prescribes. Even then, the statutory benefit is not an indefeasible right, but the verification requirement may be waived by the plaintiff either expressly or by implication, or he may by his conduct be estopped to take advantage of it. Sheets v. Ragsdal e, 220 Va. 322, 257 S.E.2d 858, 1979 Va. LEXIS 267 (1979). Failure to move to strike unverified pleading within seven days held waiver.  Where plaintiff failed, under Rule 1:10, to move to strike defendants pleading for want of verification within seven days after it was filed, plaintiff waived the verification requirement and the trial court erred in granting default judgment. Sheets v. Ragsdale, 220 Va. 322, 257 S.E.2d 858, 1979 Va. LEXIS 267 (1979). Plaintiff may be estopped from claiming benefits of this section. L.E. Mumford Banking C o. v. Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank, 116 Va. 449, 82 S.E. 112, 1914 Va. LEXIS 50 (1914). Consenting to or a ccepting continuance is waiver.  A plaintiff may, either expressly or by implication, waive compliance on the part of the defendant with the requirements of this section, or may by his conduct be estopped from taking advantage of its terms. Consenting to, or accepting without objection, a continuance of the case, are familiar methods of waiving the provisions of the section. Gehl v. Baker, 121 Va. 23, 92 S.E. 852, 1917 Va. LEXIS 5 (1917). Failure to object to unsworn pleadin gs.  This section is for the benefit of the plaintiff, and may be waived by him, and it will be deemed to have been waived where he not only makes no objection when th e pleading is tendered without a sufficient affidavit, but accepts without objection a continuance of the case until the next term of the court, with leave to the defendant to file within fifteen days his grounds of defense. Jackson v. Dotson, 11 0 Va. 46, 65 S.E. 484, 1909 Va. LEXIS 115 (1909).

The jury impaneled in any such action shall ascertain the damages sustained, or the sum due, by reason of the breaches assigned, and judgment shall be entered for the penalty, to be discharged by the payment o f what is so ascertained, and such further sums as may be afterwards assessed. Motion may be made by any person injured against the defendant and, for what may be assessed or found due upon the new breach or breaches assigned, execution may be awarded. History History. Code 1950, § 8-513; 1954, c. 333; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE The only significant change to former § 8-513 is the elimination of the reference to the writ of scire facias; § 8.01-24 has replaced it with a simple motio n. Other language of former § 8-513 has been deleted as unnecessary. Cross references. For rule of court as to commencement of civil actions, see Rule 3:2. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 5A M.J. Covenant, Action of, § 2; 5C M.J. Debt, Action of , § 4. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. It is at least doubtful whether this section was intended to apply to actions on official bonds, although, in regard to such bonds, it has been held that the judgment ought to be entered in the form provided in this section. Sangster v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 124, 1866 Va. LEXIS 12 (1866). And ju dgment does not preclude other actions on such bond.  In no case has it been decided that where a judgment on an official bond has been so entered, it is a bar to any other action on the bond, and precludes any other recovery upon it than by motion for judgment. Sangster v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 124, 1866 Va. LEXIS 12 (1866). Form of judgment.  In an action upon a sheriffs bond in the name of the Commonwealth, for the benefit of a person aggrieved by the misconduct of the sheriff, the judgment should be entered for the penalty, to be discharged by the payment of the damages assessed and costs, and such other damages as may be hereafter assessed upon suing out a scire facias, and assigning new breaches, by the said [person aggrieved], or any othe r person or persons injured. Bibb v.

Such dismissal or discontinuance of the action as to any defendant shall not operate a s a bar to any subsequent action which may be brought against him for the same cause. History History.

Process, § 5. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Section changes the common law.  In an action ex contractu against several defendants, the common-law rule was that all should be summoned actually, or constructively by prosecution to outlawry, before judgment could be had against any. This section changes this for another rule, whereby judgment may be had against one defendant served with process, and a discontinuance as to the others, or at the plaintiffs election, subsequent service of p rocess and judgment, in the same suit, against the other defendants. Bush v. Campbell, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 403, 1875 Va. LEXIS 27 (1875). Bankruptcy court properly held that a judgment against the husband did not extinguish the wifes liability for a joint credit card debt because the statute alt ered common law, allowing joint debtors to be sued individually or in any combination or seriatim, and the creditors judgment against the husband did not merge the cause of action as to the wife. Guertler v. DuPont Cmty. Credit Union, 552 Bankr. 140, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35039 (W.D. Va. 2016). Judgment may be rendered against defendant served with process.  Where only one of several defendants has been served with process, judgment may be rendered against him. Norfolk &amp; W.R.R. v. Shippers Compress Co., 83 Va. 272, 2 S.E. 139, 1887 Va. LEXIS 63 (1887). Where in an action against seven joint obligors, summons was returned executed as to four, and No inhabitants as to two, and as to the other, I unders tand he is dead, and at rules the six pleaded for misjoinder of surviving obligors with a dead obligor, and the clerk abated the action as to those returned No inhabitants, and the dead one, the court committed no error in rejecting t he pleadings and entering judgment against the four who had been summoned. Dillard v. Turner, 87 Va. 669, 14 S.E. 123, 1891 Va. LEXIS 119 (1891). And case discontinued as to those not served.  The discontinuance provided for by this section is a discontinuance as against any one or more defendants upon whom process had not been served. Corbin v. Planter s Nat'l Bank, 87 Va. 661, 13 S.E. 98, 1891 Va. LEXIS 118 (1891). One of sev eral persons jointly liable may be sued alone.  In view of § 8.01-5 and this section, there is no merit in an objection by a defendant in an action upon a contract that his liability is joint with another, t hat such person was a necessary party and that defendant could not be sued alone. Reed &amp; Rice Co. v. Wood, 138 Va. 187, 120 S.E. 874, 1924 Va. LEXIS 21 (1924). Judgment may be had against sureties though principal not served.  Judgment on a forthcoming bond may be had against the sureties under this section, though the principal has never been served with notice of a motion for an award of execution on the bond. Newberry v. Sheffey, 89 Va. 286, 15 S.E. 548, 1892 Va. LEXIS 96 (1892). And against some of stockholders jointly liable on subscription.  Since the obligation of a subscriber to stock to contribute to the amount of his subscription for the purpose of the payment of debts is contractual, and arises f rom the subscription to the stock, there can be no doubt of the right of a plaintiff under this section to proceed to judgment against a part of the defendants jointly liable for a subscription without proceeding against the others. Chisholm v. Gilmer, 8 1 F.2d 120, 1936 U.S. App. LEXIS 3407 (4th Cir.), aff'd, 299 U.S. 99, 57 S. Ct. 65, 81 L. Ed. 63, 1936 U.S. LEXIS 944 (1936). And plai ntiff may recover entire claim from one obligor.  Where two clients jointly accept services rendered by an attorney, it is proper to charge that the attorney may recover the entire amount of the fee from either o f the two clients, under this section, if he elects to sue one of them only. Culbert v. Hutton, 138 Va. 677, 123 S.E. 367, 1924 Va. LEXIS 58 (1924). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Res judicata. When an insured nonsuited an insurer from the insureds declaratory judgment action and the insurer was dismissed before a final judgment was entered, because the insurer was not involved in the first complaint when that complaint was decided on the merits, the doctrine of res judicata did not bar the insured from prosecuting a second complaint for breach of contract against the insurer.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  This statute does not apply only to commercial or income-producing property. Gaynor v. Hird, 15 Va. App. 379, 424 S.E.2d 240, 9 Va. Law Rep. 611, 1992 Va. App. LE XIS 289 (1992). Because a Chapter 7 trustee by statute had the powers of a hypothetical judgment lien creditor, his powers were not addressed in § 8.01-31, which addressed the potential rights of one joint tenant against another. Scott v. Hoole (In re Hoole), No. 17-50262, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 810 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Mar. 21, 2018). Availability.  There is no indication in the statute or in Virginia decisional law that the General Assembly intended § 8.01-2 to supplant the well-settled common law pursuan t to which an accounting is available to redress a breach of the fiduciary responsibility inherent in an agency relationship or in the special relationship shown to have existed between husband and wife in the instant case. McClung v. Smith, 870 F. Supp. 1384, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18453 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd in part, 89 F.3d 829, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 34515 (4th Cir. 1996). Debtor failed to state an equitable accounting claim because she did not allege that a mortgage lender acted as a fiduciary. Rivera v. JP Morgan Chase Bank (In re Rivera), No. 13-14351-BFK, No. 13-01280, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 344 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Jan. 27, 2014). Executor of decedents estate may seek accounting from trustees.  Executor of the estate of a decedent who was a lifetime beneficiary of a marital trust had standing to seek an accounting from the trustees as to their administra tion of the trust during the decedents lifetime, because he succeeded to the decedents § 8.01-31 right to an accounting by virtue of the survival provisions of § 8.01-25. Campbell v. Harmon, 271 Va. 590, 628 S.E.2d 308, 2006 Va. LEXIS 52 (2 006). By incorporating the powers listed in § 64.1-57 [now § 64.2-105], a testator does not thereby exclude all other powers granted by law from the execu tor. The right to compel an accounting from trustees is such an other power granted by law pursuant to §§ 8.01-31 and 8.01-25. Campbell v. Harmon, 271 Va. 590, 628 S.E.2d 308, 2006 Va. LEXIS 52 (2006). Upon div orce, marital home fell within scope of section.  Upon parties divorce, their marital home, which they had owned as tenants by the entirety, became their property as tenants in common, and thus fell within th e scope of this section. Gaynor v. Hird, 15 Va. App. 379, 424 S.E.2d 240, 9 Va. Law Rep. 611, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (1992). Reach of Gaynor.  Gaynor v. Hird, 15 Va. App. 379, 424 S.E.2d 240 (1992), which involved an accounting in equity pursuant to this section, after the parties property was converted from ownership as tenants by the entirety to ownership as tenants in common, does not requir e an accounting of rental value pre-divorce when the parties own the property as tenants by the entirety. Longmyer v. Longmyer, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 347 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 1995). Rent al value award to non-occupying ex-spouse permissible.  Where upon their divorce, the parties owned marital residence as tenants in common, and husband was required to bear his share of the financial burden of owning t he property, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding husband one-half of the reasonable rental value of the marital home for the period it was occupied exclusively by wife following their divorce. Ashley v. Ashley, No. 0851-93-1 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 30, 1993). When, instead of renting it out, the co-tenant in possession occupies and uses the whole property to the exclusion of his co-tenants, and thus, in effect, becomes himself the renter, the just and true rule is to charge him with a reasonable rent for the use and occupation of the property in the condition in which it was when he received it, and to hold him accountable to his co-tenants for their just shares of such rent. Gaynor v. Hird, 15 Va. App. 379, 424 S.E.2d 240, 9 Va. Law Rep. 611, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (1992). Non-occupying cotenant.  Because a non-occupying cotenant was never excluded or ousted from co-occupation of the property, she was not entitled to a ratable share of the fair rental value from the occupying cotenant. However, the occupying cotenant was entitled to one-half of the rental payments made by a non-owner occupant, namely the occupying cotenants son. Daly v. Shepherd, 274 Va. 270, 645 S.E.2d 485, 2007 Va. LEXIS 91 (2007). Former spouse not entitled to rental value where not co-owner.  An accounting occurs and a party is entitled to the fair market rental value of property only when that party has joint ownership of the property; where the owner s former wife conceded that the property was titled solely in her former husbands name, she was not entitled to an award based on the propertys rental value because she was not an owner of the property. Snider v. Snider, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 1 9 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 16, 2001). Responsibi lity of cotenants for taxes and other liens.  Unless something more can be shown than the mere fact that one cotenant is in possession of the premises, each cotenant should be ratably responsible for taxes an d other liens against the property. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 211 Va. 797, 180 S.E.2d 516, 1971 Va. LEXIS 268 (1971) (decided under prior law). Cotenant who discharges an encumbrance upon common property is entitled to ratable contribution from his cotenant. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 211 Va. 797, 180 S.E.2d 516, 1971 Va. LEXIS 268 (1971) (decided under prior law). The central characteristic of a tenancy in common is simply that each tenant is deemed t o own by himself, with most of the attributes of individual ownership, a physically undivided part of the entire parcel. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 211 Va. 797, 180 S.E.2d 516, 1971 Va. LEXIS 268 (1971) (decided under prior law). Husband entitled to evidentiary hearing to determine costs caused by former wifes delay in sale.  Where the wifes conduct delayed the sale of the marital residence, thereby allegedly causing the husband to make additional payments on the property, includin g the mortgage for which the husband was solely reasponsible, the husband, as tenant in common pursuant to § 20-111, was entitled under § 8.01-31 to an evidentiary hearing as to whether the husband was entitled to contribution from the wife, who wa s ratably responsible for the propertys costs. Morris v. Morris, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 447 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 2004). It is not the purpose of the equitable distribution scheme to deprive an aggrieved spouse of a generally recognized remedy for the misapplication or misappropriation of separate funds entrusted to the other spouse pursuant to a special relationship. McClung v. Smith, 870 F. Supp. 1384, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18453 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd in p art, 89 F.3d 829, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 34515 (4th Cir. 1996). Spouse not exempted.  There is no authority which, in the name of furthering marital harmony, would exempt from the remedy of an accounting a spouse who has been entrusted with the sep arate funds of another for a limited purpose and misapplied them. McClung v. Smith, 870 F. Supp. 1384, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18453 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd in part, 89 F.3d 829, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 34515 (4th Cir. 1996). Class action.  Force-pooled lessors, but not voluntary lessors, met federal class certification requirements on claims for breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and unjust enric hment arising from alleged underpayment of royalties by natural gas production companies; moreover, an equitable accounting claim was suitable for bifurcated liability and damages proceedings. Adair v. EQT Prod. Co., 320 F.R.D. 379, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46464 (W.D. Va. 2017). Counterclaim sufficiently stated claim for equitable accounting.  Circuit court erred in sustaining a trustees demurrer to a remainder beneficiarys counterclaim seeking an equitable accounting pursuant to § 8.01-31 be cause the properly pleaded facts in the beneficiarys third amended counterclaim, accepted as true, were sufficient to state a claim that the trustee, as a fiduciary, received more than comes to her just share; the circuit court erred in considering t he trustees accounting because it was neither an exhibit accompanying the pleading nor a document produced in response to a motion craving oyer. Riverside Healthcare Ass'n v. Forbes, 281 Va. 522, 709 S.E.2d 156, 2011 Va. LEXIS 90 (2011). Costs denied.  Sibling was properly ordered to bear the costs of the partition suit under § 8.01-31 where the majority of the costs related to her failed attempt to recover t he propertys fair rental value from three of the siblings in possession of the property. Berry v. Fitzhugh, 299 Va. 111, 846 S.E.2d 901, 2020 Va. LEXIS 94 (2020).

Annotations REVISERS NOTE The catchline of former § 8-517 has been changed to emphasize the real purpose of this statute which is to permit an action on lost instruments that were evide nces of debt. The former words or defendants and order awarding were deleted as unnecessary. (With respect to the deletion of or defendants see § 1-13.15.) The cross reference to the UCC was corrected. The 2000 amendments. The 2000 amendment by c. 245 substituted is for be following if judgment in the first sentence of the first paragraph and substituted  § 8.3A-309 for § 8.3-804 in the second paragraph. The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 125 rewrote the section. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 8A M.J. Executors and Administrators, § 104; 9B M.J.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Purpose of section.  This section was enacted to authorize the maintenance of an action at law on any past due lost bond, note, or other written evidence of debt, and to requi re a proper indemnity for the defendants protection. Prior to its adoption, an action at law could be maintained on lost bonds and lost choses in action of any kind, provided they were not negotiable. If the paper was negotiable, and there was ample proof that it was destroyed, an action at law could likewise be maintained; but upon negotiable paper which was simply lost or mislaid and not destroyed, no action at law would lie. In such actions as were allowed no indemnifying bond was required. Bicke rs v. Pinnell, 199 Va. 444, 100 S.E.2d 20, 1957 Va. LEXIS 209 (1957). Section does not affec t jurisdiction of equity.  Courts of equity still have jurisdiction to enforce payment of a lost bond, although courts of law are given jurisdiction over such bonds by this section, for it is well settled that courts of equity having once acquired jurisdiction never lose it because jurisdiction of the same matters is given to courts of law, unless the statute conferring such jurisdiction uses prohibitory or restrictive words. Kabler v. Spe ncer, 114 Va. 589, 77 S.E. 504, 1913 Va. LEXIS 120 (1913). Claim against decedents estate evidenced by lost instrument.  This section does not expressly or impliedly deprive a commissioner of accounts of the express and specific authority conferred on him under §§ 64.1-171, 64 .1-172 and 64.1-173 [now §§ 64.2-550 and 64.2-552] to receive proof of debts and demands against a decedent or his estate in the settlement of the accounts of a personal representative of a decedent. Bickers v. Pinnell, 199 Va. 444, 100 S.E.2d 20, 1957 Va. LEXIS 209 (1957). There was no merit in the contention that because the note evidencing a debt of a decedent was lost, the creditor was required to bring an action under this secti on against the executor, and precluded from proving her claim before a commissioner of accounts under §§ 64.1-171 through 64.1-173 [now §§ 64.2-550 and 64.2-552].

For related discussion, see 2A M.J. Assignments, § 38; 7A M.J. Equity, §§ 6, 10 . CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The object of this section was to provide against the abuse of crowding the chancery court with suits by assignees upon plain bonds, but out of abundant caution the provision was extended, and very properly, to a mere transferee or holder of a bond or other writing. Winn v. Bowles, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 23, 1817 Va. LEXIS 51 (1817); Walters v. Far mers Bank, 76 Va. 12, 1881 Va. LEXIS 69 (1881). But equity, having taken jurisdiction on other grounds, will retain it.  This section was not intended to affect the principle that when the court has once rightly obtained cognizance of the controversy and of the parties, its power is effectual for complete relief. Walters v. Farmers Bank, 76 Va. 12, 1881 Va. LEXIS 69 (1881). And equi ty has jurisdiction of suit by partial assignee.  For the enforcement of payment of a part of a debt assigned by the creditor without the assent or acceptance of the debtor, there is no jurisdiction in a court of law, but such partial recovery may be had in a court of equity. Phillips v. City of Portsmouth, 112 Va. 164, 70 S.E. 502, 1911 Va. LEXIS 67 (1911). Section is not applicable to promise to assume mortgage debt.  This section has no application to a suit brought upon the promise of defendants to assume the payment of a mortgage debt, which promise was implied by law from t heir acceptance of a writing not signed by defendants, conveying the property to them subject to the mortgage.

This right is codified in this section, subject now to the provisions of § 8.01-35.1.Carickhoff v. Badger-Northland, Inc., 562 F. Supp. 160, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18525 (W.D. Va. 1983).

Wilson, 221 Va. 979, 277 S.E.2d 149, 1981 Va. LEXIS 237 (1981). A contribution plaintiff cannot recover from a contribution defendant unless the injured party could have recovered against the contribution defendant. Pierce v. Martin, 230 Va. 94, 334 S.E.2d 576, 1985 Va. LEXIS 256 (1985). Contribution statute inapplicable.  Before contribution could be had, it was essential that a cause of action by the person injured lie against the alleged wrongdoer from whom contribution was sough t; therefore, § 8.01-34 was inapplicable where a judicial ruling was tantamount to a holding that the injured party never had an enforceable cause of action against the target of the contribution claim. Pulte Home Corp. v. Parex, Inc., 265 Va. 518, 57 9 S.E.2d 188, 2003 Va. LEXIS 51 (2003). Because each of plaintiffs claims against defendant pled the existence of an intentional tort, defendant was not entitled to contribution from third-party def endants under § 8.01-34. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus., 688 F. Supp. 2d 443, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76795 (E.D. Va. 2009), . The principles of contribution are equally applicable to indemnity, but the distinguishi ng feature of indemnity is that it must necessarily grow out of a contractual relationship. VEPCO v. Wilson, 221 Va. 979, 277 S.E.2d 149, 1981 Va. LEXIS 237 (1981). Third-party plaintiff may bring action for contribution, despite the fact that no paymen t has been made. Rambone v. Critzer, 548 F. Supp. 660, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9714 (W.D. Va. 1982). Indemnification between multiple parties.  In an action by building owners against a developer seeking contractual indemnification for damage to their buildings, where the developer sued a general contract or, who sued, inter alia, an earth-moving subcontractor, who sued a material supplier, who sued building contractors seeking contribution, the building contractors motions to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) were granted where the material supp liers contribution claims against the building contractors could not be brought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 14(a) because § 8.01-34 did not give a right of contribution to the material supplier. Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Target Stores, Inc., 214 F.R. D. 406, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5373 (E.D. Va. 2003). Where liability arose out of act involving moral turpitude.  International matchmaking agency and its owner were not entitled to contribution due to their moral turpitude in not telling their client, a Ukrainian woman, abou t a battered spouse waiver, but instead telling her that her only options were to work things out with her new abusive husband or be deported back to the Ukraine. Fox v. Encounters Int'l, No. 05-1139, No. 05-1404, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 9269 (4th Cir. Apr. 13, 2006). Sufficiency of pleading.  Manufacturers motion to dismiss a subcontractors third-party negligence action was denied in part because the subcontractor met both elements of a claim f or contribution under Virginia law. Claim for contribution was available to joint tortfeasors despite the general economic loss rule. AMCO Water Metering Sys. v. Travelers Cas. Sur. Co. of Am., No. 3:03CV00003, No. 3:03CV00012, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1775 8 (W.D. Va. Sept. 30, 2003). Erroneous jury instructions on apportionment.  Trial court in a physicians contribution action under §§ 8.01-34 and 8.01-35.1 against a pharmacy and its pharmacist erred when it gave the jury erroneo us instructions on the issues of the reasonableness of an underlying settlement and the apportionment of damages between the parties, such that a new trial was required because the instructions bore on the issues of both liability and damages; apportionm ent between the parties should not have been before the jury where the evidence indicated that the injuries suffered by the patient in the underlying action were indivisible, such that a finding of joint liability rendered each party liable for the full injury, and as there was nothing to rebut the physicians evidence as to the reasonableness of the settlement, that issue also should not have been a subject for the jurys consideration. Sullivan v. Robertson Drug Co., 273 Va. 84, 639 S.E.2d 250, 2007 Va. LEXIS 16 (2007). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section changed the common-law rule.  At common law there was no contribution among joint tort-feasors, but that right is now given by this section. Norfolk &amp; P. Belt Line R.R. v. Parker, 152 Va. 484, 147 S.E. 461, 1929 Va. LEXIS 185 (1929) (see also McLaughlin v. Siegel, 166 Va. 374, 185 S.E. 873 (1936); American Employers Ins. Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 218 F.2d 335 (4th Cir. 1954)). At common law contribution was not permitted amongst joint tort-feasors. Mahone v. McGraw-Edison Co., 281 F. Supp. 582, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8305 (E.D. Va. 1968) . The doctrine of contribution is founded on principles of equity and natural justice. Hudg ins v. Jones, 205 Va. 495, 138 S.E.2d 16, 1964 Va. LEXIS 208 (1964). The right to contribution is based upon the equitable principle that where two or more persons are subject to a common burden it shall be borne equally. Nationwid e Mut. Ins. Co. v. Minnifield, 213 Va. 797, 196 S.E.2d 75, 1973 Va. LEXIS 234 (1973). The right of contribution is controlled by this section. Mahone v. McGraw-Edison Co., 281 F. Supp. 582, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8305 (E.D. Va. 1968). But it gives a right of contribution only where the person injured has a right of action against two persons for the same indivisible injury. Though the concurring negligence of two persons may have resulted in an indivisible injury to a third, if the third person has a cause of action against only one of them, that one cannot enforce contr ibution from the other. The statute allowing contribution does not create any greater liability than existed before its enactment. Norfolk S.R.R. v. Gretakis, 162 Va. 597, 174 S.E. 841, 1934 Va. LEXIS 272 (1934). This section gives a right of contribution only where the party damaged has a right of action against two or more parties for the same indivisible damage. In shor t, if the damaged party has a cause of action against only one of the parties responsible for the damage, that one cannot enforce contribution from the other. American Tobacco Co. v. Transport Corp., 277 F. Supp. 457, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9170 (E.D. Va. 1967); Laws v. Spain, 312 F. Supp. 315, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12771 (E.D. Va.), transferred, 51 F.R.D. 307, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10051 (E.D. Va. 1970). Virginia, while permitting contribution between co-tort-feasors, withholds it as against a joint offender who cannot in law be forced to answer to the plaintiff f or his negligence. Drumgoole v. VEPCO, 170 F. Supp. 824, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3789 (D. Va. 1959). The right of contribution is withheld against a joint tort-feasor who cannot in law be forced to answer to a plaintiff for his alleged negligence. Mahone v. McGra w-Edison Co., 281 F. Supp. 582, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8305 (E.D. Va. 1968). This section does not create any greater liability than existed before its enactment. Law s v. Spain, 312 F. Supp. 315, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12771 (E.D. Va.), transferred, 51 F.R.D. 307, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10051 (E.D. Va. 1970). Joint tort-feasor.  Joint tort-feasor means two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property. Laws v. Spain, 312 F. Supp. 315 , 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12771 (E.D. Va.), transferred, 51 F.R.D. 307, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10051 (E.D. Va. 1970). Recovery amongst joint tort-feasors, absent contract, is limited to contribution. Hartfor d Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Williams, 291 F. Supp. 103, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9239 (W.D. Va. 1968).

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 5C M.J. Damages, §§ 48, 49, 91. CASE NOTES Section does not apply to losses incurred because of medical expenses.  This section is limited by its own terms to damages for loss of income, and the Virginia Supreme Court and the Virginia legislature view this as separate and distinct from losses incurred because of medical expenses. Therefore, this section does not apply where the plaintiff seeks to introduce medical bills. Karsten v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, 808 F. Supp. 1253, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19995 (E.D. Va. 199 2), aff'd, 36 F.3d 8, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 25997 (4th Cir. 1994). Section did not apply where employer paid injured employee from his prior years earnings.  Under the collateral source rule and this section, compensation paid by an employer to an employee during the period of the employees disability was not deduc tible from the quantum of damages the tortfeasor owed; hence, evidence of the employees loss of income was admissible in evidence at trial and the fact of any reimbursement to the employee by the employer shall not be admitted into evidence. Bullard v. Alfonso, 267 Va. 743, 595 S.E.2d 284, 2004 Va. LEXIS 65 (2004). Amounts written off under Medicaid.  Because the court determined that the collateral source rule would allow a personal injury plaintiff to seek damages for the full costs of medical treatment regar dless of whether any amounts were written off under Medicaid, the court allowed plaintiff to introduce the full amounts charged by her health care providers. Wright v. Smith, 641 F. Supp. 2d 536, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55781 (W.D. Va. 2009). § 8.01-35.1. Effect of release or covenant not to sue in respect to liability and contribution. Text A. When a rele ase or a covenant not to sue is given in good faith to one of two or more persons liable for the same injury to a person or property, or the same wrongful death: 1. It sh all not discharge any other person from liability for the injury, property damage or wrongful death unless its terms so provide; but any amount recovered against the other person or any one of them shall be reduced by any amount stipulated by the covenan t or the release, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever is the greater. In determining the amount of consideration given for a covenant not to sue or release for a settlement which consists in whole or in part of future payment or payments, the court shall consider expert or other evidence as to the present value of the settlement consisting in whole or in part of future payment or payments. A release or covenant not to sue given pursuant to this section shall not be admitted into evidence in the trial of the matter but shall be considered by the court in determining the amount for which judgment shall be entered; and 2. It shall discharge the person to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other person liable for the same injury to person or property or the same wrongful death. B. A person wh o enters into a release or covenant not to sue with a claimant is not entitled to recover by way of contribution from another person whose liability for the injury, property damage or wrongful death is not extinguished by the release or covenant not to s ue, nor in respect to any amount paid by the person which is in excess of what was reasonable. C. For the pur poses of this section, a covenant not to sue shall include any high-low agreement whereby a party seeking damages for injury to a person or property, or for wrongful death, agrees to accept as full satisfaction for any judgment no more than one s um certain and the party or parties from whom the damages are sought agree to pay no less than another sum certain regardless of whether any judgment rendered at trial is higher or lower than the respective sums certain set forth in the agreement and whe reby such party provides notice to all of the other parties of the terms of such high-low agreement immediately after such agreement is reached. D. A release o r covenant not to sue given pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of §§ 8.01-55 and 8.01-424. E. This sectio n shall apply to all such covenants not to sue executed on or after July 1, 1979, and to all releases executed on or after July 1, 1980. This section shall also apply to all oral covenants not to sue and oral releases agreed to on or after July 1, 1989, provided that any cause of action affected thereby accrues on or after July 1, 1989. A release or covenant not to sue need not be in writing where parties to a pending action state in open court that they have agreed to enter into such release or covenan t not to sue and have agreed further to subsequently memorialize the same in writing.

CASE NOTES Purpose.  The General Assembly intended to change a rule of law which tended to reward a recalcitrant tort-feasor at the expense of a joint tort-feasor who was willing to s ettle out of court. The legislative intent, as shown by the statutory language, was to promote the use of a covenant not to sue by permitting payment thereunder and discharge of one joint tort-feasor without causing the covenant to effect the release of the other joint tort-feasors. Hayman v. Patio Prods., Inc., 226 Va. 482, 311 S.E.2d 752, 1984 Va. LEXIS 286 (1984). In 1979, recognizing the potential hardship under the common law, the Virginia legislature enacted this section. The statute provides that a release entered into by one joint tort-feasor does not necessarily discharge the remaining tort-feasors. The legislative purpose is to facilitate settlement and promote the use of releases. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Reynolds, 676 F. Supp. 106, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1 2335 (W.D. Va. 1987). Two policy goals underlie the uniform law from which this section was derived and guide its interpretation; the overarching purpose is to foster settlements in th e multiple tortfeasor context and the ancillary goal is to prevent collusion and thereby reasonably ensure a fair distribution of responsibility for a plaintiffs damages among tortfeasors. Dacotah Mktg. &amp; Research v. Versatility, 21 F. Supp. 2d 570, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15446 (E.D. Va. 1998). Section facilitates prompt settlem ent.  The statute authorizes payment of consideration under the covenant not to sue without discharging nonpaying joint tort-feasors. The statute protects the paying to rt-feasor from liability for contribution and prohibits him from exacting contribution from nonpaying joint tort-feasors against whom claims remain outstanding. The statute facilitates prompt settlement, payment, and discharge of paying tort-feasors with out releasing those nonpaying joint tort-feasors who prefer to have their liability determined in litigation, with its attendant delays. Hayman v. Patio Prods., Inc., 226 Va. 482, 311 S.E.2d 752, 1984 Va. LEXIS 286 (1984). Injured party protected from unnecessary delays and loss of claims.  The effect of the statute is to protect the injured party from unnecessary delays and loss of claims. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Reynolds, 676 F. Supp. 106 , 1987 U.S. Dist.

Where there is pending any action by an infant plaintiff against a tort-feasor for a personal injury, where the cause of action accrued prior to July 1, 2013, any parent or guardian of such infant, who is entitled to recover from the same tort-feasor the expenses o f curing or attempting to cure such infant from the result of such personal injury, may bring an action against such tort-feasor for such expenses, in the same court where such infants case is pending, either in the action filed in behalf of the infa nt or in a separate action. If the claim for expenses be by separate action, upon motion of any party to either case, made to the court at least one week before the trial, both cases shall be tried together at the same time as parts of the same transacti on. But separate verdicts when there is a jury trial shall be rendered, and the judgment shall distinctly separate the decision and judgment in the separate causes of action.In the event of the cases being carried to the Court of Appeals, which may be do ne if there be the jurisdictional amount in either case, they shall both be carried together as one case and record, but the Court of Appeals shall clearly specify the decision in each case, separating them in the decision to the extent necessary to do j ustice among the parties. If an appeal is taken from the judgment of the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court, in matters in which it grants the petition for appeal, shall clearly specify the decision in each case, separating them in the decision to the e xtent necessary to do justice among the parties. B. For causes of action that accrue on or after July 1, 2013, the past and future expenses of curing or attempting to cure an infant of personal injuries proximately caused by a tort-feasor are damages recoverable by an infant in a cause of action against the tort-fea sor and, if applicable to the infants cause of action, are subject to the limitation on damages in § 8.01-581.15. Any parent or guardian of such infant who has paid for or is personally obligated to pay for past or future expenses to cure or attem pt to cure the infant shall have a lien and right of reimbursement against any recovery by the infant up to the amount the parent or guardian has actually paid or is personally obligated to pay. The right to reimbursement of any parent or guardian shall accrue upon the first tender of funds of any recovery from a tort-feasor to the infant. Court approval of the infant settlement shall release party defendants from all claims for past or future expenses of curing or attempting to cure the infant.Nothing in this section shall relieve a parent of the obligation to pay for the medical expenses of curing or attempting to cure the infant as such obligation exists under current law.

Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . This section recognizes the common-law rule that two separate causes of action arise out of an injury to an infant by wrongful act. One cause of action is on behalf of the infant to recover damages for pain and suffering, permanent injury and impairment of earning capacity after attaining majority. The other is on behalf of the parent for loss of services during minority and necessary expenses incurred for the infants treatment. Moses v. Akers, 203 Va. 130, 122 S.E.2d 864, 1961 Va. LEXIS 231 (1961). An infant is not entitled to recover the expenses incurred in healing or attempting to be healed of his injuries in an action brought against a tort-feasor to recover damages for personal injuries unless (1) he has paid or agreed to pay the expenses; or (2) he alone is responsible by reason of his emancipation or the death or incompete ncy of his parents; or (3) the parent has waived the right of recovery in favor of the infant; or (4) recovery therefor is permitted by statute. Moses v. Akers, 203 Va. 130, 122 S.E.2d 864, 1961 Va. LEXIS 231 (1961). Fathers cause of action derivative.  A fathers cause of action for medical and incidental expenses was a derivative action, and where there was no verdict in the childs case, there could be n one in the fathers case. Norfolk S. Ry. v. Fincham, 213 Va. 122, 189 S.E.2d 380, 1972 Va. LEXIS 317 (1972). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Parents action for medical expense s.  Doctors plea in bar and motions to dismiss and to join a child and his father were denied because the statute at issue did not expressly or implicitly restric t or bar the mothers common-law right of action for medical expenses in the manner alleged by the doctor where the first clause of the statute did not expressly state that a personal injury action on behalf of the child must be pending before the mot her could bring her claim, the statute did not clearly express a legislative intent to change the common law and abridge the mothers right of action, and the mothers claim for medical expenses and the childs personal injury claim were governe d by different statutes of limitation. Pancho v. Johnson, 94 Va. Cir. 64, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 110 (Norfolk July 25, 2016). Parents may init iate action as childs next friend.  For purposes of the parents pregnancy-related medical malpractice lawsuit, because the doctors allegedly tortious conduct occurred while the parents s on was still in utero, the court sustained defendants pleas in bar as the parents claims for their sons medical expenses were derivative of a claim by the son for personal injuries, and the facts affirmatively showed no claim for personal inj uries on behalf of the son currently pending; furthermore, the sons personal injury claim had to be brought in his name by his next friend under § 8.01-8, and could not be subsumed into a claim for personal injuries brought by the parents.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 9B M.J. Hospitals and Sanitariums, § 7. CASE NOTES Immunity for hospitals providing medical care free of charge.  The Virginia General Assembly eliminated charitable immunity for most hospitals, essentially limiting its application to hospitals that provide medical care free of charge. Davidson v. Colonial Williamsburg Found., 817 F. Supp. 611, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11667 (E.D. Va. 1993). Under this section, charitable hospitals are immune from liability in Virginia if they do not charge patients for services and 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt hospitals have limited liability. Power v. Arlington Hosp. Ass'n, 42 F.3d 851, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 34586 (4th Cir. 1994). College was not entitled to use the defense of charitable immunity from tort liability, where the charter did not specifically restrict operation of the college to charitable or eleemosynary purposes nor was the manner of operation of the college strictly charitable in nature. Radosevic v. Virginia Intermont College, 633 F. Supp. 10 84, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26626 (W.D. Va. 1986). The public policy in Virginia favors a more restrictive approach to determining that an institution is immune from tort liability on the grounds of the charitable immunity doctrine. This is evidenced by the legislative abrogation of the doctrine of charitable immunity for hospitals and the judicial reluctance to automatically apply a charitable label to various institutions. Radosevic v. Virginia Intermont Colleg e, 633 F. Supp. 1084, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26626 (W.D. Va. 1986). The 1986 amendment to this section merely clarified its application. Etheridge v. Medical Center Hosps., 237 Va. 87, 376 S.E.2d 525, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1438, 1989 Va. LEXIS 27 (1989). Relationship to other laws.  Section 501(c)(3) health care provider was not immune from tort liability even though it was not a hospital as defined in § 32.1-123, because the provider did not operate as a charitable institution. It was created to correct billing and collection issues, the ratio of its revenue to its charity work cost was disproportionate, it used a profit-based bonus system, and it did not accept charitable gifts. Univ. o f Va. Health Servs. Found. v. Morris, 275 Va. 319, 657 S.E.2d 512, 2008 Va. LEXIS 39 (2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Provider of blood products.  Charitable immunity doctrine was not applicable to the blood provider in a wrongful death action brought after the deceased allegedly died from contaminated blood , because the provider supplied the hospital with blood products for a fee, and the hospital, in turn, charged its patients for the cost of providing the blood products, over $10,000 in the deceaseds case; the indirect provision of blood and blood pr oducts by the provider did not make it a charity and did not make the deceased a recipient of a charitable benefit. Rogers v. Va. Blood Servs., 64 Va. Cir. 346, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 195 (Richmond Apr. 7, 2004). Health Services Foundation was not entitled to use the defense of charitable immunity.  University health services foundation did not qualify for charitable immunity under § 8.01-38 because the foundations articles of incorporation did not exc lusively limit the foundation to charitable purposes, charity was not the exclusive or even the central purpose in the foundations formation, and the foundation derived none of its revenue from charitable donations. Morris v. Univ. of Va. Health Serv s. Found., 72 Va. Cir. 193, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 293 (Charlottesville Oct. 25, 2006), aff'd, 275 Va. 319, 657 S.E.2d 512, 2008 Va. LEXIS 39 (2008). Foundation not a hospital for purposes of bar on charitable immunity.  Foundation was not a hospital under § 8.01-38, as the foundation was not a facility pursuant to § 32.1-123; rather, it was the entity that employed the physicians who cared for patients at a university hospital. The fact that the foundation owned and operated several clinics in outlying areas did not change this analysis. MacArthur v. Univ. of Va. Health Servs. Found., 72 Va. Cir. 322, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 294 (Charlottesville Dec. 8, 2006), rev'd, 275 Va. 319, 657 S.E.2d 512, 2008 Va. LEXIS 39 (2008) (see note above). Because a foundation did not own facilities and did not operate as a hospital, and was unlicensed, it was not a hospital for purposes of the statutory bar on char itable immunity; the foundations plea of charitable immunity was sustained in a negligence action because, inter alia, the foundation operated for a charitable purpose of furthering the education of medical students. Wright v. Silver, 72 Va. Cir. 500 , 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 14 (Norfolk Feb. 14, 2007), rev'd, 276 Va. 555, 667 S.E.2d 785, 2008 Va. LEXIS 118 (2008). Nursing facility was a charitable institution.  In a nursing facility residents action for damages following a fire, the facility, which was not licensed pursuant to § 32.1-123 et seq., was immune from t ort liability under the doctrine of charitable immunity and did not fall under the scope of § 8.01-38s denial of charitable immunity to hospitals. The facilitys charter established the rebuttable presumption that it was a charitable institutio n, and the resident failed to rebut that presumption. Rogers v. Va. Home, 83 Va. Cir. 423, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 138 (Richmond Oct. 5, 2011). Nursing homes plea bar was sustained in a medical malpractice and negligence action brought by an administrator of a deceased patients estate because the evidence proved that the home operated as a charity, immune from the tort claims under the statute; it was organized as a non-stock, not-for-profit corporation, and its articles of incorporation stated a charitable purpose. Estate of Zabrovskiy v. Beth S holom Home of Va., Inc., 85 Va. Cir. 470, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 191 (Henrico County Oct. 25, 2012). § 8.01-38.1. Limitation on recovery of punitive damages. Text In any action accruing on or after July 1, 1988, including an action for medical malpractice under Chapter 21.1 (§ 8.01-581.1 et seq.), the total amount awarded for punitive damages against all defendants found to be liable shall be determined by the trier of fact. In no event shall the total amount awarded for punitive damages exceed $350,000. The jury shall not be advised of the limitation prescribed by this secti on. However, if a jury returns a verdict for punitive damages in excess of the maximum amount specified in this section, the judge shall reduce the award and enter judgment for such damages in the maximum amount provided by this section.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE The first sentence of former § 8-650 was transferred to § 18.2-216.1 since its import is purely penal. The civil remedy retained in § 8.01-40 A was expan ded by removing the restriction that the unauthorized use must pertain to a Virginia resident.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Subsection A of this section, as applied to the facts of the instant case  plaintiffs name was prominently featured in real estate flyer  is not const itutionally invalid under either the free-speech provisions of the First Amendment to the federal Constitution or the applicable provisions of Va. Const., Art. I, § 12. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc. v. Riggins, 249 Va. 387, 457 S.E.2d 356, 1995 Va. LEXIS 54 (1995). This section is in derogation of the common law. Falwell v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., 521 F. Supp. 1204. And therefore must be strictly construed. Falwell v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., 521 F. Supp. 1204. Virginia recognizes no right of privacy other than that specifically conferred by this section. Falwell v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., 521 F. Supp. 1204. No general right of privacy exists in the law of Virginia. Evans v. Sturgill, 430 F. Supp . 1209, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16172 (W.D. Va. 1977) (decided under prior law). Claim of plaintiffs, a wife and children, regarding invasion of privacy could not withstand summary judgment because Virginia law recognized only a limited cause of action for invasion of privacy as to use of a name or picture of a plaintiff without authorization, pursuant to § 8.01-40, and Virginia courts had never recognized a common-law tort of invasion of privacy. Bellotte v. Edwards, 388 Fed. Appx. 334, 2 010 U.S. App. LEXIS 15050 (4th Cir. 2010). Except for the limited right conferred by this section.  See Evans v. Sturgill, 430 F. Supp. 1209, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16172 (W.D. Va. 1977) (decided under prior law). Protective mantle extends to c elebrities.  Ordinary citizens are entitled to the protective mantle of this section, and persons in a celebrity status should receive no less coverage in this respect. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc. v. Riggins, 249 Va. 387, 457 S.E.2d 356, 1995 Va. LEXIS 54 (1995). Exception for matters that are newsworthy or of public interest.  An exception exists under this section for items that are newsworthy or matters of public interest, which covers articles in newspapers and magazi nes, as well as pictures used to illustrate the articles, unless the picture bears no real relationship to the article or the article is an advertisement in disguise. Williams v. Newsweek, Inc., 63 F. Supp. 2d 734, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13114 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 202 F.3d 262, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 37553 (4th Cir. 1999). Promotional announceme nt of newsworthy event.  Though the evidence supported the jurys finding that a television station defamed a doctor by accusing him of sexually assaulting his patients, the use of the doctors image in the stations promotional announcements was not an unauthorized use under this section, as the right of privacy did not extend to reports of newsworthy events. WJLA-TV v. Levin, 264 Va. 140, 564 S.E.2d 383, 2002 Va. LEXIS 87 (200 2). Exception for uses that are incident al.  There is an exception to the statute for uses that are incidental to the purpose of the work, and according to this exception, a publisher will be liable for the publication of an unauthorized picture only if there is a direct and substantial connection between the appearance of the plaintiffs name or likeness and the main purpose and subject of the work. Williams v. Newsweek, Inc., 63 F. Supp. 2d 734, 1999 U .S. Dist. LEXIS 13114 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 202 F.3d 262, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 37553 (4th Cir. 1999). Limitation period for actions under subsection A.  Subsection A is aimed at preventing the appropriation, without consent, of an individuals name or likeness while he is alive and for 20 years after he dies. I t creates in an individual a species of property right in their name and likeness. Consequently, the limitation period contained in subsection B of § 8.01-243 should be applied. Lavery v. Automation Mgt. Consultants, Inc., 234 Va. 145, 360 S.E.2d 336, 4 Va. Law Rep. 543, 1987 Va. LEXIS 255 (1987). Subsection B is a cutoff statute, not a statute of limitation.  The legislature intended subsection B to be a cutoff statute, and, as such, to operate as an outside time period in which true statutes of limitations would opera te and beyond which no suit based on subsection A could be maintained. The General Assembly in enacting subsection B was not setting a time period within which suit must be brought, instead, it was providing a cutoff point after which suit could not be b rought. Lavery v. Automation Mgt. Consultants, Inc., 234 Va. 145, 360 S.E.2d 336, 4 Va. Law Rep. 543, 1987 Va. LEXIS 255 (1987). Notwithstanding the characterizations of subsection B of this section made by the revisers notes under §§ 8.01-228 and 8.01-243, subsection B of this se ction is not the statute of limitations applicable to a cause of action under subsection A. Lavery v. Automation Mgt. Consultants, Inc., 234 Va. 145, 360 S.E.2d 336, 4 Va. Law Rep. 543, 1987 Va. LEXIS 255 (1987). Use of New York decisi ons in construing section.  This section is substantially similar to § 51 of the New York Civil Rights Law, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit would look to the New York courts for guidance in construing the Virginia privacy statute. Falwell v. Flynt, 797 F.2d 1270, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 27744 (4th Cir. 1986), rev'd, 485 U.S. 46, 108 S. Ct. 876, 99 L. Ed. 2d 41, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 941 (1988). The General Assembly has fixed the knowingly used standard for punitive damages in the type of action under this section. The Virginia Supreme Court shall not engage in judicial legislation by adding ingredients not specified in the statute. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc. v. Riggins, 249 Va. 387, 457 S.E.2d 356, 1995 Va. LEXIS 54 ( 1995). Proof of willful, wanton and/or malicious conduct is admissible, but unneeded for puniti ve damages for improper use of name. PTS Corp. v. Buckman, 263 Va. 613, 561 S.E.2d 718, 2002 Va. LEXIS 58 (2002). Person.  Corporation could not have maintained an action under § 8.01-40 because the corporation was not a person under § 8.01-40 because the text of § 8. 01-40 made clear that it applied only to natural persons, and the corporation was not a natural person. Silver Ring Splint Co. v. Digisplint, Inc., 567 F. Supp. 2d 847, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48621 (W.D. Va. 2008). An individual holds a property interest in his or her reputation, which represents the i ndividuals personal identity in the community and which is the thing of value in the individuals name. Nossen v. Hoy, 750 F. Supp. 740, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15508 (E.D. Va. 1990). Use of candidates name or picture by political organization.  This section or its common-law counterparts in other states, may not be construed to prohibit political organizations from using a candidates name or picture in a political campaign without his consent. Such an expansive interpretation of the law of tortious appropriation of name would trench on important freedoms secured by the First Amendment. Friends of Gramm v. Americans for Gramm, 587 F.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The manifest intention of this section is to prevent the landlord from oppressing his tenant. The right to sue in damages for an illegal distress was recognized at common law and the enactment of the statute was in furtherance of the right so recognized. Gurfein v. Howell, 142 Va. 197, 128 S.E. 644, 1925 Va. LEXIS 330 (1925). Ignorance no excuse.  The right to distrain or attach for rent has always been regarded by the courts as a most drastic one, and in order to restrain the landlord from a too free use o f this power, he must exercise the same at his peril. The law presumes that he knows the amount of his tenants indebtedness and ignorance on his part will not relieve him for compensatory damages for a mistake committed by him. Gurfein v. Howell, 142 Va. 197, 128 S.E. 644, 1925 Va. LEXIS 330 (1925). As to reading of section in connection with § 8.01-551 and former § 8.01-552, rela ting to the giving of attachment bonds, see Harris v. Lipson, 167 Va. 365, 189 S.E. 349, 1937 Va. LEXIS 284 (1937). Action for trespass available.  Where a distress is made for rent pretended to be due, when in truth there is none due, and the goods distrained are not sold, the remedy is by action at common l aw, and trespass may be maintained. But the party suing is not obliged to bring trespass, he may waive the trespass and bring case. Olinger v. M'Chesney, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 660, 1836 Va. LEXIS 64 (1836). Quashing of attachment does not imply lack of good cause.  Under this section the fact that an attachment is quashed on the ground that it was sued out without sufficient cause does not necessarily imply that there was la ck of good cause. Harris v. Lipson, 167 Va. 365, 189 S.E. 349, 1937 Va. LEXIS 284 (1937). When landlord liable for acts of agent .  A landlord who employs an agent to lease his property and receive the rents is not liable in damages for the act of the agent in unlawfully suing out a distress w arrant against the tenant, unless he directed or approved the proceedings had under the distress warrant, or failed to repudiate such proceedings after full knowledge of them. Fishburne v. Engledove, 91 Va. 548, 22 S.E. 354, 1895 Va. LEXIS 51 (1895). Measure of damages.  In the absence of any charge of fraud, malice, oppression, or other special aggravation, the measure of the plaintiffs damages is compensation for the injury suffered  such damages as are the natural and proximate result of the injury complained of. Fishburne v. Engledove, 91 Va. 548, 22 S.E. 354, 1895 Va. LEXIS 51 (1895). In an action for illegal distress, instructions which ignore the right of plaintiff to recover nominal damages where an illegal levy has been made are erroneous u nder this section. Gurfein v. Howell, 142 Va. 197, 128 S.E. 644, 1925 Va. LEXIS 330 (1925). Damages due for excessive distraint.  While a lien legally attaches to all property as might be on the premises when the lien is asserted or within 30 days prior to distraint, the landlord can distrai n goods only to the extent necessary to satisfy the rent justly believed to be due, the tenant possessing an action for damages for excessive distraint. United States v. Melchiorre, 292 F. Supp. 305, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11939 (E.D. Va. 1968). Fair damages erroneous.  Where a landlord distrains for an amount in excess of the rent due the tenant is entitled to recover at least nominal damages. But an instruction that in such a c ase the tenant is entitled to fair damages for wrong suffered is erroneous, as it is more than probable that fair means more than compensation to the average individual, and when the jury was told to find fair damages for the wron g suffered, instead of being told they could only compensate for the injury done, they conceived the idea, no doubt, that they had the right to punish instead of the power to compensate. Gurfein v. Howell, 142 Va. 197, 128 S.E. 644, 1925 Va. LEXIS 330 (1 925). Effect of fail ing to plead and prove special damages.  Where the notice of motion for illegally suing out a distress warrant did not allege and the proof failed to disclose any special damages suffered by plaintiff, a verdict for plaintiff in a substantial amount should be set aside as excessive. Gurfein v. Howell, 142 Va. 197, 128 S.E. 644, 1925 Va. LEXIS 330 (1925). Plaintiff ha s burden of proving substantial damages.  In an action for illegal distress, the defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed that before the plaintiff could recover any except nominal damages, the burden was upon him to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he had sustained substantial damages. To merely show that an illegal levy has been made is not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover substantial damages. Gurfein v. Howell, 142 Va. 197, 128 S.E. 644, 1925 Va. LEXIS 330 (1925). Plaintiff has bu rden of proving exemplary damages.  In order to recover exemplary damages in an action under this section the burden is upon the plaintiff to show not only that the act complained of is illegal, but that it was either malicious or oppressive, or that it was attended by especially aggravating circumstances. Evans v. Schuster, 178 Va. 61, 16 S.E.2d 301, 1941 Va. LEXIS 144 (1941). When variance in allegations fatal.  In action for a wrongful distress, if the plaintiff allege that he held under a lease for five months, for $20.00 payable in repairs and labor, and at the trial i t appear that the lease was for 12 months, for a money rent of $65.00, the variance will be fatal. Olinger v. M'Chesney, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 660, 1836 Va. LEXIS 64 (1836). Value of property question of fact.  In an action for illegal distress the price obtained at a forced sale is not the sole criterion as to the value of the goods levied on. The value of the property at the time of the levy is a question of fact to be determined by the court or the jury trying the issue. Gurfein v. Howell, 142 Va. 197, 128 S.E. 644, 1925 Va. LEXIS 330 (1925). What question for court and what f or jury.  In an action under this section it was held that the question of exemplary damages should not have been submitted to the jury, since it was for the court to say w hether the evidence tended to establish a proper case for their allowance, and for the jury to determine in such case whether they should be allowed. Evans v. Schuster, 178 Va. 61, 16 S.E.2d 301, 1941 Va. LEXIS 144 (1941). Judgment in another action not evi dence.  Judgment for the tenant in an action of unlawful detainer brought by the landlord is not evidence in a proceeding under this section that no rent was due at the t ime the distress warrant was sued out. Fishburne v. Engledove, 91 Va. 548, 22 S.E. 354, 1895 Va.

CASE NOTES Actions for religious discrimination in workplace not barred.  Although subsection (c) of this section is perhaps inartfully crafted in that it does not make it clear on its face that it must be read in conjunction with not o nly the remaining provisions of the same statute but also all related state and federal proscriptions that allow a cause of action for religious discrimination in the workplace, it simply does not preclude such suit if the plaintiff can meet the burden o f proof.

Evidence sufficient to support finding of violation of this section.  The jurys finding that plaintiff was racially intimidated or harassed in violation of this section was supported by sufficient evidence where the plaintiff wa s the only black person in an otherwise totally white skating rink, and without prior warning, within an hour of the rinks closing, the plaintiff was waved off the floor and was told They want to see you in the back room. Johnson v. Hugo's Sk ateway, 949 F.2d 1338, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 27674 (4th Cir. 1991). Award of compensatory and pu nitive damages.  Circuit court properly found  after a jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages to a worker stemming from the intentional statutory torts of racial haras sment and stalking  that the evidence, consisting solely of mental anguish, emotional distress, and humiliation, was sufficient to support the jurys award of compensatory damages to a worker because a company and its president conceded liability on a workers claims for racial harassment and stalking, both statutes expressly permitted compensatory and punitive damages, and neither required proof of physical injury.

Constitutional limitations on insulting words claim.  Although application of this provision is no longer confined to its original purpose of preventing duels, it has been interpreted by Virginia courts to be virtual ly co-extensive with the common-law action for defamation. For this reason any constitutional limitations that apply to the plaintiffs defamation action must necessarily apply to their insulting words claim as well. Potomac Valve &amp; Fitting, I nc. v. Crawford Fitting Co., 829 F.2d 1280, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12607 (4th Cir. 1987). Opinions protected by First Amendment.  Where the defendants statement is capable of being proved or disproved, but when viewed in context it is clearly an opinion, it is therefore protected by the First Amendment. Potomac Valve &amp; Fitting, Inc. v. Crawford Fitting Co., 829 F.2d 1280, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12607 (4th Cir. 1987). Action for insulting words assimilated to common-law action for libel and slander.  Where the plaintiffs motion for judgment was unclear as to whether the proceeding was under this section or involved common-law libel, no distinction was requ ired to be made, since the trial of an action for insulting words is completely assimilated to the common-law action for libel or slander, and from the standpoint of the law of this state is an action for libel or slander. Mills v. Kingsport Times-News, 475 F. Supp. 1005, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10118 (W.D. Va. 1979). The trial of an action for insulting words is completely assimilated to the common-law action for libel and slander, and from the standpoint of the Virginia law i t is an action for libel and slander. Welch v. Kennedy Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc., 63 Bankr. 888 (W.D. Va. 1986). In many cases defamation claims and claims brought under this section must ineluctably rise or fall together.  Dwyer v. Smith, 867 F.2d 184, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 956 (4th Cir. 1989). Must be danger of violent reaction.  This section only penalizes words used in a verbal attack directed at a particular individual in a face to face confrontation that presents a clear and present da nger of a violent physical reaction. Thompson v. Town of Front Royal, No. 5:98CV00083, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3876 (W.D. Va. Mar. 16, 2000). This section plainly requires that the words used must not only be insults, but they mus t also tend to violence and breach of the peace. Allen &amp; Rocks, Inc. v. Dowell, 252 Va. 439, 477 S.E.2d 741, 1996 Va. LEXIS 107 (1996). In Virginia, a libel plaintiff must show that the alleged libel was published of or concerning him. He need not show that he was mentioned by name in the publication. Instead, the plaintiff satisfies the of or concerning test if he shows that the publication was intended to refer to him and would be so understood by perso ns reading it who knew him. In other words, the test is met if the plaintiff shows that the publication was in its description or identification such as to lead those who knew or knew of the plaintiff to believe that the article was intended to refer to [him]. But if the publication on its face does not show that it applies to the plaintiff, the publication is not actionable, unless the allegations and supporting contemporaneous facts connect the libelous words to the plaintiff. If the rule were otherwise, any plaintiff could adopt and apply to himself any libelous matter and obtain a recovery. Gazette, Inc. v. Harris, 229 Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, 1985 Va. LEXIS 171, cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 105 S. Ct. 3513, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2356 (1985), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 905, 105 S. Ct. 3528, 87 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2499 (1985). In order to establish prima facie evidence of publication, a plaintiff is not required t o present testimony from a third party regarding what that person heard and understood, or to identify the person to whom the defamatory words were published. Instead, a plaintiff may prove publication of defamatory remarks by either direct or circumstan tial evidence that the remarks were heard by a third party who understood these remarks as referring to the plaintiff in a defamatory sense. Food Lion, Inc. v. Melton, 250 Va. 144, 458 S.E.2d 580, 1995 Va. LEXIS 93 (1995). As a matter of state law the negligence standard should be applicable to media and nonmedia defendants alike. Gazette, Inc. v. Harris, 229 Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, 1985 Va. LEXIS 171, cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 105 S. Ct. 3513, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2356 (1985), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 905, 105 S. Ct. 3528, 87 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2499 (1985). The application of this negligence standard is expressly limited, however, to circumstances where the defamatory statement makes substantial danger to reputation apparent. The trial judge shall make such determination as a matter of law. If, on the other hand, no substantial danger to reputation is apparent from the statement in issue, New York Times malice must be established to recover compensatory damages. Gazette, Inc. v. Harris, 229 Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, 1985 Va. LEXIS 171, cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 105 S. Ct. 3513, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2356 (1985), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 905, 105 S. Ct. 3528, 87 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2499 (1985). Plaintiff mu st prove falsity.  In an action brought by a private individual to recover actual, compensatory damages for a defamatory publication, the plaintiff may recover upon proof by a prepo nderance of the evidence that the publication was false, and that the defendant either knew it to be false, or believing it to be true, lacked reasonable grounds for such belief, or acted negligently in failing to ascertain the facts on which the publica tion was based. Under this standard, truth no longer is an affirmative defense to be established by the defendant. Instead, the plaintiff must prove falsity, because he is required to establish negligence with respect to such falsity. Such liability may be based upon negligence, whether or not the publication in question relates to a matter of public or general concern. Gazette, Inc. v. Harris, 229 Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, 1985 Va. LEXIS 171, cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 105 S. Ct. 3513, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2356 (1985), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 905, 105 S. Ct. 3528, 87 L. Ed. 2d 653, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2499 (1985). The threshold determination to be made by trial judge on the question of whether there i s substantial danger to reputation apparent from the content of a publication resembles the determination traditionally made by the court on the question whether a statement is libelous per se. A trial judge must decide, viewing the circumstances objecti vely, whether a reasonable and prudent editor should have anticipated that the words used contained an imputation necessarily harmful to reputation. The harmful potential of the words used here, i.e., that plaintiffs were accused of crimes, should have b een apparent to the papers editor, if he had exercised ordinary care. Gazette, Inc. v. Harris, 229 Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, 1985 Va. LEXIS 171, cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 105 S. Ct. 3513, 87 L.

Truth only shown by plea of just ification.  The truth of defamatory words, written or spoken, cannot in this State be shown under the plea of not guilty, either in bar or in mitigation of damages, but can o nly be shown under a plea of justification. Williams Printing Co. v. Saunders, 113 Va. 156, 73 S.E. 472, 1912 Va. LEXIS 21 (1912) (decided under prior law). The language used in this section that the defendant may justify by alleging and proving that the words spoken or written were true, plainly intends that the truth shall be specially pleaded, for if the legislature had intended that the proof should be given in under the plea of not guilty, there was no occasion to require that it should be alleged. Williams Printing Co. v. Saunders, 113 Va. 156, 73 S.E. 472, 1912 Va. LEXIS 21 (1912) (decided under prior law).

An apology under this section goes only to mitigate damages, and if the plaintiff agrees to accept it in complete satisfaction it is an agreement without consideration. James v. Powell, 154 Va. 96, 152 S.E. 539, 1930 Va. LEXIS 200 (1930) (decided under prior law). An apology published after an action for libel has been instituted would be of no avail. James v.

An employer shall be presumed to be acting in good faith. The presumption of good faith shall be rebutted if i t is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the employer disclosed such information with knowledge that it was false, or with reckless disregard for whether it is false or not, or with the intent to deliberately mislead. B. In a civil action brought against an employer for disclosing the information described in subsection A, if the trier of fact determines the employer acted in bad faith, punitive damages may be awarded, as provided by § 8.01-38.1.

The application of this negligence standard is expressly limited, however, to circumstances where the defamatory statement makes substantial danger to reputation apparent. The trial judge shall make such determination as a matter of law. If, on the other hand, no substantial danger to reputation is apparent from the statement in issue, New York Times malice must be established to recover compensatory damages. Gazette, Inc. v.

Ed. 2d 653, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2499 (1985). Plaintiff must prove falsity.  In an action brought by a private individual to recover actual, compensatory damages for a defamatory publication, the plaintiff may recover upon proof by a prepo nderance of the evidence that the publication was false, and that the defendant either knew it to be false, or believing it to be true, lacked reasonable grounds for such belief, or acted negligently in failing to ascertain the facts on which the publica tion was based. Under this standard, truth no longer is an affirmative defense to be established by the defendant. Instead, the plaintiff must prove falsity, because he is required to establish negligence with respect to such falsity. Such liability may be based upon negligence, whether or not the publication in question relates to a matter of public or general concern. Gazette, Inc. v. Harris, 229 Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, 1985 Va.

Province of jury.  The jury might determine that the evidence introduced under the provisions of this section eliminated all general or compensatory damages not actual pecuniary , and thus allow plaintiff only nominal damages. The weight to be given the evidence introduced in mitigation is peculiarly the province of the jury, and not of the court. News Leader Co. v. Kocen, 173 Va. 95, 3 S.E.2d 385, 1939 Va. LEXIS 179 (1939) (decided under prior law). Instruction on damages.  Obviously it would be error to use the expression slight actual damages or substantial actual damages. As compensatory damages include all damages other than punitive or exemplary, the use of the word substantial in an instruction unduly emphasizes the amount of damages which may be awarded. Any modifying word or phrase of the term actual or compensatory damages does not clarify th e meaning intended to be conveyed and should be avoided. News Leader Co. v.

Whenever th e death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of any person or corporation, or of any ship or vessel, and the act, neglect, or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain a n action, or to proceed in rem against such ship or vessel or in personam against the owners thereof or those having control of her, and to recover damages in respect thereof, then, and in every such case, the person who, or corporation or ship or vessel which, would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, or, if a ship or vessel, to a libel in rem, and her owners or those responsible for her acts or defaults or negligence to a libel in personam, notwithstand ing the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances, as amount in law to a felony. B. Whenever a fetal death, as defined in § 32.1-249, is caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of any person, ship, vessel, or corporation, the natural mother of the fetus may bring an action pursuant to this section against such tortfeasor. Nothing in thi s section shall be construed to create a cause of action for a fetal death against the natural mother of the fetus. C. Every such action under subsection A shall be brought by and in the name of the personal representative of such deceased person. Actions for fetal death under subsection B shall be brought by and in the name of the natural mother; provided, however, if the natural mother dies, or is or becomes a person under a disability as defined in § 8.01-2, such action may be initiated or maintained by the administrator of the natural mothers estate, her guardian, or her personal representative qualified to bring such a ction. In an action for fetal death under subsection B brought under Chapter 21.1 (§ 8.01-581.1 et seq.) where the wrongful act that resulted in a fetal death also resulted in the death of another fetus of the natural mother or in the death or injury of the natural mother, recovery for all damages sustained as a result of such wrongful act shall not exceed the limitations on the total amount recoverable for a single patient for any injury under § 8.01-581.15. The person bringing an action under su bsection B shall have the power to compromise a claim pursuant to § 8.01-55 and any damages recovered shall be distributed pursuant to this article. Every such action under this section shall be brought within the time limits specified in § 8.01-24 4. D. If the dece ased person was an infant who was in the custody of a parent pursuant to an order of court or written agreement with the other parent, administration shall be granted first to the parent having custody; however, that parent may waive his right to qualify in favor of any other person designated by him. If no such parent or his designee applies for administration within 30 days from the death of the infant, administration shall be granted as in other cases. E.

Purpose of statute.  The intent of the wrongful death statute is not to accumulate an estate for the decedent but to compensate for a loss suffered by those entitled to recover. Cassa dy v. Martin, 220 Va. 1093, 266 S.E.2d 104, 1980 Va. LEXIS 205 (1980). The object of the wrongful death statute is to compensate these beneficiaries for their loss occasioned by the decedents death. The words damage and loss clearly indicate a damage and loss sustained by someone, and the loss means the loss to the statutory beneficiary in this case. Cassady v. Martin, 220 Va. 1093, 266 S.E.2d 104, 1980 Va. LEXIS 205 (1980). This section is not penal or exemplary but remedial. Hewitt v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co ., 490 F. Supp. 1358, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11778 (E.D. Va. 1980). And being remedial, this statute is construed broadly. Hewitt v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 490 F. Supp. 1358, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11778 (E.D. Va. 1980). Punitive damages not awarded if offender is dead.  Where the offender is dead at the time of trial, punitive or exemplary damages may not be awarded. The purpose of punitive damages is to punish the offender, not to compensate the victim. Tarbrake v. Sharp, 894 F. Supp. 270, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11375 (E.D. Va. 1995). Where the alleged offender and the plaintiff were both killed in an automobile accident, an award of punitive damages will not serve its intended purpose of punis hing the tortfeasor. Tarbrake v. Sharp, 894 F. Supp. 270, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11375 (E.D. Va. 1995). Sections 8.01-21, 8.01-25, 8.01-50, and 8.01-56 compared.  The requirements of the survival and wrongful death statutes, §§ 8.01-25, 8.01-50 and 8.01-56, apply when the death occurs before a final verdict, whereas § 8.01-21 applies where the death occurs after the verdict.

CASE NOTES Compromise bars action.  If a man, having suffered a personal injury, compromises for such injury and accepts full satisfaction therefor, and afterwards dies from the effects of the injur y, a question arises as to the right of his personal representative to maintain an action for death by wrongful act, neglect, or default. A former version of this section settled the question by providing that such action could not be maintained. This is the weight of authority and is supported by the better reasoning.

The verdict or judgment of the court trying the case without a jury shall include, but may not be limited to, damages for the following: 1. Sorro w, mental anguish, and solace which may include society, companionship, comfort, guidance, kindly offices and advice of the decedent; 2.

Sections 8.01-52, 8.01-53, and 8.01-54 amend and reorder the provisions of the former sections to present them more logically and to clarify the procedures. Section 8.01-52 adopts former § 8-636.1 with several changes. The section expressly recognizes that the amount of damages may be awarded by the jury or by the court if the case is tried without a jury, and damages for medical and funeral expenses are required to be specifically stated. Provisions in former § 8-636.1 defining the class and beneficiaries have been deleted and incorporated into § 8.01-53. A provision has been added providing that competent expert testimony is admissible regarding the proof of damages for loss of income, services, etc. of the decedent. Cross references.

Cons truction of fair and just.  As used in this section, the terms fair and just are to be given broad and liberal construction. Sawyer v. United States, 465 F. Supp. 282, 1978 U .S. Dist. LEXIS 14289 (E.D. Va. 1978); Miltier v. Beorn, 696 F. Supp. 1086, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11549 (E.D. Va. 1988). Purpose of d amages specified.  The damages specified in this section as recoverable are designed to compensate the beneficiaries for the losses they suffer as a result of the decedents deat h, and not to accumulate an estate for the decedent. O'Connor v. Several Unknown Correctional Officers, 523 F. Supp. 1345, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15128 (E.D. Va. 1981). The only limit imposed on the amount of wrongful death damages is what may seem fair and just. Miltier v. Beorn, 696 F. Supp. 1086, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11549 (E.D. Va. 1988). Section 8.01-25 defers to the wrongful death statute as the exclusive statement of the g rievances that Virginia will recognize when a tort victim dies of her injuries. El-Meswari v. Washington Gas Light Co., 785 F.2d 483, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 22681 (4th Cir. 1986). Punitive damages provision not retroactive.  Allowing punitive damages in a wrongful death action constitutes a major change in both the effect and purpose of the Virginia Death by Wrongful Act statute. To r etroactively apply such a significant change in the law without an explicit legislative directive would be to ignore an established rule of statutory construction as well as tampering with parties vested rights and incurred obligations as they existe d under the then existing law. Accordingly, the 1982 amendment to this section will not be given retroactive effect. Estate of Armentrout v. International Harvester Co., 547 F. Supp. 136, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15718 (W.D. Va. 1982). Punitive damages.  Court erred by granting a physicians motion to strike evidence pertaining to a punitive damages claim because the jury reasonably could have determined that t he physician was conscious of the risks associated with the long-term use of narcotic pain medication and the patients increased risk of drug abuse and addiction and that the physician consciously disregarded those risks when the physician continued to prescribe the medication to the patient while not examining the patient for signs of abuse or addiction for a significant period of time. Curtis v. Highfill, 298 Va. 499, 840 S.E.2d 321, 2020 Va. LEXIS 38 (2020). Notwithstanding remedial aspects of such provision.  While a statute which alters procedures or supplies remedies for enforcing an existing right may be given retrospective effect, there must still be some indicatio n that the legislature enacting the statutory change intends it be given such operation. The 1982 General Assembly has not indicated that it intended the amendment to operate retrospectively. Therefore, even if the amendment is considered remedial, the c ourt will not apply it in cases arising prior to its effective date. Estate of Armentrout v. International Harvester Co., 547 F. Supp. 136, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15718 (W.D. Va. 1982). 1974 amendment did not allow punitive damages.  The 1974 amendment to former § 8-636.1 could only be interpreted to indicate the legislatures intent that the enumerated elements listed as recoverable dam ages were not meant to exclude other factors a jury could consider in arriving at compensation for the beneficiarys loss. It did not allow punitive damages. Estate of Armentrout v. International Harvester Co., 547 F. Supp. 136, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15718 (W.D. Va. 1982). Dependency n ot prerequisite.  The damage provision of this statute requires proof of loss by the statutory beneficiary or beneficiaries. Dependency is not a prerequisite. Marshall v. Goughnour , 221 Va. 265, 269 S.E.2d 801, 1980 Va. LEXIS 244 (1980). Beneficiary under the Virginia Wrongful Death Act need not be a dependent, nor a minor child. Wilson v. United States, 637 F. Supp. 669, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 246 66 (E.D. Va. 1986). Award not intended to be replacement for loss sustained.  Under the broad language of this section, any pecuniary loss suffered by the statutory beneficiaries is clearly a proper element of damage, but lo ss of comfort, guidance and society, like sorrow, mental anguish and solace, are virtually incalculable except in a rough and gross manner. Money is no substitute, and under the statute the amount which may be awarded is what may seem fair and just.  Such an award is not suggested or intended to be replacement of the loss sustained. It is the means provided by which the damaging party may make some amends for the wrong done. Sawyer v. United States, 465 F. Supp. 282, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14289 (E.D. Va. 1978). Damages determined from facts and circumstances.  Damages in a death case where the measure is what is fair and just, as in personal injury actions, are to be determined from all of the facts and circumstances. S awyer v. United States, 465 F. Supp. 282, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14289 (E.D. Va. 1978). Error to limit damages to funeral expenses.  A jury verdict for the exact amount of a decedents funeral expenses was inadequate as a matter of law because it failed to compensate her statutory beneficiar ies for any other items of damage; by returning a verdict for only the amount of the funeral expenses, the jury demonstrated a misunderstanding of either the law or the facts or both in that the evidence at trial clearly supported the conclusion that the decedents statutory beneficiaries experienced sorrow, mental anguish and loss of solace as a r...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-53"><akn:num>§ 8.01-53</akn:num><akn:heading>Class and beneficiaries; when determined</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Subsection 8.01-53 A (i) and (ii), similar to former §§ 8-636.1 and 8-638, defines the class and beneficiaries to receive the damages awarded and states whe n they are to be determined. Subsection A (iii) is the final proviso of former § 8-638 with one exception. By referring to parent, the former section included as beneficiaries with in the third class only the mother or father of the decedent and not both. By referring to parent or parents, the third class now includes as beneficiaries both living parents or either surviving one. Subsection B sets the time when the class and beneficiaries who may receive the awarded damages will be fixed. This proposal codifies case law. See e.g., Baltimor e &amp; O.R.R. v.

I.Decisions Under Current Law. The classes of beneficiaries named in the statute are exclusive; a court is not at liber ty to consider additional or alternative beneficiaries. Hewitt v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 490 F. Supp. 1358, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11778 (E.D. Va. 1980). Determination of eligible beneficiary.  Under subsection B of this section, any person included among the pertinent categories of beneficiaries specified in subsection A at the time the jurys verdic t is entered is a beneficiary eligible to receive a distribution. Mann v. Hinton, 249 Va. 555, 457 S.E.2d 22, 1995 Va. LEXIS 45 (1995). Beneficiaries under this section distinguished from general beneficiaries .  Virginia makes a careful distinction between beneficiaries under this section and the general beneficiaries of the decedents estate. Miltier v. Beorn, 696 F. Supp. 1086, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11549 (E.D. Va. 1988). Personal representative merely surrogate for beneficiaries.  Section 8.01-50(B) vests the right of action in the decedents personal representative. The right of action, however, is not a right to enforce a cause of acti on personal to the personal representative. As the party-plaintiff, he is merely a surrogate for the beneficiaries of the cause of action named in this section. Horn v. Abernathy, 231 Va. 228, 343 S.E.2d 318, 1986 Va. LEXIS 184 (1986). Because an administrator could only prosecute a wrongful death action on behalf of the beneficiaries identified in § 8.01-53, the administrator was not entitle d to file the action pro se; therefore, in the absence of a valid motion for judgment, there were no pleadings that could be amended. Kone v. Wilson, 272 Va. 59, 630 S.E.2d 744, 2006 Va. LEXIS 70 (2006). Recovery on behalf of widow and children.  Estate of a U.S. AID worker who was killed in the 1983 U.S. Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, was the proper plaintiff to bring a wrongful death action against defendants, the Islamic Republic of Iran and its Ministry of Intelligence and Security, and any recovery was for the benefit of the decedents surviving spouse and children. Dammarell v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 404 F. Supp. 2d 261, 2005 U.S. Dist. L EXIS 32618 (D.D.C. 2005). Issue of paternity of beneficiary in a wrongful death suit was one for resolution by the jury. Cassady v. Martin, 220 Va. 1093, 266 S.E.2d 104, 1980 Va. LEXIS 205 (1980). St andard of proof of paternity.  Absent the presumption of legitimacy which attaches to a child born in wedlock, the standard of proof of paternity in a wrongful death case is proof by a preponde rance of the evidence. Smith v. Givens, 223 Va. 455, 290 S.E.2d 844, 1982 Va. LEXIS 224 (1982). When hearsay evidence of paternity admissible.  For purposes of the pedigree exception to the hearsay rule, the decedent in a wrongful death action is a member of the family or related to the family, whose hist ory the decedents declaration of paternity concerns, viz., the family composed of those named as beneficiaries in this section; thus, hearsay evidence of the decedents declarations is admissible in such a case, provided no other better evidence c an be obtained. Smith v. Givens, 223 Va. 455, 290 S.E.2d 844, 1982 Va. LEXIS 224 (1982). Hearsay evidence of paternity precluded where mothers testimony avail able.  In wrongful death case, where alleged illegitimate child of decedent, under the provisions of § 8.01-411 et seq. and Indiana law, could have taken his mother s deposition in Indiana and, in compliance with Supreme Court Rule 4:7(a)(4), introduced her testimony as direct evidence in support of his claim, the pedigree exception did not apply and the trial court erred in admitting hearsay evidence of deceden ts paternity.

Code 1950, § 8-638; 1954, c. 333; 1973, c. 401; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-54 is based on former § 8-638 and clarifies the procedure for the specification of the damages awarded under § 8.01-52 and distribution to thos e beneficiaries determined under § 8.01-53. Subsection A is the substance of the first two sentences of former § 8-638. Subsection B requires the court, upon request of either party, to instruct the jury to specify the distribution of the award among the beneficiaries and clarifies the courts authority to apportion the award. Subsection C provides that the damages awarded are to be paid to the decedents personal representative. After payment of costs and reasonable attorneys fe es, the representative is to distribute the medical and funeral expenses as specifically allocated under § 8.01-52. The remainder of the awarded damages are to be distributed as specified in subsections A and B to the beneficiaries as determined under § 8.01-53. If there are no beneficiaries under § 8.01-53, the personal representative is to dispose of the remaining awarded damages according to law; then, and only then, can the remainder of the awarded damages be subjected to claims by creditor s of the decedent.

CASE NOTES Any distribution of the fund recovered for a tortious killing committed in this State must be in accordance with the death by wrongful act statutes. Withrow v. Edwards, 181 Va. 344, 25 S.E.2d 343, 1943 Va. LEXIS 185, set aside, 181 Va. 592, 25 S.E.2d 899, 1943 Va. LEXIS 207 (1943); Matthews v. Hicks, 197 Va. 112, 87 S.E.2d 629, 1955 Va. LEXIS 202 (1955) (decided under prior law). The death by wrongful act statutes create the right of action for tortious death, limit the recovery, and name the classes of beneficiaries who may share in the r ecovery. Such recovery can be distributed only in accordance with the express terms of the statute. Porter v. VEPCO, 183 Va. 108, 31 S.E.2d 337, 1944 Va. LEXIS 135 (1944) (decided under prior law). Damages are not part of decedent s estate.  Damages recovered in an action for wrongful death are not part of the estate of the decedent, and the recovery can be distributed only in accordance with the expr ess terms of this statute. Porter v. VEPCO, 183 Va. 108, 31 S.E.2d 337, 1944 Va. LEXIS 135 (1944) (decided under prior law). And are not subject to dower or curtes y.  The damages recovered in an action for wrongful death are not subject to the dower or curtesy of the surviving consort. Porter v. VEPCO, 183 Va. 108, 31 S.E.2d 33 7, 1944 Va. LEXIS 135 (1944) (decided under prior law). The use of special verdicts in negligence cases is unknown in Virginia, and, unless the parties agree otherwise, there is no reason to require such a verdict where negligence results in death and causes sorrow, mental anguish, lost income, and lost services and protection. Rather, damages for these elements should be awarded in a lump sum and distributed to the beneficiaries according to this section. Johnson v. Smith, 241 Va. 396, 403 S.E.2d 685, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2225, 1991 Va. LEXIS 64 (1991). Trial cour t has authority to question attorneys fees.  Legislature intended issue of reasonableness of attorneys fees to issue in settlement of any wrongful death case; thus, trial court erred in stating that it h ad no authority to question attorneys fees. Lovelace v. Lovelace, 237 Va. 174, 375 S.E.2d 750, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1538, 1989 Va. LEXIS 20 (1989). Distribution o f award is left to courts discretion.  Estate of a U.S. AID worker who was killed in the 1983 U.S. Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, brought a wrongful death action against defendants, the Islamic Re public of Iran and its Ministry of Intelligence and Security for the benefit of the decedents surviving spouse and children, and the precise distribution of the award among the statutory beneficiaries was left to the courts discretion. Dammarell v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 404 F. Supp. 2d 261, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32618 (D.D.C. 2005). Minor beneficiaries.  In a wrongful death case, the trial court erred when it refused to direct payment of the minor beneficiaries awards to the personal representatives and instea d ordered that the awards be placed in a bank account maintained by the clerk of court. The trial court had no authority to disregard the statutory command under subsection C of § 8.01-54 directing that the award shall be paid to the personal represen tatives. In re Woodley, 290 Va. 482, 777 S.E.2d 560, 2015 Va. LEXIS 141 (2015). Evidence of debts of deceden t inadmissible.  As the wrongful death action recovery is exclusively for the benefit of certain class beneficiaries, and free from all debts of the decedent, evidence of such ite ms would not be admissible in such action. Holley v. The Manfred Stansfield, 186 F. Supp. 805, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4249 (E.D. Va. 1960) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Distribution o f award is left to courts discretion.  After a settlement was reached in a wrongful death action, the trial court had authority to determine how to distribute the settlement proceeds that remained afte r payment of court-approved attorneys fees among the seven statutory beneficiaries. Because of the close relationship evidenced between the deceased, his second wife to whom he had been married since 1989, their minor child and the deceaseds mino r stepson, the court awarded the majority of the settlement award to those three beneficiaries, and awarded a nominal award to each of the deceaseds four grown children from a previous marriage. Squillaci v. Lewis-Gale Hosp., Inc., 2006 Va. Cir. LEXI S 139 (Roanoke Sept. 1, 2006). Consent judgment not void ab initio.  Assuming the trial court in a wrongful death action resulting in a consent agreement failed to specify the amount to be received by the beneficiaries as required by subsection A of § 8.01-54, the failure to do so did not void the judgment; a judgment is void ab initio only if it has been procured by extrinsic or collateral fraud, or entered by a court that did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter or t he parties.

Such approval may be applied for on petition to s uch court, by the personal representative, or by any potential defendant, or by any interested insurance carrier. If a potential defendant or any insurance carrier petitions the court for approval, the personal representative shall be made a party to the proceeding. The petition shall state the compromise, its terms and the reason therefor. The court shall require the convening of the parties in interest in person or by their authorized representative, but it shall not be necessary to convene grandchild ren whose living parents are made parties to the proceeding. The parties in interest shall be deemed to be convened if each such party (i) endorses the order by which the court approves the compromise or (ii) is given notice of the hearing and proposed c ompromise as provided in § 8.01-296 if a resident of the Commonwealth or as provided in § 8.01-320 if a nonresident, or is otherwise given reasonable notice of the hearing and proposed compromise as may be required by the court. If the court approves the compromise, and the parties in interest do not agree upon the distribution to be made of what has been or may be received by the personal repr esentative under such compromise, or if any of them are incapable of making a valid agreement, the court shall direct such distribution as a jury might direct under § 8.01-52 as to damages awarded by them. In other respects, what is received by the pe rsonal representative under the compromise shall be treated as if recovered by him in an action under § 8.01-52. History History.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  In a wrongful death case arising from an alleged wrongful death in Iraq in which the district court was asked to approve a settlement agreement, the Virginia wron gful death statute, §§ 8.01.50 through 8.01.56, did not have extraterritorial application. The claim of the deceaseds estate and his widow and two sons, who were all Iraqi citizens, did not arise under or by virtue of the Virginia statute. Esta te of Sa'Adoon v. Prince, 660 F. Supp. 2d 723, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97973 (E.D. Va. 2009). Parties in inter est have general grant of standing.  Legislature meant for parties in interest to be heard once they were convened; thus, this section provides general grant of standing to parties in interest to be heard in proceeding to approve compromise. Lovelace v. Lovelace, 237 Va. 174, 375 S.E.2d 750, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1538, 1989 Va. LEXIS 20 (1989). May mandatory.  The legislative purpose in changing the old law was to require court approval of all compromises in order better to protect those the legislature had selected as beneficiaries. In light of that purpose, the word may as used in the second sentence of this section is mandatory. Under that construction, the first sentence grants the authority to compromise, and the second specifies the condition of that auth ority. Caputo v. Holt, 217 Va. 302, 228 S.E.2d 134, 1976 Va. LEXIS 276 (1976) (decided under former version of this section). Release absent court approval not binding.  When a circuit court approves a compromise settlement under this section, the terms of the release on which it is based likewise are subject to the courts app roval. Ramey v. Bobbitt, 250 Va. 474, 463 S.E.2d 437, 1995 Va. LEXIS 128 (1995) (decided under former version of this section). Trial cour t has authority to question attorneys fees.  Legislature intended issue of reasonableness of attorneys fees to issue in settlement of any wrongful death case; thus, trial court erred in stating that it h ad no authority to question attorneys fees. Lovelace v. Lovelace, 237 Va. 174, 375 S.E.2d 750, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1538, 1989 Va. LEXIS 20 (1989). Be neficiaries have standing to challenge attorneys fees.  Statutory beneficiaries in wrongful death case have standing to challenge reasonableness of attorneys fees. Lovelace v. Lovelace, 237 Va. 174, 375 S.E.2d 750, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1538, 1989 Va. LEXIS 20 (1989). Settlements of wrongful death claims open to public.  The judicial records in issue were accumulated in a wrongful death action. Settlements of wrongful death claims must be approved by the courts, and the public has a societal interest in learning whether compromise settlements are equitable and whether the courts are administering properly the powers conferred upon them, therefore, the trial court erred in sealing that class of data. Shenandoah Publishing House, I nc. v. Fanning, 235 Va. 253, 368 S.E.2d 253, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2424, 1988 Va. LEXIS 55 (1988). Settling parties contention that § 8.01-55 did not require a written petition to the circuit court or that such petition need not state the financial terms of the compromise settlement was not supported by the plain meaning of the language of the statute. Therefore, the circuit court did not err in construing § 8.01-55 to require a party seeking approval of a compromise settlement of a wrongful death cl aim to file in the court a written petition that included the complete and unredacted terms of the compromise settlement. Perreault v. Free Lance-Star, 276 Va. 375, 666 S.E.2d 352, 2008 Va. LEXIS 96 (2008). Given the salutary purpose of § 8.01-55, the court could not conceive that the General Assembly intended to permit the confidentiality provisions allowed but n ot required by § 8.01-581.22 to trump the provisions of § 8.01-55 and, consequently, the right of public access provided for by § 17.1-208 in the context of the records of court approval of the compromise settlement of a wrongful death claim ach ieved through mediation. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err when the court ruled that in approving the compromise settlements in the present cases, the court was not subject to a de jure requirement under § 8.01-581.22 to place the record, or at least that portion of the record detailing the financial terms of the compromise settlements, under seal. Perreault v. Free Lance-Star, 276 Va. 375, 666 S.E.2d 352, 2008 Va. LEXIS 96 (2008). Release absent court approval not binding.  Absent court approval acquired in the manner provided by this section, the release executed by an unqualified administrator was not binding upon the statutory ben eficiaries, and the plea of release was properly denied. Caputo v. Holt, 217 Va. 302, 228 S.E.2d 134, 1976 Va. LEXIS 276 (1976). Those portions of a release that are not made part of a wrongful death compromise settlement approved by a circuit court are not binding on the parties to the rel ease. Ramey v. Bobbitt, 250 Va. 474, 463 S.E.2d 437, 1995 Va. LEXIS 128 (1995). This section does not apply in action by infant for personal injuries.  Sections 8.01-424 and 8.01-425 and this section relating to compromises by fiduciaries and on behalf of parties incapable of making binding contracts, have no app lication to a settlement effected involving the payment of the whole demand asserted by a motion in an action by an infant for personal injuries. The case stands upon the same footing as an adults case. Hinton v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 137 Va. 605, 120 S. E. 135, 1923 Va. LEXIS 183 (1923) (decided under former version of this section). Inclusion in court order.  Nothing in the language of the Wrongful Death Act, §§ 8.01-50 through 8.01-56, precludes the inclusion in a courts order of the affirmative relief the p arties have agreed to as part of their settlement of a Wrongful Death Action. Fisher v. Salute, 51 Va. App. 293, 657 S.E.2d 169, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 99 (2008). Contempt proceedings.  Where a dock owner agreed to remove a boat dock pursuant to a wrongful death settlement agreement that was included in the court order approving the settlement, t he dock owner was properly found in contempt because: (1) the dock owner used structures or objects on the property to moor or dock a boat; and (2) the trial court had jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement since nothing in the language of t he Wrongful Death Act precluded the inclusion in the trial courts order of the affirmative relief the parties had agreed to as part of their settlement of the wrongful death action. Fisher v. Salute, 51 Va. App. 293, 657 S.E.2d 169, 2008 Va. App. LEX IS 99 (2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Apportionment betw een statutory beneficiaries.  After a settlement was reached in a wrongful death action, the trial court had authority to determine how to distribute the settlement proceeds that remained afte r payment of court-approved attorneys fees among the seven statutory beneficiaries.

In such cases, however, there shall be but one recovery for the same injury. History History. Code 1950, § 8-640; 1954, c. 333; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE The second clause of former § 8-640 has been changed to eliminate certain procedural stipulations which are covered by § 8.01-50 and the rules. The former s ection provided for the dissolution of a corporate defendant.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Sections 8.01-21, 8.01-25, 8.01-50, and 8.01-56 compared.  The requirements of the survival and wrongful death statutes, §§ 8.01-25, 8.01-50 and 8.01-56, apply when the death occurs before a final verdict, whereas § 8.01-21 applies where the death occurs after the verdict. Boyd v. Bulala, 647 F. Supp. 781, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18099 (W.D. Va. 1986), amended, 678 F. Supp. 612, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1186 (W.D. Va. 1988), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 877 F.2d 1191, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 8364 (4th Cir. 1989); Bulala v. Boyd, 239 Va. 218, 389 S.E.2d 670, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1399, 1990 Va. LEXIS 44 (1990). Section 8.01-25 and this section are not in conflict with § 8.01-21. They were enacte d to extend the application of § 8.01-50, the wrongful death statute, those situations not covered by the original Lord Campbells Act, in which a plaintiff who has filed an action for personal injuries, dies of those injuries before a verdict is returned. It was unnecessary at common law to amend, revive, or convert the action of the party who survived the return of a verdict, and it is equally unnecessary under the present statutory scheme. Bulala v. Boyd, 239 Va. 218, 389 S.E.2d 670, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1399, 1990 Va. LEXIS 44 (1990). Death of a child born with birth defects after a medical malpractice verdict did not require converting her claim into one for wrongful death. Section 8.01-21 di rectly so provides, by directing that in such cases, judgment may be entered as if [death] had not occurred. Section 8.01-25 and this section are not in conflict. They deal with the situation where death occurs before verdict. Boyd v. Bulala, 9 05 F.2d 764, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 9498 (4th Cir. 1990). This section modifies the every cause of action language of § 8.01-25 to plac e all personal injury actions in which death occurred as a result of the injury under the wrongful death rubric. Miltier v. Beorn, 696 F. Supp. 1086, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11549 (E.D. Va. 1988). Conversion of foreign action to Virginia action.  A valid foreign personal injury action may be converted to a Virginia wrongful death action, even though the foreign action was not filed within Virginias two -year limitations period. Riddle v. Shell Oil Co., 764 F. Supp. 418, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19448 (W.D. Va. 1990). Choice of recovery theory in malpractice action.  The plain language contained in § 8.01-25 and this section unequivocally mandates that a person may not recover for the same injury under the survival statute and the wrongful death statute. There can be but one recovery. Hence, the plaintiffs in instant case, as a matter of law, could not have recovered in the underlying tort action against defendants on both theories of wrongful death and survival. Therefore , it necessarily follows that in the present malpractice action, at an appropriate time after discovery has been completed, the plaintiffs must be required to elect whether they will proceed against the defendant attorneys on the theory that the attorney s breached a duty owed to the plaintiffs in the prosecution of the wrongful death action or breached a duty owed to the plaintiffs in the prosecution of the survival action. Hendrix v. Daugherty, 249 Va. 540, 457 S.E.2d 71, 1995 Va. LEXIS 68 (1995). Although the administrators and the health care provider agreed that the administrators filing a medical malpractice action against the health care providers had to elect between recovering under their survival action claim pursuant to § 8.01-25 and wrongful death claim under § 8.01-50, which position also was supported under § 8.01-56, the administrators were entitled to present their claim to the jury and have the jury decide the issue of causation before the administrators had to make that election. As a result, the administrators could recover monetary damages awarded by the jury involving the survival act claim, especially since the verdict awardin g no damages on the wrongful death claim understood it could not award damages under both theories. Centra Health, Inc. v. Mullins, 277 Va. 59, 670 S.E.2d 708, 2009 Va. LEXIS 3 (2009). Choice of recovery in wrongful death cases.  Under Virginia law, a person could not recover for the same injury under the survival statute and the wrongful death statute if that injury or wrongful act result ed in the victims death; because decedents daughter had already recovered under the Virginia Wrongful Death Act in a state proceeding, plaintiff could not recover under the Maryland Survival Act, and the district court did not err in concluding t hat Virginia law barred plaintiff from proceeding under the Maryland Survival Act. Jones v. Prince George's County, 355 Fed. Appx. 724, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 26678 (4th Cir. 2009). No election of rem edy.  Circuit court erred in granting the motions to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiff elected a remedy when he settled the Kentucky personal injury action against the Kentucky medical providers, and that plaintiffs wrongful death action against the Virginia medical providers was barred by this statute because there was no language in this statute that would prohibit the filing of a wrongful death action in Vir ginia based on the settlement of a personal injury claim in another state; and Kentucky law allowed the filing of a personal injury claim in addition to a wrongful death claim for the same injury. Green v. Diagnostic Imaging Assocs., P.C., 299 Va. 1, 843 S.E.2d 371, 2020 Va. LEXIS 61 (2020). No double recovery.  This Statute and other statutory and common-law principles prohibiting double recovery did not bar plaintiffs Virginia wrongful death action from moving forwa rd as any alleged double recovery based on the settlement of a personal injury claim in Kentucky could be addressed by the circuit court. Green v. Diagnostic Imaging Assocs., P.C., 299 Va. 1, 843 S.E.2d 371, 2020 Va. LEXIS 61 (2020). Where two witnesses vary in their statements of facts.  Where administratrix brought action for personal injuries based on nursing homes treatment of decedent, dismissal of the action prior to completion of administrat rixs evidence deprived her of opportunity to prove damages for personal injury and, therefore, constituted reversible error; although one doctor testified that nursing homes treatment hastened decedents death, the testimony did not leave admi nistratrix with only a wrongful death action; court should have allowed administratrix to proceed with testimony of another doctor that the cause of death was pneumonia since when two or more witnesses introduced by a party litigant vary in their stateme nts of fact, such party has the right to ask the court or jury to accept as true the statements most favorable to him. Lucas v. HCMF Corp., 238 Va. 446, 384 S.E.2d 92, 6 Va. Law Rep. 601, 1989 Va. LEXIS 151 (1989). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Purpose of statute.  This section was designed to give the right of revival in cases where the plaintiff in actions for personal injuries died pending the action, without regard to th e cause of death, and not to make all actions for personal injuries revivable. Birmingham v. C &amp; O Ry., 98 Va. 548, 37 S.E. 17, 1900 Va. LEXIS 76 (1900). Right given is not strictly a survival of the right of action.  While this section gives a statutory right in case of the death of the plaintiff that right given is not, properly speaking, a survival of the right of action as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Ruebush v. Funk, 63 F.2d 170, 1933 U.S. App. LEXIS 3354 (4th Cir. 1933). But see Tignor v. Parkinson, 729 F.2d 977, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 24480 (4th Cir. 1984). The statutes of Virginia do not, in any real sense, provide for the survival of a right of action for personal injury if the injured person dies as a result of th e injury. Grady v.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. For history of Virginia Employers Liability Act, see Karabalis v. E.I. Du Pont De Ne mours &amp; Co., 129 Va. 151, 105 S.E. 755, 1921 Va. LEXIS 84 (1921). Power of legislature to clas sify railroads.  It is within the constitutional authority of the legislature in enactments such as the Virginia Employers Liability Act, which are in the exercise of the poli ce power of the State, to adopt a classification which would embrace every corporation operating every kind of road or way on which rails of iron are laid for the wheels of cars to run on, without regard to the character of the railroad as fixed by the b usiness in which it is engaged, e.g., whether the corporation is engaged in the business of a common carrier or of manufacturing. Karabalis v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., 129 Va. 151, 105 S.E. 755, 1921 Va. LEXIS 84 (1921). This section is not applicable to railroads engaged in interstate commerce. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Hall, 49 F.2d 692, 1931 U.S. App. LEXIS 3240 (4th Cir. 1931). But no allegation as to intrastate commerce is necessary.  Where an injured railroad employee is suing the employer for injuries sustained in employment, it is unnecessary to allege that the employee was engaged in intras tate commerce which is allegation for surplusage, because this and the following sections, covering intrastate commerce, are almost word for word like the federal act. Norfolk &amp; P. Belt Line R.R. v. White, 143 Va. 875, 129 S.E. 339, 1925 Va. LEXIS 310 (1 925). Construction of similar acts adopted.  This section closely follows the language of the Federal Employers Liability Act, and the Supreme Court will adopt the construction placed upon apposite langu age by the Supreme Court of the United States. C &amp; O Ry. v. Mizelle, 136 Va. 237, 118 S.E. 241, 1923 Va. LEXIS 82 (1923). The general rule is that when the General Assembly adopts a statute which has been previously enacted by another sovereignty and construed by the courts of that s overeignty, then such previous construction of the statute is held to be also adopted. C &amp; O Ry. v. Mizelle, 136 Va. 237, 118 S.E. 241, 1923 Va. LEXIS 82 (1923). Statute is considered in light of kindred legislation.  Whatever may be the specific words used in an employers liability act, or in kindred legislation to classify the objects of the statute, the legislative meani ng of the words must be found by considering them in the light of other legislation in the particular state on the same subject, and of the meaning which is given to the same words in other existing general legislation of such state. Karabalis v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., 129 Va. 151, 105 S.E. 755, 1921 Va. LEXIS 84 (1921). Private railroad operated by manufacturing company not within act.  The Virginia Employers Liability Act, as contained in this article, does not apply to the class of employees therein specified of a manufacturing corporation operating in the State a private railroad, merely incidental to and in connection with its manufacturing business. The act only applies to employees of corporations operating in this State railroads used or authorized by law to be used as common carriers engaged in intrastate commerce. Karabalis v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., 129 Va. 151, 105 S.E. 755, 1921 Va. LEXIS 84 (1921). Machinist re pairing engine in shop cannot invoke act.  The plaintiff, a machinist, who was working on the repair of an engine in the shops of defendant railway, was not engaged in intrastate commerce, or transportatio n service, within the meaning of the Virginia statute, and hence cannot invoke either this section or § 8.01-59, which applies to actions brought under this section. Plaintiff was not engaged in either interstate or intrastate commerce. C &amp; O Ry. v. M izelle, 136 Va. 237, 118 S.E. 241, 1923 Va.

Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . Employment need not be intrastate commerce as in §§ 8.01-57 and 8.01-59.  It was argued that this section both in the Code and in the original act (Acts 1916, p. 763), should be construed together with the preceding § 8.01-57 and the following § 8.01-59, and that so construed all three refer to injuries suffered while the employees are engaged in intrastate commerce. But it was held that such a construction would do violence to the language of the section. C &amp; O Ry. v. Mizelle, 1 36 Va. 237, 118 S.E. 241, 1923 Va. LEXIS 82 (1923). Test is whether carrier is engaged in intrastate commerce.  Under this section, contributory negligence is no longer an absolute bar to an action by an injured employee of any common carrier by railroad whose motive power is steam engaged in intrastate commerce, whether such employee is injured while engaged in such commerce or not. The test under this section is not whether at the time of his injury the employee was engaged in intrastate commerce, but merely whether the defendant carrier is engaged in such commerce. C &amp; O Ry. v. Mizelle, 136 Va. 237, 118 S.E. 241, 1923 Va. LEXIS 82 (1923). Negligence of defendant mu st be established.  Until the negligence of defendant is established, no question of contributory negligence of plaintiff can arise. It is essential, therefore, first to establish th e negligence of the defendant. In the instant case, negligence of defendant was not established, as the failure of plaintiffs intestate to put up the blue flag for his protection, as required by a rule of the railroad company, was the sole proximate cause of his death. Shumaker's Adm'r v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., 125 Va. 393, 99 S.E. 739, 1919 Va. LEXIS 32 (1919). There is nothing in this section which denies the defense of assumed risk, though to a l imited extent it is denied by § 8.01-59 in actions brought under § 8.01-57. C &amp; O Ry. v. Mizelle, 136 Va. 237, 118 S.E. 241, 1923 Va. LEXIS 82 (1923). Contributory negligenc e does not bar recovery.  Unlike § 8.01-58, which specifically provides that contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery in action brought by employees against a common carrier whe re death resulted from the common carriers violation of a statute enacted for the safety of employees, nothing in the Newport News Building Code or Code of City of Newport News § 10-3, allows recovery regardless of a plaintiffs negligence. The refore, plaintiff who fell backwards over a balcony that did not comply with the height requirements of the building code could not recover against buildings owner, even though owner was per se negligent for violating code, because her contributory n egligence barred her recovery.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Purpose of section.  This section was intended to conform the law of assumption of risk in intrastate commerce to the rule applied by the federal decisions to the similar statute appl icable to interstate commerce. Roberts v. Southern Ry., 151 Va. 815, 144 S.E. 863, 1928 Va. LEXIS 276 (1928). No eff ect on interstate carriers when Congress has acted.  Where Congress has spoken upon the question of the liability of interstate carriers to their employees, this section, as to assumption of risk and the violation o f the Safety Appliance Act, cannot be looked to for guidance as to the liability of such carriers to their employees.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE The reference in former § 8-646 to any act of Congress of the United States of America has been deleted and statute of the United States or this Co mmonwealth has been substituted. This change does not broaden the scope of former § 8-646 but is made to reflect case law that it is not necessary for the plaintiff to specify whether the action is brought under the United States or the Virginia s tatute; i.e., it is sufficient if the facts alleged bring the action within either statute since the Virginia court has jurisdiction under both the federal and State laws.

Master and Servant, § 79. CASE NOTES State and federal statutes exclusive in their jurisdiction.  Whenever the acts of Congress relative to the liability of common carriers engaged in interstate commerce to their employees are applicable, they are exclusive, b ut if not applicable and the state statute is, the latter will be applied. No case can arise where both statutes are applicable. Shumaker's Adm'r v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., 125 Va. 393, 99 S.E. 739, 1919 Va. LEXIS 32 (1919) (decided under prior law). But state court has jurisdiction o f both.  It is often extremely difficult to determine whether the injured servant was engaged in interstate commerce or not. The advantage of suing in the state court is t hat that court has jurisdiction under both acts, and if necessary facts are stated, jurisdiction will be maintained under the appropriate statute.

Simple negligence is the failure to exercise that degree of care that an ordinary pruden t person would exercise under the same or similar circumstances to avoid injury to another. Gossett v. Jackson, 249 Va. 549, 457 S.E.2d 97, 1995 Va. LEXIS 62 (1995). Sufficient evidence of drivers conduct as proximate cause of negligence.  Plaintiffs presented evidence from which the jury could have inferred that defendants negligence was a proximate cause of the accident. For example, defen dant had previously stopped the car at intersections minutes before the accident occurred and the jury could have found that but for defendants excessive speed of 60 m.p.h., he would have been able to use the brakes to stop the car and, thus, prevent the accident. The jury could have also found that the cars mechanical condition was not a proximate cause of the accident because police officer testified that the condition of the car did not affect its speed. Furthermore, the jury could have found that defendant was negligent in his operation of the car because he took his hands off the steering wheel of the car as it was weaving and traveling at a speed of 60 m.p.h. immediately before the collision. Gossett v. Jackson, 249 Va. 549, 457 S .E.2d 97, 1995 Va. LEXIS 62 (1995). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Statute does not apply to transportation by airplane.  Transportation by airplane is markedly different from transportation by automobile, and neither this section nor the policy behind it should be applied to airplan e travel without legislative action. Walthew v. Davis, 201 Va. 557, 111 S.E.2d 784, 1960 Va. LEXIS 129 (1960). Guest defined.  The word guest is used to denote one whom the owner or possessor of a motor car or other vehicle invites or permits to ride with him as a gratuity, that i s, without any financial return, except such slight benefits as it is customary to extend as a part of the ordinary courtesies of the road. Thus the mere benefit resulting from companionship, or the advantage resulting from a promise to assist in the dri ving, is not of a legal value sufficient in itself to transfer a gratuitous undertaking into an undertaking for payment. Mayer v. Puryear, 115 F.2d 675, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 2965 (4th Cir. 1940). Even though he may be driving his hosts car, a person is still considered a guest as far as his host is concerned. Mayer v. Puryear, 115 F.2d 675, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 2965 (4th Cir. 1940); Leonard v. Helms, 269 F.2d 48, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 3444 (4th Cir. 1959). There was no business relationship between plaintiff and defendant where plaintiff under took to assist defendant and another friend in helping move material in a truck and the offer to help was a nature of rendition of neighborly assistance without expectation of personal benefit or compensation. The plaintiff was riding as a mere guest. Mi ller v. Ellis, 188 Va. 207, 49 S.E.2d 273, 1948 Va. LEXIS 158 (1948). To raise the status of a passenger from that of guest to paying passenger there must be shown more than incidental benefit conferred on, or social amenities extended to, the owner or operator of the vehicle; the benefit must be a consideration for the transportation. Davis v. Williams, 194 Va. 541, 74 S.E.2d 58, 1953 Va. LEXIS 116 (1953); D ickerson v. Miller, 196 Va. 659, 85 S.E.2d 275, 1955 Va. LEXIS 136 (1955). Where plaintiff upon defendants invitation rode to work with him and voluntarily paid the defendant, without request, the equivalent of bus fare regularly for a period of more than one year, it was held that plaintiff was a paying passenger and not a guest within the meaning of this section. Davis v. Williams, 194 Va. 541, 74 S.E.2d 58, 1953 Va. LEXIS 116 (1953). Payments made or services performed for transportation, to be sufficient to elevate one from a guest to a paying passenger, must be more than gratuitous gestures of reciprocal hospitality, or social amenities, extended without thought of bargaining for the transportation. Groome v. Birkhead, 214 Va. 429, 201 S.E.2d 789, 1974 Va. LEXIS 154 (1974). It is not necessary that driver receive actual cash in return for transpo rtation.  With respect to payment it is not necessary that the operator of the vehicle receive actual cash in return for the transportation supplied, since services or other benefits given by the occupant, if regarded by the parties as consideration inducing the offer of transportation, may be sufficient to entitle the occupant to the status of a paying passenger, as distinguished from a guest passenger. Dickerson v. Miller, 196 Va. 659, 85 S.E.2d 275, 1955 Va. LEXIS 136 (1955); Hill Hdwe. Corp. v. Hesson, 198 Va. 425, 94 S.E.2d 256, 1956 Va. LEXIS 225 (1956) (commented on in 13 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 84 (1956); Richardson v. Charles, 201 Va. 426, 111 S.E.2d 401, 195 9 Va. LEXIS 245 (1959); Parker v. Leavitt, 201 Va. 919, 114 S.E.2d 732, 1960 Va. LEXIS 178 (1960); Gilliland v. Singleton, 204 Va. 115, 129 S.E.2d 641, 1963 Va. LEXIS 123 (1963). The payment referred to in this section does not, of course, have to be in cash in order to make the occupant a paying passenger rather than a guest. If a person bargains for services and the transportation is given in consideration thereof, the person performing the services is a paying passenger and not a guest passenger, but the services performed must be more than gratuitous gestures of reciprocal hospitality , or social amenities extended without thought of bargaining for the transportation. Smith v. Tatum, 199 Va. 85, 97 S.E.2d 820, 1957 Va. LEXIS 166 (1957). And one who performs services in return for transportation is paying passe nger.  If a person bargains for services and as consideration therefor offers transportation, the person performing or agreeing to perform the services and accepting suc h transportation is a paying passenger and not a guest passenger. Dickerson v. Miller, 196 Va. 659, 85 S.E.2d 275, 1955 Va. LEXIS 136 (1955) (commented on in 13 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 84 (1956)). Defendant, who was manager of a restaurant, by promising her transportation home, induced decedent to stay beyond her usual hours to clean up. Decedent was theref ore a paying passenger. Dickerson v. Miller, 196 Va. 659, 85 S.E.2d 275, 1955 Va. LEXIS 136 (1955). It is not necessary to prove that there was an express enforceable contract between the operator and the occupant of a motor vehicle resulting from considerations moving from one to the other to raise the status of the occupant from that of a guest to that of a paying passenger. However, mere giving and receiving of friendly and reciprocal benefits and amenities between the driver and occupant without any thought of creating a business or contractual relation is insufficient to change the status of a guest to that of a paying passenger within the meaning of this section. Hill Hdwe. Corp. v . Hesson, 198 Va. 425, 94 S.E.2d 256, 1956 Va. LEXIS 225 (1956). But mere incidental benefit is not sufficient.  An incidental benefit resulting to the defendant from transportation is not sufficient to enlarge the liability from guest to passenger. The benefit to the defend ant must be a consideration for the transportation. More than an incidental benefit must have induced the defendant to extend the ride. The benefits, in short, must be more than gratuitous gestures of reciprocal hospitality, or social amenities, extended without thought of bargaining for the transportation. Richardson v. Charles, 201 Va. 426, 111 S.E.2d 401, 1959 Va. LEXIS 245 (1959). Owner does not become guest of one whom he allows to drive.  The owner of a car did not lose his character of host and become the guest of his companion when he permitted her to drive the car for her own pleasure. The chang e of places in the vehicle did not alter the relationship of host and guest, where the guest asked for and was granted the privilege of driving the car. There was no gratuitous undertaking on her part for the benefit of the owner but, rather, the accepta nce of a favor from him, which was tendered because it gave her pleasure. Leonard v.

The case cited below was decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Section must be strictly construed.  This section, while remedial, is in derogation of the common law and, therefore must be strictly construed. It must be presumed that the legislature acted with fu ll knowledge of the strict interpretation that must be placed upon a statute of the nature of this section. Hannabass v. Ryan, 164 Va. 519, 180 S.E. 416, 1935 Va. LEXIS 226 (1935). The language who is not permitted under the provisions of § 46.1-357 [§ 46.2-335] . . . To drive deals solely with those not licensed by the State to operate a motor vehicle upon the streets and highways. Had the legislature intended to extend the liability of the owner of a motor vehicle to embrace those who may be prohibit ed from the operation of such a vehicle by a city ordinance it would have so expressed that intention in the statute.

When duty of good faith arises.  Fact that interest and costs are measured from the date of the claim shows that the General Assembly intended the duty of good faith to arise when the insured is presently owed under the terms of the policy; in an uninsured motorist policy context, that does not occur when the insured requests damages the insurer has no present obligation to pay, but rather when the insured obtains judgment against the uninsured tortfeasor. Manu v. GEICO Cas. Co., 293 Va. 371, 798 S.E.2d 598, 2017 Va. LEXIS 73 (2017). Uninsured motorist carrier s duty to settle.  Statutory framework and legislative history confirm that uninsured motorist (UM) carriers have no duty to settle prior to trial, and reading the statutes in harmo ny indicates that the UM carriers decision to settle pretrial is similarly discretionary; a carrier may settle prior to the insured obtaining judgment, but it has no duty to do so.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this chapter and this section, as used below, r efer to former provisions. Infants lands can be sold only as provided in this chapter.  Infants lands can be sold only under the authority and for the purpose contained in this and the following sections of this chapter. Clark v. George, 161 Va. 104, 170 S.E. 713, 1933 Va. LEXIS 301 (1933). Section is to be liberally construed.  This section is highly remedial, and upon familiar principles must receive a liberal construction, to give effect to the intention of the legislature and enhance the remedy. Faulkner v. Davis, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 651, 1868 Va. LEXIS 29 (1868); Rhea v. Shields, 103 Va. 305, 49 S.E. 70, 1904 Va. LEXIS 39 (1904). As to subjects to be s old.  The rule requiring a liberal construction to be placed upon statutes for the sale of lands of persons under disability has reference rather to the subjects sought to be sold in which such persons are interested than to the procedure by which such sales are effected. It does not authorize a mode of procedure not in substantial compliance with the statute authorizing the sale. Coleman v. Virginia Stave &amp; Heading Co ., 112 Va. 61, 70 S.E. 545, 1911 Va. LEXIS 53 (1911) (see also Parker v. Stephenson, 127 Va. 431, 104 S.E. 39 (1920)). But substantial compliance with provisions of this chapter is required.  When a suit is instituted to confirm the sale of infants lands, there must be not only a substantial compliance with this section but a substantial compliance with the other provisions of this chapter. Clark v. George, 161 Va. 104, 170 S.E. 713, 1933 Va. LEXIS 301 (1933). If a suit for the sale of lands of an insane person be brought under this section, there must be a substantial compliance with the other sections of this chapter. Wheeler v. Thomas, 116 Va. 259, 81 S.E. 51, 1914 Va. LEXIS 30 (1914). Character of property not changed except to extent required.  The legislative intent expressed in the statutes concerning the sale of lands owned by infants and incompetents is that the character and nature of an incompetent s land is not to be changed except to the extent required, and the proceeds of sale shall be impressed with the character of the land. Bryson v. Turnbull, 194 Va. 528, 74 S.E.2d 180, 1953 Va. LEXIS 115 (1953). Consent decree in partition proceedings void for noncompliance with article.  A consent decree in partition proceedings, to the effect that respondents share of the land be set off to them in bulk as joint tenants with the right of surv ivorship, was void as to an incompetent respondent where the requirements of the statutes providing for the sale of lands belonging to persons under disability were not complied with, although the incompetents committee was a party to the suit and th e incompetent was represented by a guardian ad litem. Leonard v. Boswell, 197 Va. 713, 90 S.E.2d 872, 1956 Va. LEXIS 143 (1956). Recovery for improvements against one who was not party to lease.  A lessee could not recover for the value of his improvements against an infant who was a part owner, relying upon the provision in his lease permitting him to rem ove all improvements upon termination of the lease, where she was not a party to the lease. White v. Pleasants, 227 Va. 508, 317 S.E.2d 489, 1984 Va. LEXIS 221 (1984). B.Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is not inherent .  In this State a court of equity has no authority under its general jurisdiction as guardian of infants to sell their real estate whenever it is to the advantage o f the infants to do so, whether for reinvestment or for their maintenance and education. Faulkner v. Davis, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 651, 1868 Va. LEXIS 29 (1868); Kavanaugh v. Shacklett, 111 Va. 423, 69 S.E. 335, 1910 Va. LEXIS 63 (1910); Coleman v. Virginia Stave &amp; Heading Co., 112 Va. 61, 70 S.E. 545, 1911 Va. LEXIS 53 (1911). This section grants such jurisdiction.  The doctrine in this State is well settled that courts of equity possess no inherent power, as guardians of infants, to sell their real estate for the purpose of reinvestment, and the obvious purpose of this section is to invest those courts with that jurisdiction in respect to estates of all persons under disability. Rhea v. Shields, 103 Va. 305, 49 S.E. 70, 1904 Va. LEXIS 39 (1904) (see also Faulkner v. Davis, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 651 (1868); Rinker v. Streit, 73 Va. (33 Gratt.) 663 (1880); Kavanaugh v. Shacklett, 111 Va. 423, 69 S.E. 335 (1910); Coleman v. Virginia Stave &amp; Heading Co., 112 Va. 61, 70 S.E. 545 (1911)). The jurisdiction of the circuit courts of the Commonwealth to authorize the application of the proceeds of the corpus of infants real estate to their maintena nce and education is altogether statutory. Whitehead v. Bradley, 87 Va. 676, 13 S.E. 195, 1891 Va. LEXIS 121 (1891); Hess v. Hess, 108 Va. 483, 62 S.E. 273, 1908 Va. LEXIS 57 (1908). But it is special and limited.  In a suit under this section for the sale of an infants lands, the court does not exercise a general, but only a special, statutory and limited, jurisdiction. Therefore, the conditions of fact, under which this section confers jurisdiction upon the court to enter a decree of sale, must affirmatively appear on the face of the proceedings in the suit in order that the decree may be valid. Farant Inv. Corp. v. F rancis, 138 Va. 417, 122 S.E. 141, 1924 Va. LEXIS 35 (1924). And court may exercise only powers expressly granted.  Possessing no inherent power to sell the land of an infant, courts of equity are limited by the powers expressly granted by this chapter. Newman v. Light, 152 Va. 760, 148 S.E. 818, 1929 Va. LEXIS 209 (1929). C.When Sale Proper. Sale to pay debts of decedent is not authorized.  Nowhere in this chapter is there any authority for the sale of infants lands or a confirmation of such a sale for the purpose of paying the debts of a testato r or intestate by or from whom the title to the lands has been devised or inherited by the infants. Clark v. George, 161 Va. 104, 170 S.E. 713, 1933 Va. LEXIS 301 (1933). Un less testator expressly prohibits sale.  It was not the purpose of the legislature to overrule an imperative prohibition of the testator, applicable to all circumstances that might occur or exist; and, t herefore, the power to sell is withheld from the courts where the will expressly directs that the property shall not be sold. Where there is no such absolute prohibition, the testator must be regarded as having left the matter subject to the general auth ority conferred by the law. Talley v. Starke, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 339, 1849 Va. LEXIS 52 (1849). In Talley v. Starke, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 339 (1849), a testator directed his estate, after payment of his debts, to be kept together until his youngest child should come of age, to be controlled and managed by his executor and his wife with their best discretion, so as to make it productive of the greatest amount of profits for the support of his wife and children. It was held that a court of equity might direct a sale of the real estate under the statute if it was for the benefit of the infant children, and those who were of age consented.

For related discussion, see 9B M.J. Infants, §§ 59, 60, 64. CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Consideration. II. Persons Who Would Be Heirs of Person Under Disability. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . Presence of necessary parties is jurisdictional.  The presence of the necessary parties required by this section in a suit for the sale of infants lands is jurisdictional, and a decree rendered in their absen ce is void as to infants whose interests are affected thereby. Gee v. McCormick, 142 Va. 173, 128 S.E. 541, 1925 Va. LEXIS 328 (1925); Newman v. Light, 152 Va. 760, 148 S.E. 818, 1929 Va. LEXIS 209 (1929). And want of proper parties invalidates mortgage and sale.  Where, in a suit for the sale or mortgage of an infants lands, it was the purpose of the parties to proceed under this and the preceding section, and they end eavored to conform thereto, but the proceedings were substantially defective for want of proper parties, a mortgage made in pursuance thereof and a sale thereunder were void. Parker v. Stephenson, 127 Va. 431, 104 S.E. 39, 1920 Va. LEXIS 62 (1920). Lack of substantial compliance with section voids proceedings.  Where the state court failed to substantially comply with former § 8-676, which set forth jurisdictional requirements for an action to sell, encumber or lease infants land, the lack of substantial compliance made the proceeding void ab initio and in toto because the court lacked jurisdiction. Payne v. Consolidation Coal Co., 607 F. Supp. 378, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21180 (D. Va. 1985) (decided under former § 8-676). Representative cap acity.  An individual or entity does not acquire standing to sue in a representative capacity by asserting the rights of another unless authorized by the statute to do so . W.S. Carnes, Inc. v. Board of Supvrs., 252 Va. 377, 478 S.E.2d 295, 1996 Va. LEXIS 102 (1996). The infants must be made parties defendant by guardian ad litem. Snavely v. Harkrader, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 112, 1877 Va. LEXIS 9 (1877). Or they may be plaintiffs with their guardian.  The fact that infants were plaintiffs with their mother, instead of being made defendants, is no objection to the proceedings in a suit for the sale of land. Ques enberry v. Barbour, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 491, 1879 Va. LEXIS 16 (1879). Purchaser at sale to be confirmed is necessary party.  Where the petition asks that a contract previously entered into by the guardian for the sale of the infants land be confirmed by the court, the purchaser unde r the contract is a necessary party. Hughes v. Johnston, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 479 (1855). II.Persons Who Would Be Heirs of Person Under Disability. Distributees and heirs refer to natural persons only.  The words distributees and heirs, as used in this section, have reference to natural persons only, and not to the Commonwealth, as the Commonwealt h takes property not as an heir but by title paramount. Farant Inv. Corp. v. Francis, 138 Va. 417, 122 S.E. 141, 1924 Va. LEXIS 35 (1924). Presumptive heirs of infant must be parties defendant.  All persons who would be the heirs of the infant if he were dead must, under this section, be made parties defendant. Snavely v. Harkrader, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 112 , 1877 Va. LEXIS 9 (1877). Unless they are plaintiffs.  Where a bill is filed by a father and mother, who are trustees of certain lands for their infant children, to sell these lands, it is a sufficient compliance with this section that the infants should be made parties defendant, their parents, who are the persons who would be the heirs of each infant if he were dead, being already plaintiffs. Lancaster v. Barton, 92 Va. 615, 24 S.E. 251, 1896 Va. LEXIS 24 (1896). Where a bill is filed by a guardian, it is not necessary to make him a party defendant on the ground that he would be an heir of the infant if the infant were dea d. Durrett v. Davis, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 302, 1874 Va. LEXIS 13 (1874). The reason for the requirement that the heirs of the infants be made parties is twofold: First, the presumed affection of such heirs for the infants; and, second, their personal contingent interest in the land sought to be sold. It is a natural conclusion that those who may become the owners of the land or its proceeds will see that the sam e is not sacrificed by a guardian who is recreant of the trust imposed upon him. Gee v. McCormick, 142 Va. 173, 128 S.E. 541, 1925 Va. LEXIS 328 (1925); Newman v. Light, 152 Va. 760, 148 S.E. 818, 1929 Va. LEXIS 209 (1929) (see Bryson v. Turnbull, 194 Va . 528, 74 S.E.2d 180 (1953)). Doctrine of representation applies.  Land was conveyed in trust for a husband and wife and the survivor of them for life, and at the death of the survivor to their children who would be living at the death of the survivor, and the descendants of such of the children as should then be dead leaving descendants. After the death of the husband, a bill was filed by the wife against the children and trustees for a sale of the land. It was held that a sale decreed upon the bill would bind the descendants of any child dying within the lifetime of the wife, under the doctrine of representation. Faulkner v. Davis, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 651, 1868 Va. LEXIS 29 (1868). But not where interests are hostile.  When the interests of the life tenant and the remaindermen are hostile, infant remaindermen cannot be considered as being before the court by representation by th e life tenant. Turner v. Barraud, 102 Va. 324, 46 S.E. 318, 1904 Va. LEXIS 73 (1904). Questions of who would be heirs is one of fact.  In order to effectuate the title of a purchaser at a judicial sale of an infants lands, it must appear from the proceedings that the provisions of this chapte r have been substantially complied with. However, the question as to who would be the heirs of an infant if he were dead is one of fact. Newman v. Light, 152 Va. 760, 148 S.E. 818, 1929 Va. LEXIS 209 (1929). Finding that infant had no kin cannot be assailed collaterally.  In an action of ejectment, a decree in a suit for the sale of an infants land was assailed because those who would have been the infants heirs or distribu tees, if he had been dead, had not been made defendants to the suit, as required by this section. The bill alleges that the infant had no kin or relations. The commissioner reported that all necessary parties were before the court, and that it was proved that the infant had no relations whatever. And the court, upon the hearing on the report and the evidence returned therewith, confirmed the commissioners report, and by so doing adjudicated its finding of fact that the infant, if he had been dead, w ould have had no heirs or distributees at the time of the suit. Nothing appeared on the face of the proceedings sufficient to negative this adjudicated fact. It was held that this finding of fact was final and conclusive, no appeal having been taken, and it could not be assailed collaterally, or affected by any extrinsic evidence. Farant Inv. Corp. v. Francis, 138 Va. 417, 122 S.E. 141, 1924 Va. LEXIS 35 (1924). Effect of failure to make presumptive heirs defendants.  In a suit to sell or mortgage an infants lands, brought by the infants mother in her own right and as guardian of the infant, there was a failure to compl y with this section by making the heirs of an infant parties to the suit. It was insisted that if the court had jurisdiction on any ground, its decree was not void, but at most only voidable, and that the mother had the right to sue as creditor of her hu sbands estate, having paid his debts and legacies. But as the bill made no charge that the mother was a creditor, and did not show that at the time it was filed she had paid any debt or legacy of her husband, there was nothing in it to show jurisdict ion on this ground. Parker v. Stephenson, 127 Va. 431, 104 S.E. 39, 1920 Va. LEXIS 62 (1920). Contingent remainderman is not necessary party after failure of contingency.  Where land is devised to a certain person during his natural life, and to his children if he should have lawful issue, and if not, to the testators grandchild ren and their heirs forever, and the life tenant marries and has children, the remainder vests in the children, and the alternative remainder to the grandchildren is defeated; hence the grandchildren are not necessary parties to a proceeding to sell the real estate after the birth of the children of the life tenant.

LEXIS 54 (1878). Sale is not void but voidable.  Where land is sold under a decree of court in pursuance of a bill filed by the committee of an insane person and purchased by the committee contrary to this secti on, the sale is voidable and not void. It is in force until set aside, and this cannot be done collaterally. Cline v. Catron, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 378, 1872 Va. LEXIS 27 (1872). And in some cases might be sustained.  There may be a case in which a purchase made by a guardian or other fiduciary, of the land of his ward or other beneficiary, sold under this chapter, would and ou ght to be sustained and enforced. Redd v. Jones, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 123, 1878 Va. LEXIS 54 (1878). Bona fide purchaser will be protected.  A sale could not be set aside at the instance of an heir at law of a lunatic on the ground that the committee was himself the real purchaser, where the land had b een conveyed to a trustee to secure a bona fide debt, and the party seeking to set aside the sale failed to allege notice to the trustee or the beneficiary of the fact relied on to set aside the sale, especially when the party seeking to set aside the sa le herself joined in the deed of trust.

The court shall take ample security for all investments so made, and from time to time require additional security, if necessary, and make any proper order for the faithful application and safe investment of the fund, and for the management and preservation of any properties or securities in which the same has been invested, and for the protection of the rights of all persons interested therein, whether such rights be vested or contin gent, but nothing hereinbefore contained shall prevent the court having charge thereof from directing such funds to be paid over to the legally appointed and qualified fiduciary, as defined in § 8.01-67, of the person under a disability, whenever the court is satisfied that such fiduciary has executed sufficient bond; or from applying at any time all or any portion thereof to the proper needs and requirements of the person under a disability.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Purpose of section.  It is evident that while the legislature designed to authorize courts of chancery to sell infants real estate, without which they had no authority to sell, it was at the same time its design that such sale should be made without affecting the infants rights incident to an ownership of real estate, and without violating the rights of those who would be entitled to the estate, if the infant were dead. Indee d, it would not have been proper, if competent to the legislature, to have authorized a court to deprive the infant of a vested beneficial right incident to his ownership of real estate, he being incapable of assenting thereto, or to have diverted or violated the rights of those who would be entitled to the estate at the death of an infant under disability. Vaughan v. Jones, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 444, 1873 Va. LEXIS 46 (1873). Character of land is not to be changed except to extent required.  The legislative intent is made clear; viz., the character and nature of an incompetents land is not to be changed except to the extent required. Bryson v. Tur nbull, 194 Va. 528, 74 S.E.2d 180, 1953 Va. LEXIS 115 (1953). And procee ds are impressed with character of land sold.  Upon the involuntary sale, under a judicial decree, of the land of an incompetent person, incapable of dealing with the real estate, the proceeds should be impres sed with the character of the land sold and should pass as such at death if the disabilities have not been removed. Bryson v. Turnbull, 194 Va. 528, 74 S.E.2d 180, 1953 Va. LEXIS 115 (1953). Where an infants lands are sold under a decree of court, the proceeds retain the character of realty and pass as real estate. Thus, on the death of a female i nfant leaving a child, the proceeds will go to the child, and on its death during infancy, the husband surviving, the property will go to the childs heirs on the part of his mother, subject to the life estate of the husband, the impress of realty nev er having been removed. Vaughan v. Jones, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 444, 1873 Va. LEXIS 46 (1873). The conversion of an infants real estate into money does not change its character as realty, and the proceeds of the sale retain the impress of real estate un til the infant attains the age of 21 (now 18) years. Rinker v. Streit, 73 Va. 663 (1873). Section applies in suits for partiti on.  Where a suit for the sale of real property under a will, although not in the usual form and procedure, was more or less, in effect, a suit for the partition of re al estate in which all parties joined and consented, the proceeds passed as real estate.

No statute authorizes purchase of realty by committee.  While this section provides when and where a committee may petition for the sale, lease, or mortgage of the real estate of his ward, there is no specific statute authorizing a committee to purchase real estate, but Boisseau v. Boisseau, 79 Va. 73, 52 Am.

Any two or more of the parties, if they so elect, may have their shares laid off together when partition can be conveniently made in that way. If the court orders parti tion in kind, the court may require that one or more parties pay one or more parties amounts so that the payments, taken together with the court-determined value of the in-kind distributions to the parties, will make the partition in kind just and pr oportionate in value to the fractional interests held.

Wife held entitled to half of proceeds although not named in deed to land sold.  In an action brought by a divorced wife to partition a parcel of land where an examination of the record, the various exhibits filed, and the testimony of the wit nesses established clearly and satisfactorily that throughout the period of their marriage and thereafter until the wife filed her bill of complaint seeking partition of the parties, both parties were under the impression that the land had been conveyed to them jointly and as tenants by the entirety, but where, because the wife was under the age of 21, the deed to the property of husband and wife was taken in name of the husband alone, the divorced wife still had an undivided one-half interest in the re al property and, the property having been sold by agreement, the trial court properly decreed that each party was entitled to one half of the proceeds. Pleasants v. Pleasants, 221 Va. 1017, 277 S.E.2d 170, 1981 Va. LEXIS 243 (1981). Divorce proceeding.  The method of accomplishing partition in a divorce proceeding differs from the method of arriving at a monetary award. The amount of a monetary award is determine d after considering 11 specific factors, § 20-107.3 E, and is based on the equities and the rights and interests of each party in the marital property. On the other hand, partition, an entirely statutory procedure, is governed by this article since no directions for its implementation are contained in § 20-107.3.Morris v. Morris, 3 Va. App. 303, 349 S.E.2d 661, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1029, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 365 (1986). Partition under subsection C of § 20-107.3 is governed by this article. Clayberg v. Clayberg, 4 Va. App. 218, 355 S.E.2d 902, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2560, 1987 Va. App . LEXIS 256 (1987). Partition as now permitted in the equitable distribution statute is no different from that permitted prior to the adoption of § 20-107.3, except that it may no w be done in the divorce case rather than as a separate proceeding. However, when it is done, it must conform to the mandate of this article. Clayberg v. Clayberg, 4 Va. App. 218, 355 S.E.2d 902, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2560, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 256 (1987). Partition of real property in a divorce proceeding is governed by this section. Mains v. Mains, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 362 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 1993).

App. LEXIS 362 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 17, 1993). Pa rtition procedures for § 20-107.3.  Section 20-107.3 does not contain provisions directing how partition shall be conducted; therefore the procedures for distribution of the property and/or the proc eeds of its sale, as disclosed by the partition statutes, and court decisions interpreting those statutes, must be followed. Fitchett v. Fitchett, 6 Va. App. 562, 370 S.E.2d 318, 5 Va. Law Rep. 88, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 75 (1988).

A joint tenancy with right of survivorship, as at common law, is subject to partition by a judgment lien creditor of one of the several joint tenants. Jones v. Conwell, 227 Va. 176, 314 S.E.2d 61, 1984 Va. LEXIS 279 (1984). This section prohibits the partitioning of mineral rights west and north of the Clinch River; therefore, if a court has no authority to partition mineral rights west and north of the Clinch River, a fortiori, such mineral rights cannot be partitioned without the consent of all cotenants. Chosar Corp. v. Owens, 235 Va. 660, 370 S.E.2 d 305, 4 Va. Law Rep. 3189, 1988 Va. LEXIS 72 (1988). Tenants conduct of mining operations was such an appropriation of a specific portion of the Splashdam seam, located west and north of the Clinch River, which was in effect, a unilateral partitioning of the mineral estate, and the trial court correctly ruled that tenants mining excluded the nonconsenting cotenants from their interests in the property.

Joint tenants with right of survivorship.  The words joint tenants as used in this section were intended by the legislature to include joint tenants with right of survivorship and, pursuant to this section, such tenant shall be compellable to make partition at the instance of a judgment lien creditor. Jones v. Conwell, 227 Va. 176, 314 S.E.2d 61, 1984 Va. LEXIS 279 (1984). Chapter 7 trustees power to sell estate property for purpose of satisfying creditors claims was not limited to debtors state law rights to partition t hat property as a joint tenant. The Chapter 7 trustee had the power, as a hypothetical lien creditor, to compel partition of the property under Virginia Code, but what was more, if the property could not be divided, the Bankruptcy Code allowed the truste e to sell the undivided joint property so long as certain conditions were met.

If at least one party to a partition action petitions the court for allotment or for a partition sale, the court may order allotment pursuant to this section or, if the court determines allotment is not practicable, a sale pursuant to § 8.01-83.1. B. Before a co urt is authorized to allot or sell an undivided interest in a partition action, it shall first determine that partition in kind cannot be practicably made. When the subject land is not susceptible to a practicable division in kind, the court shall next c onsider an allotment of the entire subject property to any one or more of the parties who will accept it for a price equal to the value determined pursuant to § 8.01-81.1, and pay therefor to the other parties such sums of money as their interest ther ein may entitle them to receive, notwithstanding that any of those entitled may be a person with a disability. If a purchaser is entitled to a share of the proceeds of the sale, the purchaser is entitled to a credit against the price in an amount equal t o the purchasers share of the proceeds. The court shall make distribution of the proceeds of the allotment according to the respective rights of those entitled, taking care, when there are creditors of any deceased person who was a tenant in common, joint tenant, or coparcener, to have the proceeds of such deceased persons part applied according to the rights of such creditors. 1. When the court considers allotment, it shall require the party or parties seeking allotment to notify all of the other parties (i) that the property may be allotted to any one or more of them who is willing to accept it and (ii) of the required price. 2. In the event that multiple parties seek allotment and disputes arise concerning such allotment, the court shall consider the following in making such allotment: a. Evidence of the collective duration of ownership or possession of the property by a party and one or more predecessors in title or predecessors in possession to the party who are or were related to the party or each other; b. A partys sentimental attachment to the property, including any attachment arising because the property has ancestral or other unique or special value to the party; c. The lawful use being made of the property by a party and the degree to which the party would be harmed if the party could not continue the same use of the property; d. The degree to which the parties have contributed their pro rata share of the property taxes, insurance, and other expenses associated with maintaining ownership of the property or have contributed to the physical improvement, maintenance, or upkeep of the property; and e. Any other relevant factor.The court shall not consider any one of the preceding factors to be dispositive without weighing the totality of all relevant factors and circumstances. 3. After the court determines which party or parties will participate in the allotment, the court shall notify all the parties of its decision and of the amount each party is to pay or re ceive for its allotted share pursuant to either this subsection or subsection C. The court shall set a date, not sooner than 60 days after notification to the parties, by which each party allotted a share of the property must pay the amount due to the co urt. If any party allocated a share fails to pay the amount due by the required date the court shall order a sale of the entire subject property pursuant to § 8.01-83.1, unless the court determines, based on the factors in this subsection, that it wil l allow another party or parties to acquire such share by paying for such share within a reasonable period of time set by the court. C. If the cour t determines that such allotment of the entire subject is not practicable or is not equitable, and if the interest of those who are entitled to the subject, or its proceeds, will be promoted by a sale of the entire subject, or allotment of part and sale of the residue, the court, notwithstanding any of those entitled may be a person under a disability, may order such sale, or an allotment pursuant to subsection B of a part thereof to any one or more of the parties who will accept it and pay therefor to the other parties such sums of money as their interest therein may entitle them to, and a sale of the residue. The price for the part of the property allotted to one or more parties shall be the fair market value of such part as determined by the court u nless all the parties agree to a value for the part, which the court shall adopt. The sale of the residue shall be conducted pursuant to § 8.01-83.1. The court shall make distribution of the proceeds of the allotment and sale of the residue, according to the respective rights of those entitled, taking care, when there are creditors of any deceased person who was a tenant in common, joint tenant, or coparcener, to have the proceeds of such deceased persons part applied according to the rights of s uch creditors. D. If the cour t determines neither allotment of the entire subject property nor of a part of the subject property is practicable or equitable, it shall order a sale pursuant to § 8.01-83.1.

I.Decisions Under Current Law. A.General Cons ideration. Primary question in suits for partition is whether or not a division in kind is convenie nt, practicable and for the best interest of the parties; the secondary question is whether their interest will be promoted by a sale in whole or in part. Sensabaugh v. Sensabaugh, 232 Va. 250, 349 S.E.2d 141, 3 Va. Law Rep. 984, 1986 Va. LEXIS 252 (1986 ). Discretion of court.  Whether an allotment should be decreed is a matter resting within the sound discretion of a trial court. White v. Pleasants, 227 Va. 508, 317 S.E.2d 489, 1984 Va. LEXIS 221 (1984). Allotment in kind jointly to cotenants.  While two cotenants may, by agreement, have their joint interests allotted in kind to them jointly, they cannot be compelled to do so against their wishes, or the wishes of either. White v. Pleasants, 227 Va. 508, 317 S.E.2d 489, 1984 Va. LEXIS 221 (1984). The 1988 amendment to subsection C of § 20-107.3 gave the trial judge discretion to o rder a transfer of the property to one of the parties without first determining whether partition in kind could be conveniently made; thus, under the amended statute, a transferor could be deprived of real property susceptible to partition in kind to whi ch he or she would have been absolutely entitled under this section. Such a fundamental change in the law affects substantive rights and thus the 1988 statutory amendment to subsection C of § 20-107.3 was not merely procedural. Marion v. Marion, 11 Va . App. 659, 401 S.E.2d 432, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1564, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 22 (1991). Section 20-107.3, as amended in 1988, gave the trial judge discretion in a divorce proceeding to order a transfer of property to one of the parties without first determining whether partition in kind could be conveniently made. Thus, under the amended statute, one spouse in the divorce proceeding could be deprived of ownership of real property susceptible to partition to which that spouse would have been absolut ely entitled under this section.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Court may appl y proceeds of sale to discharge of lien.  Courts of equity have jurisdiction of suits for partition, and have power, where there are liens by judgment or otherwise on the interests of any party, to apply the dividends of such party in the proceeds of sale to the discharge of such lien. Grove v. Grove, 100 Va. 556, 42 S.E. 312, 1902 Va. LEXIS 60 (1902). Defendant may assert claim or lien.  Under this section defendants in a partition suit may assert any claim or lien they may have upon the land, and if the claim or lien is established, the proceeds of the sale for partition may be applied thereto. Reynolds v. Adams, 125 Va. 295, 99 S.E. 695, 1919 Va. LEXIS 24 (1919). Failure to assert charge or lien.  Where defendants in a partition suit made no assertion of any charge or lien in their favor on the real estate in question in their pleadings in the cause, it is not error for the decree to ignore the rights of defendants in this respect. Reynolds v. Adams, 125 Va. 295, 99 S.E. 695, 1919 Va. LEXIS 24 (1919). Right of cotenant who has discharged more than his share of encumbrance.  In decreeing partition, a court of equity will adjust all the equitable rights of the parties interested in the property, and if one of the cotenants has paid mor e than his just share of an encumbrance on the common property, or advanced more than his proportion of the purchase money, the court may decree that payment of the excess be made to him, and that, in default of such payment, the share of the tenant in d efault may be sold to satisfy the amount equitably due from it.

No special commissioner, appointed by a court, shall receive money under a decree, until he gives bond, with approved security, befo re such court or its clerk, in a penalty to be prescribed by the court, conditioned upon the faithful discharge of his duties as such commissioner and to account for and pay over as the court may direct all money that may come into his hands as such comm issioner.

IV. Bond of Commissioner. I.General Consideration. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. II.Terms of Sale. Sale may be private.  A direction to a commissioner, in a decree for the sale of real estate, to receive private offers and report them to the court to be acted upon in vacation is wit hin the discretion of the trial court, in order to obtain the best price for the land. Conrad v. Fuller, 98 Va. 16, 34 S.E. 893, 1900 Va. LEXIS 3 (1900). Contract of parties governs sales under mortgages and other instruments.  A court may direct the sale of property to be for cash, or on such credit and terms as it may deem best, but this rule does not apply to mortgages, deeds of trust , and other instruments, in which the terms of sale are agreed upon. In such cases the contract of the parties governs. Pairo v. Bethell, 75 Va. 825, 1881 Va. LEXIS 60 (1881); Stimpson v. Bishop, 82 Va. 190, 1886 Va. LEXIS 23 (1886). Realty of value should be sold on reasonable credit.  The general rule to be deduced from the decisions is that real property of value should be sold on a reasonable credit, unless under peculiar circumstances, and t he circumstances to take the case out of general rule should appear by the record. Pairo v. Bethell, 75 Va. 825, 1881 Va. LEXIS 60 (1881). Court may change terms of sale before confirmation.  So long as the sale is unconfirmed, and the property and the sale remain under the power of the court, it has the power to change the terms of the sale. Tebbs v. Lee, 76 Va. 744, 1882 Va. LEXIS 75 (1882). Resale of land o n default of purchaser.  Before there can be a decree of resale, it is proper and necessary that the purchaser have notice of the proceeding. The practice is to proceed by the service of a rule on the purchaser to show cause why the lands should not be resold. And upon the filing of a petition for a resale and a report showing that the purchase money has not all been paid, the court may direct such a rule. Thornton v. Fairfax, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 669, 1878 Va. LEXIS 4 (1878) (see also Clarkson v. Read, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 288 (1858); Long v. Weller, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 347 (1877); Berlin v. Melhorn, 75 Va. 639 (1881); Boyce v. Strother, 76 Va. 862 (1882); Ogden v. Davidson, 81 Va. 757 (188 5)). Terms of resale held proper.  Where a judgment debtor bought his own land at a sale under a decree in a creditors suit against him, and failed to pay the purchase money, a resale on terms of one-fourth cash and the balance in one, two and three years was not inequitable under this section. Dickerson v. Clement, 87 Va. 41, 12 S.E. 105, 1890 Va. LEXIS 87 (1890). III.Confirmation of Sale. Discretion of court.  It lies within the discretion of the court ordering the sale to determine whether it will accept the bid and confirm the sale, or set it aside. Terry v. Coles, 80 Va. 695, 1885 Va. LEXIS 110 (1885); Moore v. Triplett, 96 Va. 603, 32 S.E. 50, 1899 Va. LEXIS 108 (1899). Discretion is not arbitrary.  The court, in acting upon a report of a sale, does not exercise an arbitrary discretion, but a sound legal discretion in view of all the circumstances. It is to b e exercised in the interest of fairness, prudence, and a just regard to the rights of all concerned. Berlin v. Melhorn, 75 Va. 639, 1881 Va. LEXIS 47 (1881). Sale should be sustained if possible.  Sound policy requires that judicial sales should be sustained as far as possible, where it is consistent with the rights of others and the rule that innocent purc hasers are favorites of the law. Coleman v. Virginia Stave &amp; Heading Co., 112 Va. 61, 70 S.E. 545, 1911 Va. LEXIS 53 (1911). Before confirmation, lesser grounds are sufficient.  Where a sale has not been confirmed, the reasons for setting it aside need not be so strong as they should be after confirmation. Todd v. Gallego Mills Mfg. Co., 84 Va. 586, 5 S.E. 676, 1888 Va. LEXIS 113 (1888). Confirmation may be set aside during term.  It is within the discretion of the court at any time during the term to set aside the decree of confirmation and rescind the sale, upon proper motion and notice t o the purchaser and the parties concerned, for good cause shown. Langyher v. Patterson, 77 Va. 470, 1883 Va. LEXIS 79 (1883). Confirmation cures defects.  Subsequent confirmation is equivalent to previous authority, cures departures from the terms prescribed, and cures all defects in the execution of the decree, exc ept those founded in lack of jurisdiction or in fraud. It makes the sale the courts own act, and renders it no longer executory, but executed. Langyher v. Patterson, 77 Va. 470, 1883 Va. LEXIS 79 (1883). Any party may appeal from refusal to confirm sale.  From the refusal to confirm a sale and order for resale, any party may appeal, and to refuse suspension of the decree is error, but the Supreme Court will not rev erse the decree for that error when it is right on its merits. Todd v. Gallego Mills Mfg. Co., 84 Va. 586, 5 S.E. 676, 1888 Va. LEXIS 113 (1888). Sale set aside for mistake, misrepresentation or fraud.  In a judicial sale, if it should be made to appear, either before or after the sale has been ratified, that there has been any injurious mistake, misrepresentatio n or fraud, the biddings will be reopened, the reported sale rejected or the order of ratification rescinded, and the property again sent into the market and resold. Merchants Bank v. Campbell, 75 Va. 455, 1881 Va. LEXIS 27 (1881). Grounds for se tting aside sale.  The following have been held to be grounds for setting aside sales: breach of duty by officer,.Brock v. Rice, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 812 (1876), fraud or mistake, Car r v. Carr, 88 Va. 735, 14 S.E. 368 (1892), conduct preventing fair completion, Teel v. Yancey, 64 Va. (33 Gratt.) 691 (1880), sale on inclement day, Roberts v. Roberts, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 639 (1857), defect of title, Daniel v. Leitch, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 195 (1856), gross inadequacy of price, Coles v. Coles, 83 Va. 525, 5 S.E. 673 (1887). Ordinarily, a commissioner to sell is not allowed to purchase the subject, either direct ly or indirectly. Such a purchase, however, is not absolutely void, but voidable only at the election of any party interested in the land. Hurt v. Jones, 75 Va. 341, 1881 Va. LEXIS 18 (1881). Purcha se by commissioner at resale.  Upon the failure of the purchaser at a judicial sale to pay the purchase money, there was a decree appointing a commissioner to resell the land. The commissioner himself purchased the land at the resale. No objection or exception to the commissioners purchase was made or taken by any party, the purchase money was paid, and the sale was approved and ratified. It was held that the sale was good, inasmuch as the full amount of the purchase money, for the payment of which the resale was ordered, was assured and paid to the parties entitled, and they could have received nothing more on a resale to another, for the surplus, if any, would have belonged to the purch aser at the original sale. Hurt v. Jones, 75 Va. 341, 1881 Va. LEXIS 18 (1881). Advance bids.  In a proper case, where it would be just to all the parties concerned, the court may, in the exercise of a sound discretion, set aside a sale made by commissioner s under a decree, and reopen the biddings upon the offer of an advance bid of a sufficient amount deposited or well secured. But it has never been held imperative upon the courts to set aside the sale and reopen the bids. It is a question addressed to th e sound discretion of the courts, subject to review by the appellate tribunal, and the propriety of its exercise depends upon the circumstances of each case, and can only be rightfully exercised when it can be done with a due regard to the rights of all concerned, the purchaser included. Roudabush v. Miller, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 454, 1879 Va. LEXIS 80 (1879) (see also Effinger v. Ralston, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 430 (1871); Hudgins v. Lanier, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 494 (1873); Brock v. Rice, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 812 (1876); Curtis v. Thompson, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 474 (1877); Merchants Bank v. Campbell, 75 Va. 455 (1881); Berlin v. Melhorn, 75 Va. 639 (1881); Hansucker v. Walker, 76 Va. 753 (1882); Langyher v. Patterson, 77 Va. 470 (1883); Effinger v. Kenney, 79 Va. 551 (1884); Terry v. Coles, 80 Va. 695 (1885); Yost v. Porter, 80 Va. 855 (1885)). It is error to set aside a judicial sale solely because after the sale an advance bid of 10% has been made. Lillard v. Graves, 123 Va. 193, 96 S.E. 169, 1918 Va. LEXIS 16 (1918). IV.Bond of Commissioner. Bond must be given before commissioner receives money.  This section requires a bond of commissioners of sale, and the bond must be given before the commissioners receive any money under the decree, whether it is direc ted therein or not.

History History. Code 1950, § 8-656; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Former § 8-656 has been simplified and language pertaining to the sale of land for delinquent taxes has been deleted since such a sale is provided for in § 58.1-3965. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section was not written for the benefit of the delinquent landowner. Woodhouse v. Bu rke &amp; Herbert Bank &amp; Trust Co., 166 Va. 706, 185 S.E. 876, 1936 Va. LEXIS 231 (1936). It is error to decree sale before ascertaining liens.  Where there are various liens on the land of a debtor, it is premature and erroneous to decree a sale of the land to satisfy the liens, without first ascertaining all the liens existing against the land and determining and definitely fixing their respective amounts and priorities.

The certificate or a copy thereof shall be appended to the advertisement; provided, however, that in any case of such sale or rental, the court may direct all the cash proceeds thereof to be deposited by the purchaser or lessee to the credit of such c ourt in some bank to be designated by it, and may direct that all evidences of indebtedness arising from such transaction or rent be deposited for safekeeping with such bank or the clerk of such court and the court may in its discretion thereafter dispen se with the bond. The clerk shall make the certificate whenever the bond has been given and note the same in the proceedings in the cause.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Former § 8-658 has been simplified and expanded. The court may consider such portion of the rent which it deems appropriate in determining the amount o f the penalty bond for the rental of real estate. This flexibility may permit a reduction in cost of the bond. The provision for a clerks fee in former § 8-658 has been deleted as obsolete. Cross references.

Mort gages and Deeds of Trust, § 146. CASE NOTES Applies to all judicial sales, whether original or resales, and a purchaser who seeks to avail himself of the protection afforded by it must show either that the commissioner to whom payments were made actually gave the bond required of him, or that the clerks certificate that such bond had been given was appended to the advertisement. The fact that a bond was required of and given by the same commissioner before making the original sale, and that the surety of the purchaser at the original sale became the purchaser at the resale, cannot change the result. Tompkins v. Dyerle, 102 Va. 2 19, 46 S.E. 300, 1904 Va. LEXIS 58 (1904) (decided under prior law).

Section is not exclusive.  While a rule may be issued against a commissioner under this section such method of procedure is not exclusive; and a reference to another commissioner to ascerta in the amount due served the function of a rule to give notice and an opportunity to defend. French v. Pobst, 203 Va. 704, 127 S.E.2d 137, 1962 Va. LEXIS 209 (1962) (decided under former corresponding provisions). Commissioner personally liable.  Court held the Special Commissioner of Sale personally liable for failing to account for petitioners judgment lien and ordered him to implead $79,452.28 to th e court and provide notice to then-existing lien creditors who might have had a valid legal claim to the proceeds of the judicial sale.

Judicial Sales and Rentings, § 34; 13A M.J. Mortgages and Deeds of Trust, §§ 51, 175. CASE NOTES Priority of commissioners claim for fees.  By fixing the amount of the commission in a judicial sale, the general assembly intended that such commission be paid from the proceeds of that sale and a circuit court thus properly directed payment of the fees of a special ommissioner from the sale proceeds before any distribution of the funds to the holder of the first deed of trust. Homeside Lending, Inc. v. Unit Owners Ass'n of Antietam Square Condo., 261 Va . 161, 540 S.E.2d 894, 2001 Va. LEXIS 1 (2001). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Commission for each property.  Sale of each of the properties, despite the properties being included in a single purchase offer and their sales being approved in a single decree, could generate a separate commission for the special commissioners because the express statutory language provided that each piece of property so sold would constitute a separate sale. Haworth v. Haworth, 100 Va. Cir. 349, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 624 (Norfolk Nov. 26, 201 8). Commission that was more than double the maximum allowable statutory commission had there been a single aggregate sale would be excessive; thus, defendants were e ach responsible for their respective share of the joint special commissioners commissions. Haworth v. Haworth, 100 Va. Cir. 349, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 624 (Norfolk Nov. 26, 2018). Flexibility in awarding commission.  Statute affords courts great flexibility in awarding commissions, as its provision regarding the Special Commissioner commission is permissive and not mandatory. Haworth v. Haworth, 100 Va. Cir. 349, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 624 (Norfolk Nov. 26, 2018). Attorney fees.  Statutory commission is designed to compensate the Special Commissioners for what they normally would charge as attorneys fees for fulfilling their roles as S pecial Commissioners; therefore, by awarding a commission, the Special Commissioners are not entitled to any additional attorneys fees for services they provided as Special Commissioners.

Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . Deed passes title of all parties.  A deed by a special commissioner appointed and empowered by the court to convey under this section will pass the title of all the parties to the suit. Hurt v. Jon es, 75 Va. 341, 1881 Va. LEXIS 18 (1881). Commissioner canno t convey land in another state.  A person within the Commonwealth may be decreed to execute a conveyance for lands lying in another state, or to cancel a deed for such lands obtained by fraud; bu t the courts of this State are without jurisdiction to sell and convey land situated beyond the limits of the State. Poindexter v. Burwell, 82 Va. 507, 1886 Va. LEXIS 65 (1886); Gibson v. Burgess, 82 Va. 650, 1886 Va. LEXIS 84 (1886); Wimer v. Wimer, 82 Va. 890, 5 S.E. 536, 1886 Va. LEXIS 93 (1886). Relief should be of an in rem nature.  In a suit for specific performance of a contract to sell land, where personal service was had outside the State, the language of the decree directing the defendan t to perform the contract and convey the property to the complainant made it an in personam decree, and hence it went beyond permissible limits. If the complainant was entitled to any relief, it should be of an in rem nature and accomplished by the appoi ntment of a commissioner as provided by this section. Cranford v. Hubbard, 208 Va. 689, 160 S.E.2d 760, 1968 Va. LEXIS 168 (1968). Appointment proper.  Order appointing the husbands lawyer as a special commissioner with the authority to execute documents on behalf of the wife regarding the sale of the parties  home was proper because the trial court had authority under § 8.01-110 to make the appointment and did not abuse its discretion in doing so; the lawyer provided the necessary accounting and did not charge a fee. Tromza v. Vossburg, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 125 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2013). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Conveyance by special commissioner.  Trial court declined to enter the decree that the parties presented to it regarding the settlement agreement concerning their property and the partition suit that the one party brought against the second party because there was not adequate evidence in the record to support the entry of such a decree, but the trial court also noted that if the parties so desired, they could have a special commissioner appointed t o convey an interest in the real property based on a private settlement agreement; since that would be a conveyance by the special commissioner rather than the trial court, there was no need for the kind of evidentiary support that the trial court requir ed for entry of the partys decree.

I.Decisions Under Current Law. This section cannot serve to breathe life into a void decree of sale. Forrer v. Brown, 22 1 Va. 1098, 277 S.E.2d 483, 1981 Va. LEXIS 254 (1981). One not a party may not be divested of ownership.  This section cannot authorize a court by judicial sale to divest one not a party to the suit of his ownership of property. Forrer v. Brown, 221 Va. 1098, 277 S.E. 2d 483, 1981 Va. LEXIS 254 (1981). When mistake merits setting aside sale.  Not every mistake merits the setting aside of a previously confirmed judicial sale. The mistake must be mutual unless it was induced by the fraud or culpable negl igence of the other. Branton v. Jones, 222 Va. 305, 281 S.E.2d 799, 1981 Va. LEXIS 305 (1981). Unilateral mistake as to property sold in gross.  Vendors were not entitled to have a sale of property, sold in gross, set aside where the vendors were unilaterally mistaken as to the acreage of the property sold , since the buyers mere silence concerning the correct boundaries and acreage of the property did not constitute fraud. Branton v. Jones, 222 Va. 305, 281 S.E.2d 799, 1981 Va. LEXIS 305 (1981). Mistake irrelevant where sale is in gross.  Where a contract for the sale of land is in gross, such contract is a contract of hazard. The parties to such a sale assume the risk of a deficiency or excess in the number of acres in the property. Where the parties intend a contract of hazard regarding a propertys acreage, it is immaterial whether or not the sellers or the buyer, or both, were mistaken as to the number of acres in the tract. Branton v. Jone s, 222 Va. 305, 281 S.E.2d 799, 1981 Va. LEXIS 305 (1981). Discretion of court in deciding whether to confirm sale.  Prior to confirmation, a court can exercise considerable discretion in deciding whether to confirm a sale, but after confirmation the purchaser at a judicial sale is as much entitled to the benefit of his purchase as a purchaser in pais, and the sale in the one case can be set aside only on such grounds as would be sufficient in the other. Branton v. Jones, 222 Va. 305, 281 S.E.2d 799, 1981 Va. LEXIS 305 (1981). Grounds for setting aside sale after confirmation.  After confirmation, a judicial sale cannot be set aside except for fraud, mistake, surprise, or other cause for which equity would give like relief, if the sale h ad been made by the parties in interest, instead of by the court. Branton v. Jones, 222 Va. 305, 281 S.E.2d 799, 1981 Va. LEXIS 305 (1981). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section is to be liberally construed. Brenham v. Smith, 120 Va. 30, 90 S.E. 657, 191 6 Va. LEXIS 155 (1916). Section applies to sales of lands of infants made in suits properly brought for that pur pose. Lancaster v. Barton, 92 Va. 615, 24 S.E. 251, 1896 Va. LEXIS 24 (1896) (see also Cooper v. Hepburn, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 551 (1858)). But it is not to be construed to contravene statutes protecting infants.  So far as the statutes for the sale of infants lands are concerned, it will not be questioned that the primary and controlling consideration underlying their enactment was the welfare of the infants whose lands are to be sold, and in construing this section the purpose to ignore or contravene this consideration may not be imputed to the legislature. Brenham v. Smith, 120 Va. 30, 90 S.E. 657, 1916 Va. LEXIS 15 5 (1916). It does not apply to a proceeding to compel purchasers to comply with their contracts by paying the purchase money to the persons legally entitled to receive it. Whitehead v. Bradley, 87 Va. 676, 13 S.E. 195, 1891 Va. LEXIS 121 (1891). Sale is not complete until confirmation and conveyance.  Whether the sale be by a master, commissioner, or other functionary authorized by the court to conduct the sale, the bargain is not ordinarily considered as compl ete until the sale is confirmed and the conveyance is made. Brock v. Rice, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 812, 1876 Va. LEXIS 73 (1876); Terry v. Coles, 80 Va. 695, 1885 Va. LEXIS 110 (1885). Section does not protect sales under void decrees.  In no case has this section been applied where the relief sought was based on a void decree. So where the court was without jurisdiction to issue the decree, this section cannot be applied. Gee v. McCormick, 142 Va. 173, 128 S.E. 541, 1925 Va. LEXIS 328 (1925) (see also Brenham v. Smith, 120 Va. 30, 90 S.E. 657 (1916)). Since the decree of sale was void as to complainants, the purchasers under it could take no benefit from the provision of this section. Finkel Outdoor Prods., Inc . v. Bell, 205 Va. 927, 140 S.E.2d 695, 1965 Va. LEXIS 156 (1965). Title is not to be disturbed although decree is erroneous or voidable.  It appears from the history and the language of this section that the title of a purchaser at a judicial sale shall not be disturbed after 12 months from the date of the decree of confirmation, even though the decree is erroneous or voidable. Robertson v. Stone, 199 Va. 41, 97 S.E.2d 739, 1957 Va. LEXIS 159 (1957). Confirmation relates back to sale.  After the sale is confirmed, the confirmation relates back to the sale, and the purchaser is entitled to everything he would have been entitled to had the confirm ation and conveyance been contemporaneous with the sale. Taylor v. Cooper, 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 317, 1839 Va. LEXIS 35 (1839). Limitation is suspended by bill of review.  Where the decree setting aside the proceedings under the original bill and dismissing the same was entered 12 months after the confirmation of the sale, but the b ill of review was filed before the expiration of the 12 months, the period of limitation was suspended until the entry of the decree complained of. Gee v. McCormick, 142 Va. 173, 128 S.E. 541, 1925 Va. LEXIS 328 (1925) (see Anderson v. Biazzi, 166 Va. 30 9, 186 S.E. 7 (1936)). This section limits § 8.01-322, which allows a person not served with process to have a rehearing of the case within two years from the date of judgment or decree and any injustice corrected. Robertson v. Stone, 199 Va. 41, 97 S.E.2d 739, 1957 Va. LEXIS 159 (1957). Section does not defeat title of one not party to suit.  It was clearly not the purpose of the legislature by the enactment of this section to authorize a court by judicial sale to divest one of his ownership of propert y, who is not a party to the suit. Such a procedure would be without due process of law. Mountain Mission School, Inc. v. Buchanan Realty Corp., 207 Va. 518, 151 S.E.2d 403, 1966 Va. LEXIS 253 (1966). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Action barred.  Injury to plaintiff resulted at time a court order was entered approving a sale of certain property on July 7, 2015, and plaintiff had 12 months to pursue its act ion to either set aside the sale or take some other measure to protect its interest. Plaintiffs action, which was filed on February 8, 2017, was time barred by the statute of limitations. Frost Funeral Home, LLC v. Dolinger, 96 Va. Cir. 34, 2017 Va. Cir.

Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Fixing damages on basis of affidavit held error where not supported by e vidence.  The trial court erred in relying exclusively on an affidavit filed by the plaintiff in fixing the amount of the judgment when it was clear that the evidence at th e hearing did not support the amount awarded. Before fixing the amount of the final judgment, the court should have held a further hearing on the damage issue. At that hearing, additional relevant evidence on the issue of damages should have been receive d from all parties and the respective parties should have been allowed to prove with reasonable certainty the worth of the property seized by the plaintiff.

Judgment against plaintiff where property seized and placed be yond courts jurisdiction.  Where the plaintiff, after seizing the property under authority of statute and placing it beyond the jurisdiction of the court, decides to manipulate the statutor y scheme by exercising the privilege of nonsuit, the detinue statutes contemplate entry of a specific judgment in the detinue proceedings against the plaintiff for the value of the property.

Mandamus for forced entry error.  Where under the common law, it was unlawful for a sheriff to break the doors of a persons house to arrest that person in a civil suit in debt or trespass, whe re this venerable principle underlies the whole law dealing with the right to break and enter a dwelling house for civil recovery of property, and where the General Assembly has not plainly manifested an intent to abrogate this common law principle, the trial court erred in issuing writ of mandamus directing the sheriff to use due diligence and reasonable means to execute all validly issued detinue seizure orders and to take all appropriate action necessary to seize personal property including forced en try into the premises where such property was located or believed to be located.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this article and this section, as used below, refer to former provisions.

An ample remedy is aff orded the plaintiff by this section. Langford &amp; Bro. v. Taylor, 99 Va. 577, 39 S.E. 223, 1901 Va. LEXIS 81 (1901). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statute of frauds held inapplicable.  Where landlords sued their tenants for detinue based on an oral agreement for the sale of personalty located at the leased premises, pursuant to § 8.2-201(3)(b ), the tenants statute of frauds defense regarding contracts for the sale of goods failed in the face of their sworn testimony concerning that oral agreement. Lee v. Park, 73 Va. Cir. 219, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 80 (Fairfax County Apr. 4, 2007). Landlord could not recover fixtures or insufficiently identified personalty.  Landlords detinue claim against their tenants under § 8.01-114 et seq. failed because the alleged agreement largely involved a sale of fixtures rather than personalty, the landlords failed to prove the items of personal property sought had value, and they failed to identify them with sufficient specificity.

Sanctions not imposed for creditors apparent good faith but impermissi ble use of judgment proceedings.  Creditor who sought a warrant of detinue for recovery of collateral after debtor was discharged in bankruptcy appeared to have acted in the good-faith, albeit mis taken, belief that its actions in getting judgment against debtor, garnishing the debtors wages, and threatening criminal action for disposal of collateral were permissible; therefore, sanctions would not be imposed on the creditor.

What sta tute contemplates.  Statute plainly contemplates two, separate scenarios: the first where a purported owner enters the property and takes it by force; and the second where one whose right to possession has expired for whatever reason remains on the property. Seitz v. Fannie Mae, 909 F. Supp. 2d 490, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162927 (E.D. Va. 2012). Validity of title.  This was a clear example of a case in which the unlawful detainer action turned upon the validity of the title to the property. It appeared that, under Virginia l aw, the unlawful detainer action pending in the Circuit Court for Hanover County should be considered an action quasi in rem. Seitz v. Fannie Mae, 909 F. Supp. 2d 490, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162927 (E.D. Va. 2012).

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this statute, this act, and this section, as us ed below, refer to former provisions. Statute libe rally construed.  As the defendant can in no case be turned out of possession, unless it is apparent that he ought to surrender the possession on the demand of the plaintiff, and t o retain it would be unjust, this statute, being remedial, should be given a liberal construction. Allen v. Gibson, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 468, 1826 Va. LEXIS 66 (1826). Purpose of action.  The remedy of unlawful entry and detainer was designed to protect the actual possession, whether rightful or wrongful, and to afford summary redress and restituti on. Olinger v. Shepherd, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 462, 1855 Va. LEXIS 35 (1855); Davis v. Mayo, 82 Va. 97, 1886 Va. LEXIS 13 (1886); Fore v. Campbell, 82 Va. 808, 1 S.E. 180, 1887 Va. LEXIS 150 (1887); Mears v.

While the purpose of this and the following sections is to prevent violence and disturbances which are likely to follow when one entitled to the lawful possession of premises undertakes to assert his rights by force, the right of action is civil in character and the result, if the plaintiff prevails, is merely to restore the possession to one from whom it has been forcibly taken, or to give possession to one from whom it is being unlawfully withheld. The judgment has only the effect of placing the parties in status quo. Shorter v. Shelton, 183 Va. 819, 33 S.E.2d 643, 1945 Va. LEXIS 230 (1945). A warrant for unlawful entry and detainer is a civil action. Kincheloe v. Tracewells, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 587, 1854 Va. LEXIS 45 (1854). Unlawful detainer and ejectment distinguished.  In ejectment, title or right of possession is always involved. The design of unlawful detainer is to protect the actual possession whether rightful or wrongful, a nd to afford summary redress and restitution. Forcible entry of the owner is unlawful. Entry of stranger is unlawful, whether forcible or not. Judgment only restores the status quo, but settles nothing as to the title or right of possession. Davis v. May o, 82 Va. 97, 1886 Va. LEXIS 13 (1886) (see also Olinger v. Shepherd, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 462 (1855)). Title is not involved in the action of unlawful detainer, and evidence of title is often inadmissible. Allen v. Gibson, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 468, 1826 Va. LEXIS 66 (1826); Emerick v. Tavener, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 220, 1852 Va. LEXIS 37 (1852); Olinger v. Shepherd, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 462, 1855 Va. LEXIS 35 (1855). But see, Corbett v. Nutt, 59 Va. ( 18 Gratt.) 624, 1868 Va. LEXIS 28 (1868), aff'd, 77 U.S. 464, 19 L. Ed. 976, 1870 U.S. LEXIS 1140 (1871); Tayloe v. Rose, 10 Va. L. Reg. 1002 (1904). Use of r easonable force by owner.  This section does not in express terms deprive the owner of the common-law right to take possession by reasonable force of premises to which he may be entitled. T he real owner of the premises, having a right of entry, will not commit a trespass by entering, though with force, unless he also commit a breach of the peace, but he may be turned out in an action of forcible entry. Shorter v. Shelton, 183 Va. 819, 33 S .E.2d 643, 1945 Va. LEXIS 230 (1945). B.Elements. 1.Possession. It is necessary to show that the defendant unlawfully withholds the possession. Power v. Tazewells, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 786, 1875 Va. LEXIS 85 (1875). Possession under claim of title is sufficient to sustain an action of forcible entry and detainer against one entering without title. Fore v. Campbell, 82 Va. 808, 1 S.E. 180, 1887 Va. LEXIS 150 (1887). Actual occupancy of whole tract not required.  The possession to which the proceeding for unlawful entry will apply, is not confined to actual occupancy or enclosure, but it is any possession which is sufficie nt to sustain an action of trespass. And thus actual possession of a part of a tract of land under a bona fide claim and color of title to the whole is such a possession of the whole or so much thereof as is not in the adverse possession of others, as wi ll sustain this proceeding. Olinger v. Shepherd, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 462, 1855 Va. LEXIS 35 (1855). Color of title without possession, actual or constructive, is not sufficient to support an action of unlawful detainer. Hot Springs Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Sterrett, 108 Va. 710, 62 S.E. 797, 1908 Va. LEXIS 89 (1908). In ference of possession at time action brought.  Where the proof shows that a defendant in an action of unlawful detainer had been in possession of the premises claimed in the declaration for five years before t he action was brought and always refused to give up possession, the jury might and should infer that he was in possession at the time of action brought. Hence, the court must so find on a demurrer to the evidence by the defendant. Hobday v. Kane, 114 Va. 398, 76 S.E. 902, 1913 Va. LEXIS 97 (1913) (see also Kincheloe v. Tracewells, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 587 (1854)). 2.Right of Possession. Not necessar y in order to recover.  If the defendant enters upon lands of the plaintiff unlawfully, the plaintiff is entitled to recover possession without any regard to the right of possession, the actual possession giving the plaintiff the right of possession against any party not having the right of entry. Tayloe v. Rose, 10 Va. L. Reg. 1002 (1904); Olinger v. Shepherd, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 462, 1855 Va. LEXIS 35 (1855). May recover for ouster from lands of State.  In a proceeding for an unlawful entry or detainer, if the defendant has entered unlawfully, the plaintiff is entitled to recover without any regard to the questio n of his right of possession. This though the land from which he is ousted is the land of the State. Olinger v. Shepherd, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 462, 1855 Va. LEXIS 35 (1855). One with right of immediate possession may be liable.  A person may render himself liable to an action of forcible entry and detainer by entering on his own premises, even when he has the right of immediate possession . Tayloe v. Rose, 10 Va. L. Reg. 1002 (1904); Olinger v. Shepherd, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 462, 1855 Va. LEXIS 35 (1855). 3.The Force Required. To sustain a complaint for forcible entry, the force must be actual, not constructive. O therwise, the remedy given for an unlawful entry would be unnecessary. Pauley v. Chapman, 41 Va. (2 Rob.) 235, 1843 Va. LEXIS 28 (1843).

For the pur poses of this section, termination notice means a notice given under § 55.1-1245 or other notice of termination of tenancy given by the landlord to the tenant of a dwelling unit, or any notice of termination given by a landlord to a tenant of a nonresidential premises. B. In any case when possession of any house, land or tenement is unlawfully detained by the person in possession thereof, the landlord, his agent, attorney, or other person, entitled to the possession may present to a magistrate or a clerk or judge of a general distri ct court a statement under oath of the facts which authorize the removal of the tenant or other person in possession, describing such premises; and thereupon such magistrate, clerk or judge shall issue his summons against the person or persons named in s uch affidavit. The process issued upon any such summons issued by a magistrate, clerk or judge may be served as provided in § 8.01-293, 8.01-296, or 8.01-299. When issued by a magistrate it may be returned to and the case heard and determined by the j udge of a general district court. If the summons for unlawful detainer is filed to terminate a tenancy pursuant to the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (§ 55.1-1200 et seq.), the initial hearing on such summons shall occur as soon as pract icable, but not more than 21 days from the date of filing. If the case cannot be heard within 21 days from the date of filing, the initial hearing shall be held as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 days after the date of the filing. If t he plaintiff requests that the initial hearing be set on a date later than 21 days from the date of filing, the initial hearing shall be set on a date the plaintiff is available that is also available for the court. Such summons shall be served at least 10 days before the return day thereof. C. Any summons issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall contain a notice to the tenant that, pursuant to the provisions of § 18.2-465.1, it is unlawful for his employer to discharge him from employment or take any adverse personnel action against him as a result of his absence from employment due to appearing at any initial or subsequent hearing on such summons, provided that he has given reasonable notice of such hearing to his employer. D. Notwithstan ding any other rule of court or provision of law to the contrary, the plaintiff in an unlawful detainer case may submit into evidence a photocopy of a properly executed paper document or paper printout of an electronically stored document including a cop y of the original lease or other documents, provided that the plaintiff provides an affidavit or sworn testimony that the copy of such document is a true and accurate copy of the original lease. An attorney or agent of the landlord or managing agent may present such affidavit into evidence. E. 1. Notwithstanding any other rule of court or provision of law to the contrary, when th e defendant does not make an appearance in court, the plaintiff or the plaintiffs attorney or agent may submit into evidence by an affidavit or sworn testimony a statement of the amount of outstanding rent, late charges, attorney fees, and any other charges or damages due as of the date of the hearing. The plaintiff or the plaintiffs attorney or agent shall advise the court of any payments by the defendant that result in a variance reducing the amount due the plaintiff as of the day of the heari ng. 2. a. If the unlawful detainer summons served upon the defendant requests judgment for all amounts due as of the date of the hearing, the court shall permit amendment of the amount requested on the summons for unlawful detainer filed in court in accordance with t he evidence and in accordance with the amounts contracted for in the rental agreement and shall enter a judgment for such amount due as of the date of the hearing in addition to entering an order of possession for the premises. Notwithstanding any rule o f court or provision of law to the contrary, no order of possession shall be entered unless the plaintiff or plaintiffs attorney or agent has presented a copy of a proper termination notice that the court admits into evidence. b. Notwithstanding any rule of court or provision of law to the contrary, a plaintiff may amend the amount alleged to be due and owing in an unlawful detainer to request all amounts due and owing as of the date of the hearing. If additional amounts become due and owing prior to the final disposition of a pending unlawful detainer, the plaintiff may also amend the amount alleged to be due and owing to include such additional amounts. If the plaintiff requests to amend the amount alleged to be due and owing in an unlawful detainer, the judge shall grant such amendment. Upon amendment of the unlawful detainer, such plaintiff shall not subsequently file an additional summons for unlawf ul detainer against the defendant for such additional amounts if such additional amounts could have been included in such amendment. If another unlawful detainer is filed, the court shall dismiss the subsequent unlawful detainer. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a plaintiff from filing an unlawful detainer for a non-rent violation during the pendency of an unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent. 3. In determining the amount due the plaintiff as of the date of the hearing, if the rental agreement or lease provides that rent is due and payable on the first of the month in advance f or the entire month, at the request of the plaintiff or the plaintiffs attorney or agent, the amount due as of the date of the hearing shall include the rent due for the entire month in which the hearing is held, and rent shall not be prorated as of the actual court date. Otherwise, the rent shall be prorated as of the date of the hearing. However, nothing herein shall be construed to permit a landlord to collect rent in excess of the amount stated in such rental agreement or lease. If a money judgm ent has been granted for the amount due for the month of the hearing pursuant to this section and the landlord re-rents such dwelling unit and receives rent from a new tenant prior to the end of such month, the landlord is required to reflect the applica ble portion of the judgment as satisfied pursuant to § 16.1-94.01. 4. If, on the date of a foreclosure sale of a single-family residential dwelling unit, the former owner remains in possession of such dwelling unit, such former owner becomes a tenant at sufferance. Such tenancy may be terminated by a written termination notice from the successor owner given to such tenant at least three days prior to the effective date of termination. Upon the expiration of the three-day period, the successor owner may file an unlawful detainer under this section. Such tenant shall be responsible for payment of fair market rental from the date of such foreclosure until the date the tenant vacates the dwelling unit, as well as damages, and for payment of reasonable atto rney fees and court costs.

The 2015 amendment by c. 547 rewrote subsection C, which read Notwithstanding any other rule of court or provision of law to the contrary, when the defendant does not make an appearance in court, the plaintiff or the plaintiffs attorney or agent may include in the affidavit entered into evidence pursuant to subsection B a statement of the amount of outstanding rent, late charges, attorney fees, and any ot her charges or damages due as of the date of the hearing. Upon request of the plaintiff or the plaintiffs attorney or agent, if the court determines that (i) the affidavit accurately sets forth the amount due the plaintiff and (ii) the unlawful detai ner summons served upon the defendant requests judgment for all amounts due as of the date of the hearing, the court shall permit amendment of the amount requested on the summons for unlawful detainer filed in court in accordance with the affidavit and s hall enter a judgment for such amount due as of the date of the hearing in addition to entering an order of possession for the premises. The 2017 a...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-127"><akn:num>§ 8.01-127</akn:num><akn:heading>8</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>01-127, 8.01-127.1.

CASE NOTES Lessor may evict lessee without losing right to recover deficiency later.  In creating an exemption to the rules of claim-splitting, this section provides the lessor with an opportunity to evict the lessee without losing its right to rec over any later deficiency in rent after making an effort to minimize the lessees damages by renting to another tenant. Virginia Dynamics Co. v. Payne, 244 Va. 314, 421 S.E.2d 421, 9 Va. Law Rep. 276, 1992 Va. LEXIS 86 (1992). Right to file subsequent action after eviction must be expressly waived.  The lessors statutorily created right to file a subsequent action for rent would have to be expressly waived in order for such a right to be considered contra cted away. Virginia Dynamics Co. v. Payne, 244 Va. 314, 421 S.E.2d 421, 9 Va. Law Rep. 276, 1992 Va. LEXIS 86 (1992). The judgment restores only the status quo and settles nothing as to the title or right of possession. Davis v. Mayo, 82 Va. 97, 1886 Va. LEXIS 13 (1886) (decided under prior law). No independent action for damages for forcible dispossession.  This article does not undertake to give a party forcibly dispossessed any right to institute a separate and independent action for damages therefor. Shorter v. Sh elton, 183 Va. 819, 33 S.E.2d 643, 1945 Va. LEXIS 230 (1945) (decided under prior law). Removal of encroachment.  Where the evidence showed that removal of an encroachment was essential to appellants full enjoyment of their land, the trial court erred in refusing to issue the injunction sought. Appellants had no adequate remedy at law by way of ejectment or unlawful detainer, for by neither action could they accomplish their object to obtain quiet possession of their land. Benoit v. Baxter, 196 Va. 360, 83 S.E.2d 442, 19 54 Va. LEXIS 228 (1954) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Foreclosure buyer awarded possession .  Buyer was awarded possession of property in an unlawful detainer action because, inter alia, the deed of foreclosure was prima facie evidence that the buyer was e ntitled to possession and the occupant admitted that she maintained possession over the property; the buyer was not required to give any notice to vacate. Fannie Mae v. Harbin, 85 Va. Cir. 69, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 99 (Virginia Beach Mar. 20, 2012). Virginia Housing Development Authority entitled to possession.  Virginia Housing Development Authority (VHDA) successfully demonstrated that it was entitled to prevail on its unlawful detainer claim because it owned the proper ty as a result of the foreclosure sale and the substitute trustees execution of the substitute trustee deed; VHDA subsequently provided the mortgagor with appropriate notice to vacate the premises and was entitled to possession of the property, and a s the prevailing party, it was entitled to damages for the unlawful detention. Ononuju v. Va. Hous. Dev. Auth., 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 48 (Norfolk Mar. 23, 2021). Virginia Housing Development Authority (VHDA) was entitled to prevail on its unlawful detainer claim because VHDA owned the subject property as a result of a fore closure sale and the substitute trustees execution of the substitute trustee deed, VHDA subsequently provided the mortgagor with appropriate notice to vacate the premises, and VHDA was entitled to possession of the property.

In cases where the courts order permits immediate processing of a writ of execution in order to schedule an eviction date, in no case shall such eviction be executed (a) until expiration of the tenant s 10-day appeal period or (b) if the tenant perfects an appeal pursuant to this section. The 2019 amendments. The 2019 amendments by cc. 180 and 700 are identical, and inserted of eviction following writ twice in subsection B. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 1B M.J. Appeal and Error, § 357; 8B M.J. Forcible Entry a nd Detainer, § 28. CASE NOTES This section did not permit an appeal from denial of motion for new trial.  This section was inapplicable where tenant in unlawful detainer action did not appeal district courts judgment awarding possession to landlord but appealed on ly from the courts denial of motion for a new trial. Ragan v. Woodcroft Village Apts., 255 Va. 322, 497 S.E.2d 740, 1998 Va. LEXIS 34 (1998). Relationship to pre-appe al bankruptcy filing.  Bankruptcy court properly found that an escrowed fund awarded to an attorney lien creditor by a state court was property of debtors bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C.S. § 541(a)(1) because: (1) the debtors had an equitable or legal interest in the fund on the date they commenced their bankruptcy case as the debtors filed their bankruptcy petition four days before their time to appeal the state court judgmen t would have expired; and (2) the creditors statutory attorneys fee lien on the fund, pursuant to § 54.1-3932, was not self-executing and did not automatically extinguish the debtors legal or equitable interest in the fund as of the date t hey filed their bankruptcy petition. Todd v. Hart, No. 5:06-CV-00029, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43340 (W.D. Va. June 27, 2006). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No jurisdiction for appeal.  Because the tenants retaliation claim against the landlord under Virginias Manufactured Home Lot Rental Act, § 55.1-1300, was part of the landlords underlying unlawful detainer action and that action was not appealed, that claim was not properly before the circuit court. Even if the tenant had noted an appeal of the tenants retaliation claim, the decision on that claim was not a final order or judgment that was appealable as the tenant only appealed the tenants negligence, negligence per se, and breach of contract claims.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 1A M.J. Adverse Possession, § 55; 6B M.J. Ejectment, § § 2, 10. CASE NOTES Ju dgment settles nothing as to title or right of possession.  In an action of forcible entry and detainer the judgment has only the effect of placing the parties in status quo. It settles nothing even between them in regard to the title or right of possession. It is no bar to an action of trespass or ejectment between the same parties. Olinger v. Shepherd, 53 Va.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to follow court rules.  Challenge to courts interpretation of Parrish v. Fannie Mae , 292 Va. 44, 787 S.E.2d 116 (2016) and § 8.01-130 fail because of lack of argument and evidence. Ononuju v. Va. Hous. Dev. Auth., 103 Va. Cir. 57, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 622 (Norfolk Oct. 30, 2019). § 8.01-130.01. Unlawful detainer; expungement. Text A. If an actio n for unlawful detainer filed in general district court is dismissed or a nonsuit is taken and the time in which the action may be recommenced pursuant to § 8.01-229 has expired, provided that no order of possession has been entered in the case, the d efendant may file a petition on a form created by the Supreme Court in the general district court in which the underlying unlawful detainer action was filed requesting expungement of the court records relating to the unlawful detainer. The petition shall provide the date that the order of dismissal or nonsuit was entered, the address of the property that was the subject of the unlawful detainer action, and the name of the plaintiff in the unlawful detainer action. B. Upon findin g that the unlawful detainer action was dismissed or a nonsuit was taken and the time for recommencement of the action has expired and no order of possession was entered, the court shall, without a hearing, enter an order requiring the expungement of the court records.

On the trial of such action, if any parol demise or any agreement not by deed whereon a certain rent was reserved appears in evidence, the plaintiff shall not therefor be nonsuited, but may use the same as evidence of the am ount of his debt or damages.

City of Richmond, 240 F. 545, 1917 U.S. App. LEXIS 2390 (4th Cir. 1917), aff'd, 249 U.S. 174, 39 S. Ct. 186, 63 L. Ed. 543, 1919 U.S. LEXIS 2241 (1919). It presupposes the relation of landlord and tenant. Raven Red Ash Coal Co. v. Ball, 185 V a. 534, 39 S.E.2d 231, 1946 Va. LEXIS 226 (1946). And distress for rent will not lie unless the relation exists between the parties. The r ight is not only incident to that relation, but is dependent upon it. Church v. Goshen Iron Co., 112 Va. 694, 72 S.E. 685, 1911 Va. LEXIS 138 (1911). A landlords lien is given by this section and §§ 55-231 and 55-233. United States v. Waddill, Holland &amp; Flinn, Inc., 182 Va. 351, 28 S.E.2d 741, 1944 Va. LEXIS 184 (1944), rev'd, 323 U.S. 353, 65 S. Ct. 304, 89 L. Ed. 294, 1945 U.S. LEXIS 2765 (1945) . This section and §§ 55-231 and 55-233 give the landlord a lien which is fixed and specific, and not one which is merely inchoate, and such a lien exists ind ependently of the right of distress or attachment, which are merely remedies for enforcing it. Such a lien relates back to the beginning of the tenancy, thus giving it force and effect on date of the voluntary assignment. United States v. Melchiorre, 292 F. Supp. 305, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11939 (E.D. Va. 1968). The case law indicates that § 55-231, this section and § 55-233 give a landlord a lien which is fixed and specific and not one which is merely inchoate. Suc h lien exists independent of the right of distress or attachment, which are merely remedies for enforcing it. When the landlords lien for rent is obtained, it relates back to the beginning of the tenancy and takes precedence over any lien of any othe r person obtained or created upon goods or chattels on the leased premises after the commencement of the tenancy. John Deskins Pic Pac, Inc. v. Flat Top Nat'l Bank, 59 Bankr. 809, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 6264 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1986). Extent to which landlord may distrain goods.  While a lien legally attaches to all property as might be on the premises when the lien is asserted or within 30 days prior to distraint, the landlord can distrai n goods only to the extent necessary to satisfy the rent justly believed to be due, the tenant possessing an action for damages for excessive distraint. United States v. Melchiorre, 292 F. Supp. 305, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11939 (E.D. Va. 1968). Priority of federal tax lien.  Where landlords obtained a distress warrant before the tenant made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, but did not levy thereunder, their lien was neither specific nor perfected under Virginia law and could not have priority over a federal tax lien with respect to the proceeds of a sale under the assignment. United States v. Melchiorre, 292 F. Supp. 305, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11939 (E.D. Va. 1968). § 8.01-130.2. Who may recover rent or compensation. Text If a person is entitled to rent or compensation, whether such person has the reversion or not, then his personal representative or assignee may recover it as provided i n § 8.01-130.1, whatever the estate of the person owning it, or though his estate or interest in the land has ended. When the owner of real estate in fee, or holder of a term, yielding him rent dies, the rent due after such owners or termholder s death shall be recoverable by such owners heir or devisee or such termholders personal representative. If the owner or holder alienates or assigns his estate or term, or the rent falls due after such alienation or assignment, the alienee or assignee may recover such rent. History History.

Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Ejectment is an action to determine the title and right of possession to real property. S heffield v. Department of Hwys. &amp; Transp., 240 Va. 332, 397 S.E.2d 802, 7 Va. Law Rep. 736, 1990 Va. LEXIS 132 (1990). The landowners constitutional right is a right to just compensation, not a right to recover possession of the property. Sheffield v. Department of Hwys. &amp; Transp., 240 Va. 332, 397 S.E.2d 802, 7 Va. Law Rep. 736, 1990 Va. LEXIS 132 (1990). Form of action.  Ejectment was a common law action designed to try title to land and by statute it continues to be a law action. Seoane v. Drug Emporium, Inc., 249 Va. 469, 457 S. E.2d 93, 1995 Va. LEXIS 66 (1995). Ejectment remedy inappropriate to prosecute inverse conde mnation claim against Commonwealth.  Given the nature of the action of ejectment, and the entitlement of the successful claimant to be put into possession of the disputed land, the remedy is inapprop riate and unsuitable as a vehicle to prosecute an inverse condemnation claim against the Commonwealth. Sheffield v. Department of Hwys. &amp; Transp., 240 Va. 332, 397 S.E.2d 802, 7 Va. Law Rep. 736, 1990 Va. LEXIS 132 (1990). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this article, and this section, as used below, refer to former provisions. English law compared.  An action of ejectment brought under this article affects the title to land more than the action of ejectment in England. United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 1 S. Ct. 240, 27 L. Ed. 171, 1882 U.S. LEXIS 1534 (1882), limited, Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643, 82 S. Ct. 980, 8 L. Ed. 2d 168, 1962 U.S. LEXIS 2148 (1962). Ejectment does not lie where entry cannot be made.  Ejectment lies for the recovery of corporeal hereditaments. It does not lie for anything where an entry cannot be made, as for example, easements, licenses, right s of user. Steinman v. Vicars, 99 Va. 595, 39 S.E. 227, 1901 Va. LEXIS 84 (1901); King v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 99 Va. 625, 39 S.E. 701, 1901 Va. LEXIS 89 (1901). But see, Reynolds v. Cook, 83 Va. 817, 3 S.E. 710, 1887 Va. LEXIS 127 (1887). Ejectment is the proper action for one having legal title, who is not in possession, in order to recover possession and establish his title. Jennings v. Gravely, 92 Va. 377, 23 S.E. 763, 1895 Va. LEXIS 127 (1895). Distinguished from forcible or unlawful entry.  The action of forcible or unlawful entry is materially different from the action of ejectment. In the latter action, title is involved, while in the former only t he right to possession is tried. In the action of forcible entry the plaintiff need only show the right of immediate possession, while in ejectment the plaintiff must always recover on the strength of his title. Power v. Tazewells, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 786 , 1875 Va. LEXIS 85 (1875); Davis v. Mayo, 82 Va. 97, 1886 Va. LEXIS 13 (1886). Trustee as plaintiff.  A trustee, holding the legal title, may maintain ejectment, even after the trust is satisfied. Although a cestui que trust, after the trust is satisfied, may main tain ejectment, that does not deprive the trustee, holding the legal title, of his right to maintain such an action. Hopkins v. Stephens, 23 Va. (2 Rand.) 422, 1824 Va. LEXIS 18 (1824). Effect of statute on existing rights.  If the plaintiff in ejectment would have been entitled at the time the Code of 1849 went into effect and at the time of the institution of his suit, to recover in a writ of right, he is entitled to recover in the present action of ejectment, under the provisions of this section. Mitchell v. Baratta, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 445, 1867 Va. LEXIS 18 (1867). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Timeliness.  Ten-year statute of limitations set forth in § 8.01-255.1 did not apply, and the dioceses lawsuit was timely filed prior to the expiration of the 15-year s tatute of limitations for ejectment actions, where the diocese alleged that the parish retained church property after it ceased to be used for Episcopal purposes and refused to convey the property to the diocese upon the declaration of abandonment, and a s a result, the diocese had pled a breach of the terms of the fiduciary relationship between the parties rather than a reversionary interest in land.

Sheffield v. Department of Hwys. &amp; Transp., 240 Va. 332, 397 S.E.2d 802, 7 Va. Law Rep. 736, 1990 Va. LEXIS 132 (1990). Grantor of deed of trust may maintain action in own name.  In an action of ejectment a deed of trust should be construed as a mere lien on the property, and the grantor may maintain an action in ejectment in his own name. Providence Properties, Inc. v. United Va. Bank/Seaboard Nat'l, 219 Va. 735, 251 S.E.2d 474, 1979 Va. LEXIS 164 (1979). Grantee of property that has a public easement was not entitled to maintain an action in ejectment, since in Virginia, no person shall bring such ejectment action unless he has, at the time of commencing it, a subsisting interest in the premises claimed and a right to recover the same, or to recover the possession thereof. Laughlin v. Mor auer, 849 F.2d 122, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 7790 (4th Cir. 1988). Cont ingent or expectant interest.  Under this section even if grantee was conveyed some kind of contingent or expectant interest by the deed, he had no right to recover the same because the record does not indicate any kind of abandonment of the park or vacation of the plat, or cessation of use, or the like, to give him any right to assert any future interest he may have in the property. Laughlin v. Morauer, 849 F.2d 122, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 7790 (4th Cir. 1988). B.Requirement of Recovery on Strength of Own Title. Plaintiff must recover on strength of own title.  In actions for ejectment, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that he has good title and the right to possession, and he must recover upon the strength of his own title rather than upon the weakness of the defendants title. Providence Properties, Inc. v. United Va. Bank/Seaboard Nat'l, 219 Va. 735, 251 S.E.2d 474, 1979 Va. LEXIS 164 (1979). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. A.General Consider ation. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this article, and this section, as used below, refer to former provisions. The plaintiff in an action of ejectment must have legal title and a present right of possession under it at the time of the commencement of the action. Nelson v. Triplett, 81 Va. 236, 1885 Va. LEXIS 26 (1885); Jennings v. Gravely, 92 Va. 377, 23 S.E. 763, 1895 Va. LEXIS 127 (1895). Presumed where t itle clear.  As a general rule, a plaintiff in ejectment must show a legal title in himself, and a present right to possession under such title. In the absence, however, of ev idence to the contrary, the law presumes that the right of possession is incident to and follows the legal title. Casselman v. Bialas, 112 Va. 57, 70 S.E. 479, 1911 Va. LEXIS 52 (1911). Plaintiff must trace title from Commonwealth.  As a general rule a plaintiff to recover in an action of ejectment must trace unbroken chain of title to the Commonwealth or established title by adverse possessi on. Bugg v. Leay, 107 Va. 648, 60 S.E. 89, 1908 Va. LEXIS 122 (1908); Spriggs v. Jamerson, 115 Va. 250, 78 S.E. 571, 1913 Va. LEXIS 29 (1913) (see also Sulphur Mines Co. v. Thompson, 93 Va. 293, 25 S.E. 232 (1896)). But this is not necessary when title of parties is from a common source.  It is not necessary for plaintiff to trace title to the Commonwealth where both he and the defendant claim title from a common source. In such a case the defendan t is estopped to go back of the common source in order to question the plaintiffs title and it is sufficient for the plaintiff to show that he has better title from that source. Hurley v. Charles, 110 Va. 27, 65 S.E. 468, 1909 Va. LEXIS 112 (1909); J ennings v. Marston, 121 Va. 79, 92 S.E. 821, 1917 Va. LEXIS 10 (1917). However, the plaintiff cannot connect the defendant with the common source of title by proof of a parol purchase of the land. Hurley v. Charles, 110 Va. 27, 65 S.E. 468, 1909 Va. LEXIS 112 (1909). Present, operative, outstanding legal title in another will defeat a recovery by the plaintiff although the defendant does not connect himself therewith. Holladay v. Moore, 115 Va. 66, 78 S.E. 551, 1913 Va. LEXIS 10 (1913). Effect of prior possession.  Prior peaceful possession by the plaintiff is prima facie evidence of ownership and seisin, and is sufficient to authorize recovery unless the defendant shows a b etter title in himself or another. McMurray v. Dixon, 105 Va. 605, 54 S.E. 481, 1906 Va. LEXIS 68 (1906); Holladay v. Moore, 115 Va. 66, 78 S.E. 551, 1913 Va. LEXIS 10 (1913). The principle that possession under color of title constitutes a prima facie title is un der the great weight of authority restricted to those factual situations where the defendant is a mere intruder or trespasser without color of title. Bull Run Dev. Corp. v. Jackson, 201 Va. 95, 109 S.E.2d 400, 1959 Va. LEXIS 198 (1959). Demand and notice necessary before action against tenant at will.  Before bringing an action of ejectment against a tenant at will, demand and notice to quit are necessary, and a vendee, who is put in possession without conveyanc e being made, is a tenant at will and entitled to notice. Pettit v. Cowherd, 83 Va. 20, 1 S.E. 392, 1887 Va. LEXIS 33 (1887); Jones v. Temple, 87 Va. 210, 12 S.E. 404, 1890 Va. LEXIS 111 (1890). B.Requirement of Recovery on Strength of Own Title. The plaintiff in ejectment must recover on the strength of his own title and cannot rely on the weakness of the defendants claim. McKinney v. Daniel, 90 Va. 702, 19 S.E. 880, 1894 Va. LEXIS 48 (1894); Merryman v. Hoover, 107 Va. 485, 59 S.E. 483, 1907 Va. LEXIS 67 (1907); Davis v. Bostic, 125 Va. 698, 100 S.E. 463, 1919 Va. LEXIS 58 (19 19). Exceptions.  To the general rule that a plaintiff in ejectment must recover on the strength of his own title there are several well defined exceptions resting for the most par t on the principle of estoppel. Tapscott v. Cobbs, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 172, 1854 Va. LEXIS 13 (1854); Rhule v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 102 Va. 343, 46 S.E. 331, 1904 Va. LEXIS 75 (1904). As when landlord sues tenant.  A tenant is estopped to deny his landlords title, and, hence, in an action of ejectment by a landlord he is not required to establish title as against the ten ant. Miller v. Williams, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 213, 1859 Va. LEXIS 11 (1859); Suttle v. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R., 76 Va. 284, 1882 Va. LEXIS 31 (1882). Also, when one is in possession against an intruder.  Although, in general, legal title in the plaintiff must be shown in order to sustain a recovery in ejectment, as against mere intruders without semblance of right , prior peaceable possession is sufficient. Rhule v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 102 Va. 343, 46 S.E. 331, 1904 Va. LEXIS 75 (1904); McMurray v. Dixon, 105 Va. 605, 54 S.E. 481, 1906 Va. LEXIS 68 (1906). And when grantor enforces forfeiture for breach of condition.  Where there is a breach of condition subsequent, the legal title to the land remains in the grantee until the forfeiture is consummated, but the practice in Virgi nia, under § 55-239, is to bring ejectment in such case although the plaintiff has not the legal title. Pence v. Tidewater Townsite Corp., 127 Va. 447, 103 S.E. 694, 1920 Va. LEXIS 63 (1920). C.When Title Must Exis t. A plaintiff in ejectment must have title at the time of the commencement of his action a nd cannot acquire it afterwards. Merryman v. Hoover, 107 Va. 485, 59 S.E. 483, 1907 Va. LEXIS 67 (1907). But where a plaintiff, after suit brought, aliens the land he may recover for the benefit of the alienee. Right to recover at the commencement of the action is all that is required by the statute. Bolling v. Teel, 76 Va. 487, 1882 Va. LEXIS 53 (1882). D.Evidence of Title. The documentary evidence relied on must identify the land in dispute. Blakey v. Morris, 8 9 Va. 717, 17 S.E. 126, 1893 Va. LEXIS 93 (1893); Craig-Giles Iron Co. v. Wickline, 126 Va. 223, 101 S.E. 225, 1919 Va. LEXIS 89 (1919). A grant from the Commonwealth confers constructive seisin sufficient to support an action of ejectment. Actual seisin is not necessary. Howdashell v. Krenning, 103 Va. 30, 48 S.E. 491, 1904 Va. LEXIS 4 (1904). When grant may be presumed.  The plaintiff in an action of ejectment may show title in himself either by showing a grant from the crown or the Commonwealth and connecting himself therewith by a regular chain of title, or by showing such a chain of facts as will warrant the jury in presuming a grant. Sulphur Mines Co. v. Thompson, 93 Va. 293, 25 S.E. 232, 1896 Va. LEXIS 76 (1896); Spriggs v. Jamerson, 115 Va. 250, 78 S.E. 571, 1913 Va. LEXI S 29 (1913); Brunswick Land Corp. v.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Defendants where no person actually occupying premises.  Where there is no person actually occupying the disputed property when an action for ejectment was initiated, the action must be brought against some person,  but not every person, exercising ownership or claiming title to or an interest in the property. Providence Properties, Inc. v. United Va. Bank/Seaboard Nat'l, 219 Va. 735, 251 S.E.2d 474, 1979 Va. LEXIS 164 (1979). Ejectment remedy inappropriate to prosecute inverse conde mnation claim against Commonwealth.  Given the nature of the action of ejectment, and the entitlement of the successful claimant to be put into possession of the disputed land, the remedy is inapprop riate and unsuitable as a vehicle to prosecute an inverse condemnation claim against the Commonwealth. Sheffield v. Department of Hwys. &amp; Transp., 240 Va. 332, 397 S.E.2d 802, 7 Va. Law Rep. 736, 1990 Va. LEXIS 132 (1990). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Effect of section.  This section does not alter the rule that ejectment cannot be maintained by a plaintiff in possession of the land. The object of the action is to try the possesso ry title to corporeal hereditaments, and to recover the possession thereof. The effect of the section is simply to permit a plaintiff in his discretion, to join as defendants with the occupant any person claiming title thereto or an interest therein adve rsely to the plaintiff. Steinman v. Vicars, 99 Va. 595, 39 S.E. 227, 1901 Va. LEXIS 84 (1901). Proper remedy when neither party in possession.  The proper remedy is by an action of ejectment, when the owner holds the legal title, but has not actual possession, and another asserts an adverse claim to the l and, but has not actual possession of it. Stearns v. Harman, 80 Va. 48, 1885 Va. LEXIS 39 (1885). Ejectment may be properly brought against persons who have made entries and surveys of a ny part of the land in controversy, and are setting up claims to it, though not in occupation of it at the time suit is brought. Harvey v. Tyler, 69 U.S. 328, 17 L. Ed. 871, 1864 U.S. LEXIS 433 (1865). One who has had land surveyed and regularly paid taxes on it and claims to own it may be made defendant to an action of ejectment when no one is in actual occupat ion. Lynchburg Cotton Mill v. Rives, 112 Va. 137, 70 S.E. 542, 1911 Va. LEXIS 63 (1911). When occupant is necessary defendant.  This section permits the plaintiff to join with the occupant as defendants any other persons claiming title to the land. It may be conceded that the actual occupa nt is always a necessary party defendant to an action of ejectment in the sense that another defendant may by timely and proper procedure compel the plaintiff to bring the occupant before the court. The presence of the occupant, however, is not essential to the jurisdiction of the court, and if the claimant of the premises who is sued does not appropriately raise the point, and defends the action upon the merits, he is bound by the judgment. Matoaka Coal Corp. v. Clinch Valley Mining Corp., 121 Va. 522, 93 S.E. 799, 1917 Va. LEXIS 55 (1917). Who is a n occupant of premises.  One operating mines under a contract with a lessee which gave him exclusive possession thereof for the time being, but whose possession was not exclusive of and w as subordinate to the possession of the entire tract by the lessee, is not the party actually occupying the premises, as those terms are used in this section. Matoaka Coal Corp. v. Clinch Valley Mining Corp., 121 Va. 522, 93 S.E. 799, 1917 Va. LEXIS 55 ( 1917). Meaning of lessee.   The term lessee, is used, not so much to define an estate as to express the relation existing where one person holds under and in subordination to the tit le of another. Hanks v. Price, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 107, 1879 Va. LEXIS 50 (1879). Right of lan dlord to defend.  In an action of ejectment, brought against the person in possession, the landlord of such person may come in and be allowed to defend the action under the statute whether the actual relation of lessor and lessee exists between them or not. This will be permitted even where the plaintiff and the defendant in possession have submitted the matters between them to arbitration, an award made in favor of the plaintiff, and a rule awarded against the defendant in possession to show cause why the award should not be entered as the judgment of the court against him. Hanks v. Price, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 107, 1879 Va. LEXIS 50 (1879). Effect when husband sued and legal title in wife.  Where a husband who was in possession merely by sufferance, his wife holding the legal title, was sued in ejectment, the wife not being a party to the suit, it wa s held that her rights were not affected and that she could convey them to a purchaser, innocent or otherwise. The husband also could acquire a life estate by her death and would not be estopped and was entitled to have the judgment by default against hi m opened. But where the wifes deed was not filed for recordation until long after such judgment, she is not entitled to an order restraining execution of the judgment, although she is entitled to have the judgment opened and be allowed to defend. Kin g v. Davis, 137 F. 222, 1905 U.S. App. LEXIS 5219 (C.C.D. Va. 1905), aff'd, Blankenship v. King, 157 F. 676, 1906 U.S. App. LEXIS 4265 (4th Cir. 1906). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Joinder of trustees and deed of trust beneficiary not required.  Landowner was not required to include trustees and the beneficiary of a deed of trust as necessary parties to the landowners ejectment action against a neighb or because the deed of trust was a mere lien, so the landowner could pursue the suit in the landowners own name and had discretion to join others claiming adverse interests in the property, and the deed of trust did not defeat the action.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this article, and this section, as used below, refer to former provisions. The object of the description of lands in a motion is to so identify them that the sheri ff may give possession. It is not necessary that the sheriff should be able to tell from an inspection of the record of what lands he is to give possession. Howdashell v. Krenning, 103 Va. 30, 48 S.E. 491, 1904 Va. LEXIS 4 (1904). Defective description.  A motion in ejectment, which describes the land as a part of a larger tract owned by plaintiff, near certain creeks which have no public notoriety, is defective, and may be demurred to. Hitchcox v. Rawson, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 422, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 526, 1858 Va. LEXIS 40 (1858). Effect of verdict for plaintiff for land insufficiently described in motion.  A verdict which finds for the plaintiff the land insufficiently described in the motion is too vague. There is no more certainty and precision in the verdict than there is in the motion, and the defect in the latter is not cured by the former. Hitchcox v. Rawson, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 422, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 526, 1858 Va. LEXIS 40 (1858). Where the motion sufficiently describes the premises, a general finding for the plaintiff of the lands described is sufficiently certain. Messick v. Thomas, 84 Va . 891, 6 S.E. 482, 1888 Va. LEXIS 161 (1888). Effect of verdict for whole of land when defendant claims only part.  Where the defendant claimed only part of the land, a verdict for the plaintiff for the whole of the land described in the motion is sufficiently certain and does not injure the defendant. Messick v. Thomas, 84 Va. 891, 6 S.E. 482, 1888 Va. LEXIS 161 (1888). Verdict held correct when a variance between the verdict and motion.  The quantity and boundaries of the land described in a motion and in the verdict varied from each other. But the verdict found that the land therein described was the tenement mentioned in the declaration. It was to be presumed that the description given in a motion was a mistaken description, and that the land recovered by the verdict was the land demanded. Koiner v. Rankin, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 420, 1854 Va. LEXI S 32 (1854). Where a motion described the land in controversy as lying north of a road, and the verdict as south of that road, the description in other particulars being the s ame, the variance was held immaterial and the description in the motion must be presumed to be mistaken.

Proof.  The action of ejectment is concerned only with the ownership rights of the plaintiff, and the proof necessary to support the action consists of the documents whic h vest title in the owner and any other evidence related to the issue of title. Brown v. Haley, 233 Va. 210, 355 S.E.2d 563, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2286, 1987 Va. LEXIS 186 (1987). Verdict must s pecify plaintiffs share or interest.  A verdict for the plaintiff in an action for ejectment must specify the share or interest of the plaintiff, whether in the whole or a part of the premises claimed , and the estate of the plaintiff, whether in fee, for life, or for a term of years. Brown v. Haley, 233 Va. 210, 355 S.E.2d 563, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2286, 1987 Va. LEXIS 186 (1987).

CASE NOTES Nature of possession needed to constitute adverse possession.  The possession of one joint tenant, tenant in common, or coparcener is prima facie the possession of all the other cotenants, and the mere possession of the one w ill not be taken to be adverse to the title and possession of the other. Yet if the defendant prove actual ouster or other notorious act or acts, amounting to a total denial of the plaintiffs rights as cotenant, and of such a character as to afford d irect or presumptive proof that the other cotenants or plaintiffs had had knowledge of the claim of exclusive ownership thus set up and held by the defendants, or those under whom they claim, such possession of the land is held continuously and uninterru ptedly under such circumstances under color of title for the length of time prescribed by law, constitutes adverse possession, and will ripen into a good and sufficient title in the defendants.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The purpose of the section was to prevent oppression by one having mere legal title and to obviate the necessity for a jury in equity to establish a perfect defense. Until a statute was passed to remedy the evil, a vendee in possession, who had paid every dollar of his purchase money, and had written evidence of his contract, was liable to be turned out of possession at any time by his vendor upon the mere legal title, and was at least compelled to make his defense in a court of equity. And the same rule prevailed to a great extent with respect to mortgages and deeds of trust, which had be en satisfied. Suttle v. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R., 76 Va. 284, 1882 Va. LEXIS 31 (1882).

This section applies to the action of unlawful detainer as well as ejectment. Dobson v. C ulpepper, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 352, 1873 Va. LEXIS 41 (1873). Written contract prerequisite.  Although a defendant in ejectment may be clothed with a perfect equitable title, he cannot avail himself thereof in ejectment unless he can bring himself within t he terms of the section, requiring a contract in writing. Jennings v. Gravely, 92 Va. 377, 23 S.E. 763, 1895 Va. LEXIS 127 (1895). Writing need not be produced in al l cases.  The section does not admit of the construction that the writing must be produced in all cases, but that, although evidence of a parol contract is inadmissible, th e best possible evidence of the required writing may be admitted. The writing must have been executed, but it may be established by pleadings in a court of record, and by reference in the record to a contract as a document filed in the court. Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Steinman, 223 F. 743, 1915 U.S. App. LEXIS 1790 (4th Cir. 1915). Contract must also be performed.  In order to rely on this section, the defendant must show not only the written contract of sale setting out the terms but also his own performance of the contract . Dobson v. Culpepper, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 352, 1873 Va. LEXIS 41 (1873). Defendant may resort to equity to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment rendered against him in an action of ejectment even though the equitable defense might, under this section, have been proved in the action of ejectment.

The equitable defense under this section is limited to mortgages and deeds of trust, whe re the mortgage money has been fully paid, or the trust completely performed; or to sales, where the vendee has paid all the purchase money and performed everything incumbent on him, so as to entitle him to a specific execution on the contract in equity, and a conveyance of the legal title, without any condition proper in equity to be on him imposed. It must be a sale, and not a partnership in the acquisition of the land, and the terms of the contract must be plain. Davis v. Teays, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 283 , 1846 Va.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Grantor may bring action.  Where a deed of trust by a wife was satisfied and reconveyance made to the husband, it was held under this section that neither the trustee nor the husband should bring ejectment but that the wife was the proper party. The effect of the section is to prevent the trustee from bringing ejectment and to authorize the grantor to maintain such an action. Lynchburg Cotton Mill v. Rives, 112 Va. 137, 70 S.E. 542, 1911 V a. LEXIS 63 (1911). Purchaser from trust.  Where land was conveyed in trust to secure specific debts and afterwards conveyed outright, the purchaser takes good title subject to the trust, and when that is satisfied is entitled to the benefit of this section, though the trustee has not conveyed it to him.

Many of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . This section alters the common-law rule and allows, as a set-off to the plaintiffs c laim for rent and damages, compensation for permanent improvements made by defendant at a time when there was reason to believe the title good under which he was holding the premises, not exceeding, however, the increase of value to the same. Hollingswor th v. Funkhouser, 85 Va. 448, 8 S.E. 592, 1888 Va. LEXIS 54 (1888) (decided under prior law). It applies only to actions of ejectment or to cases in which a decree or judgment is rendered against a defendant for land. It does not apply to a suit for the specific enforcement of an alleged parol contract to convey land. Graeme v. Cullen, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 266, 1873 Va. LEXIS 37 (1873); Branham v. Artrip, 115 Va. 314, 79 S.E. 390, 1 913 Va. LEXIS 37 (1913). It has no application to the case of a purchaser at a judicial sale, against whom a clai m for the purchase money is asserted, and in whose favor there has been no decree of confirmation. Tyler v. Toms, 75 Va. 116, 1880 Va. LEXIS 11 (1880) (decided under prior law). Nor to a judgment creditor seeking to enforce his lien upon the land upon which the improvements have been made. Flanary v. Kane, 102 Va. 547, 46 S.E. 312, 1904 Va. LEXIS 101 (1904) (decided under prior law). No allowance is made for improvements erected by one who is not a bona fide purchaser. Bu rton v. Mill, 78 Va. 468 (1884); Smith v. Woodward, 122 Va. 356, 94 S.E. 916 (1918). The cases cited above were decided under prior law. Effect of being life tenant.  A party cannot be said to be acting in good faith in putting improvements on land when he knows that at best he has only a life estate in the land. Wright v. John son, 108 Va. 855, 62 S.E. 948, 1908 Va. LEXIS 106 (1908) (decided under prior law). Whenever there is a duty to inquiry, the party bound to inquire is affected with knowled ge of all that would have been discovered had the party performed the duty. Richardson v. Parris, 246 Va. 203, 435 S.E.2d 389, 10 Va. Law Rep. 238, 1993 Va. LEXIS 118 (1993). Inappl icable to one with notice of infirmity in his title.  Although this section permits a recovery for improvements when the one who made them mistakenly held the land under a title believed by him . . . to have been good, this section has no application to one who is not a bona fide purchaser, and a person with notice, actual or constructive, of infirmity in his title cannot recover for improvements. White v. Pleasants, 227 Va. 508, 317 S.E.2d 489, 1984 Va. LEX IS 221 (1984). In order to be a bona fide purchaser and therefore qualify for protection under this sec tion, the belief in the validity of the title must be founded on ignorance of fact, not ignorance of law. Richardson v. Parris, 246 Va. 203, 435 S.E.2d 389, 10 Va. Law Rep. 238, 1993 Va. LEXIS 118 (1993). Effect of actual or constructive n otice.  Under this section a person with notice, actual or constructive, of a defect in his title is not entitled, upon being dispossessed by the rightful owner, to recov er compensation for permanent improvements made on the premises. Kian v. Kefalogiannis, 158 Va. 129, 163 S.E. 535, 1932 Va. LEXIS 247 (1932) (see Keister v. Cubine, 101 Va. 768, 45 S.E. 285 (1903); Truslow v. Ball, 166 Va. 608, 186 S.E. 71 (1936)). This section restricts recovery for improvements to one holding the premises under a title believed by him . . . to be good. This section has no applicati on to one who is not a bona fide purchaser, and a person with notice, actual or constructive, of infirmity in his title cannot recover for improvements. Graeme v. Cullen, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 266, 1873 Va. LEXIS 37 (1873); Hurn v. Keller, 79 Va. 415, 1884 Va. LEXIS 97 (1884); Smith v. Woodward, 122 Va. 356, 94 S.E. 916, 1918 Va. LEXIS 103 (1918). Means of notice with the duty of using those means, is equivalent to actual notice. Effin ger v. Hall, 81 Va. 94, 1885 Va. LEXIS 14 (1885) (decided under prior law). Effect of laches on part of plaintiff.  If the owner is guilty of gross laches in asserting his claim, after he is apprised of it, he will not be permitted to recover, except upon compensation. Walker v . Beauchler, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 511, 1876 Va. LEXIS 43 (1876); Wood v. Krebbs, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 685, 1880 Va. LEXIS 68 (1880). What constitutes permanent impro vement.  Whether the work was done and the money expended with reference to the future betterment of the premises, or for future immediate advantage of the occupant is the consideration which should control. Cullop v. Leonard, 97 Va. 256, 33 S.E. 611, 1899 Va. LEXIS 33 (1899) (decided under prior law). Commercial fertilizers cannot be regarded as permanent improvements. Effinger v. Kenney, 92 Va. 245, 23 S.E. 742, 1895 Va. LEXIS 111 (1895) (see also Wright v. Johnson, 108 Va. 855, 62 S.E. 948 (1908)). Recovery for improvements unavaila ble.  Where the insufficiency of the affidavit for the order of publication was apparent on the face of the record to be discovered by the subsequent purchaser or their agent before entry of the decree confirming the sale, the failure to recognize the facial insufficiency of the affidavit was ignorance of law, not ignorance of fact. Thus, because the subsequent purchaser had constructive notice of the title infirmity, they were not bona fide purchasers and were precluded from recovering for improvements. Richardson v. Parris, 246 Va. 203, 435 S.E.2d 389, 10 Va. Law Rep. 238, 1993 Va.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. Value of plaintiffs estate ascertained as of same time as the improvement.  The value of the plaintiffs estate in the premises without the improvements, is to be ascertained as at the time when the assessment of the value of the impro vements was made. Goodwyn v. Myers, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 336, 1862 Va. LEXIS 5 (1862) (see also Corr v. Porter, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 278 (1880)). Estate to be valued by a different jur y.  If defendant claims for improvements on the land, the plaintiff may at any time before a judgment is rendered on the assessment of the value of the improvements, though after the jury which tried the issue or passed upon the defendants claim for improvement has been discharged, require that the value of his estate in the premises, without the improvements, shall also be ascertained. This inquiry is to be made by another jury. Goodwyn v. Myers, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 336, 1862 Va. LEXIS 5 (1862). Where the plaintiff in the ejectment suit requires the value of his estate in the premises in controversy to be ascertained, the inquiry must be made by a differe nt jury from that which tried the cause on its merits. Goodwyn v. Myers, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 336, 1862 Va. LEXIS 5 (1862); Corr v. Porter, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 278, 1880 Va. LEXIS 41 (1880). No objec tion to use of same jury can be made after verdict.  The same jury which tried the case on its merits was allowed, without objection from either side, to fix the value of the land, the rents and profits thereof, and the value of the improvements claimed by the defendant. It is too late after verdict to object to this action of the court. Corr v. Porter, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 278, 1880 Va.

(5 Gratt.) 4 99, 1849 Va. LEXIS 12 (1849). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Distribution of marital property.  In a divorce case, a wifes 50% share of marital property was reduced by $26,000 because she committed permissive waste under § 55-211 by allowing the prope rty to deteriorate in the 17 years she had lived there; the house was remodeled and in good condition when she moved in. Although the wife had an interest in the value of the marital estate, she did not have an ownership interest in it, and the property was titled in her husbands name. Bell v. Bell, 89 Va. Cir. 472, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 2 (Roanoke County Jan. 30, 2013). In a divorce case, a court valued the marital property and a husband was permitted to convey one parcel of property to the wife; the wifes 50% share included a $26,000 devaluation that occurred due to the wifes commission of permissive waste on property that she occupied after the parties separation. The rest of the amount owed to the wife was reduced to a monetary judgment after the entry of a final divorce decree. Bell v. Bell, 89 Va. Cir. 472, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 2 (Roanoke County Jan. 30, 2013). In a divorce case, a court decided to value the property currently, instead of using the date that the parties separated 17 years earlier, because passive appreci ation had occurred; moreover, evidence was presented as to the dollar amount of the repairs needed due to the wifes commission of permissive waste. Using the current valuation date instead of the date of separation allowed the court to consider all o f the factors necessary to arrive at a fair and equitable monetary award. Bell v. Bell, 89 Va. Cir. 472, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 2 (Roanoke County Jan. 30, 2013). § 8.01-178.2. Civil action for waste; double damages.

Kavanaugh v. Donovan, 186 Va. 85, 41 S.E.2d 489, 1947 Va. LEXIS 131 (1947). § 8.01-178.3. Waste for tenant to sell or remove manure from leased premises. Text If a tenant at will or for years, without a special license to do so, sells or otherwise removes manure made on such leased premises in the ordinary course of husbandry , consisting of (i) ashes leached or unleached; (ii) collections from the stables, barnyard, or cattle pens or other places on the leased premises; or (iii) composts formed by an admixture of any such manure with the soil or other substances, such remova l shall be deemed waste for the purposes of the provisions of this article.

Waste committed during pendency of action. Text If a defendant who is a tenant in possession of land in an action initiated pursuant to § 8.01-178.2 commits any waste on the land, the court may, on petition of the plaintiff alleging such waste, verified by oath, and after reasonable notice to the tenant, prohibit the tenant from committing further waste on the land during the pendency of the action. Violation of such order by the tenant after he has been served w ith a copy may be punished as contempt. The order shall not be effective until the plaintiff gives bond with sufficient surety as prescribed by the court, with condition to pay to the tenant, in case the plaintiff does not succeed in recovering or chargi ng the land, such damages as may accrue to the tenant as a consequence of such order. If the plaintiff succeeds in recovering or charging the land, he may recover three times the amount of the damages assessed for such waste. History History.

Burden of proving common grantor.  Where the parties to a boundary-line proceeding purport to trace their title to a common grantor, the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove perfect legal title by showing an unbroken chain running back to the common source. Bulifant v. Slosjarik, 221 Va. 983, 277 S.E.2d 151, 1981 Va. LEXIS 238 (1981). Effect of deed recorded years after execution.  In a boundary-line proceeding in which plaintiffs and defendant both claimed to trace their title to the disputed strip to a common grantor, there was evidence th at the deed was recorded, but where the deed is recorded many years after its execution and no satisfactory explanation accounts for its whereabouts during the intervening period, no presumption of delivery arises from the mere fact of recordation; there fore, the plaintiffs failed to establish title to the disputed strip because they did not prove proper delivery of the deed. Bulifant v. Slosjarik, 221 Va. 983, 277 S.E.2d 151, 1981 Va. LEXIS 238 (1981). Comparable t o ejectment.  Where in a proceeding under the section to establish a boundary line the title and right of possession of the coterminous owners is brought into dispute by the pl eadings, the same principles of law are applicable as would be applicable to the same subject in an action of ejectment. Bulifant v. Slosjarik, 221 Va. 983, 277 S.E.2d 151, 1981 Va. LEXIS 238 (1981). II.Nature of Action. Editors note. Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this statute and this section, as used below, r efer to former provisions. The proceeding to settle and determine boundaries under this section is an action for the recovery of property. Bradshaw v. Booth, 129 Va. 19, 105 S.E. 555, 1921 Va. LEXIS 73 (1921), overruled in part, Howard v. Ball, 289 Va. 470, 770 S.E.2d 476, 2015 Va. LEXIS 46 (2015) (overruled in part by Howard v. Ball, 770 S.E.2d 476 (Va. 2015) (to t he extent Bradshaw can be interpreted to allow a party to rely on adverse possession as an affirmative defense without expressly pleading it in an ejectment action or an action to establish boundary lines)). A summary proceeding at law.  The remedy given by this section for ascertaining and determining the boundary lines of real estate is a summary proceeding at law, and not in equity. Wri ght v. Rabey, 117 Va. 884, 86 S.E. 71, 1915 Va. LEXIS 109 (1915). Matters which may be settl ed.  In a proceeding under this section, the court will settle the line between plaintiff and defendants so far as their lands are coterminous, but the plaintiff canno t in such proceeding contest the rights of the defendants to the use of a river in which the plaintiff has no title, nor the title of defendants to land which in no way fixes the location of the line in question. James River &amp; Kanawha Power Co. v. Old Do minion Iron &amp; Steel Corp., 138 Va. 461, 122 S.E. 344, 1924 Va. LEXIS 39 (1924). Proceeding not incompatible with action for trespass.  Plaintiffs action to try the right of possession by means of its petition (now motion for judgment) under this section, is not incompatible with the concomita nt action by it for the defendants trespass. But plaintiffs claim to the right of possession, to the land in dispute, while related to a claim for damages for defendants trespass upon the land, constitutes a distinct and independent subject o f action. Brunswick Land Corp. v. Perkinson, 153 Va. 603, 151 S.E. 138, 1930 Va. LEXIS 256 (1930). But proceeding did not toll statute of limitation against action of trespass.  Defendant, in an action for trespass, pleaded the statute of limitations. But plaintiff claimed that the statute of limitations had been tolled by a proceeding un der this section instituted after the alleged trespass by the plaintiff in the instant case against defendant to determine the boundary between plaintiff and defendant and establish title to the land upon which the trespass was alleged to have been commi tted. It was held that the statute was not tolled. Brunswick Land Corp. v. Perkinson, 153 Va. 603, 151 S.E. 138, 1930 Va. LEXIS 256 (1930). Pr oceeding not a substitute for partition.  The proceeding to determine boundaries under this section was not intended as a substitute for a suit for partition, nor does it afford the same relief. The forme r proceeding is governed by the same principles as obtained in an action of ejectment. The court has no jurisdiction therein to establish lines which have never been designated with proper certainty by the source of title of the plaintiff. Whereas that i s precisely the relief which a suit for partition in kind affords to those who own several freeholds in the same land, which have never been divided in severalty with respect to the right of possession, by definite designation, in the source of title, of the dividing line or lines. Hodges v. Thornton, 138 Va. 112, 120 S.E. 865, 1924 Va. LEXIS 15 (1924). But proceeding may determine dividing line under partition agreement.  In a proceeding under this section, if a partition deed from grantors to their cotenant did not include all the lands which, according to the agreed line, were th e property of the cotenant and now belong to his successor in title, it was proper for the jury to so fix the dividing line as to give to the cotenants successor in title the land which was the cotenants under the terms of the partition agreement . Vanover v. Hollyfield, 151 Va. 287, 144 S.E. 450, 1928 Va. LEXIS 233 (1928). Must designa te boundaries in motion.  This section is a statutory remedy to have ascertained and designated the true boundary line or lines of coterminous landowners, and the plaintiff is required to designate with reasonable certainty in his motion the boundary line or lines which he seeks to establish. James River &amp; Kanawha Power Co. v. Old Dominion Iron &amp; Steel Corp., 138 Va. 461, 122 S.E. 344, 1924 Va. LEXIS 39 (1924). III.Comparable to Ejectment. Proceeding as a substitute for action of ejectment.  This statute, which was presumably enacted with knowledge of the long established right of joinder in actions of ejectment, was intended, and has been used, as a frequently available and convenient substitute for ejectment. This is shown by the language of the statute, by its location in the Code of 1919 in the chapter on ejectment, and inferentially at least by the reported decisions. Fray v. Pollock, 7 Va. L. R eg. 95 (1921). While the judgment of the court under this section may not in terms be a judgment rendered for land, yet in substance and effect it is for land to the same extent as in a judgment entered in an action of ejectment. Pickeral v. Federal Land Bank, 177 Va. 743, 15 S.E.2d 82, 1941 Va. LEXIS 257 (1941). Same princip les applicable.  Where in a proceeding under the section to establish a boundary line the title and right of possession of the coterminous owners is brought into dispute by the pl eadings, the same principles of law are applicable as would be applicable to the same subject in an action of ejectment. Brunswick Land Corp. v. Perkinson, 146 Va. 695, 132 S.E. 853, 1926 Va. LEXIS 358 (1926) (see Prettyman v. M. J. Duer &amp; Co., 52 S.E.2d 156, 189 Va. 122, 1949 Va. LEXIS 155; Wade v. Ford, 193 Va. 279, 68 S.E.2d 528 (1952); Allen v. Powers, 194 Va. 662, 74 S.E.2d 688 (1953); Bull Run Dev. Corp. v. Jackson, 201 Va. 95, 109 S.E.2d 400 (1959); Custis Fishing &amp; Hunting Club, Inc. v. Johnson, 214 Va. 388, 200 S.E.2d 542 (1973)). In a proceeding under this section, to determine boundaries, the same principles are inevitably involved as are involved on the same subject in actions of ejectme nt. Where the plaintiff to recover relies on title to land up to a certain location of its boundary on the ground, although the defendant may in general terms admit by the pleadings that the plaintiff has title to some land claimed by the latter, yet whe n the defendant denies that the plaintiffs title extends to such location, the plaintiff is inescapably put to his proof of such a title by evidence of title which the defendant cannot be heard to dispute. Such evidence must trace the title either fr om the Commonwealth or other common grantor. Bradshaw v. Booth, 129 Va. 19, 105 S.E. 555, 1921 Va. LEXIS 73 (1921), overruled in part, Howard v.

LEXIS 159 (1916) (see also Bradshaw v. Booth, 129 Va. 19, 105 S.E. 555 (1921) (overruled in part by Howard v.

The burden of establishing adverse possession is upon the defendant. Westland Realty Corp . v. Griffin, 151 Va. 1005, 145 S.E. 718, 1928 Va. LEXIS 286 (1928). Plaintiffs acquiescence in defendants survey did not work estoppel.  The mere acquiescence of plaintiff in a survey by defendant of the land in controversy in a proceeding under this section, to determine boundaries, at the time of the purchase of the real estate by defendant, does not estop plaintiff from afterwards asserting an adverse claim of title inconsistent with the validity of the survey in the accuracy of which he had acquiesced. Such mere acquiescence alone will not wor k an estoppel. In order to do so the acquiescence must have influenced the subsequent conduct of the defendant to his prejudice. Bradshaw v. Booth, 129 Va. 19, 105 S.E. 555, 1921 Va. LEXIS 73 (1921), overruled in part, Howard v. Ball, 289 Va. 470, 770 S. E.2d 476, 2015 Va. LEXIS 46 (2015) (overruled in part by Howard v.

Defendant receives no benefit from compromise not accepted.  Where a defendant in a proceeding to ascertain a boundary between him and the plaintiff has refused to accept an offer of a compromise line made in the petition ( now motion for judgment), and has denied the right of the plaintiff to the line both in his pleadings and proof, he has no right to claim any benefit from such offer.

Statutory duty as to surveys.  The provisions of this section are not intended to prevent the court of its own motion from ordering such survey or surveys as it might deem necessary to give eff ect to its judgment as to what constitutes the boundary between the parties by locating and marking the line on the ground. It is not only the right, but the duty, of the court to have such survey or surveys made whenever deemed proper. This holding is m ade statutory by the present form of the section. Hamman v. Miller, 116 Va. 873, 83 S.E. 382, 1914 Va. LEXIS 101 (1914).

I.Decisions Under Current Law. A.General Cons ideration. This section and § 8.01-191 are to be liberally interpreted and administered with a v iew to making the courts more serviceable to the people. Board of Supvrs. v. Southland Corp., 224 Va. 514, 297 S.E.2d 718, 1982 Va. LEXIS 323 (1982). The controversy must be one that is justiciable, that is, where specific adverse claims, based upon present rather than future or speculative facts, are ripe for judicial adjustment. Reisen v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., 225 Va. 327, 302 S.E.2d 529, 1983 Va. LEXIS 225 (1983). When a state provides an adequate procedure for obtaining just compensation, a property owner cannot claim a violation of the federal provision until it has used the state procedure and been denied just compensation. Pasquotank Action Council, Inc. v. City of Va. Beach, 909 F. Supp. 376, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19119 (E.D. Va. 1995). Standing generally.  A plaintiff has standing to bring a declaratory judgment proceeding if he has a justiciable interest in the subject matter of the litigation, either in hi s own right or in a representative capacity. Cupp v. Board of Supvrs., 227 Va. 580, 318 S.E.2d 407, 1984 Va. LEXIS 228 (1984). Pleadings filed by the second of two landowners failed to assert a valid request for declaratory relief because, among other reasons, the pleadings did not seek p reventive relief, but effectively attempted to create a right of appeal that did not exist by statute; moreover, as a third party, the landowner lacked a right of appeal from the boards determination. Miller v. Highland County, 274 Va. 355, 650 S.E.2 d 532, 2007 Va. LEXIS 119 (2007). A justiciable controversy involves specific adverse claims based on present facts that are ripe for adjudication. Mosher Steel-Virginia v. Teig, 229 Va. 95, 327 S.E.2d 87, 1985 Va. LEXIS 178 (1985). A hypothetical or abstract interest is insufficient to confer standing to bring a declaratory judgment action. Mosher Steel-Virginia v. Teig, 229 Va. 95, 327 S.E.2d 87, 1985 Va. LEXIS 178 (1985). Where there is no administrative remedy equal to the relief sought, a complainant in a d eclaratory judgment proceeding, having no adequate legal remedy by judicial review, properly states a justiciable cause of action. Mosher Steel-Virginia v. Teig, 229 Va. 95, 327 S.E.2d 87, 1985 Va. LEXIS 178 (1985). Other remedies ava ilable.  Trial court did not have jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment under the Virginia Declaratory Judgment Act, § 8.01-184 et seq., since a mother had other remedies available to her in continuing to defend a same sex partners litigation seeking to register and enforce the Vermont custody orders; for the same reason, the mother could not obtain injunctive relief. Miller v. Jenkins, 54 Va. App. 282, 678 S.E.2d 268, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 291 (2009). The binding adjudications of right made under this section must resolve issues specifically pled in the petition for declaratory judgment, and the court is not empowered to make binding adjudications of right which are not specifically pled. Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Glick, 240 Va. 283, 397 S.E.2d 105, 1990 Va. LEXIS 112 (1990). Private rights of ac tion.  Circuit court properly dismissed the estates declaratory judgment complaints seeking to assert a private right of action against two nursing homes for the pro duction of documents because the estates claims could not be enforced where the governing statutes did not authorize a private right of action and the estates could not use the Declaratory Judgment Act as a platform for asserting non-existent private rights of action to enforce an administrative regulation promulgated by the Board of Health. Cherrie v. Va. Health Servs., 292 Va. 309, 787 S.E.2d 855, 2016 Va. LEXIS 106 (2016). Controversy held ripe for adjudication.  A justiciable controversy ripe for adjudication exists where plaintiff has brought an action for damages resulting from personal injuries and defendants insur er seeks a declaratory judgment as to obligation to pay if defendant is subsequently found liable for plaintiffs injuries and the circumstances give rise to a real probability that the insurer owed no coverage to the defendant. Reisen v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., 225 Va. 327, 302 S.E.2d 529, 1983 Va. LEXIS 225 (1983). Trial court properly determined that the objecting lot owners could bring a declaratory judgment action against the one lot owner who was interested in building a commercial office building on lots in their subdivision even though a restrictive covenant applicable to the lots required that the lots only be used for residential purposes, as an actual case or controversy existed because the evidence showed the one lot owner was ready to go ahead with his plans and the objecting lot owners did not want him to do so. River Heights Assocs. v. Batten, 267 Va. 262, 591 S.E.2d 683, 2004 Va. LEXIS 15 (2004). Standing of owner of options to buy land subject to zoning.  Where a developer owned options to buy real estate that was subject to piecemeal downzoning by the local government, the developer had standing to bring a declara tory judgment proceeding since it had a justiciable interest in the subject matter of the litigation and, further, the developers interest by virtue of the options was not hypothetical or abstract because, as an optionee, it had an exclusive, irrevoc able, binding contractual right to purchase the real estate according to the terms of the several option agreements. Board of Supvrs. v. Fralin &amp; Waldron, Inc., 222 Va. 218, 278 S.E.2d 859, 1981 Va. LEXIS 294 (1981). Unauthorized practice of law by title insurance company.  Whether a title insurance company is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law by its participation in real estate closings may be resolved by declaratory judg ment. Blodinger v. Broker's Title, Inc., 224 Va. 201, 294 S.E.2d 876, 1982 Va. LEXIS 282 (1982). The fact that unauthorized practice of law is a misdemeanor does not preclude declaratory relief to attorneys who sought determination as to whether a title insur ance companys activities constituted the unauthorized practice of law, where their goal was not solely to stop the illegal conduct of others, but to ensure that their own conduct conformed to the law and the tenets of the legal profession. Blodinger v. Broker's Title, Inc., 224 Va. 201, 294 S.E.2d 876, 1982 Va. LEXIS 282 (1982). Trial court incorrectly held that declaratory judgment was not available to construe provision of written lease to determine whether continued occupancy of certain premises would subject lessee to liability for continuing damages, and his employees and customers to criminal liability for trespass; lessee was entitled to declaratory judgme nt action given unavailability of any remedy by customary processes and liberal construction of § 8.01-191. Hop-In Food Stores, Inc. v. Serv-N-Save, Inc., 237 Va. 206, 375 S.E.2d 753, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1574, 1989 Va. LEXIS 17 (1989). Court not to render advisory opinions.  Enactment of the declaratory judgment statutes did not vest the courts with authority to render advisory opinions, decide moot questions, or answer merely specula tive inquiries. Reisen v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., 225 Va. 327, 302 S.E.2d 529, 1983 Va. LEXIS 225 (1983). Declarations concerning insurance coverage.  In a declaratory judgment action pursuant to § 8.01-184, the trial court properly determined that an insurance company was required to provide coverage to a su bcontractor; the insurance company failed to satisfy the standard set out in § 38.2-309, because an insurance agent had apparent authority to bind the company, and the agent did not rely on alleged misrepresentations in an application in deciding to b ind coverage. Montgomery Mut. Ins. Co. v. Riddle, 266 Va. 539, 587 S.E.2d 513, 2003 Va. LEXIS 104 (2003). Trial court properly entered a declaratory judgment holding that an insurer was not liable on a policy written for an employer and ordering that the employer retu rn the funds the insurer contributed to settle an employees underlying tort claim as the policy excluded claims arising out of and in the course of employment; the em...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-185"><akn:num>§ 8.01-185</akn:num><akn:heading>Venue</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The venue of actions seeking declarations of right with or without consequential relief shall be determined in accordance with provisions of Chapter 5 (§ 8.01-257 et seq.) of this title.

Former § 8-580 (Procedure) has been deleted as unnecessary. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Venue proper.  Because the circuit court had personal jurisdiction over relatives based upon their minimum contacts with Virginia, venue was properly laid in Virginia in a lawye rs declaratory judgment action under the Virginia Declaratory Judgment Act, § 8.01-184 et seq., seeking a declaratory judgment regarding his rights and responsibilities under powers of attorney; the relatives executed the powers of attorney in Vir ginia and returned to Virginia to meet again with the lawyer, and by voluntarily creating a continuing relationship with the lawyer, who maintained an office and performed work for the relatives in Virginia, the relatives purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities within the Commonwealth.

CASE NOTES The phrase further relief in this section does not authorize a court to award at torneys fees to a litigant. Russell County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Quinn, 259 Va. 139, 523 S.E.2d 492, 2000 Va. LEXIS 17 (2000). The provisions of the former version of this section clearly contemplate further action to enforce the rights determined by a declaratory judgment. Winborne v. Doyle, 190 Va. 867, 59 S.E.2d 90, 1950 Va. LEXIS 177 (1950) (decided under prior law). The relief contemplated and provided for by § 8.01-184 is not limited to a bare declaration of rights. In a proper case under that section and this section, su ch consequential, other, and additional relief as is justified by the pleadings, and by the private or public rights and interests involved, may be awarded. Dean v. Paolicelli, 194 Va. 219, 72 S.E.2d 506, 1952 Va. LEXIS 223 (1952) (decided under prior la w). Remedy not exclusive.  The remedy for enforcement of the rights determined by the declaratory judgment prescribed by this section is not exclusive. Such a proceeding is intended to supp lement rather than supersede ordinary causes of action. Winborne v. Doyle, 190 Va. 867, 59 S.E.2d 90, 1950 Va. LEXIS 177 (1950) (decided under prior law). Illustrative case.  For case as to the sufficiency of a bill for declaratory judgment and further relief where the plaintiff sought the cancellation or annulment of an easement, see First Nat'l Trust &amp; Sav. Bank v. Raphael, 201 Va. 718, 113 S.E.2d 683, 1960 Va. LEXIS 152 (1960) (decided under prior law). Members lacked standing.  Members had no standing to bring a declaratory judgment suit challenging a property development because, inter alia, no language in Hampton, Va., Charter §§ 3A-10 and 3A-11 provided or suggested a continuing role for a committee of petitioners beyond the petition process; when the city council agreed to repeal the ordinance, which negated the necessity of presenting the petition for repeal to the tr ial court, the committees authority to act ended and the committee had no ongoing justiciable right or interest that was aggrieved by the development property. Deerfield v. City of Hampton, 283 Va. 759, 724 S.E.2d 724, 2012 Va. LEXIS 91 (2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Easement dispute.  Owners plea in abatement as to plaintiffs claim of an easement over the owners property was denied because the courts refusal to resolve the dispu te would have given rise to uncertainty over what rights, if any, could have been asserted by the parties, and § 8.01-186 provided authority to the court to grant declaratory relief that was necessary or proper; declaratory relief was proper even if o ther legal redress was available to plaintiff.

The appointment of commissioners or condemnation jurors and all proceedings thereafter shall be governed b y the procedure prescribed for the condemning authority.

I.General Consideration. This section is a remedial statute. It disturbs no vested rights and creates no new obli gation. It merely supplies another remedy to enforce existing rights. See Stroobants v. Fugate, 209 Va. 275, 163 S.E.2d 192, 1968 Va. LEXIS 226 (1968); Chaffinch v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., 227 Va. 68, 313 S.E.2d 376, 1984 Va. LEXIS 269 (1984) (decided under prio r law). Statutory remedy does not preempt common-law remedies against a nonsovereign entity vest ed with the power of eminent domain unless the statute, expressly or by necessary implication, so provides. Chaffinch v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., 227 Va. 68, 313 S.E.2d 376, 1984 Va. LEXIS 269 (1984). When a state provides an adequate procedure, etc. When a state provides an adequate procedure for obtaining just compensation, a property owner cannot claim a violation of the federal provision until it has used the state procedure and been denied just compensation. Pasquotank Action Council, Inc. v. City of Va. Beach, 909 F. Supp. 376, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19119 (E.D. Va. 1995). In an action for damages following the demolition of a residential building, the property owners failure to exhaust administrative remedies barred any claim f or inverse condemnation under § 8.01-187 where during the 107 days that elapsed from receipt of the notice until demolition, the property owner made no inquiries about any appeal rights and took no actions to avail himself thereof. Lee v. City of Norf olk, 281 Va. 423, 706 S.E.2d 330, 2011 Va. LEXIS 55 (2011). Mandamus will not lie to compel the Highway Commissioner to institute condemnation proce edings in the proper court to ascertain what compensation is due petitioners for the damages that they allege have been done to their property by the acts of the respondent, since the cause of action asserted by the petitioners can be resolved in a decla ratory judgment proceeding in a lower court. Stroobants v. Fugate, 209 Va. 275, 163 S.E.2d 192, 1968 Va. LEXIS 226 (1968) (decided under prior law). Diminution in value not sufficient to establish taking.  In inverse condemnation actions, as property owners did not allege that the presence of a public utilitys transmission lines interfered with their ability to exercise any specific property right, but that the transmission lines rendered their land less valuable as residential property; they did not state a claim for a taking under Va. Const. art. I, § 11. Byler v. Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co., 284 Va. 501 , 731 S.E.2d 916, 2012 Va. LEXIS 167 (2012). Section applicable though not in force when cause of action arose.  While this section was not in force when petitioners cause of action arose, it became effective on June 28, 1968, and they are entitled to avail themselves of the procedure outlined therein. Stroobants v. Fugate, 209 Va. 275, 163 S.E.2d 192, 1968 Va. LEXIS 226 (1968) (decided under prior law). Relationship with other laws.  This section is not the exclusive remedy for claimants making an inverse condemnation claim against a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. The provisions of Va. Const., Art. I, § 11 are self-executing. The enactment of § 8.01-187 does not change that analysis or evidence an intent on the part of the General Assembly to limit the right to make the constitutional takings claim. Kitchen v. City of Newpor t News, 275 Va. 378, 657 S.E.2d 132, 2008 Va. LEXIS 38 (2008). Circuit court erred in holding that this section constituted an inverse condemnation and was claimants exclusive remedy against a municipal corporation where the provisions of Va. Const., Art. I, § 11 were self-executing and § 8.01-187 disturbed no vested rights and created no new obligation. Section 8.01-187 merely supplied another remedy to enforce existing rights. Kitchen v. City of Newport News, 275 Va. 378, 657 S.E.2d 132, 2008 Va. LEXIS 38 (2008). II.Sovereign Immunity. Waiver of sovereign immunity from inverse condemnation claims.  The just-compensation clause of Va. Const., Art. I, § 11, constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity from inverse condemnation claims, and this section creates a statutory mechanism for the enforcement of such claims. Chaffinch v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., 227 Va. 68, 313 S.E.2d 376, 1984 Va. LEXIS 269 (1984). Public service companies have never enjoyed immunity from liability for damaging private property, the power of eminent domain entrusted to them by § 56-464 confers none, and there is nothing in the language of this section or the annals of legislative history which reflects legislative intent to immunize them from actions at common law. Chaffinch v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., 227 Va. 68, 313 S.E.2d 376, 1984 Va. LEXIS 269 (1984). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Landowners entitled to proceeding to determine just compensation.  Landowners established damage under Va. Const., Art. I, § 11, and that, if not compensated, they were entitled to a proceeding under § 8.01-187 to determine just compensation as the property had suffered a significant increase in volume, frequency, and vibrations from noise due to aircraft flying directly overhead, there was no requirement that the damage be significant, and the exact amount of damages was not important as the landowners sought a declaratory judgment. Osipovs v. Chesapeake Airport Auth., 74 Va. Cir. 350, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 295 (Chesapeake Nov. 16, 2007). No right to jury trial existed.  Because a property owner lacked any right to a jury trial in its suit against the Commonwealth under the Just Compensation Clause, Va. Const., Art. I, § 11, th e action was to proceed on the Commonwealths terms, pursuant to the plain meaning of § 8.01-187. Moreover, the instant court lacked any power to effect a more expansive waiver of immunity than provided for by the Commonwealth itself. Catholic Dioc ese v. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r, 74 Va.

CASE NOTES Suit held pure bill for injunction.  A suit for declaratory judgment and injunction against threatened actions at law was really a pure bill for an injunction. It asked the chancellor to try a disput ed question of fact as a determinative issue, and to substitute a suit in equity for several actions at law, although it alleged that there was an absolute defense in each action, pleadable at law. A court of equity will not enjoin the prosecution of an action at law when the defendant can make a full and adequate defense in such action. A suit at law cannot be enjoined and the litigation transferred to the equity forum merely on the assertion of defenses that are pleadable at law. An action at law will not be enjoined except where a court of chancery may afford a more adequate and perfect remedy. Williams v. Southern Bank, 203 Va. 657, 125 S.E.2d 803, 1962 Va. LEXIS 202 (1962) (decided under prior law). Demurrer on ground that prayer for injunction violated section not good.  A bill for divorce, by a husband against his wife, asked for a construction of a separation contract between the husband and wife and a deed of trust executed in pursuance of the contract, and also asked for an injunction against the enforcement of the contract and the deed of trust. The wife demurred on the ground that the prayer for the injunction was in violation of the former version of this section, which pr ovides that the pendency of an action or suit to obtain a declaration of rights or a determination of a question of construction should not be sufficient grounds for the granting of an injunction. It was held that this was not a good ground of demurrer. Gloth v. Gloth, 154 Va. 511, 153 S.E. 879, 1930 Va. LEXIS 232 (1930) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Attorneys fees.  Where there was no contractual provision or statutory authority to the contrary and there was no bad faith, the neighbors request for attorneys fees as th e prevailing party in an action for injunctive relief was denied.

Southland Corp., 224 Va. 514, 297 S.E.2d 718, 1982 Va. LEXIS 323 (1982). Trial court incorrectly held that declaratory judgment was not available to construe provision of written lease to determine whether continued occupancy of certain premises would subject lessee to liability for continuing damages, and his employees and customers to criminal liability for trespass; lessee was entitled to declaratory judgme nt action given unavailability of any remedy by customary processes and liberal construction of this section. Hop-In Food Stores, Inc. v. Serv-N-Save, Inc., 237 Va. 206, 375 S.E.2d 753, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1574, 1989 Va. LEXIS 17 (1989). Applicability to reconciliation process.  Circuit court did not err when it sustained the demurrer as to appellants declaratory judgment action under Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-191 related to the reconci liation process; under no set of facts could appellant have petitioned the circuit court for declaratory judgment regarding the scope of the reconciliation provisions of the agreement after the final reconciliation occurred. Temple Found., Inc. v. Focus SH Acquisitions, LLC, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2023). No justiciable controversy existed where parties not named as defendants.  In an action for declaratory judgment by a motorist against her automobile insurer and the automobile insurer for owner of another automobile involved in an accid ent, no justiciable controversy existed because the motorist did not name the owner and driver of the other automobile as defendants. Erie Ins. Group v. Hughes, 240 Va. 165, 393 S.E.2d 210, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2698, 1990 Va. LEXIS 96 (1990). Declaratory judgment proper for review of dispute between county and town. Declaratory j udgment under § 8.01-191 was the proper vehicle for review of a dispute between a town and a county over the respective authority under a joint comprehensive master plan created pursuant to § 15.2-2231; the planning process, as distinct from the zo ning process, was joint under §§ 15.2-2232 and 15.2-2223. Bd. of Supervisors v. Town of Purcellville, 276 Va. 419, 666 S.E.2d 512, 2008 Va. LEXIS 100 (2008). Award of attorneys fees not authorized.  Although the plain language in this section requires that the courts interpret and administer the Declaratory Judgment Act with a view to making the courts more s erviceable to the people, this does not authorize a court to make an award of attorneys fees. Russell County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Quinn, 259 Va. 139, 523 S.E.2d 492, 2000 Va. LEXIS 17 (2000). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this section and this article, as used below, refer to former provisions. Intent of this article is not to give parties greater rights than those which they previ ously possessed, but to permit the declaration of those rights before they mature. Fairfield Dev. Corp. v. City of Virginia Beach, 211 Va. 715, 180 S.E.2d 533, 1971 Va. LEXIS 249 (1971). The intent of this article is to have courts render declaratory judgments which may guide parties in their future conduct in relation to each other, thereby relie ving them from the risk of taking undirected action incident to their rights, which action, without direction, would jeopardize their interests. This is with a view rather to avoid litigation than in aid of it. Fairfield Dev. Corp. v. City of Virginia Be ach, 211 Va. 715, 180 S.E.2d 533, 1971 Va. LEXIS 249 (1971). This article is remedial and is to be liberally construed and administered. Criterion In s. Co. v. Grange Mut. Cas. Co., 210 Va. 446, 171 S.E.2d 669, 1970 Va. LEXIS 142 (1970). The construction of this article, while liberal, must be reasonable and confined within definite limits. Declaratory judgments are not to be used as instruments of procedural fencing, either to secure delay or to choose a forum. Williams v. Southern Bank, 203 Va. 657, 125 S.E.2d 803, 1962 Va. LEXIS 202 (1962). The declaratory judgment acts do not create or change any substantive rights, or bring into being or modify any relationships, or alter the character of controver sies, which are the subject of judicial power. Their construction, while liberal, must be reasonable and confined within definite limits. They are not to be used as instruments of procedural fencing, either to secure delay or to choose a forum. Liberty M ut. Ins. Co. v. Bishop, 211 Va. 414, 177 S.E.2d 519, 1970 Va. LEXIS 263 (1970). Power to make declaratory judgment is discretionary.  While the courts have, in obedience to this section, given a liberal interpretation to the Declaratory Judgment Act, they have nevertheless recognized that the po wer to make a declaratory judgment is a discretionary one and must be exercised with care and caution. Fairfield Dev. Corp. v. City of Virginia Beach, 211 Va. 715, 180 S.E.2d 533, 1971 Va. LEXIS 249 (1971). And it will not be exercised where some other mode of proceeding is provided. Hence, whe re the petitioners, in essence, were seeking a money judgment for a sum certain, and the court had nothing to determine that would guide the parties in their future conduct in relation to each other, but each petitioner had paid the fee, and the only iss ue to be determined was whether it was entitled to have the fees refunded, their remedy was by motion for judgment and not by petition for declaratory judgment. Fairfield Dev. Corp. v. City of Virginia Beach, 211 Va. 715, 180 S.E.2d 533, 1971 Va. LEXIS 2 49 (1971). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Standing to challenge ordinance.  Since the Declaratory Judgments Act is to be liberally interpreted, residential landlords action seeking to have towns ordinance declared invalid was not barred on the ground that the terms of the ordinance had not been applied to them as they had a direct interest in the application of the ordinance because it affected their rental properties. Logie v. Town of Front Royal, 58 Va. Cir. 527, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 174 (Warren County June 19, 2002). Standing of county board of superv isors.  County board of supervisors had standing to challenge the actions of a county board of zoning appeals (BZA) through declaratory relief because it had aggrieve d party status by virtue of the action decided against it, and declaratory relief would determine the lawfulness of the process the BZA used; no other mode of procedure was available to the board of supervisors to challenge directly and reach the cou rse of the BZA procedure employed and the question of its claimed authority to reconsider its decisions. Bd. of Supervisors v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 23 (Fairfax County Feb. 13, 2018). Alleged procedural transgressions in the decision-making process of the board of zoning appeals may be challenged by declaratory judgment action by any aggrieved party as a justiciable claim when they underlie, but are not identical to, the merits decision separately appealed, for each adjudicative process addresses distinct claims for relief not directly overlapping in the resulting judgment thereof. Bd. of Supe rvisors v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 23 (Fairfax County Feb. 13, 2018). Neither the aggrieved party standard nor the justiciable interest standard is broader nor narrower than the other, and thus the board of superviso rs can qualify as an aggrieved person and may have standing in a declaratory judgment action; however, although the board may have standing, it does not automatically have standing, and the test to be applied to whether the board of supervisors h as standing to pray for declaratory relief against the board of zoning appeals is fact-dependent. Bd. of Supervisors v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 23 (Fairfax County Feb. 13, 2018). First, there must be an actual controversy to which the board of supervisors is a party, and the court is not empowered to render merely advisory opinions; second , declaratory relief can only be exercised if it will relieve the board from the risk of the board of zoning appeals taking undirected action that would jeopardize the lawful and legitimate interests of the board. Bd. of Supervisors v. Bd. of Zoning Appe als, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 23 (Fairfax County Feb. 13, 2018). Liberal interpretation.  A tenants motion for a demurrer pursuant to § 8.01-273 as to a landlords declaratory judgment action pursuant to § 8.01-184 was denied, because § 8.01-191 stated that the declaratory judgment statute was remedial in nature and had to be liberally interpreted, and the declaratory judgment statute permitted a party like the landlord to seek the courts guidance on a landlord/tenant relationship, the pleadings stated a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, and the claims of each party were adverse to the other and were ripe for adjudication.

Section 8.01-19 2 permits such a claim to be brought in an appropriate circuit court. The sentence beginning with and when a person has any other claim. . . in former § 8-752 has been deleted.

Decisions Under Prior Law. A. General Consideration. B. Actions Based Upon Exercise of Eminent Domain Power. I.Decisions Under Current Law. There is no reason to vitiate the right of the state not to be subject to suit in her own courts by a broad and unwarranted interpretation of the legislative intent behind the limited waiver of sovereign immunity in this section. Commonwealth v. Luzik, 259 Va. 198, 524 S.E.2d 871, 2000 Va. LEXIS 21 (2000). For discussion of doctrine of sovereign immunity, see Hinchey v. Ogden, 226 Va. 234, 307 S.E.2d 891, 1983 Va. LEXIS 311 (1983). Immunity from suit in federal court.  The Commonwealth, never having waived her immunity under U.S. Const., Amend. XI, is not amenable to a suit for damages in federal court, even when the basis for s uch suit is a claimed violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Only officials of the Commonwealth may be enjoined from acts that violate the Constitution. Croatan Books, Inc. v. Virginia, 574 F. Supp. 880, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11993 (E.D. Va. 1983), dismissed, 583 F. Supp. 857, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18236 (E.D. Va. 1984). Eleventh Amendment immunity not waived.  Virginia has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity. This section, which generally governs recovery of claims against the State, waives sovereign immunity in actions brought in Virginia courts. But it does not express the clear legislative intent necessary to constitute a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity. McConnell v. Adams, 829 F.2d 1319, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 13009 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S . 1006, 108 S. Ct. 1731, 100 L. Ed. 2d 195, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2254 (1988). Nothing in Virginia cases interpreting this section suggests that it should be applied in circumstances other than in claims properly instituted under this sectio n and the scheme provided for pursuing such claims in §§ 8.01-193 to 8.01-195. Commonwealth v. Luzik, 259 Va. 198, 524 S.E.2d 871, 2000 Va. LEXIS 21 (2000). Even if employees claim for back wages was subject to sovereign immunity under this section, complainants suit would still not satisfy the requirements fo r seeking payment of a contract debt from the state as prescribed by this section, where the suit was not brought in the style of a contract claim or in the manner prescribed for such claims by the statutory scheme. Commonwealth v. Luzik, 259 Va. 198, 52 4 S.E.2d 871, 2000 Va. LEXIS 21 (2000). Waiver of immunity in state court does not necessarily operate as a consent to be sued in federal court. Jacobs v. College of William &amp; Mary, 495 F. Supp. 183, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12611 (E.D. Va. 1980), aff'd, 661 F.2d 922 (4th Cir. 1981). Clear legislative intent to waive immunity in federal courts not e xpressed in section.  In order for a waiver of sovereign immunity to be found effective as to actions brought in a federal court, as well as to actions brought in the states own co urts, a clear legislative intent to that effect must be found. A clear legislative intent has not been expressed to extend the provisions of this section, effectively waiving the bar of sovereign immunity, to actions brought in federal court. Jac obs v. College of William &amp; Mary, 495 F. Supp. 183, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12611 (E.D. Va. 1980), aff'd, 661 F.2d 922 (4th Cir. 1981). Immunity from suit for unlawful application of former § 13.1-93.  In deciding whether a state has waived its constitutional protection under U.S. Const., Amend. XI, waiver will be found only where stated by the most express lang uage or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction. Because there has been no such clear manifestation, indeed, because there has been no manifestation at all, of intent to waive this immun ity on the part of the Commonwealth, her immunity prevents her being haled into federal court to answer a claim it conspired to shut down a business by unlawfully applying former § 13.1-93 to revoke its corporate charter. Croatan Books, Inc. v. Virgin ia, 574 F. Supp. 880, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11993 (E.D. Va. 1983), dismissed, 583 F. Supp. 857, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18236 (E.D. Va. 1984). Sovereign immunity has no application to valid contract actions.  The doctrine of sovereign immunity has no application in actions based upon valid contracts entered into by duly authorized agents of the government. The sovereig n is as liable for its contractual debt as any citizen would be, and that liability may be enforced by suit in the appropriate circuit court if proper and timely proceedings are taken. Wiecking v. Allied Medical Supply Corp., 239 Va. 548, 391 S.E .2d 258, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2107, 1990 Va. LEXIS 65 (1990), limited, Commonwealth v. Allstate Bonding Co., 246 Va. 189, 435 S.E.2d 396, 10 Va. Law Rep. 230, 1993 Va. LEXIS 110 (1993). But the contractual relationship must be direct.  While contract suits against the Commonwealth were permitted to a limited extent, a direct contractual relationship was contemplated; thus, the trial court did no t err in denying the suretys motions for judgment against the state transportation department, which the surety filed in an attempt to collect on work it performed after it took over work for the original contracting party after that party defaulted on the underlying construction projects, as the surety did not have a direct contractual relationship with the state transportation department and the surety could not show any Virginia law which waived the Commonwealths sovereign immunity regarding the suretys equitable subrogation claim. XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 424, 624 S.E.2d 658, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (2006). Injunctive relief as to future conduct of state officials.  The States Eleventh Amendment immunity does not protect it from suits for injunctive relief governing its officials future conduct. McConnell v. Adams, 82 9 F.2d 1319, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 13009 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 1731, 100 L. Ed. 2d 195, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2254 (1988). Cons truction with other laws.  The procurement act [see now § 2.2-4300 et seq.], is a specific statute relating to the acquisition of services by public bodies and prevails over the more gen eral statutes relating to the presentation of pecuniary claims against the commonwealth, such as those found in this section and former § 2.1-223.1 [see now subsection A of § 2.2-814]. Dr. William E.S. Flory Small Bus. Dev. Ctr., Inc. v. Commonweal th, 261 Va. 230, 541 S.E.2d 915, 2001 Va. LEXIS 39 (2001). Plaintiff employee could not state a claim for wrongful termination or breach of contract because he never presented his pecuniary claim to the president of Unive rsity of Virginia (the president was the head of the institution of the Commonwealth responsible for the alleged act giving rise to the employees claim), as required by § 2.2-814.

It was held that, though the order dismissi ng the petition against the state may have been unnecessary, yet as it did not affect the petitioners right or remedy, it was not reversible error.

Ogden, 226 Va. 234, 307 S.E.2d 891, 1983 Va. LEXIS 311 (1983). Article essentially waives states sovereign immunity to the extent of $25,000 per cl aim. Al-Mustafa Irshad v. Spann, 543 F. Supp. 922, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13674 (E.D. Va. 1982). But not the sovereign immunity of the Commonwealths agencies.  Because the Virginia Tort Claims Act, § 8.01-195.1 et seq., provided a waiver only of the Commonwealths sovereign immunity but did not disturb the sovereig n immunity of the Commonwealths agencies, plaintiff employees tortious interference claim was dismissed as to defendant university, which was an agency of the Commonwealth. Cominelli v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 589 F. Supp. 2d 706, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99428 (W.D. Va. 2008), aff'd, 362 Fed. Appx. 359, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 1562 (4th Cir. 2010). Doctrine of sovereign immunity has largely disappeared for tort claims accruing on or after July 1, 1982, since on that date, this article went into effect. Al-Mustafa Irshad v. Spann, 543 F. Supp. 922, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13674 (E.D. Va. 1982). Doctrine of sovereign immunity is alive and well in Virginia. Though the Supreme Court has, over the years, discussed the doctrine in a variety of contexts and refined it for application to constantly shifting facts and circumstances, it has never seen fit to abolish it. Nor does the General Assembly want the doctrine abolished. Mes sina v. Burden, 228 Va. 301, 321 S.E.2d 657, 1984 Va. LEXIS 203 (1984). Not a waiver of im munity under Eleventh Amendment.  This section waives sovereign immunity in some cases for tort liability provided the suit is filed in state court. Such waiver may not properly be construed as a waiver of immunity under the U.S. Const., Amend. XI to the same or similar suits in federal court. Reynolds v. Sheriff, City of Richmond, 574 F. Supp. 90, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12351 (E.D. Va. 1983). The Virginia Tort Claims Act, while generally waiving sovereign immunity for tort claims filed in state courts, does not waive the states Eleventh Amendment i mmunity. McConnell v. Adams, 829 F.2d 1319, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 13009 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 1731, 100 L. Ed. 2d 195, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2254 (1988). District courts ability to take jurisdiction over a Virginia Tort Claims Act (VTCA), § 8.01-195.1 et seq., claim is doubtful because the Virginia legislatu re has expressly limited the jurisdiction over VTCA claims to Virginia state courts; it is unclear whether 28 U.S.C.S. § 1367, which allows for supplemental jurisdiction, overcomes the sovereign immunity bar to hearing a claim that the Commonwealth ha s only allowed state courts to hear. Creed v. Virginia, 596 F. Supp. 2d 930, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1769 (E.D. Va. 2009). Removal from district court.  Whether removal was proper turned on whether the Commonwealth should be considered merely a nominal or formal party, or, instead, a real party in interest whose f ailure to join the petition for removal required the court to remand the case and a reasonable basis existed for predicting that the Commonwealth could be liable. Whether the Commonwealth could be liable for the actions of the detention centers emplo yees under the Virginia Tort Claims Act (VTCA), § 8.01-195.1 et seq., depended on the construction of a statute that committed all causes of action brought under it exclusively to the Virginia courts and any decision rendered by the instant court on t he breadth of the VTCA necessarily intruded on the Commonwealths interest in defining the scope of its waiver of sovereign immunity. Creed v. Virginia, 596 F. Supp. 2d 930, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1769 (E.D. Va. 2009). Inju nctive relief as to future conduct of state officials.  The states Eleventh Amendment immunity does not protect it from suits for injunctive relief governing its officials future conduct. McConnell v. Adams, 82 9 F.2d 1319, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 13009 (4th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1006, 108 S. Ct. 1731, 100 L. Ed. 2d 195, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2254 (1988). Postdeprivation remedy to pris on inmates.  This article clearly provides a meaningful postdeprivation remedy to prison inmates for tort claims of $25,000 or less accruing after July 1, 1982. Al-Mustafa Irs had v. Spann, 543 F. Supp. 922, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13674 (E.D. Va. 1982). Act provides remedy to prison inmate not given credit for time in jail in another state.  A former inmate in Virginias prison system could not bring action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for compensatory and punitive damages for having been held seven d ays longer than he would have been if he had been given credit for seven days spent in a jail in Florida, before Virginia authorities obtained custody of him, because the Tort Claims Act provided adequate tort remedies for post-deprivation compensation. Wadhams v. Procunier, 772 F.2d 75, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 21718 (4th Cir. 1985), disapproved, Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 110 S. Ct. 975, 108 L. Ed. 2d 100, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 1171 (1990). Assault on inmate by prison guard.  The Tort Claims Act provided an adequate remedy where a prison guard allegedly assaulted an inmate. Accordingly, plaintiff stated no procedural due process claim. Perry v. Walker, 586 F. Supp. 1264, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17094 (E.D. Va. 1984). Negligent injury of inmate not deprivation of liberty.  An inmate at the city jail in Richmond who was injured when he slipped on a pillow negligently left on the stairs by respondent, a correctional deputy stationed a t the jail, was not deprived of his liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment in freedom from bodily injury. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is simply not implicated by a negligent act of an official causing unint ended loss of or injury to life, liberty or property. Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 106 S. Ct. 662, 88 L. Ed. 2d 662, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 43 (1986) (decision as to action accruing before effective date of this article). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Police officer responding to a call.  Sovereign immunity applies to a police officer involved in an automobile accident that occurs after the official call to which the officer was responding had been cancelled but before the officer was aware of the cancellation.

Any person desiring to change his own name, or that of his child or ward, may apply therefor to the circuit court of the county or city in which the person whose name is to be changed resides, or if no place of abode exists, such person may apply to any circuit cou rt which shall consider such application if it finds that good cause exists therefor under the circumstances alleged. An incarcerated person may apply to the circuit court of the county or city in which such person is incarcerated. In case of a minor who has no living parent or guardian, the application may be made by his next friend. In case of a minor who has both parents living, the parent who does not join in the application shall be served with reasonable notice of the application pursuant to § 8.01-296 and, should such parent object to the change of name, a hearing shall be held to determine whether the change of name is in the best interest of the minor. It shall not be necessary to effect service upon any parent who files an answer to the ap plication. If, after application is made on behalf of a minor and an ex parte hearing is held thereon, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that such notice would present a serious threat to the health and safety of the applicant, the court m ay waive such notice. B. Every appli cation shall be under oath and shall include the place of residence of the applicant, the names of both parents, including the maiden name of his mother, the date and place of birth of the applicant, the applicants felony conviction record, if any, w hether the applicant is a person for whom registration with the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry is required pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 9.1-900 et seq.) of Title 9.1, whether the applicant is presently incarcerated or a probationer with a ny court, and if the applicant has previously changed his name, his former name or names. C. On any such application and hearing, if such be demanded, the court, shall, unless the evidence shows that the change of name is sought for a fraudulent purpose or would otherwise infringe upon the rights of others or, in a case involving a minor, that the change o f name is not in the best interest of the minor, order a change of name. D. No applicat ion shall be accepted by a court for a change of name of a probationer, person for whom registration with the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry is required pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 9.1-900 et seq.) of Title 9.1, or incarcerated person un less the court finds that good cause exists for consideration of such application under the reasons alleged in the application for the requested change of name. If the court accepts the application, the court shall mail or deliver a copy of the applicati on to the attorney for the Commonwealth for the jurisdiction where the application was filed and the attorney for the Commonwealth for any jurisdiction in the Commonwealth where a conviction occurred that resulted in the applicants probation, registr ation with the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 9.1-900 et seq.) of Title 9.1, or incarceration. The attorney for the Commonwealth where the application was filed shall be entitled to respond and represent the i nterests of the Commonwealth by filing a response within 30 days after the mailing or delivery of a copy of the application. The court shall conduct a hearing on the application and may order a change of name if, after receiving and considering evidence concerning the circumstances regarding the requested change of name, the court determines that the change of name (i) would not frustrate a legitimate law-enforcement purpose, (ii) is not sought for a fraudulent purpose, and (iii) would not otherwise inf ringe upon the rights of others. Such order shall contain written findings stating the courts basis for granting the order. E. The provisi ons of subsection D are jurisdictional and any order granting a change of name pursuant to subsection D that fails to comply with any provision of subsection D is void ab initio. The attorney for the Commonwealth for the jurisdiction where such an applic ation was filed has the authority to bring an independent action at any time to have such order declared void. If the attorney for the Commonwealth brings an independent action to have the order declared void, notice of the action shall be served upon th e person who was granted a change of name who shall have 30 days after service to respond. If the person whose name was changed files a response objecting to having the order declared void, the court shall hold a hearing. If an order granting a change of name is declared void pursuant to this subsection, or if a person is convicted of perjury pursuant to § 18.2-434 for unlawfully changing his name pursuant to § 18.2-504.1 based on conduct that violates this section, the clerk of the court entering the order or the order of conviction shall transmit a certified copy of the order to (i) the State Registrar of Vital Records, (ii) the Department of Motor Vehicles, (iii) the State Board of Elections, (iv) the Central Criminal Records Exchange, and (v) any agency or department of the Commonwealth that has issued a license to the person where such license utilizes the persons changed name, if known to the court and identified in the court order. F. The order s hall contain no identifying information other than the applicants former name or names, new name, and current address. The clerk of the court shall spread the order upon the current deed book in his office, index it in both the old and new names, and transmit a certified copy of the order and the application to the State Registrar of Vital Records and the Central Criminal Records Exchange. Transmittal of a copy of the order and the application to the State Registrar of Vital Records and the Central Criminal Records Exchange shall not be required of a person who changed his or her former name by reason of marriage and who makes application to resume a former name pursuant to § 20-121.4. G. If the appl icant shall show cause to believe that in the event his change of name should become a public record, a serious threat to the health or safety of the applicant or his immediate family would exist, the chief judge of the circuit court may waive the requir ement that the application be under oath or the court may order the record sealed and direct the clerk not to spread and index any orders entered in the cause, and a certified copy shall not be transmitted to the State Registrar of Vital Records or the C entral Criminal Records Exchange. At such time as a name change order is received by the State Registrar of Vital Records, for a person born in the Commonwealth, together with a proper request and payment of required fees, the Registrar shall issue certi fications of the amended birth record which do not reveal the former name or names of the applicant unless so ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Such certifications shall not be marked amended and show the effective date as provided in § 32.1-272. Such order shall set forth the date and place of birth of the person whose name is changed, the full names of his parents, including the maiden name of the mother and, if such person has previously changed his name, his former name or nam es.

Seduction, § 2. CASE NOTES Ac tion for alienation of affection of son brought by father.  For case assuming, for purposes of the case, that an action for alienation of the affection of a son brought by a father has been abrogated by the statute, or nev er existed in the first place, see Raftery v. Scott, 756 F.2d 335, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 31592 (4th Cir. 1985). As to distinctions between intentional infliction of emotional distress and alienation of affection, see Raftery v. Scott, 756 F.2d 335, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 31592 (4th Cir. 1985). Detinue actions not barred.  Heart balm statute does not bar an action in detinue for recovery of an engagement ring following the breakoff of the engagement; the statute bars three specific civil actions: alienation of affection, breach of promise to marry, and criminal conversation, but the statute says nothing about the law of conditional gifts, and an action for recovery of property exchanged in contemplation of marriage is still determi ned by existing law and common-law principle. McGrath v. Dockendorf, 292 Va. 834, 793 S.E.2d 336, 2016 Va. LEXIS 187 (2016). Appellee gave appellant a gift of a ring, which was a conditional gift, and when the condition upon which the gift was made did not occur, appellee could institut e an action in detinue to recover the ring or its value; the trial court did not err in finding that the statute did not bar the action and in ordering either a return of the ring or the entry judgment for the amount of the ring. McGrath v. Dockendorf, 2 92 Va. 834, 793 S.E.2d 336, 2016 Va. LEXIS 187 (2016). Tortious interference with parental rights.  General Assemblys statutory abolition of the cause of action for alienation of affection pursuant to § 8.01-220 did not preclude a recognition of a cause o f action for tortious interference with parental rights, as they were distinct causes of action with separate elements. Wyatt v. McDermott, 283 Va. 685, 725 S.E.2d 555, 2012 Va. LEXIS 92 (2012). Action for breach of social workers professional standard of care.  Because a husband alleged facts constituting breaches of a social workers professional standard of care in addition to ones alleging alienation of affection, the malpractice claims were not barred by § 8.01-220; therefore, it was error to dismiss the entire case by sustaining the social workers demurrer. Doe v. Zwelling, 270 Va. 594, 620 S.E.2d 750, 2005 Va. LEXIS 90 (2005). Name assigned to conduct not dis positive.  When the general assembly enacted this section, it manifested its intent to abolish common law actions seeking damages for a particular type of conduct, regardles s of the name that a plaintiff assigns to that conduct. McDermott v. Reynolds, 260 Va. 98, 530 S.E.2d 902, 2000 Va. LEXIS 90 (2000). Emotional distre ss claim based on adultery barred.  Where the essential basis of the plaintiffs claim was that the defendant had an adulterous relationship with the plaintiffs wife, which he continued in an open and notorious manner after being confronted by the plaintiff, this alleged conduct was precisely the type of conduct that the general assembly intended to exclude from civil liability when it enacted this section and the fact that the plaintiff lab eled his claim as intentional infliction of emotional distress and recited the elements of that tort in support of his action did not shield the action from the statutory bar. McDermott v. Reynolds, 260 Va. 98, 530 S.E.2d 902, 2000 Va. LEXIS 90 (2000). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Wi ll contest based on alleged marriage promise to decedent.  Even assuming the executor made a fraudulent marriage promise to the decedent, who changed her will in his favor, this could not be a basis for undue influence, a s Virginia did not allow recovery for breach of promises to marry. Pierce v. Anderson, 63 Va. Cir. 207, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 203 (Fairfax County Oct. 6, 2003). Name assigned to conduct not dis positive.  Even though plaintiffs pleadings used language relating to conditional gifts, his action for the return of a car given to defendant based on a promise to marr y was invalid in substance because lawsuits based on a breach of a promise to marry were prohibited. Holmburg v. Ferrell, 69 Va. Cir. 348, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 359 (Salem Dec. 5, 2005). Action for return of engagement ring.  When a fiance sued his former fiancee for return of an engagement ring he gave her, or its value, his action was barred by § 8.01-220 because he sought damages incurred from a breach of a promise to marry, and actions for breach of promise to marry were abrogated by § 8.01-220. Georgalas v. Kilgore, 73 Va. Cir. 34, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 292 (Newport News Dec. 22, 2006). When a fiance claimed that his suit against his former fiancee for return of the engagement ring he gave her, or its value, was not barred by § 8.01-220 becaus e he merely sought to enforce the return of a conditional gift when the condition was not met, but § 8.01-220 barred his claim because the basis for the condition of the conditional gift was void as against public policy. Georgalas v. Kilgore, 73 Va. Cir. 34, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 292 (Newport News Dec. 22, 2006). Action for fraud failed.  Plaintiffs claims of actual and constructive fraud failed because allegations that plaintiff had conveyed a joint interest in real property to defendant based upon his promise to marry her and that she executed a deed of trust lien against the jointly owned real estate based upon defendants representation that he was single, that he intended to marry plaintiff, that he was in love with plaintiff and that he was financially solvent, were nothing more than allegations of breach of a contract to marry, which was no longer a valid cause of action. Whalen v. Rutherford, 86 Va. Cir. 560, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 277 (Nelson County Nov. 16, 2011). This secti on did not bar a husbands defamation action.  Even though husband sought damages for injury done to his marriage, where he alleged that a pastor made defamatory remarks about the husband to his wife, he suffi ciently alleged facts to state a cause of action for defamation per se that was not barred by § 8.01-220. The tort of defamation was intended to protect an individuals uninterrupted entitlement to enjoyment of his reputation, and the husband had a lleged an injury to his reputation. Cuthrell v. McKeller, 73 Va. Cir. 386, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 205 (Norfolk June 28, 2007). § 8.01-220.1. Defense of interspousal immunity abolished as to certain causes of action arising on or after July 1, 1981. Text The common-law defense of interspousal immunity in tort is abolished and shall not constitute a valid defense to any such cause of action arising on or after July 1, 19 81.

See Byrd v. Byrd, 657 F.2d 615, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 18233 (4th Cir. 1981). § 8.01-220.1:1. Civil immunity for officers, partners, members, managers, trustees and directors of certain tax exempt organizations. Text A. Directors, partners, members, managers, trustees and officers of organizations exempt from income taxation under § 501(c) or § 528 of the Internal Revenue Code who serve without compensation shall be immune from civil liability for acts taken in their capacit ies as officers, partners, members, managers, trustees or directors of such organizations.

Section confers no new right of action.  This section merely preserves any right of action the injured person may have, and does not give him any new right of action. Ward v. Connor, 495 F. Supp. 434, 19 80 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14966 (E.D. Va. 1980), rev'd, 657 F.2d 45, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 18613 (4th Cir. 1981). This section creates no new right of action for damages for violation of some other criminal or penalty statute; no civil right of action exists unless such other statute by its terms so provides, or unless proof of the same facts that establish violation of such other statute also constitutes proof of an otherwise existing civil action for damages independent of the criminal statute. Vansant &amp; Gusler, Inc. v. Wa shington, 245 Va. 356, 429 S.E.2d 31, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1177, 1993 Va. LEXIS 72 (1993). This section permits damages for those injured by a violation of the Virginia Code. However, this section does not create a new right of action where none existed . Instead, it prevents a wrongdoer from avoiding civil liability based on the theory that he has paid his penalty under a penal statute. Pettengill v. United States, 867 F. Supp. 380, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16068 (E.D. Va. 1994). Plaintiff car dealerships former owners claim under § 8.01-221 against defendants, a car manufacturer and its financing division, failed to state a cla im as § 8.01-221 did not create a separate private action for the alleged Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act claims predicate acts, and while § 59.1-68.3 provided private actions for false advertising under §§ 18.2-216 and 18.2-217, there were no allegations on the nature of such advertising, and an executives alleged false credentials in a resume was insufficient. Field v. GMAC LLC, 660 F. Supp. 2d 679, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110164 (E.D. Va. 2008), aff'd, 328 Fed. Ap px. 873, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 16460 (4th Cir. 2009). Although this section does not create any new rights of action but instead preserves any existing right of action that an injured person may have against a wrongdoer who has previously been the subject of statutory penalties for his misconduct, it is consistent with the idea that the provision for a statutory penalty does not foreclose a pe rsons right to recover damages for the same statutory violation unless the statute so provides. Morgan v. American Family Life Assurance Co., 559 F. Supp. 477, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18523 (W.D. Va. 1983), disapproved, A &amp; E Supply Co. v. Nationwide M ut. Fire Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 669, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 28177 (4th Cir. 1986). Disclosure of confidential medical information.  In a case in which plaintiff claimed that defendants, a healthcare corporation and two of its employees, had disclosed her confidential medical information to oth ers, the Supreme Court disagreed with plaintiff regarding the corporations direct liability under Fairfax Hospital v. Curtis and under the doctrine of negligence per se. Adhering to its settled precedent interpreting § 8.01-221, the Supreme Court declined plaintiffs invitation to reinterpret it as a legislative directive to transform alleged federal HIPAA violations into a state-law, negligence per se claim. Parker v. Carilion Clinic, 2018 Va. LEXIS 211 (Va. Nov. 1, 2018). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Purpose.  It is very evident that the purpose of this section was merely to preserve to an injured person the right to maintain his action for the injury he may have receiv ed by reason of the wrongdoing of another, and to prevent the wrongdoer from setting up the defense that he had paid the penalty of his wrongdoing under a penal statute. It cannot be supposed that in enacting this section the legislature had the remotest idea of creating any new ground for bringing an action for damages. Tyler v. Western Union Tel. Co., 54 F. 634, 1893 U.S. App. LEXIS 2498 (C.C.D. Va. 1893) see also Connolly v. Western Union Tel. Co., 100 Va. 51, 40 S.E. 618, 1902 Va. LEXIS 1 (1902); Ho rtenstein v. Virginia-Carolina Ry., 102 Va. 914, 47 S.E. 996, 1904 Va. LEXIS 55 (1904). Confers no new right of action.  This section merely preserves any right of action the injured person may have, and does not give him any new right of action. Tyler v. Western Union Tel. Co., 54 F. 634, 1893 U.S. App. LEXIS 2498 (C.C.D. Va. 1893). This section confers no new or enlarged right upon a party injured as a result of the violation of a statute. A party suing for an injury arising from an act of a defendant, in violation of a statute, claiming damages, and not merely the penalty prescribed in the act, must allege and prove the same facts he would have to allege and prove if the act of negligence complained of was not in violation of a statute. Ho rtenstein v. Virginia-Carolina Ry., 102 Va. 914, 47 S.E. 996, 1904 Va. LEXIS 55 (1904). Applies to any violation of statutory duty.  This section seems, in terms, to provide for the measure of damages in any case in which there shall be an injury resulting from the violation of any statute in t his State. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Reynolds Bros., 77 Va. 173, 1883 Va. LEXIS 47 (1883). But proximate cause must also be established.  While one who violates a statute or an ordinance may be regarded as a wrongdoer, and the act regarded as negligence, still it may or may not be the proximate caus e of the injury complained of according to the facts of the particular case. The element of proximate cause must be established, and it will not necessarily be presumed from the fact that an ordinance or statute has been violated. Wyatt v. C &amp; P Tel. Co. , 158 Va. 470, 163 S.E. 370, 1932 Va. LEXIS 269 (1932). Common-law duty of landlords not enlarged.  In an action against landlords to recover for injuries sustained by a tenants invitee when some steps at the entrance of defendants building tilted over a nd caused him to fall, where it was contended that the steps were being maintained in violation of local ordinances, it was held that neither the ordinances nor this section enlarged the common-law duty of the landlords to their tenant or the tenants invitee. Oliver v. Cashin, 192 Va. 540, 65 S.E.2d 571, 1951 Va. LEXIS 201 (1951). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Section does not create cause of act ion.  Demurrer filed by a counselor and his employer as to the count of patients complaint alleging taking indecent liberties with a minor while the accused is in a supervisory relationship was sustained because the factual allegations could be properly included in a claim for sexual assault and battery, but they did not generate a separate civil claim for a violation of subsection A of § 18.2-370.1; § 8.01-2 21 does not create, or recognize, that a cause of action exists for a violation of the indecent liberties statute in the criminal code, subsection A of § 18.2-370.1.B.E.L. v. Price, 81 Va. Cir. 391, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 138 (Culpeper County Dec. 2, 201 0). It cannot be supposed that, in enacting the statute, the legislature had the remotest idea of creating any new ground for bringing an action for damages, and as t here is no common-law action for damages by an agent for refusal to accept a power of attorney, the statute does not create one; the statute does, however, provide a remedy whereby the court can mandate the acceptance of the power of attorney. Lance v. W ells Fargo Bank, N.A., 99 Va. Cir. 115, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Chesapeake Feb. 21, 2018). § 8.01-221.1. Unestablished business damages; lost profits. Text Damages for lost profits of a new or unestablished business may be recoverable upon proper proof. A party shall not be deemed to have failed to prove lost profits becau se the new or unestablished business has no history of profits. Such damages for a new or unestablished business shall not be recoverable in wrongful death or personal injury actions other than actions for defamation. History History. 2002, c. 624. Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS New businesses.  Two business tenants were not precluded from suing their former landlord for lost profits merely because their business was unestablished and new, as long as they provided proper proof, pursuant to this section. Sukens v. Wilkes, 64 Va. Cir. 220, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 200 (Richmond Mar. 11, 2004).

Statutes, § 70. CASE NOTES The legislature intended that this section apply only from the date of its enactment. Far ish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 722 F.2d 74, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 14855 (4th Cir. 1983). The legislature intended this section and § 8.2-318 to apply prospectively only from the dates of their enactments. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 754 F.2d 1111, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 28168 (4th Cir. 1985). This section is a companion statute to § 8.2-318. Bryant Elec. Co. v. City of Frederic ksburg, 762 F.2d 1192, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 31288 (4th Cir. 1985). This section is in derogation of the common-law privity requirement.  Under Virginias rules of statutory construction, it is not to be extended beyond its express terms. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 722 F.2d 74, 1983 U.S. App . LEXIS 14855 (4th Cir. 1983); Bryant Elec. Co. v. City of Fredericksburg, 762 F.2d 1192, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 31288 (4th Cir. 1985). Privit y not abolished where only economic loss suffered.  This section does not appear to abolish the common-law requirement of privity for negligence suits in which the plaintiff has suffered only economic loss. Bryant Elec. Co. v. City of Fredericksburg, 762 F.2d 1192, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 31288 (4th Cir. 1985). This section does not eliminate the privity requirement in a negligence action for economic loss alone. Blake Constr. Co. v. Alley, 233 Va. 31, 353 S.E.2d 724, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1868, 1987 Va. LEXIS 167 (1987). Where there is no duty alleged between plaintiff and defendants, and because seemingly the loss or damage is purely economic where no privity exists, there is no cause of action for negligence. John C. Holland Enters., Inc. v. J.P. Mascaro &amp; Sons, 653 F. Supp. 1242, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1344 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 829 F.2d 1120, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12206 (4th Cir. 1987). This section does not eliminate the privity requirement in a negligence action for economic loss alone because it is in derogation of the common law and is not to be enlarged beyond its express terms. Beard Plumbing &amp; Heating v. Thompson Plastics, 152 F.3d 313, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 18363 (4th Cir. 1998). Lack of privity held bar to recovery.  Virginia law does not permit recovery by a home purchaser against the pool installer and the architect for damages to an indoor swimming pool and the foundation o f a house caused by a leaking pool, where the pool installer and the architect were not in privity of contract with the home purchaser; the damages were injuries to property and not economic losses, and even if the indoor swimming pool and its separate r oom enclosure were built against the house but outside its foundation, that fact would not affect the result. Sensenbrenner v. Rust, Orling &amp; Neale, Architects, Inc., 236 Va. 419, 374 S.E.2d 55, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1040, 1988 Va. LEXIS 150 (1988). Where the stockholders reliance upon alleged substandard professional services rendered by accounting firm induced him to make the warranties and to execute t he escrow indemnity covenant that became the foundation of his liability to corporation, and his liability was measured by the diminution in the value of the whole stock package, i.e., the difference between the sale price of his stock fixed in reliance upon the bargained-for services and the value determined by a correct accounting formula, in effect, stockholder alleged nothing more than disappointed economic expectations, and his loss, then, was a purely economic loss. Therefore, because stockholder lacking privity of contract with accounting firm and sought to recover damages for economic loss under negligence principles, the trial court did not err in granting the accounting firms demurrer to the original motion for judgment. Ward v. Ernst &amp; Y oung, 246 Va. 317, 435 S.E.2d 628, 10 Va. Law Rep. 305, 1993 Va. LEXIS 126 (1993). Plaintiffs breach of warranty claim against defendant rip-saw manufacturer was dismissed due to lack of privity between plaintiffs decedent and defendant because plaintiff could not show the product was manufactured or sold before Virginias first anti-privity statute was enacted in 1962, and unlike for negligence claims, the inherently dangerous product exception to the privity requirement does not ap ply to warranty claims. Powell v. Diehl Woodworking Mach., Inc., 198 F. Supp. 3d 628, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103434 (E.D. Va. 2016). Damages sought in addition t o economic loss.  Pursuant to § 8.01-223, the economic loss rule did not bar the negligence claims asserted by insurers against a contractor, its subcontractor, and related part ies for damages caused by a roof that collapsed because, although the various parties defendant were not in privity with the insured tenants, the subrogated cause of action by the insurers sought damages for both the injury to property that was n ot the subject of contractual obligation between the parties, e.g., inventory and display fixtures, as well as economic loss resulting from the alleged negligence of one or more of the defendants. Factory Mut. Ins. Co. v. DLR Contr., Inc., No. 3:04CV834, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25876 (E.D. Va. Oct. 20, 2005). Neither this section nor § 8.2-318 alters the rule demanding privity of contract in warranty actions against architects. Gravely v. Providence Partnership, 549 F.2d 958, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 14606 (4th Cir. 1977) (decided under prior law). Not applicable to boat owners negligence action.  Damage to a boat owners boat caused by an electrical fire fell within the scope of the contract between the owners general contractor and a subcontractor, thus, amounting to nothing more than economic loss for which the owners sole remedy against the subcontractor was contract law, and § 8.01-223 did not apply to the owners negligence action against the subcontractor because the record was abse nt of any evidence that the owners boat suffered damage beyond the scope of the contract. Dur v. W. Branch Diesel, 240 Fed. Appx. 568, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 16237 (4th Cir. 2007). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Bar to recovery.  A products liability claim is not beyond the scope of the economic loss rule, and a products liability claim must state a cause of action arising out of injury to person or property. MacConkey v. F.J. Matter Design, Inc., 54 Va. Cir. 1, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 390 (Virginia Beach Feb. 8, 2000). Where a subcontractor claimed that a tile remover was negligent in repairing a tile floor at a mall under the tile removers contract with the contractor, but the subcontractor did not seek recovery for damages to its alleged property, and instead, sought indemnification or contribution for any economic losses it would suffer if it was found liable to the contractor on the contractors separate claims, reco very for such purely economic losses was not available to the subcontractor since it had no privity of contract with the tile remover. Metro Panel Sys. v. Sordoni Skanska Constr. Co., 56 Va. Cir. 399, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 478 (Norfolk Sept. 17, 2001). Priority of cont ract required for economic losses.  While contractors agent who was being sued for the alleged negligent performance and supervision of work under a contract to build a house was generally liabl e for the agents negligent performance of the principals contract, this was subject to the exception of the economic loss doctrine, and therefore, the agent could only be liable in negligence for damages to persons or property; privity of contrac t was required for economic losses. Rice v. Berkwood Corp., 56 Va. Cir. 493, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 490 (Chesterfield County Oct. 9, 2001). Water infiltration into condominiums, and the resulting damage to other property, caused a diminution in the value of property that created only disappointed econ omic expectations, and the economic loss rule barred recovery for negligence, as there was no privity between the condominium association and the manufacturer of the allegedly defective exterior insulation finishing system; although § 8.01-223 abrogated the common law requirement of privity, the statute was interpreted strictly to apply only in negligence cases involving injury to person or property. Bd. of Dirs. of the Lesner Pointe Condo. on the Chesapeake Bay Ass'n v. Harbour Point Bldg. C orp., 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 422 (Virginia Beach June 18, 2002). Because the failure of a companys warning system was a breach of its contractual obligation to a county, but not to a resident, the resident did not state a c ause of action in negligence under § 8.01-223 against the company because the residents damages were purely economic; accordingly, the companys demurrer was sustained. Gianforte v. Verizon Va., Inc., 69 Va. Cir. 361, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 207 (F airfax County Dec. 8, 2005).

If a person entitled to bring any action is at the time the cause of action accrues an infant, except if such infant has been emancipated pursuant to Article 15 (§ 16.1-331 et seq.) of Chapter 11 of Title 16.1, or incapacitated, such person may bring it wi thin the prescribed limitation period after such disability is removed; or 2. After a cause of action accrues, a. If an infant becomes entitled to bring such action, the time during which he is within the age of minority shall not be counted as any part of the period within which the action must be brought except as to any such period during which the infant has bee n judicially declared emancipated; or b. If a person entitled to bring such action becomes incapacitated, the time during which he is incapacitated shall not be computed as any part of the period within which the action must be brought, except where a conservator, guardian or committee is appointed for such person in which case an action may be commenced by such conservator, committee or guardian before the expiration of the applicable period of limitation or within one year after his qualification as such, whichever occurs later.For the purposes of subdivisions 1 and 2, a person shall be deemed incapacitated if he is so adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction, or if it shall otherwise appear to the court or jury determining the issue that such person is or was incapacitated within the prescribed limitation period. 3. If a convict is or becomes entitled to bring an action against his committee, the time during which he is incarcerated shall not be counted as any part of the period within which the a ction must be brought. B. Effect of d eath of a party.  The death of a person entitled to bring an action or of a person against whom an action may be brought shall toll the statute of limitations as follows: 1. Death of person entitled to bring a personal action.  If a person entitled to bring a personal action dies with no such action pending before the expiration of the limitation period for commencement thereof, then an action may be commenced by the decedent s personal representative before the expiration of the limitation period including the limitation period as provided by subdivision E 3 or within one year after his qualification as personal representative, whichever occurs later. 2. Death of person against whom personal action may be brought.  a. If a person against whom a personal action may be brought dies before the commencement of such action and before th e expiration of the limitation period for commencement thereof then a claim may be filed against the decedents estate or an action may be commenced against the decedents personal representative before the expiration of the applicable limitation p eriod or within one year after the qualification of such personal representative, whichever occurs later. b. If a person against whom a personal action may be brought dies before suit papers naming such person as defendant have been filed with the court, then such suit papers may be amended to substitute the decedents personal representative as party defend ant before the expiration of the applicable limitation period or within two years after the date such suit papers were filed with the court, whichever occurs later, and such suit papers shall be taken as properly filed. 3. Effect of death on actions for recovery of realty, or a proceeding for enforcement of certain liens relating to realty.  Upon the death of any person in whose favor or against whom an action for recovery of realty, or a proceeding for enforcement of certain liens relating to realty, may be brought, such right of action shall accrue to or against his successors in interest as provided in Article 2 (§ 8.01-236 et seq.). 4. Accrual of a personal cause of action against the estate of any person subsequent to such persons death.  If a personal cause of action against a decedent accrues subsequent to his death, an action may be brought against the decedents personal representative or a claim thereon may be filed against the estate of such decedent before the expiration of the applicable limitation period or within two years after the qualificati on of the decedents personal representative, whichever occurs later. 5. Accrual of a personal cause of action in favor of decedent.  If a person dies before a personal cause of action which survives would have accrued to him, if he had continued to liv e, then an action may be commenced by such decedents personal representative before the expiration of the applicable limitation period or within one year after the qualification of such personal representative, whichever occurs later. 6. Delayed qualification of personal representative.  If there is an interval of more than two years between the death of any person in whose favor or against whom a cause of action h as accrued or shall subsequently accrue and the qualification of such persons personal representative, such personal representative shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to have qualified on the last day of such two-year period. C. Suspension during injunctions.  When the commencement of any action is stayed by injunction, the time of the continuance of the injunction shall not be computed as any part of the period within which the action must be brought. D. Obstruction of filing by defendant.  When the filing of an action is obstructed by a defendants (i) filing a petition in bankruptcy or filing a petition for an extension or arrangement under the United States Bankruptcy Act or (ii) using any other direct or indirect means to obstruct the filing of an action, then the time that such obstruction has continued shall not be counted as any part of the period within which the action must be brought. E. Dismissal, abatement, or nonsuit. 1. Excep t as provided in subdivision 3, if any action is commenced within the prescribed limitation period and for any cause abates or is dismissed without determining the merits, the time such action is pending shall not be computed as part of the period within which such action may be brought, and another action may be brought within the remaining period. 2. If a judgment or decree is rendered for the plaintiff in any action commenced within the prescribed limitation period and such judgment or decree is arrested or reversed upon a ground which does not preclude a new action for the same cause, or if there is occasion to bring a new action by reason of the loss or destruction of any of the papers or records in a former action which was commenced within the prescribed limitation period, th en a new action may be brought within one year after such arrest or reversal or such loss or destruction, but not after. 3. If a plaintiff suffers a voluntary nonsuit as prescribed in § 8.01-380, the statute of limitations with respect to such action shall be tolled by the commencement of the nonsuited a ction, regardless of whether the statute of limitations is statutory or contractual, and the plaintiff may recommence his action within six months from the date of the order entered by the court, or within the original period of limitation, or within the limitation period as provided by subdivision B 1, whichever period is longer. This tolling provision shall apply irrespective of whether the action is originally filed in a federal or a state court and recommenced in any other court, and shall apply to all actions irrespective of whether they arise under common law or statute. F. Effect of d evise for payment of debts.  No provision in the will of any testator devising his real estate, or any part thereof, subject to the payment of his debts or charging the same therewith, or containing any other provision for the payment of debts, shall prevent this chapter from operating against such debts, unless it plainly appears to be the testators intent that it shall not so operate. G. Effect of n ew promise in writing. 1. If an y person against whom a right of action has accrued on any contract, other than a judgment or recognizance, promises, by writing signed by him or his agent, payment of money on such contract, the person to whom the right has accrued may maintain an actio n for the money so promised, within such number of years after such promise as it might be maintained if such promise were the original cause of action. An acknowledgment in writing, from which a promise of payment may be implied, shall be deemed to be s uch promise within the meaning of this subsection. 2. The plaintiff may sue on the new promise described in subdivision 1 or on the original cause of action, except that when the new promise is of such a nature as to merge the original ca use of action then the action shall be only on the new promise. H. Suspension of limitations in creditors suits.  When an action is commenced as a general creditors action, or as a general lien creditors action, or as an action to enforce a mechanics lien, the running of the statute of limitations shall be susp ended as to debts provable in such action from the commencement of the action, provided they are brought in before the commissioner in chancery under the first reference for an account of debts; but as to claims not so brought in the statute shall contin ue to run, without interruption by reason either of the commencement of the action or of the order for an account, until a later order for an account, under which they do come in, or they are asserted by petiti...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-230"><akn:num>§ 8.01-230</akn:num><akn:heading>Accrual of right of action</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In every action for which a limitation period is prescribed, the right of action shall be deemed to accrue and the prescribed limitation period shall begin to run from the date the injury is sustained in the case of injury to the person or damage to property, when the breach of contract occurs in actions ex contractu and not when the resulting damage is discovered, except where the relief sought is solely equitable or where otherwise provided under § 8.01-233, subsection C of § 8.01-245, §§ 8.01-249, 8.01-250 or other statute. History History. 1977, c. 617; 1996, c. 328. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-230 retains the traditional rule of Virginia case law that a cause of action accrues when the wrongful act or breach of duty or contract occurs. In t ort cases this has generally been construed to occur when injury or other damage takes place irrespective of when discovered. See e.g., Hawks v. DeHart, 206 Va. 810, 146 S.E.2d 187 (1966); but see § 8.2-725 [cause of action with regard to breach of ce rtain warranties as to future performance does not accrue until latent defect in goods discovered or should have been discovered]. The exceptions follow existing law. See e.g., Revisers notes to §§ 8.01-223, 8.01-245 C, 8.01-249, and 8.01-250. Equity suits to which statutes of limit ations may apply are also excepted. Cf. Revisers note to § 8.01-228. Cross references. As to when right of action on claim against Commonwealth accrues, see § 8.01-192. For provision as to persons under disability, see § 8.01-229.

For purposes of statute of limitations, there is but a single, indivisible cause of action for all injuries sustained, whether or not all of the damage is immediately apparent. Joyce v. A.C. &amp; S., Inc., 785 F.2d 1200, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 22853 (4th Cir. 1986). The mere fact that most of the damage occurs many years later does not change Virginia law or create a new cause of action. Irvin v. Burton, 635 F. Supp. 366, 198 6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25156 (W.D. Va. 1986). Cause of action and right of action compared.  There is a tendency by some to treat cause of action and right of action as interchangeable terms. While a cause of action and a right of action m ay accrue simultaneously, they need not do so. A right of action is a remedial right to presently enforce a cause of action. There can be no right of action until there is a cause of action. Stone v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 232 Va. 365, 350 S.E.2d 629, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1342, 1986 Va. LEXIS 266 (1986). In an action for breach of warranty on common elements of condominium project, any unit owner whose deed was delivered before October 1, 1977, the effective date of this section, was entitled to the benefit of the rule that his right of action did not accrue until his property rights were injured. He had no property rights until he became a n owner, and therefore his right of action accrued when his deed was delivered, if within the warranty period. On the other hand, a purchaser whose deed was delivered on or after October 1, 1977, was affected by this section. The statute of limitations b egan to run as to his claim when the breach of contract or duty occurred. That event took place when the first unit was conveyed to an individual owner. Harbour Gate Owners' Ass'n v. Berg, 232 Va. 98, 348 S.E.2d 252, 3 Va. Law Rep. 552, 1986 Va. LEXIS 23 4 (1986). Equitable tolling only applies in Virginia where the defendant has actually concealed hi s culpability and the fact of the injury. A plaintiff aware of his injury is on inquiry notice to discover his cause of action by use of ordinary diligence. Resolution Trust Corp. v. Walde, 856 F. Supp. 281, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7383 (E.D. Va. 1 994). Virginia lacks a cross-jurisdictional equitable tolling rule. Wade v. Danek Med., Inc., 182 F.3d 281, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 14887 (4th Cir. 1999). Applicability of Virginias tolling rule in diversity action.  In any case in which a state statute of limitations applies  whether because it is borrowed in a federal question action or because it applies under Erie in a diversity action  the states accompanying rule regarding equitable tolling should also a pply. Hence in a diversity action brought in federal court based on alleged injury arising out of back surgery, Virginias rule against equitable tolling, rather than federal rule, would apply. Wade v. Danek Med., Inc., 182 F.3d 281, 1999 U.S. App. LE XIS 14887 (4th Cir. 1999). Federal preemption.  Landowners tort claims related to a coal mine dewatering operation were untimely under Virginia law, which was not preempted by the discovery rule under the C omprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C.S. §§ 9601-9675, because the claims could not be asserted under CERCLA; the landowners had not stated a basis for recovery of response or remediation costs, and the releases of water were federally permitted. Blankenship v. Consolidation Coal Co., 850 F.3d 630, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 4168 (4th Cir. 2017). Equitable relief exception to contract action accrues upon breach.  For cases in which the relief sought is solely equitable, Virginia law provides an exception to the rule that a contract action accrues upon breach. Goodell v. Re hrig Int'l, Inc., 683 F. Supp. 1051, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3192 (E.D. Va. 1988), aff'd, 865 F.2d 1257, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 316 (4th Cir. 1989). Under this section accrual occurs when the breach of contract or duty occurs and therefo re, like copyright infringement claims, unfair competition claims can be comprised of a multitude of separate and distinct claims, where each occurrence inflicts a new injury and gives rise to a separate cause of action and plaintiffs claim was n ot barred as to any injury accruing during the five year period preceding the filing of suit. Hoey v. Dexel Sys. Corp., 716 F. Supp. 222, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8839 (E.D. Va. 1989). But see Unlimited Screw Prods., Inc. v. Malm, 781 F. Supp. 1121, 1991 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 19023 (E.D. Va. 1991). Complaints timely, even though filed before nonsuit orders.  Dismissal of later actions as untimely was error because, under subdivision E 3 of § 8.01-229, a new action had to be filed within six months from the date of the nonsuit order in a prior action; because the complaints were refiled within six months of nonsuit orders, they were timely, even though the second complaints were filed before the nonsuit orders in prior case. Laws v. McIlroy, 283 Va. 594, 724 S.E.2d 699, 2012 Va. LEXIS 85 (2012). Legal malpractice.  When malpractice is claimed to have occurred during the representation of a client by an attorney with respect to a particular undertaking or transaction, the bre ach of contract or duty occurs and the statute of limitations begins to run when the attorneys services rendered in connection with that particular undertaking or transaction have terminated, notwithstanding the continuation of a general attorney-cli ent relationship, and irrespective of the attorneys work on other undertakings or transactions for the same client. Keller v. Denny, 232 Va. 512, 352 S.E.2d 327, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1704, 1987 Va. LEXIS 162 (1987), limited, Moonlight Enters., LLC v. Mroz, 293 Va. 224, 797 S.E.2d 536, 2017 Va. LEXIS 40 (2017). Life insurance policy.  With respect to life insurance policies, when a policy requires a demand for payment and proof of death, the statute of limitations begins to run on the date of t he demand and proof. Arrington v. Peoples Sec. Life Ins. Co., 250 Va. 52, 458 S.E.2d 289, 1995 Va. LEXIS 76 (1995). Suit on oral contract must be brought within three years after cause of action accrues, which is at breach, not at discovery of any resulting damage. Goodell v.

CASE NOTES Time does not run against the State.  As against the government the bar of the statute of limitations cannot be set up. Time does not run against the State, nor bar the rights of the public. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Board of Supvrs., 110 Va. 95, 65 S.E. 531, 1909 Va. LEXIS 120 (1909); Board of Supvrs. v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 119 Va. 763, 91 S.E. 124, 1916 Va. LEXIS 147 (1916) (see also Levasser v. Washburn, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 572 (1854); Hurst v. Dulany, 84 Va. 701, 5 S.E. 802 (1888); Reusen v. Lawson, 91 Va. 226, 21 S.E. 347 (1895). The cases cited above were decided under former corresponding provisions). Unless statute expressly so provides.  The statute of limitations does not run against the State unless expressly mentioned. Virginia Hot Springs Co. v. Lowman, 126 Va. 424, 101 S.E. 326, 1919 Va. LEXI S 105 (1919) (decided under prior law). This section is absolute and unqualified. It makes no distinction between so-called pure statutes of limitation (those which time-restrict the availabilit y of a remedy) and special limitations (those prescribed by statute as an element of a newly created right). Hence, whether the time limitation prescribed in former § 15.1-552 (now § 15.2-1246) is special and jurisdictional or merely procedural, it does not operate as a bar to any proceeding by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. Commonwealth ex rel. Pross v. Board of Supvrs., 225 Va. 492, 303 S.E.2d 887, 1983 Va. LEXIS 246 (1983). No statute of limitations applies to the commonwealth unless the statute expressly so provides. Barr v. S.W. Rodgers Co., 33 Va. App. 273, 532 S.E.2d 920, 2000 Va . App. LEXIS 608, different results reached on reh'g, 34 Va. App. 50, 537 S.E.2d 620, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 852 (2000). Legislative intent to exempt m ust be clear.  In light of the policy that surrounds statutes of limitation, the bar of such statutes should not be lifted unless the legislature makes unmistakably clear that s uch is to occur in a given case. Where there exists any doubt, it should be resolved in favor of the operation of the statute of limitations. Burns v. Board of Supvrs., 227 Va. 354, 315 S.E.2d 856, 1984 Va. LEXIS 254 (1984). Section merely exempts State.  The statute of limitations does not affect the validity of a claim but merely sets up a defense to it. The governmental exception does not preserve a right of act ion, but merely exempts the sovereign from the general defense established. McCloskey &amp; Co. v. Wright, 363 F. Supp. 223, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13097 (E.D. Va. 1973) (decided under prior law). Immunity of governmental bodies from the statutes of limitation is strictly limited. Bur ns v. Board of Supvrs., 227 Va. 354, 315 S.E.2d 856, 1984 Va. LEXIS 254 (1984). Agencies included under section if not specifically excluded.  Because the legislature specifically excluded two categories of state agencies from the saving grace of this section, it appears that it intended to include other state agencies. Burns v. Board of Supvrs., 227 Va. 354, 315 S.E.2d 856, 1984 Va. LEXIS 254 (1984). Entity created b y county is not exempt from statute.  A county is not one and the same as the sovereign with regard to the applicability of statutes of limitation. If a county is not entitled to ignore a statute of l imitations, an entity created by that county can have no greater authority to do so. Burns v. Board of Supvrs., 227 Va. 354, 315 S.E.2d 856, 1984 Va. LEXIS 254 (1984). County board of supervisors, in its capacity as the governing body of a sanitary district, is not entitled to the benefit of this section. Burns v. Board of Supvrs., 227 Va. 354, 315 S.E.2d 856, 1984 Va. LEXIS 254 (1984). School boards are subject to statutes of limitation, since they are incorporated within the meaning of this section. County School Bd. v. Whitlow, 223 Va. 157, 286 S.E.2d 230, 1982 Va. LEXIS 183 (1982). The Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority, though a political subdivision of the State, is not one acting for purely governmental purposes, and hence is subject to the bar of the statute of limitations. Richmond Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Laburnum Constr. Corp., 195 Va. 827, 80 S.E.2d 574, 1954 Va. LEXIS 162 (1954) (decided under prior law). Transit authority was instrumentality of Commonwealth and was exempt from statute of limitations.  District court incorrectly determined that the transit authoritys action brought pursuant to a written contract against an architectural and engineering firm was barred by Virginias statute of limitations; as an agency and instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Virginia, transit authority is exempt from application of the statute of limitations. Delon Hampton &amp; Assocs. v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Au th., 943 F.2d 355, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 17765 (4th Cir. 1991). Habitual offender proceedings.  This section provides that no statute of limitation which shall not in express terms apply to the Commonwealth shall be deemed a bar to any proceeding by or on be half of the same. Since the Department of Motor Vehicles is not incorporated for charitable or educational purposes, this section is applicable. The Habitual Offender Act contains no such explicit limitation provision and former § 46.1-387.3 (now § 46.2-352) contemplates habitual offender proceedings taking place more than five years after the conviction which triggers the proceeding. Therefore, the proceeding is not time-barred by any statute of limitation. Bouldin v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 166, 355 S.E.2d 352, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2231, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 176 (1987). No title by adverse possession can be acquired in a public street. Bellenot v. City of Ri chmond, 108 Va. 314, 61 S.E. 785, 1908 Va. LEXIS 36 (1908) (decided under prior law). Action time-barred.  Circuit court did not err in finding that a government contractors action against its subcontractors was time-barred because subcontracts did not state an int ent to create an obligation on the part of the subcontractor to indemnify the contractor, and thus, the right of action accrued upon breach of the performance provisions of the contract; while the statute could provide for the contractors ongoing exp osure to litigation from an agency, the contract documents did not establish an ongoing responsibility. Hensel Phelps Constr. Co. v. Thompson Masonry Contr., Inc., 292 Va. 695, 791 S.E.2d 734, 2016 Va. LEXIS 166 (2016). Statute of limitations not waived.  Circuit court did not err in finding that a government contractors action was time-barred because no subcontract provision demonstrated sufficient intent to i ncorporate a waiver of the statute of limitations; even if the prime contract was imposed on the subcontractors, they would not be bound by a statutory waiver of the statute of limitations not incorporated into the subcontracts because § 8.01-231 prov ided no limitations period could be applicable against the Commonwealth.

In all other cases, an unwritten promise not to plead the statute shall be void, and a written promise not to plead such statute shall be valid and enforceable to prevent assertion of the defense of the statute only when (i) the written promise is made to avoid or defer litigation pending settlement of any cause of ac tion that has accrued in favor of the promisee against the promisor, (ii) the written promise is signed by the promisor or his agent, and (iii) the promisee commences an action asserting such cause of action within the earlier of (a) the applicable limit ations period running from the date the written promise is made or (b) any shorter time as may be provided in the written promise. No provision of this subsection shall operate contrary to subsections B and C. B. No acknowle dgment or promise by any personal representative of a decedent shall charge the estate of the decedent, revive a cause of action otherwise barred, or relieve the personal representative of his duty to defend under § 64.2-1415 in any case in which but for such acknowledgment or promise, the decedents estate could have been protected under a statute of limitations. C. No acknowle dgment or promise by one of two or more joint contractors shall charge any of such contractors in any case in which but for such acknowledgment another contractor would have been protected under a statute of limitations. D. Subsections A and C shall not apply to, limit, or prohibit written promises to waive or not to plead the statute of limitations that are made in, or contemporaneously with, subcontracts of any tier that are related to contracts for construction, construction manage ment, design-build, architecture, or engineering under Chapter 43 (§ 2.2-4300 et seq.) or 43.1 (§ 2.2-4378 et seq.) of Title 2.2; under the policies and procedures adopted by any county, city, or town or school board; under Title 23.1; or under aut horizing provisions, policies, or procedures for procurement of such contracts by any public body exempted from the foregoing; however, such waiver or promise not to plead applies only to demands, claims, or actions asserted under such contracts by a pub lic body. As used in this subsection, subcontract includes any contract or purchase order to supply labor, equipment, materials, or services to an entity awarded a contract with a public body or to any lower-tier entity performing work provided f or in such a contract. History History. Code 1950, §§ 8-27, 8-28; 1977, c. 617; 2006, c. 278; 2020, cc. 496, 497; 2022, c. 477. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-232 combines former §§ 8-27 and 8-28. Subsection A adds a proviso to former § 8-27 to codify case law and make explicit the interrelationship between former §§ 8-27 and 8-28. See Soble v. Her man, 175 Va. 489, 9 S.E.2d 459 (1940); Gwinn v. Farrier, 159 Va. 183, 165 S.E. 647 (1932). The effect of this subsection is to allow prospective defendants [with the exception of personal representatives and joint contractors who are provided for in subs ections B and C] to bind themselves by written promise not to plead the statute of limitations. Subsection B incorporates the substance of former § 8-28 with regard to personal representatives incapacity to charge a decedents estate where the esta te could have been protected by pleading the statute of limitations. The language which prohibits the revival of a cause of action otherwise barred is a codification of Brown v. Rice, 76 Va. 629 (1883). The reference to the personal representatives d uty to defend relates this subsection to § 26-5 which imposes personal liability for damage resulting from failure of a fiduciary to plead the applicable statute of limitations. Subsection C represents the remaining portion of former § 8-28 which is incorporated without substantial change. Editors note. At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the reference to § 26-5 was changed to § 64.2-1415 to conform to the recodification of Tit le 64.1 by Acts 2012, c. 614, effective October 1, 2012. Acts 2022, c. 477, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall apply to any written promise not to plead the statute of limitations made on or afte r July 1, 2022. The 2006 amendments. The 2006 amendment by c. 278 substituted the language beginning be valid when (i) for have the effect of a promise to pay the debt or discharge the li ability at the end of the first sentence in subsection A. The 2020 amendments. The 2020 amendments by cc. 496 and 497 are identical, and in subsection A, deleted of this section following and C at the end, and added subsectio n D. The 2022 amendments. The 2022 amendment by c. 477 rewrote subsection A, which read: Whenever the failure to enforce a promise, written or unwritten, not to plead the statute of li mitations would operate as a fraud on the promisee, the promisor shall be estopped to plead the statute. In all other cases, an unwritten promise not to plead the statute shall be void, and a written promise not to plead such statute shall be valid when (i) it is made to avoid or defer litigation pending settlement of any case, (ii) it is not made contemporaneously with any other contract, and (iii) it is made for an additional term not longer than the applicable limitations period. No provision of this subsection shall operate contrary to subsections B and C. Law Review. For 2007 annual survey article, Civil Practice and Procedure, see 42 U. Rich. L. Rev. 229 (2007).

Process, § 27; 19 M.J. Vendor and Purchaser, § 99. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms the statute of limitations and this section, as used be low, refer to former provisions. The word promise means the obligation of the person liable. Soble v. Herman, 175 Va. 489, 9 S.E.2d 459, 1940 Va. LEXIS 194 (1940). And word promisor refers to one legally bound to discharge obligation.  The word promisor refers to the person making the promise, or to some other person who has become legally bound to discharge the obligation. It does not r efer to some third person who ultimately may be benefited by the enforcement of the statute of limitations. Soble v. Herman, 175 Va. 489, 9 S.E.2d 459, 1940 Va. LEXIS 194 (1940). Fraud mu st relate to present or pre-existing fact.  Fraud, as used in the phrase would operate as a fraud on the promisee, must relate to a present or a pre-existing fact and cannot be established b y allegation or proof of an unfulfilled, naked, oral promise. This construction of the first sentence is in accord with the clear meaning of the last sentence, and renders entire subsection A reasonably clear. Soble v. Herman, 175 Va. 489, 9 S.E.2d 459 ( 1940). But see Tucker v. Owen, 94 F.2d 49 (4th Cir. 1938), wherein the federal court stated that the scope of subsection A should not be restricted by a narrow interpretation of the word fraud.. Indefinite period of time.  When a party intentionally relinquishes its known right to plead the statute of limitations through a contractual waiver, the party implicitly makes a promise tha t it will refrain from pleading the statute of limitations in the future. Radiance Capital Receivables Fourteen, LLC v. Foster, 298 Va. 14, 833 S.E.2d 867, 2019 Va. LEXIS 135 (2019). Waiver of right to ple ad statute of limitations.  While a promise generally involves an undertaking to do something in the future, a waiver of the right to plead the statute of limitations and a promise not to pl ead the statute of limitations have the same practical effect; if enforceable, both a waiver of the right to plead the statute of limitations and a promise not to plead the statute of limitations would bar a party from asserting a statute of limitations defense. Radiance Capital Receivables Fourteen, LLC v. Foster, 298 Va. 14, 833 S.E.2d 867, 2019 Va. LEXIS 135 (2019). Not made to avoid or defer litigation.  As the waiver of the right to plead the statute of limitations set forth in a guaranty failed to comply with the requirements of the statute, it was not valid und er Virginia law; the waiver was made contemporaneously with the guaranty and attempted to waive the right to plead the statute of limitations for an indefinite period of time, and thus it was not made to avoid or defer litigation pending the settlement o f any case. Radiance Capital Receivables Fourteen, LLC v. Foster, 298 Va. 14, 833 S.E.2d 867, 2019 Va. LEXIS 135 (2019). Necessity for writing.  The second sentence in subsection A, in express terms, places the promise not to plead the statute of limitations on the same plane as a promise to pay the debt; that is, such promises must be in writing to be enforceable. Soble v. Herman, 175 Va. 489, 9 S.E.2d 459, 1940 Va. LEXIS 194 (1940). Meaning of could have been prote cted.  The use of the words could have been protected does not imply that the limiting clause in this section relates to the time of the promise by the personal representative. The clause should not be construed as if it read could have been protected at the time the promise was made. It would appear that the General Assembly merely loosely used could have been for can be or could be,  or that they viewed the section as speaking at a time subsequent to that at which a promise in question was made, rather than at the time of the enactment of the section. Gwinn v. Farrier, 159 Va. 183, 165 S.E. 647, 1932 Va. LEXIS 182 (1932). Subsection A not extended to promises by personal representatives or ben eficiaries of decedents...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-233"><akn:num>§ 8.01-233</akn:num><akn:heading>When action deemed brought on counterclaim or cross-claim; when statute of limitations tolled; defendants consent required for dismissal</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. A defendant who pleads a counterclaim or cross-claim shall be deemed to have brought an action at the time he files such pleading. B. If the subj ect matter of the counterclaim or cross-claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence upon which the plaintiffs claim is based, the statute of limitations with respect to such pleading shall be tolled by the commencement of the plaintiff s action. History History. Code 1950, § 8-244; 1954, c. 611; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-233 is substantially former § 8-244. Subsection B provides for relation back to the time when a plaintiffs claim is filed of a cross-claim whi ch arises out of the same transaction upon which the plaintiffs claim is based, thereby giving the same treatment to cross-claims as was given to counterclaims under the former statute. The final sentence of former § 8-244 prohibited the plaintiff from dismissing his action without defendants consent after a defendant counterclaimed. This provision has been amended and is relocated in § 8.01-380. Cross references. For rules of court as to counterclaims and cross-claims, see Rules 3:9 and 3:10. Michies Jurisprudence.

CASE NOTES This section would seem to require some physical injury to plaintiffs property before suit may be maintained in absence of privity. Bryant Elec. Co. v. City of Fredericksburg, 762 F.2d 1192, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 31288 (4th Cir. 1985). Appeal from improper dismissal of defendant against whom cross-claim filed.  When an order of nonsuit improperly dismisses a party defendant against whom a valid cross-claim has been duly filed, effectively time-barring the cause of action set forth in the cross-claim, such order is a final, appealable judgment as to the cross-claimant. Iliff v. Richards, 221 Va. 644, 272 S.E.2d 645, 1980 Va. LEXIS 286 (1980). Defendants counterclaim did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence wher e the issues of fact and law in the complaint and counterclaims were not largely the same; proof of defendants counterclaims required separate evidence than proof of plaintiffs complaint and principles of res judicata would not bar a subsequent s uit on the counterclaims because the proof and issues raised by the counterclaim were unrelated to the proof and issues raised by the complaint. Unlimited Screw Prods., Inc. v. Malm, 781 F. Supp. 1121, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19023 (E.D. Va. 1991). Defendants counterclaim arising from the same transaction or occurrence.  While § 8.01-243 provides that the statute of limitations for a personal injury claim is two years after accrual of the cause of action and § 8.01-230 provi des that a cause of action accrues on the date the injury was sustained, and the correctional officers cause of action accrued on August 22, 1999, nevertheless, his filing of a counterclaim on September 21, 2001, was timely because the inmate filed h is 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 cause of action on May 4, 2001, and pursuant to § 8.01-233 B the statute of limitations on the officers claim was tolled by the commencement of the inmates case since the counterclaim arose out of the same occurrence a s the inmates claim.

For related discussion, see 12A M.J. Limitation of Actions, § 3. CASE NOTES Virginias policy favoring prospective application of statutes of limitations is codified both in this section and § 8.01-256. This section provides that an action barred by a statute of limitations is not revived by repeal of that limitation provision. Section 8.01-256 provides that the 1977 amendments to the limitation provisions are inapplicable to any cause of action that accrued prior to the effective date of those amendments. Saunders v. H.K. Porter Co., 643 F. Supp. 198, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22070 (E.D. Va. 1986), rev'd, 843 F.2d 815, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 4428 (4th Cir. 198 8). Section prescribes rule different from that of United States Supreme Court.  By this section it was intended to prescribe a rule different from that declared by the Supreme Court of the United States in Campbell v. Holt, 115 U.S. 620, 6 S. Ct. 209, 29 L. Ed. 483 (1885), that a debtor has no vested right in a bar interposed to the collection of his debt, and that the bar may be removed by repeal of the statute as to debts upon which limitations have already run. Kesterson v. Hill, 101 Va. 736, 101 Va. 739, 45 S.E. 288, 1903 Va. LEXIS 81 (1903) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Claim not barred.  Negligent infliction of emotional harm claim in an employees amended complaint related back to the date of the original complaint under § 8.01-6.1, and was not time-barred because the original complaint contained an intentional infliction claim, and thus the amendment was not a new substantive cause of action; the employee was reasonably diligent in asserting his claim and no prejudice was shown by allowin g the amendment. Ballard v. Hanover Research Council, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 110 (Fairfax County Sept. 24, 2010).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-235"><akn:num>§ 8.01-235</akn:num><akn:heading>Bar of expiration of limitation period raised only as affirmative defense in responsive pleading</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The objection that an action is not commenced within the limitation period prescribed by law can only be raised as an affirmative defense specifically set forth in a re sponsive pleading. No statutory limitation period shall have jurisdictional effects and the defense that the statutory limitation period has expired cannot be set up by demurrer. This section shall apply to all limitation periods, without regard to wheth er or not the statute prescribing such limitation period shall create a new right. History History. 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-235 requires that any statute of limitations must be pleaded as an affirmative defense by the party claiming its benefit. As to statutorily created r ights unknown to common law, e.g., wrongful death actions, this changes case law which required the party asserting such a right to plead that he had brought the action within the limitation period. To this extent the section therefore repeals Branch v. Branch, 172 Va. 413, 2 S.E.2d 327 (1939). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 6A M.J. Demurrers, § 22; 20 M.J. Wills, §§ 60, 61, 66. CASE NOTES This section is merely a procedural statute governing the manner of pleading statutes of limitation. Harper v. City Council, 220 Va. 727, 261 S.E.2d 560, 1980 Va. LEXIS 160 (1980). Statute of limitat ions defense to be heard by jury.  Distributor had not waived its statute of limitations defense and was entitled to present its theory to the jury because it specifically set forth in a responsive pleading its defense of the statute of limitations; since the customers demand for a trial by jury did not specify any limits on the issues on which a jury trial was requested, the distributor had no obligation to make an additional demand. Ferguson Enters., Inc. v. F.H. Furr Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., 297 Va. 539, 830 S.E.2d 917, 2019 Va. LEXIS 87 (2019). Distributor was entitled to have its statute of limitations defense heard by a jury especially where the issue was initially presented to the trial judge for deci sion, and the judge declined to decide the matter because evidence was required. Ferguson Enters., Inc. v. F.H. Furr Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., 297 Va. 539, 830 S.E.2d 917, 2019 Va. LEXIS 87 (2019). Distributor was not required to file an additional demand for a trial by jury because its customer had already demanded a jury trial as to all issues, and the dis tributor was entitled to rely upon the demand for a jury trial made by the customer as to all issues in controversy between them; the statutes do not require duplicate jury demands to preserve the right to a trial by jury. Ferguson Enters., Inc. v. F.H. Furr Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., 297 Va. 539, 830 S.E.2d 917, 2019 Va. LEXIS 87 (2019). Effect upon prior law.  According to its plain terms, this section deals with the manner in which reliance on limitation periods must be asserted in responsive pleadings. It does not abo lish the substantive distinction heretofore recognized between a pure and special statute of limitation. Prior law has been changed only to the extent that a distinction in pleading had been premised on the theory that special sta tutes of limitation were jurisdictional in effect. Harper v. City Council, 220 Va. 727, 261 S.E.2d 560, 1980 Va. LEXIS 160 (1980). Failure to plead c ontractual limitations period.  Two-year limitation period in a policy of insurance was an affirmative defense that was waived under Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c), by defendant insurers failure to raise it as an affirmative defense when plaintiff insureds state court action was removed to federal court, thus, while the district court was correct in granting the insureds motion for summary judgment, the district court incorrectly applied §§ 8.01-235, 8.01-243 and 8.01-246, which had no application, because in Virginia contractual and statutory limitations were not the same, and the federal rules applied in the removed action. S. Wallace Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 353 F.3d 367, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 26267 (4th Cir. 2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to raise untimelines s of cross bill.  Although a life tenants cross bill seeking to impeach a decedents will was untimely, the untimeliness of that claim was not considered by the court becaus e it was not raised as a defense in an executrixs pleadings. Adair v. Kuhn, 64 Va. Cir. 364, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 62 (Spotsylvania County Apr. 12, 2004). Proper pleading.  First workers demurrer to the truck drivers second amended motion for judgment that claimed that damages the first worker caused the truck driver to incur to the truck drivers rented truck could not be recovered due to the applicable statute of limitations had to be rejected, as a demurrer was not a proper pleading by which to raise the affirmative defense of the running of the statute of limitations; rather, such a defense had to be raised as an affirmative defense in a responsive pleading. Laguna v. Wallace, 67 Va. Cir. 535, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 358 (Loudoun County Aug. 4, 2004). Because a defendant properly pleaded a statute of limitations defense, and pursuant to § 8.01-281 and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 4:13(8) ruling on a plea at bar did not h ave to be deferred until the date of trial, the plaintiffs petition for declaratory judgment under § 8.01-191 was dismissed. Trivedi v. Pansuria, 72 Va. Cir. 220, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 196 (Chesterfield County Nov. 3, 2006). Whether a statute of limitation provision barred recovery in a husbands defamation action against a church was reserved where the parties pleadings did no t state when the churchs pastor made the allegedly defamatory remarks to the husbands wife. The husbands cause of action accrued and the statute of limitations began to run on the date when the pastor first made the statements to the wife. Cu threll v. McKeller, 73 Va. Cir. 386, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 205 (Norfolk June 28, 2007). While it is certainly preferable that pleadings set forth the dates of alleged conduct (when known) to avoid additional discovery expenses, this is not required. The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense and as such alleging the date of the specific actions, though preferable, is not required for valid pleadings. Johnson Senior Ctr. v. Dolan, 97 Va. Cir. 76, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 306 (Amherst County Oct. 11, 2017). Managers demurrer was denied because the facts alleged in a corporations complaint gave the managers notice of the claim; the corporations pleadings a lleged that its records were and had been in the possession of the managers, and the alleged unauthorized financial charges were described with enough particularity that the managers could be able to identify them in the financial accounts. Johnson Senio r Ctr. v. Dolan, 97 Va. Cir. 76, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 306 (Amherst County Oct. 11, 2017). Time limitation.  Subsection H of § 8.01-229, like the similar provisions in § 8.01-235, operates with respect to the commencement of an action, not the separate independent requirement of the filing of a notice of lis pendens within the 10-year period as required by subsection C of § 8.01-251. United Leasing Corp. v. Lacey, 101 Va. Cir. 402, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 222 (Westmoreland County Jan. 16, 2013). Demurrer.  Statute plainly states that the defense that the statutory limitation period has expired cannot be set up by demurrer; therefore, the court did not consider defen dants demurrer to the statute of limitations. Joyner v. Colonial Heights Operations, L.L.C., 108 Va. Cir. 240, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 140 (Petersburg June 24, 2021). Although employers demurred to a terminated employees charges of defamation by arguing that the statute of limitations barred the employees claim, the violation of the statute of limitations was to be raised as an affirmative defense in a responsive pleading and was not be set up by demurrer. Accordingly, the denial of the demurrer was appropriate because the issue of statute of limitations was not pr operly before the court. Foster v. Fraternal Order of Eagles, 108 Va. Cir. 409, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 200 (Rockingham County Aug. 19, 2021). Plea in bar.  Because § 8.01-235 addresses only the commencement of an action, it has no application to the filing of the notice of lis pendens required in subsection C of § 8.01-251; thus, a grantee and lender did not waive the right to file a plea in bar due to any waiver and could not assert the 10-year limitation for commencing the suit to enforce a judgment lien as an affirmative defense in their answers because th e judgment creditor filed the action within the statute of limitations. United Leasing Corp. v. Lacey, 101 Va. Cir. 402, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 222 (Westmoreland County Jan. 16, 2013). Article 2.

Elements.  To establish title to land by adverse possession it is necessary to show actual, hostile, exclusive, visible and continuous possession for the statutory period of 15 years. McIntosh v. Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Co., 220 Va. 553, 260 S.E.2d 457, 1979 Va. LEXIS 296 (1979). Adverse possession of child as against parent.  As a general rule, adverse possession cannot arise from possession of a child as against his parent. In order to establish adverse possession in such a case, the owner must have had some clear, definite, or unequivocal notice of the childs intention to assert exclusive ownership, and the character of the possession is a jury question. McIntosh v. Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Co., 220 Va. 553, 260 S.E.2 d 457, 1979 Va. LEXIS 296 (1979). B.Dower. Dower was an interest in land for which a right of entry exists in favor of a widow unde r Virginia law. Devers v. Chateau Corp., 748 F.2d 902, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 16567 (4th Cir. 1984). Sect ion applicable to action to insure dower rights.  The 15-year statute of limitations applied to an action to insure the dower rights of a widow. Devers v. Chateau Corp., 748 F.2d 902, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 16567 ( 4th Cir. 1984). Existence of equitable remedy for exercise of dower did not affect limitation period.  A widow could exercise her dower rights either at law or in equity. The fact that an equitable remedy exists in addition to a legal remedy did not mean that the s tatute of limitations for entry to land did not apply. Devers v. Chateau Corp., 748 F.2d 902, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 16567 (4th Cir. 1984). C.Requisites for Adverse Possession. Adverse possession requires that the acts relied upon must have been actual, continuous, exclusive, hostile, open and notorious and accompanied by a claim of right for the statutory period. Payne v. Consolidation Coal Co., 607 F. Supp. 378, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21180 (D. Va. 1985). Occupancy must be hostile.  Trial court erred in finding the possessors of real property did not demonstrate hostile possession in their adverse possession claim because the hostile char acter of the owners possession was not undercut by the fact that they mistakenly believed the land was theirs. Quatannens v. Tyrrell, 268 Va. 360, 601 S.E.2d 616, 2004 Va. LEXIS 124 (2004). It is well established that a claimants possession is hostile if it is under a claim of right and adverse to the right of the true owner. Kim v. Douval Corp., 259 Va. 752, 529 S.E.2d 92, 2000 Va. LEXIS 79 (2000), limited, Quatannens v. Tyrrell, 268 Va. 360, 601 S.E.2d 616, 2004 Va. LEXIS 124 (2004). A claim of right can be inferred from unequivocal conduct that is inconsistent with any other reasonable inference. Kim v. Douval Corp., 259 Va. 752, 529 S.E.2d 92, 2000 Va. LEXIS 79 (2000), limited, Quatannens v. Tyrrell, 268 Va. 360, 601 S.E.2d 616, 2004 Va. LEXIS 124 (2004). Inference of claim of right question for jury.  Whether the conduct relied upon to support an inference of a claim of right is sufficient to establish such a claim is generally a question for the jury. Kim v. D ouval Corp., 259 Va. 752, 529 S.E.2d 92, 2000 Va. LEXIS 79 (2000), limited, Quatannens v. Tyrrell, 268 Va. 360, 601 S.E.2d 616, 2004 Va. LEXIS 124 (2004). Intent to use land to exclusion of others.  The phrase claim of right, when used in the context of adverse possession, refers to the intent of a claimant to use land as the claimants own to the exclusion of all others; the existence of a claim of right does not depend on the claimant having any actual title or right to the property. Kim v. Douval Corp., 259 Va. 752, 529 S.E.2d 92, 2000 Va. LEXIS 79 (2000), limited, Quatannens v. Tyrrell, 268 Va . 360, 601 S.E.2d 616, 2004 Va. LEXIS 124 (2004). Entry with permission of owner.  Where the original entry on anothers land was by agreement or permission, possession regardless of its duration presumptively continues as it began, in the ab sence of an explicit disclaimer. Kim v. Douval Corp., 259 Va. 752, 529 S.E.2d 92, 2000 Va. LEXIS 79 (2000), limited, Quatannens v. Tyrrell, 268 Va. 360, 601 S.E.2d 616, 2004 Va. LEXIS 124 (2004). The terms claim of right, claim of title and claim of ownership mean the intention of an adverse possessor to take the land and use it as his own. The terms do not imply any claim of actual title or right. Payne v. Consolidation Coal Co., 607 F. Supp. 378, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21180 (D. Va. 1985). Jury instruction must include statutory period.  District court did not err when it refused to adopt an instruction defendants proposed on adverse possession that did not make reference to the time a person had to possess property under § 8.01-236 before he acquired title by adverse possession, at the close of the Governments case charging defendants with violating 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 1341, 1343, and 317 by selling timber rights to property before they acquired title to the property and by claiming that they acquired title by adverse possession. United States v. Turgeon, 149 Fed. Appx. 144, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 19731 (4th Cir. 2005). Period of adverse possession.  Trial court did not err in ruling that a family had not met their burden of proving adverse possession or prescription as they did not prove by clear and convinci ng evidence that they had asserted an adverse claim to ownership of the riparian rights for the requisite period of time. While the familys ownership of a pavilion on the river constituted an actual and hostile assertion of the right to occupy the ri parian area between 1989 and 2003, they did not show that they continued to exert actual control over the riparian area after the hurricane destroyed the pavilion and, thus, could not show that they met each of the requirements for adverse possession for the mandatory period of fifteen years in § 8.01-236. Scott v. Burwell's Bay Improvement Ass'n, 281 Va. 704, 708 S.E.2d 858, 2011 Va. LEXIS 91 (2011). Time that statutory period commences.  Pursuant to § 8.01-236, where co-tenants did not raise an issue at trial or in their assignments of error pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5:25 and 5:17 as to the t ime that the statutory period for adverse possession commenced, it was assumed that the time period against the co-tenants interests in the property commenced when other owners took exclusive possession of the property. Harkleroad v. Linkous, 281 Va. 12, 704 S.E.2d 381, 2011 Va. LEXIS 14 (2011). Tacking.  Tacking allows successive adverse users in privity with prior adverse users to aggregate the two adverse periods. However, tacking is prohibited if the pr ior owner abandons the premises. United States v. Tobias, 899 F.2d 1375, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 7027 (4th Cir. 1990). Once adverse claimant vacates, owner is in constructive possession.  Virginia follows the rule that once the adverse claimant vacates the premises, the owner, by reason of his legal title, will be regarded as in constructive posses sion and the adverse period of the claimant is at an end. United States v. Tobias, 899 F.2d 1375, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 7027 (4th Cir. 1990). Burden of proof.  The claimant bears the burden of proving the elements of adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence. Kim v. Douval Corp., 259 Va. 752, 529 S.E.2d 92, 200 0 Va. LEXIS 79 (2000), limited, Quatannens v. Tyrrell, 268 Va. 360, 601 S.E.2d 616, 2004 Va. LEXIS 124 (2004). Elements sufficiently established.  Co-tenants established their claim to adverse possession of property pursuant to § 8.01-236 against other co-tenants, where they provided sufficient clear and convincing evidence of the elements, including hostile possession; they showed that for more than 15 ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-237"><akn:num>§ 8.01-237</akn:num><akn:heading>Effect of disabilities upon right of entry on, or action for, land</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of § 8.01-229, no disabilities or tacking of disabilities shall preserve to any person or his successors a right to ma ke entry on or bring an action to recover land for more than twenty-five years after such right first accrued, although such person or persons shall have been disabled during the whole of such twenty-five years. History History. Code 1950, §§ 8-7, 8-8; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-237 qualifies the application of § 8.01-229 A to rights of entry on or actions for land and modifies former §§ 8-7 and 8-8. A 25-year limit is placed on the right to enter on or bring an action for land regardless of the disabilities of persons so entitled. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 1A M.J. Adverse Possession, §§ 2, 17, 37; 6B M.J. Ejec tment, § 28; 12A M.J. Limitation of Actions, § 45. CASE NOTES This section is not a true statute of limitations but a cutoff provision that op erates to define the maximum period within which an action may be brought, regardless of applicable statutes of limitations. Lavery v. Automation Mgt. Consultants, Inc., 234 Va. 145, 360 S.E.2d 336, 4 Va. Law Rep. 543, 1987 Va. LEXIS 255 (1987). Tacking disabilities not allowed.  Where a disability existing at the time the cause of action accrued is removed, another disability arising subsequently cannot be tacked to it to avoid the bar of the statute. Fitzhugh v. Anderson, 12 Va. (2 Hen. &amp; M.) 289 (1808); Hudson v. Hudson, 20 Va. (6 Munf.) 352 (1819); Parsons v. McCracken, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 495 (1838). The cases cited above were decided under former comparable section. Disabilities which bring a person within the exceptions of the statute cannot be filed one upon another; a party claiming the benefit of this proviso can only ava il himself of the disability existing when the right of action first accrued. Lessee of Mercer v. Selden, 42 U.S. 37, 11 L. Ed. 38, 1 How. 37, 1843 U.S. LEXIS 286 (1843) (decided under prior law). Recurring lunacy.  Where after one was adjudged a lunatic and his land was sold in an action by a creditor against his committee, limitations on an action by the lunatic to recover the land commenced to run when he was discharged as restored to sanity, and continued to run notwithstanding a recurrence of insanity nine years later. Howard v. Landsberg's Comm., 108 Va. 161, 60 S.E. 769, 1908 Va. LEXIS 23 (1908) (decided under prior l aw). Infanc y of one joint tenant does not affect other tenants.  As ejectment lies in Virginia for an undivided interest in realty, the infancy of one joint tenant will not prevent the running of the act of limitations as to th e other joint tenants not under disability. Redford v. Clarke, 100 Va. 115, 40 S.E. 630, 1902 Va.

Limitation of Actions, §§ 4, 7, 11, 22; 15 M. J. Public Lands, § 19. CASE NOTES Actions by Commonwealth not barred.  Since this section does not, by its express terms, apply to the Commonwealth, it cannot bar an action by it. Bradford v. Nature Conservancy, 224 Va. 181, 294 S.E. 2d 866, 1982 Va. LEXIS 281 (1982). Section is inapplicable to a declaratory judgment action to determine the rights of the parties. Bradford v. Nature Conservancy, 224 Va. 181, 294 S.E.2d 866, 1982 Va. LEXIS 281 (1982). This section may not be used to defeat a landowners effort to show that a grant under former § 41-84 (now § 41.1-16) is void and to have a court of equity confirm his title. Johnson v. Buzzard Island Shooting Club, Inc., 232 Va. 32, 348 S.E.2d 220, 3 Va. Law Rep. 476, 1986 Va. LEXIS 223 (1986). Applie s to land grant obtained by false representations.  In a suit to repeal a land grant, it was claimed that the patent had been obtained upon false suggestions, and circumstances were relied on to establish the exist ence of a trust, to take the case out of the operation of the statute, but it was held that the language was express that no patent could be repealed after the lapse of 10 years.

No deed of trust or mortgage heretofore or hereafter given to secure the payment of money, and no lien heretofore or hereafter reserved to secure the payment of unpaid purchase money, shall be enforced after 10 years from the time when the original obligation last maturing thereby secured shall have become due and payable according to its terms and without regard to any provision for the acceleration of such date; provided that the period of one year from the death of any party in interest shall be excluded from t he computation of time. B. Notwithstan ding the limitations prescribed by subsection A, a deed of trust or mortgage given, and a lien reserved to secure the payment of money, for which the original obligation last maturing thereby secured became due and payable according to its terms between July 1, 1988, and July 1, 2000, without regard to any provision for the acceleration of the date such obligation became due and payable, shall not be enforced after July 1, 2010. However, the provisions of this subsection shall have no effect on the righ ts of a person who (i) acquired an interest in the real property securing such deed of trust or mortgage between July 1, 2008, and the date of enactment of this subsection and (ii) would otherwise have priority over or take free of such deed of trust or mortgage under the laws of the Commonwealth at that time. C. The limitat ions prescribed by this section may be extended by the recordation of a certificate in the form provided in § 8.01-241.1 prior to the expiration of the limitation period prescribed herein in the clerks office in which such lien is recorded and exe cuted either by the party in whom the beneficial title to the property so encumbered is vested at the time of such recordation or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact, or agent. Recordation of the certificate shall extend the limitations of the right to enforce the lien for 10 years from the date of the recordation of the certificate. The clerk of the court shall index the certificate in both names in the index of the deed book and give reference to the book and page in which the original writing is recorded. Unless the deed or deeds executed pursuant to the foreclosure of any mortgage or to the execution of or sale under any deed of trust is recorded in the county or city where the land is situated within one year after the time the right to enforc e the mortgage or deed of trust shall have expired as hereinabove provided, such deed or deeds shall be void as to all purchasers for valuable consideration without notice and lien creditors who make any purchase of or acquire any lien on the land convey ed by any such deed prior to the time such deed is so recorded.

The 2008 amendment by c. 226 substituted 10 years for twenty years in the first and third sentences. The 2009 amendments. The 2009 amendment by c. 163, effective retroactively to July 1, 2008, divided the former section into subsections A and C, inserted the subsection designations; and added subsection B. Law Review.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms the statute and this section, as used below, ma y refer to former provisions. Note also that the 2008 amendment changed the limitation period from 20 years to 10 years. This section creates an absolute bar to any proceeding for the enforcement of a deed of trust or mortgage after 20 years from the time the right to enforce it accrued. Cohen v. Jenkins, 125 Va. 635, 100 S.E. 678, 1919 Va. LEXIS 54 (1919). But it d oes not affect the rule of presumption of payment.  The rule of presumption of payment from lapse of time is not affected by the positive bar of the statute of limitations. Turnbull v. Mann, 99 Va. 41, 37 S.E. 288, 1900 Va. LEXIS 121 (1900). Institution of suit stops running of statute.  If the suit is instituted before the expiration of the 20-year period, the bar of the statute does not become effective. Anderson v. Biazzi, 166 Va. 309, 186 S.E. 7, 1936 Va. LEXIS 190 (1936). The legislature, in enacting this section, did not intend, from the language, No deed of trust or mortgage . . . shall be enforced after 20 years . . . , that a final decree, from which there could be no appeal and under which there must be an irrevocable conveyance of the property to the purchaser, must be entered before the expiration of the 20-year period. The legislature meant by the language used tha t the institution of a suit to subject the land was the enforcement of the deed of trust or mortgage. Anderson v. Biazzi, 166 Va. 309, 186 S.E. 7, 1936 Va. LEXIS 190 (1936). Party may be estopped by fraud to plead section.  The defendants were precluded and estopped by their own fraud from relying upon the statute of limitations contained in this section as a bar to the enforcement o f a deed of trust. Sadler v. Marsden, 160 Va. 392, 168 S.E. 357, 1933 Va. LEXIS 220 (1933). The lien of the trust deed was not extended in the manner provided for by this section and so went out of being after 20 years. Since it was not extended, it coul d not as such thereafter be revived, unless possibly some principle of estoppel can be invoked or some fraud has been practiced. Wilson v. Butt, 168 Va. 259, 190 S.E. 260, 1937 Va. LEXIS 221 (1937). De mand not barred at law by limitations not barred in equity.  Where a legal demand is asserted in equity which is not barred at law by the applicable statute of limitations, neither is it barred in equity. Thus, given that the statute of limitation for enforcing a deed of trust lien is 20 years, the doctrine of laches will not bar the enforcement of a deed of trust prior to the expiration of the time period. United States v. Lomas Mtg., USA, Inc., 742 F. Supp. 936, 1990 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 11208 (W.D. Va. 1990). Action for recovery of money and suit to enforce lien distinguished.  Though an action at law to recover purchase money is barred, a suit in equity to enforce a deed of trust or mortgage is not affected by any time short of that pro vided in this section. Tunstall v. Withers, 86 Va. 892, 11 S.E. 565, 1890 Va. LEXIS 57 (1890). That the personal liability of the vendee of real estate for the purchase money has been barred by the statute of limitations does not bar a suit in equity to enf orce the lien, provided the latter is brought within the time prescribed by this section. Rector v. Tazewell Coal &amp; Iron Co., 179 Va. 803, 20 S.E.2d 504, 1942 Va. LEXIS 276 (1942). Provision for extension of lien should be sympathetically considered.  The provision in this section providing that the limitation of 20 years could be extended by an endorsement to that effect entered upon the margin of the deed boo k on which the same was recorded made certain matters which had been uncertain and should receive sympathetic consideration by the courts. Cunningham v. Williams, 178 Va. 542, 17 S.E.2d 355, 1941 Va. LEXIS 188 (1941). Extended lien is not subject to intervening rights.  Prior to Acts 1897-98, p. 516, it was possible for parties interested to substitute a new lien for an old one, and a deed of trust or mortgage might be placed upo n the same land for the old debt, but the new lien would be subject to such rights of others as might have intervened. Under the present statute, however, there can be no such intervention where the statutory marginal extension is made, as distinguished from the substitution of a new lien for the old. Cunningham v. Williams, 178 Va. 542, 17 S.E.2d 355, 1941 Va. LEXIS 188 (1941). Provision as to deat h of party is not retroactive.  The provision of this section excluding a year on the death of a party from the computation of time in estimating the period in which a suit to enforce a deed of trust would be barred, did not affect the period of limitation within which a deed of trust might be enforced, where the obligation secured by such deed of trust matured prior to the adoption of this provision.

For related discussion, see 13A M.J. Mortgages and Deeds of Trust, § 166. CASE NOTES Junior lienor was a party in interest.  Junior lienor, who was the mortgagor of the property which was the subject of the foreclosure and the holder of a second deed of trust which secured his note, was a necessary party, as well as a party in interest to foreclosure suit for the purposes of this section; therefore, his death extended the statute of limitations by one year, as provided in this section. Allen v. Chapman, 242 Va. 94, 406 S.E.2d 186, 7 Va . Law Rep. 2865, 1991 Va. LEXIS 119 (1991). Fe deral agencys immunity did not apply to private trustee.  Although § 8.01-242 could not bar a federal agency, such as the United States Small Business Administration, from initiating foreclosure proceedings on real pr operty, a private entity (a trustee) to which the Administration assigned a deed of trust did not, merely by virtue of that assignment, enjoy the same immunity from the statute of limitation. Long, Long &amp; Kellerman, P.C. v. Wheeler, 264 Va. 531, 570 S.E. 2d 822, 2002 Va. LEXIS 152 (2002). Foreclosure action was time-barred.  Where a deed of trust contained no maturity date, the 20-year statute of limitation set forth in § 8.01-242 applied and barred a trustees action to foreclo se on the deed of trust where the foreclosure action was initiated more than 20 years after the date of the deed of trust. Long, Long &amp; Kellerman, P.C. v. Wheeler, 264 Va. 531, 570 S.E.2d 822, 2002 Va. LEXIS 152 (2002). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  In context, subsection B of § 8.01-241 is an exception to subsection A of § 8.01-241, and for subsection B to apply here, subsection A also had to apply; ho wever, subsection A of § 8.01-241 did not apply because the deed of trust did not state a maturity date, and therefore, § 8.01-242 applied. G&amp;G, LLC v. Thoburn Ltd. P'ship, 106 Va. Cir. 88, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 178 (Fairfax County Sept. 21, 2020). Statute applies to a deed of trust in which the maturity date of the underlying note is not found in the deed of trust. G&amp;G, LLC v. Thoburn Ltd. P'ship, 106 Va. C ir. 88, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 178 (Fairfax County Sept. 21, 2020). Construction with other law.  The 2008 and 2009 amendments to § 8.01-241 did not impliedly supersede or repeal § 8.01-242; the amendments neither amended § 8.01-242 nor referred expre ssly to it, there is not such a repugnancy between them that they could have been designed to remain equally in force, their co-existence is not destructive of the object for which the amendments were passed, and the amendments do not embrace the whole s ubject of § 8.01-242 and were not plainly substituted for it. G&amp;G, LLC v. Thoburn Ltd. P'ship, 106 Va. Cir. 88, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 178 (Fairfax County Sept. 21, 2020). Foreclosure action was time-barred.  Holder in due course of deed of trust notes was not time-barred from foreclosing when the debtor filed bankruptcy petitions, which were dismissed, because, althou gh the notes stated a maturity date, the lender and the borrower elected not to fix a maturity date in the deed of trust. Accordingly, the action was timely filed as the applicable statute of limitations was 20 years from the date of the deed of trust an d the filings of the bankruptcy petitions by the borrower tolled the statute of limitations when bankruptcy proceedings were pending.

Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. The limitations period in the Virginia wrongful death statute is a substantive limitation. Riddle v. Shell Oil Co., 764 F. Supp. 418, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19448 (W.D. Va. 1990). The two paragraphs of this section are inextricably interrelated, one is the predicate f or the other, and the tolling provisions of § 8.01-229 B do not apply to the time limitation imposed by this section. Horn v. Abernathy, 231 Va. 228, 343 S.E.2d 318, 1986 Va. LEXIS 184 (1986). Subdivision E 3 of § 8.01-229 is inapplicable to wrongful death actions because subs ection B of this section controls. Dodson v. Potomac Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc., 241 Va. 89, 400 S.E.2d 178, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1327, 1991 Va. LEXIS 2 (1991); Flanagan v. Virginia Beach Gen. Hosp., 406 S.E.2d 914, 8 Va. Law Rep. 433, 1991 Va. LEXIS 121 (Va. 19 91). Because § 8.01-229 E 3 deals generally with the subject of tolling statutes of limitations and conflicts with subsection B of this section, which deals specifi cally with the tolling of wrongful death actions, the latter section controls for two reasons: First, § 8.01-228 provides in pertinent part that every action for which a limitation period is prescribed by law must be commenced within the period presc ribed in this chapter unless otherwise specifically provided in the Code. This section provides for the limitation of wrongful death actions and a tolling period in a specific way, and thus otherwise specifically provides its own requirements. Se cond, in construing conflicting statutes, when one statute speaks to a subject in a general way and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, where they conflict the latter prevails. Dodson v. Potomac Mack Sales &amp; Serv., In c., 241 Va. 89, 400 S.E.2d 178, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1327, 1991 Va. LEXIS 2 (1991). Tolling provision amendment not retroactive.  Lower court correctly ruled that plaintiffs wrongful death action was time-barred because plaintiff failed to refile after nonsuit within the time prescribed by wrongful death statute of limitations in effect when original cause of action accrued; tolling provision amendment to wrongful death statute was substantive, not procedural, and therefore did not apply retroactively. Riddett v. Virginia Elec. and Powe r Co., 255 Va. 23, 495 S.E.2d 819, 1998 Va. LEXIS 11 (1998). Joinder of a co-administrator tolled wrongful death action.  Section 8.01-5 permitted the joinder of a second co-administrator to a wrongful death action under the Virginia Wrongful Death Act, § 8.01-50, because the firs t co-administrator was already a party plaintiff; the claims in the suit did not change as a result of the joinder; and the first co-administrators initial filing, without the second co-administrator, of the wrongful death claim tolled the statute of limitations for that claim under subsection B of § 8.01-244. Addison v. Jurgelsky, 281 Va. 205, 704 S.E.2d 402, 2011 Va. LEXIS 16 (2011). Statute of limitations not tolled where plaintiff not qualif ied as personal representative.  When a surviving wife was not qualified as a personal representative in any state when the wife filed a wrongful death suit in Virginia under § 26-59 and subs ection B of § 8.01-50, the wife lacked standing to maintain the action; therefore, the statute of limitations was not tolled by subsection B of § 8.01-244 and the action was properly dismissed. Fowler v. Winchester Med. Ctr., Inc., 266 Va. 131, 580 S.E.2d 816, 2003 Va. LEXIS 68 (2003). Reinstatement after dismissal of cause of action.  Trial court erred in sustaining doctors pleas and dismissing a wrongful death action as barred by subsection B of § 8.01-244 because the statute of limitat ions for wrongful death actions in subsection B of § 8.01-244 did not bar the reinstatement of the personal representatives action, which was dismissed under subsection B of § 8.01-335. Conger v. Barrett, 280 Va. 627, 702 S.E.2d 117, 2010 Va. L EXIS 261 (2010). Tolling provision of the Virginia Medical Malpractice Act, former § 8.01-581.9, which tolled the statute of limitations for 120 days from the giving of notice or 60 days following issuance of an opinion by the medical review panel, applied to the two year limitations contained in the Virginia Wrongful Death Act, § 8.01-50 and subsecti on (B). Wertz v. Grubbs, 245 Va. 67, 425 S.E.2d 500, 9 Va. Law Rep. 750, 1993 Va. LEXIS 17 (1993). Action und er 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  In determining which state statute of limitations applies to a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, a federal court should apply the time bar used by the forum state for s imilar torts. Under this section, the limitations period for a wrongful death action is two years. Bruce v. Smith, 581 F. Supp. 902, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19415 (W.D. Va. 1984). Conversion of foreign personal injury action to Virginia wrongful death action.  A valid foreign personal injury action may be converted to a Virginia wrongful death action, even though the foreign action was not filed within Virginias two -year limitations period. Riddle v. Shell Oil Co., 764 F. Supp. 418, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19448 (W.D. Va. 1990). Motion for leave to amend complaint.  In a wrongful death case brought pursuant to § 8.01-244 in which a personal representative filed an objection to a magistrate judges order denying her moti on for leave to amend the complaint to add a prison health service company as a defendant, the two-year limitations period under §§ 8.01-243 and 8.01-244 had passed, and the cause of action against the company could not be related back to the origi nal filing of the lawsuit. The company had not received notice of the original complaint such that it would not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense; in the first three and a half years following the inmates death, the personal representative, at n o point, served the company with any notice of a potential cause of action against it. Everett v. Cherry, 671 F. Supp. 2d 819, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109983 (E.D. Va. 2009), aff'd, 412 Fed. Appx. 604, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 4234 (4th Cir. 2011). The defendant has the burden of proof to establish facts necessary to prevail on a statu te of limitations plea. Lo v. Burke, 249 Va. 311, 455 S.E.2d 9, 1995 Va. LEXIS 22 (1995). Decedents mothers federal civil rights and state wrongful death claims against a sheriff in her amended complaint survived dismissal because, although the mothers claims against the sheriff were filed after the two-year limitations period under §§ 8.01-243 A and 8.01-244 B had expired, the mothers claims related back to her original complaint, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(3)(B); the she riff reasonably should have known that he was the proper party to the lawsuit because the mothers original complaint described the alleged circumstances occurring in the jail over which sheriff had policy-making authority, the county sheriffs off ice, of which he was in charge, was named as a party, and the original complaint recited that all of the defendants were sued in their individual capacities.

History History. Code 1950, §§ 8-13, 8-15, 8-16; 1964, c. 219; 1966, c. 118; 1972, c. 825; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-245 consolidates limitations applicable to fiduciaries into a single section. Subsection A preserves the former § 8-13 ten-year limitation period as to actions on fiduciary bonds under seal. Thus, while a seal no longer has impact on the limitations period, actions on fiduciary bonds will have a longer statute of limitations than contract actions. See § 8.01-246 (2). Subsection B clarifies former § 8-16, without change in substance (like former § 8-16, the introductory proviso of § 8.01-246 makes it clear that contrac t limitations do not apply to fiduciaries). Subsection C simplifies former § 8-15. Thus, the cause of action against fiduciaries does not generally accrue until the disability is removed, but where an ex ecution against the fiduciary has already been obtained, the cause of action accrues immediately upon failure to satisfy the execution or order. Cross references. As to limitation of action against trustee, see § 64.2-796. Editors note. At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the reference to Title 26 was changed to Part A (§ 64.2-1200 et seq.) of Subtitle IV of Title 64. 2 to conform to the recodification of Title 64.1 by Acts 2012, c. 614, effective October 1, 2012.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . This section is exclusive.  There is no other limitation applicable to the sureties upon the official bonds of executors or administrators, other than that provided by this section. Leake's Ex'r v. Leake, 75 Va. 792, 1881 Va. LEXIS 57 (1881). When action on fiduciary bond accrues.  Action on a fiduciarys bond is barred only after ten years from the accrual of the cause of action  that is, from the return day of execution against fidu ciary, or from the time of the right to require payment or delivery from the fiduciary. Sharpe v. Rockwood, 78 Va. 24, 1883 Va. LEXIS 5 (1883); Morrison v. Lavell, 81 Va. 519, 1886 Va. LEXIS 120 (1886); Robertson v. Gillenwaters, 85 Va. 116, 7 S.E. 371, 1888 Va. LEXIS 17 (1888). But see McCormick v. Wright, 79 Va. 524, 1884 Va. LEXIS 108 (1884). Bond of surety.  Where suit is brought, not on an open account, but on the suretys bond, the ten-year limitation applies under this section. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. v. Lackland, 1 75 Va. 178, 8 S.E.2d 306, 1940 Va. LEXIS 160 (1940). Suit to surcharge or falsify account.  In the absence of fraud or mutual mistake, no suit to surcharge and falsify the account of a receiver, or to hold him or his sureties liable for any balance state d in his account to be in his hands, can be brought, except within ten years after the account had been confirmed, as required by the provisions of this section. Senseny v. Boyd, 114 Va. 308, 76 S.E. 280, 1912 Va. LEXIS 140 (1912). Subsection B does not apply to suit on guardians bond.  It was not the intention of the legislature that subsection B should override the clear language of subsection C. Subsection B has no application to suits by ward s upon the bonds of guardians. Newsom v. Watkins, 168 Va. 370, 191 S.E. 756, 1937 Va. LEXIS 233 (1937). Subsection C prescribes a plain test for determining when the cause of action is to be d eemed to have accrued in suits upon fiduciary bonds. Leake's Ex'r v. Leake, 75 Va. 792, 1881 Va. LEXIS 57 (1881). Decree in favor of distributee.  The statute of limitations in favor of the sureties of fiduciaries did not begin to run in favor of the surety of an executor until a decree against the executor in favor of the distributees of the estate; and this though the surety was not a party to the suit in equity pursuant to which the decree against the executor was rendered. Franklin v. Depriest, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 257, 1856 Va. LEXIS 14 (1856). Bond for balance due on settlement of accounts.  Where an administrator had finally settled his accounts and given bond for the balance due, the statute began to run in favor of his surety on that bond from the time of its execution. Tilson v. Davis, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 92, 1879 Va. LEXIS 49 (1879). Defense of statute by one surety on joint obligation enures to benefit of all.  When the suit is on the joint obligation of all the sureties of an administrator, the defense of the statute by one of them, not being purely personal to him, enu res to the benefit of all. Ashby v. Bell, 80 Va. 811, 1885 Va. LEXIS 116 (1885). Effect of suspension of suit.  A suit was brought on an executors bond and decided in 1858, but, because there was no hand to receive the fund, was retained on docket till 1867, when it was dismissed with leave to reinstate it on motion of any person interested. The suit was reinstated in 1878, and a supplementary suit brought. It was held that the supplementary suit should be deemed a continuation of the original suit, quoad questions ari sing under the statute of limitations. Sharpe v. Rockwood, 78 Va. 24, 1883 Va. LEXIS 5 (1883). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS When action on fiduciary bond accrues.  Executors plea in bar to the statute of limitations was time-barred by the 10-year statute of limitations because the co-trustees surcharge action on the executors bond, which was taken under advisement by the court, began to accrue upon the executors filing of the estates first accounting. Menefee v. Menefee, 94 Va. Cir. 448, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 175 (Chesapeake Nov. 2, 2016). Claim not time-barred.  Heirs claim that the remainder of the deceaseds estate passed to them after the death of a beneficiary was not time-barred; since the claim was to determi ne the ownership of property, and not to state a claim against the estate, the statute of limitations did not apply. Baillio v. Donn, 54 Va. Cir. 279, 2000 Va. Cir.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-246 consolidates the limitations of former §§ 8-13, 8-17, and 8-23. Subdivision 1 incorporates former § 8-17. The term motion has replaced scire facias. See § 8.01-24. With respect to suspension by injunction , cf. § 8.01-229 C. Subdivision 2 applies a five-year limitation generally to written contracts regardless of whether such contracts be under seal. The elimination of the impact of t he seal on the limitation period changes former § 8-13. Subdivision 3 incorporates provisions of former § 8-13 regarding partnership accounts and accounts between merchants. Subdivision 4 continues the former § 8-13 three-year limitation for unwritten contracts. The proviso relating to the application of § 8.2-725, the UCC four-year limitation to contracts for the sale of goods, is the same as that contained in former § 8-13, except for the express stipulation that the UCC limitation, like other contract limitations, has no applicability to an action for injuries to person or to actions for injury to property which is not subject to the contract of sale. The distin ctions contained in this proviso regarding the types of injury and the applicable statute of limitations in products liability actions, § 8.01-243, are in accord with Virginia law. Compare Friedman v. Peoples Serv. Drug Stores, 208 Va. 700, 160 S. E.2d 563 (1968) with Tyler v. R.R. Street &amp; Co., 322 F. Supp. 541 (E.D. Va. 1971).

E &amp; C Coal Co., 647 F. Supp. 268, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18966 (W.D. Va. 1986). To successfully prove a claim of equitable estoppel under Virginia law the party seeking to defeat a plea of the statute of limitations must prove that: (1) a mat erial fact was falsely represented or concealed; (2) the representation or concealment was made with knowledge of the fact; (3) the party to whom the representation was made was ignorant of the truth of the matter; (4) the representation was made with th e intention that the other party should act on it; (5) the other party was induced to act on it; and (6) the party claiming the estoppel was misled to his injury. Alessio v. Adkins, 102 Bankr. 485, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 1132 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1989). Only slightest injury required to start running of limitations period.  In Virginia, only the slightest injury is required to start the running of the limitations period. International Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Marsh &amp; McLennan, Inc., 838 F.2d 124, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 1160 (4th Cir. 1988). Consent to search not a contract.  In action alleging, among other things, that officers to whom plaintiff gave consent to search of home breached agreement by bringing other officers along and sea rching for items not covered by the agreement, plaintiff could not claim the benefit of the five-year limitation on contract actions, as consent to a search is not a contract. Williams v. City of Portsmouth, 538 F. Supp. 74, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12459 ( E.D. Va.), aff'd, 692 F.2d 754 (4th Cir. 1982). Section held ina pplicable.  In action under § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (29 U.S.C. § 185) to vacate an arbitration award, the most closely analogous statute of limitati on under Virginia law was former § 8.01-579 (see now subdivision 5 of § 8.01-581.010), rather than this section or § 8.01-248. Local Union 8181, UMW v. Westmoreland Coal Co., 649 F. Supp. 603, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16893 (W.D. Va. 1986). This dispute did not involve a common law action founded upon an express or implied contract, but rather an employers duty to pay causally related medical ben efits awarded to the claimant by the commission; thus the three year statute of limitations established by this section did not apply.

The words is governed by the law of are substituted for the former words was made and was to be performed in, because the former phrase is more in keeping with modern conflicts of laws principles.

Conflict of Laws, Domicile and Residence, § 39; 12A M.J. Limitation of Actions, §§ 18, 22. CASE NOTES Contract interpreted under law of another state.  In a homeowners breach of contract count based on the application of EIFS, rather than conventional stucco, the three-year statute of limitations from Md. Cod e Ann., § 5-101 of the Courts Article, rather than the five-year subdivision 2 of § 8.01-246 statute of limitations, was applied as the contract specified that it was to be interpreted under Maryland law, and § 8.01-247 provided that the shorter statute of limitations was to be applied to actions for breaches of contracts governed by the law of another state. Hansen v. Stanley Martin Cos., 266 Va. 345, 585 S.E.2d 567, 2003 Va. LEXIS 80 (2003). Claim for breach of oral contract to recover monies lent by the plaintiff to the defendants was barred by the statute of limitations; under Virginias borrowin g statute, since the breach of contract claim was barred by Californias two-year statute of limitations given the plaintiffs concession that she filed the action more than two years after the contract was breached, the claim was also barred in Vi rginia. Johnson v. Brown, 372 F. Supp. 2d 501, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10963 (E.D. Va. 2005). In this breach of contract action, because the limitations period for a written contract was only three years in the District of Columbia, Virginias borrowing statute dictated that the District of Columbias three-year statute of limitations applied in this action; the record reflected that the contract at issue, which required plaintiff to repair the insured property, was performed in the District of Colu mbia, the insured propertys location. Hunter Innovations Co. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 753 F. Supp. 2d 597, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123705 (E.D. Va. 2010). Although the federal court, sitting in diversity, was sitting in Virginia, Virginia law contains a borrowing statute that incorporates another states statute of limitations when that states substantive law governs the contract. Therefore, the parties lawsuit was governed by North Carolinas three-year statute of limitations. River Cmty. Bank, N.A. v. Bank of N.C., No. 4:14-cv-00048, 2015 U. S. Dist. LEXIS 80031 (W.D. Va. June 19, 2015). Repeated defamations do not constitute a continuing tort, such that the statute of limit ations runs only from the last statement, as the courts have uniformly recognized that each separate defamatory statement itself constitutes a separate and distinct cause of action. Lewis v. Gupta, 54 F. Supp. 2d 611, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8379 (E.D. Va. 1999). Action on account stated not barred by statute of limitations.  Because a cause of action based on an account stated between a debtor and a creditor arose when a corporate officer of the debtor signed the statement of account, which contained a forum selection clause designating Virginia as the forum, less than four years before proceedings were commenced on the creditors claim in the debtors bankruptcy, the creditors claim was not barred by the Virginia or Texas statutes of limitations. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors v. Fairchild Dornier GmbH (In re Dornier Aviation (N. Am.) Inc.), No. 02-82003-SSM, No. 02-8199-SSM, 2005 Bankr. LEXIS 561 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Feb. 8, 2005), aff'd, 453 F.3d 225, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 16101 (4th Cir. 2006). § 8.01-247.1. Limitation on action for defamation, etc. Text Every action for injury resulting from libel, slander, insulting words, or defamation shall be brought within one year after the cause of action accrues. If a publisher of statements actionable under this section publishes anonymously or under a false identity on the Internet, an action may be filed under this section an d the statute of limitations shall be tolled until the identity of the publisher is discovered or, by the exercise of due diligence, reasonably should have been discovered.

Libel and Slander, § 45; 12A M.J. Limitation of Actions, § 19. CASE NOTES Voluntary nonsuit tolled statute of limitations.  When a scientist took a voluntary nonsuit in his original state court defamation action against a newspaper, he did so with respect to the set of operative facts underlying his complaint, namely the newspapers publication of a reporters columns. When he filed the instant defamation action in federal court, the tolling provision of § 8.01-229 saved all rights of action arising from that cause of action. Hatfill v. New York Times Co., 416 F.3d 320, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 15471 (4th Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1040, 126 S. Ct. 1619, 164 L. Ed. 2d 333, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 2518 (2006). Republicatio n for purposes of statute of limitation.  Creating hypertext links to previously published statements did not constitute republication for purposes of Virginias one year statute of limitations for def amation actions. Even to the extent that third party electronic references included new comments on the allegedly defamatory materials, those comments did not constitute republication for which the original publisher could be held liable. Lokhova v. Halp er, 441 F. Supp. 3d 238, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34145 (E.D. Va. 2020), aff'd, 995 F.3d 134, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 10796 (4th Cir. 2021). Claim timely.  Because the information provided in a supplemental interrogatory answer, the motion for judgment, and the bill of particulars was consistent with the two statemen ts provided to the jury as consisting of the defamation claim, the first of these statements was pled within the limitations period. Gov't Micro Res., Inc. v. Jackson, 271 Va. 29, 624 S.E.2d 63, 2006 Va. LEXIS 1 (2006). Claim not timely.  Where an allegedly defamatory email was sent on June 11, 2007, plaintiffs defamation claim was barred under the statute of limitations as of June 11, 2008; be cause plaintiff did not file his complaint until August 29, 2008, it was time barred. Cominelli v. Rector &amp; Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 589 F. Supp. 2d 706, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99428 (W.D. Va. 2008), aff'd, 362 Fed. Appx. 359, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 15 62 (4th Cir. 2010). Pro se plaintiffs claim against a doctor could not stand because the claim that the doctor called the police regarding plaintiff appeared to be a defamation c laim that was untimely under the one-year limitation of action in § 8.01-247.1.Vanover v. Shams, No. 1:08cv1037, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111643 (E.D. Va. Oct. 22, 2008), aff'd, 326 Fed. Appx. 166, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 12140 (4th Cir. 2009). Electronic references to articles otherwise time-barred did not bring those earlier publications within Virginias one-year statute of limitations for defamati on under the republication doctrine, as that doctrine typically applied to republication by defendant itself. Lokhova v. Halper, 441 F. Supp. 3d 238, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34145 (E.D. Va. 2020), aff'd, 995 F.3d 134, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 10796 (4th Cir. 2 021). Electronic references to, or distribution of, allegedly defamatory materials did not retrigger Virginias one year statute of limitations under the single publ ication rule. Lokhova v. Halper, 441 F. Supp. 3d 238, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34145 (E.D. Va. 2020), aff'd, 995 F.3d 134, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 10796 (4th Cir. 2021). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Credit card slander claims.  Where a credit card customer raised new slander claims for the first time in an amended motion for judgment and the statute of limitations had not been tolled, th e new claims were barred by the one-year statute of limitations; in addition, because the only alleged claim in the original motion that had not been barred by the statute of limitations was not alleged in the amended motion, there was nothing for the co urt to decide. Armstrong v. Bank of Am., 61 Va. Cir. 131, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 57 (Fairfax County Feb. 6, 2003). Claim timely.  Athletic director was not barred from moving forward with a defamation claim because all newspaper articles were properly before the court, and they related back to the original filing; the statute of limitations was extended by one hundred twenty-six days because of the declaration of judicial emergency for all but a portion of one statement.

Effect of 19 95 amendment.  The 1995 amendment to this section, which extended the limitation period on miscellaneous causes of action to two years, did not apply retroactively to cover plai ntiffs cases. Nothing in the amended statute suggested that it applied retroactively, and in fact, the inclusion of an effective date, July 1, 1995, suggested just the opposite. Michael v. Sentara Health Sys., 939 F. Supp. 1220, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14876 (E.D. Va. 1996). The statute of limitations cannot begin to run against a claim until all the elements o f the cause of action exist and one of the essential elements of a cause of action for personal injury is the injury itself. Brown v. ABC, 704 F.2d 1296, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 28 923 (4th Cir. 1983). Claim based on creditors failure to timely release a lien against a consumers residence after the underlying debt obligation was satisfied was barred by t he statute of limitations, since the limitations period began to run when the creditor failed to file a certificate of satisfaction within the statutory period after payment rather than when the consumer demanded that the creditor record a certificate of satisfaction. Poindexter v. Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp., 792 F.3d 406, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 11650 (4th Cir. 2015). The statute of limitations does not accrue separately for each set of damages that results from a wrongful act. Once a cause of action is complete and the statute of limitations begins to run, it runs against all damages resulting from the wrongful act, even damages which may not arise until a future date. Brown v. ABC, 704 F.2d 1296, 198 3 U.S. App. LEXIS 28923 (4th Cir. 1983). Cause accrues despite lack of quantifiable harm.  Where plaintiff was aware of accountants report letters and their review by third party absence of quantifiable harm as of that time did not mean that plainti ff s cause of action had not yet accrued. Semida v. Rice, 863 F.2d 1156, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17137 (4th Cir. 1988). Tolling of statute.  A statute of limitations is tolled until a person intentionally misled by a putative defendant could reasonably discover the wrongdoing and bring action to redres s it. Under Virginias doctrine of equitable estoppel, however, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would have to do more than show that all of savings and loan directors were implicated in the wrongdoing, and that it was unable to sue un til it became the corporations receiver. The FDIC also would have to show that the directors concealed their wrongdoing from savings and loan, subsidiary, and their shareholders, the parties from whom the FDIC derived its interest in this lawsuit, du ring the period after the last act of alleged misconduct until the FDIC became receiver. It would be for the district court, on remand, to determine the extent to which equitable estoppel tolled Virginias one-year statute of limitations. FDIC v. Cock e, 7 F.3d 396, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 26830 (4th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 807, 115 S. Ct. 53, 130 L. Ed. 2d 12, 1994 U.S. LEXIS 5412 (1994). This section held inapplicable.  A claim which sought to pierce the corporate veil of automobile dealership and impose personal liability on the defendant shareholders for the fraudulent conveyan ce of the dealerships assets was not a fraud claim and thus was subject to limitation period in § 8.01-253 rather than this section. Curley v. Dahlgren Chrysler-Plymouth, Dodge, Inc., 245 Va. 429, 429 S.E.2d 221, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1218, 1993 Va. LEXI S 71 (1993). Section is inapplicable to advance acquisitions.  In determining whether a successor corporations claim for reconveyance of land conveyed by advance acquisition to the Commonwealth of Virginia by a predecesso r under § 33.1-90 [now § 33.2-1005] was timely, a trial court improperly relied upon § 8.01-248, subdivision 4 of § 8.01-246, and § 8.01-255.1, applicable to actions for re-entry upon land for breach of conditions subsequent, was also inap plicable; these provisions were superseded by the more specific time limitations of § 33.1-90, which has a comprehensive and broad scope that in effect contains its own statute of limitations. Commonwealth Transp. Comm'r v. Windsor Indus., 272 Va. 64, 630 S.E.2d 514, 2006 Va. LEXIS 69 (2006). Defamation.  The Virginia Supreme Court has consistently applied the one-year statute of limitation in this section to defamation actions. Morrissey v. William Morrow &amp; Co., 7 39 F.2d 962, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 20133 (4th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1216, 105 S. Ct. 1194, 84 L. Ed. 2d 340, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 965 (1985). This section is applicable to actions for defamation. Welch v. Kennedy Piggly Wiggly Stores, Inc., 63 Bankr. 888 (W.D. Va. 1986). The statute of limitations under the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia for defamation is one year. Lewin v. Medical College, 910 F. Supp. 1161, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1437 (E.D. Va. 1996) (see also 931 F. Supp. 443 (E.D. Va. 1996)). Defamation based on memorandum of lis pendens.  In proceeding on a theory of personal defamation, based on statements made in a memorandum of lis pendens, plaintiffs threshold burden was to prove that defen dants alleged defamatory statements were falsely made. Had defendants prevailed in their action in state court to have fraudulent conveyances set aside, plaintiff would be estopped from pursuing such a claim since defendants assertions would have been adjudged as valid. Thus, it was only after the court ruled in plaintiffs favor (as defendant) that her action for defamation fully accrued. Since she instituted the suit within one year from the date of the state courts final order her defa mation action was timely. Warren v. Bank of Marion, 618 F. Supp. 317, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15785 (W.D. Va. 1985). Transmission of contract file held not republication.  Where employee of company sent contract file with defamatory letter, employees transmission of contract file did not constitute republication since employee h ad no reason to know of defamatory contents of file and did nothing to draw particular attention to letter; since letter was republished at time it was first distributed to company, multiple copies within organization were considered part of aggregate co mmunication, and aggregate communication was treated as single publication for which only one action for damages could have been maintained. Semida v. Rice, 863 F.2d 1156, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17137 (4th Cir. 1988). Slander of title.  The fact that plaintiff instituted an action for slander of title approximately five and one-half years after the filing of defendants memorandum of lis pende ns was not dispositive of her claim for slander of title, since her cause of action did not fully accrue and the limitations period did not begin to run until the defendants released their claim against her property. Since plaintiff filed her action with in one year of this release, she was held not to be barred by application of Virginias statute of limitations for defamation actions (this section), much less its limitations period of injury to property (§ 8.01-243), the court finding it unnecess ary to decide the issue of the applicable limitations period. Warren v. Bank of Marion, 618 F. Supp. 317, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15785 (W.D. Va. 1985). Two-year statute of limitations, as applied to plaintiffs slander of title claim arising out of the alleged wrongful foreclosure of her property, did not begi n to run until defendant ceased to maintain a claim against the subject property. Yerion v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co., 27 F. Supp. 3d 677, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87345 (E.D. Va. 2014). Maritime claims.  When general maritime claims are at issue, the equity rule of laches, rather than any rigid statute of limitations, governs. Moore v. Exxon Transp. Co., 502 F. Su pp. 583, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9539 (E.D. Va. 1980). Unjust enr ichment claims.  Workers compensation insurers cause of action for unjust enrichment, which accrued when the worker was arguably unjustly enriched (when the worker was in receipt of two moneta...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-249"><akn:num>§ 8.01-249</akn:num><akn:heading>When cause of action shall be deemed to accrue in certain personal actions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The cause of action in the actions herein listed shall be deemed to accrue as follows: 1. In ac tions for fraud or mistake, in actions for violations of the Consumer Protection Act (§ 59.1-196 et seq.) based upon any misrepresentation, deception, or fraud, and in actions for rescission of contract for undue influence, when such fraud, mistake, m isrepresentation, deception, or undue influence is discovered or by the exercise of due diligence reasonably should have been discovered; 2. In actions or other proceedings for money on deposit with a bank or any person or corporation doing a banking business, when a request in writing be made therefor by check, order, or o therwise; 3. In actions for malicious prosecution or abuse of process, when the relevant criminal or civil action is terminated; 4. In actions for injury to the person resulting from exposure to asbestos or products containing asbestos, when a diagnosis of asbestosis, interstitial fibrosis, mesothelioma, or other d isabling asbestos-related injury or disease is first communicated to the person or his agent by a physician. However, no such action may be brought more than two years after the death of such person. The diagnosis of a nonmalignant asbestos-related injur y or disease shall not accrue an action based upon the subsequent diagnosis of a malignant asbestos-related injury or disease, and such subsequent diagnosis shall constitute a separate injury that shall accrue an action when such diagnosis is first commu nicated to the person or his agent by a physician; 4a. In actions for injury to the person resulting from the exposure to a substance or a combination of substances or the use of a product, when such injury is latent, other than (i) tho se asbestos-related injuries specified in subdivision 4 and (ii) claims against health care providers as defined in § 8.01-581.1, when the person knew or should have known of the injury and its causal connection to an injury-causing substance or produ ct. However, no such action may be brought more than two years after the death of such person. For purposes of this subdivision, latent refers to injuries that remain dormant or do not develop and, therefore, are undiagnosable during the period o f limitations set forth in subsection A of § 8.01-243; 5. In actions for contribution or for indemnification, when the contributee or the indemnitee has paid or discharged the obligation. A third-party claim permitted by subsection A of § 8.01-281 and the Rules of Court may be asserted before such cause of action is deemed to accrue hereunder; 6. In actions for injury to the person, whatever the theory of recovery, resulting from sexual abuse occurring during the infancy or incapacity of the person, upon the later of the remova l of the disability of infancy or incapacity as provided in § 8.01-229 or when the fact of the injury and its causal connection to the sexual abuse is first communicated to the person by a licensed physician, psychologist, or clinical psychologist. As used in this subdivision, sexual abuse means sexual abuse as defined in subdivision 6 of § 18.2-67.10 and acts constituting rape, sodomy, object sexual penetration or sexual battery as defined in Article 7 (§ 18.2-61 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 18.2; 7. In products liability actions against parties other than health care providers as defined in § 8.01-581.1 for injury to the person resulting from or arising as a result of the impla ntation of any prosthetic device for breast augmentation or reconstruction, when the fact of the injury and its causal connection to the implantation is first communicated to the person by a physician; 8. In actions on an open account, from the later of the last payment or last charge for goods or services rendered on the account; 9. In products liability actions against parties other than health care providers as defined in § 8.01-581.1 for injury to the person resulting from or arising as a result of the impla ntation of any medical device, when the person knew or should have known of the injury and its causal connection to the device.

Sess. I, c. 195. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-249 provides that certain causes of action should not accrue for the purpose of applying statutes of limitation until the damage or injury is discove rable by the plaintiff. While this represents an exception to the general rule embodied in § 8.01-230 that a cause of action shall be deemed to accrue when the wrong occurs or when the technical breach of contract duty occurs, § 8.01-249 follows Vi rginia law. Subsection 1 incorporates former § 8-14 which tolled the statute of limitations in cases of fraud or mistake in the payment of money. The subsection extends th e principle to all situations of fraud, mistake or undue influence. Subsection 2 is an incorporation without substantive change of a proviso from former § 8-13 regarding the necessity for demand in actions for money on deposit before a cause of action shall be deemed to accrue. Subsection 3 recognizes the common-law action for malicious prosecution, or abuse of process and provides that the statute of limitations, § 8.01-248, does not begin to run until the determination of the associated criminal or civil action (in favor of the defendant who is the plaintiff in the civil action). Cross references. For provisions concerning change of venue, with exception for actions arising under subdivision 4 of this section, see § 8.01-265. Editors note.

Manufacturers and Suppliers of Equipment and Machinery. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. A.General Cons ideration. Section does not violate due process clause.  It is only when a right has accrued or a claim has arisen that it is subject to the protection of the due process clause. This section merely prevents what might otherwise be a cause of action from ever arising and therefore does not violate the due process clause. Hess v. Snyder Hunt Corp., 240 Va. 49, 392 S.E.2d 817, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2565, 1990 Va. LEXIS 104 (1990). Section is not a true statute of limitations but a cutoff provision that operate s to define the maximum period within which an action may be brought, regardless of applicable statutes of limitations. Lavery v. Automation Mgt. Consultants, Inc., 234 Va. 145, 360 S.E.2d 336, 4 Va. Law Rep. 543, 1987 Va. LEXIS 255 (1987). This section is not a statute of limitations. School Bd. v. United States Gypsum Co., 234 Va. 32, 360 S.E.2d 325, 4 Va. Law Rep. 592, 1987 Va. LEXIS 244 (1987). This section is not a statute of limitations, but a statute of repose, something in fact, different in concept, definition, and function. Commonwealth v. Owens-Co rning Fiberglas Corp., 238 Va. 595, 385 S.E.2d 865, 6 Va. Law Rep. 765, 1989 Va. LEXIS 179 (1989). Application of decisions under former statute apply under current statute.  Virginias statute of repose, originally codified at § 8-24.2, and current § 8.01-250 contain virtually identical language. Moreover, all courts apply th e decisional law construing former § 8-24.2 when addressing issues arising under the more recently enacted § 8.01-250. Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Target Stores, Inc., 290 F. Supp. 2d 674, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20274 (E.D. Va. 2003). This section is not a procedural statute. School Bd. v. United States Gypsum Co., 234 Va. 32, 360 S.E.2d 325, 4 Va. Law Rep. 592, 1987 Va. LEXIS 244 (1987). The statute, by its express terms, is restricted in its application to what are in effect tort actions to recover for injury to property or persons and not to actions in contract. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Bristol Steel &amp; Iron Works, Inc., 722 F.2d 1160, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 14854 (4th Cir. 1983). Rights bestowed by this section upon defendants (which arose when statutory period expired) are substantive if not vested and, as such, may not be impaired by retroactive application of § 8.01-250.1.School Bd. v. United States Gypsum Co., 234 Va. 32, 360 S.E.2d 325, 4 Va. Law Rep. 592, 1987 Va. LEXIS 244 (1987). General Assembly intended this section to be a statute of repose. The time limitation in such a statute begins to run from the occurrence of an event unrelated to the accrual of a cause of action, and the expiration of the time extinguishes not only the legal remedy but also all causes of action, including those which may later accrue as we ll as those already accrued. School Bd. v. United States Gypsum Co., 234 Va. 32, 360 S.E.2d 325, 4 Va. Law Rep. 592, 1987 Va. LEXIS 244 (1987). Lapse of statutory period extinguishes all rights, including th ose arising from later injury.  As a statute of repose, this section is a redefinition of the substantive rights and obligations of the parties to any litigation arising out of the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property. Specifically, the lapse of the statutory period was meant to extinguish all the rights of a plaintiff, including those which might arise from an injury sustained later, and to grant a defendan t immunity from liability for all the torts specified in the statute. School Bd. v. United States Gypsum Co., 234 Va. 32, 360 S.E.2d 325, 4 Va. Law Rep. 592, 1987 Va. LEXIS 244 (1987). The lapse of the statutory period was meant to extinguish all the rights of a plaintiff, including those which might arise from an injury sustained later, and to grant a defendant immunity from liability for all the torts specified in the statute, which itself is only applicable to those torts specified. Tate v. Colony House Bldrs., Inc., 257 Va. 78, 508 S.E.2d 597, 1999 Va. LEXIS 8 (1999). Commencement of the limitations period.  There was no evidence to support the contention that third-party defendant construction fill dirt supplier exercised control over the installation of the fill and the fill constituted an ordinary building material, so the liability of the supplier was governed by the provisions of Virginias Statute of Repose; at bottom, the suppliers performance and furnishing was limited to the furnishing of the fill and it had no involvement with other aspects of the construction project, so the limitations period commenced running when the supplier completed its delivery of the fill. Under any reasonable construction of the statute, the action was not commence d within the five-year period, so the court granted summary judgment to the supplier. Kohl's Dep't Stores, Inc. v. Target Stores, Inc., 290 F. Supp. 2d 674, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20274 (E.D. Va. 2003). Inapplicable to action arising out of contract of indemnity.  An action not sounding in tort, but arising out of a specific written contract of indemnity, is outside the scope of this section. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Brist ol Steel &amp; Iron Works, Inc., 722 F.2d 1160, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 14854 (4th Cir. 1983); Jordan v. Sandwell, Inc., 189 F. Supp. 2d 406, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1739 (W.D. Va. 2002). Fraud.  Fraud is not a tort specified in this statute because the wrongful act involved in fraud is aimed at the person; because fraud invariably acts upon the person of the victim, rather than upon property, its consequence is personal damage rather than injury to property. Tate v. Colony House Bldrs., Inc., 257 Va. 78, 508 S.E.2d 597, 1999 Va. LEXIS 8 (1999). Claim for brea ch of warranty.  In an action arising from the eruption of superheated water from a tower at a paper mill, which burned the plaintiffs back, the plaintiff could not escape the effect of statute of repose by asserting a claim for breach of warranty against the designers of the paper mill as the object of the action was still to recover for personal injury. Jordan v. Sandwell, Inc., 189 F. Supp. 2d 406, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17 39 (W.D. Va. 2002). Actions against architectural and engineering firm ar ose out of contract and were outside scope of section.  Where transit authority asserted breach of contract, negligence, and breach of warranties claims against architectural and engineering firm, despite firms arg ument that the claims sounded in tort because they arose out of alleged negligence, this was a contract action and was outside the scope of this section. Delon Hampton &amp; Assocs. v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 943 F.2d 355, 1991 U.S. App . LEXIS 17765 (4th Cir. 1991). Inapplicable to products liability action concerning asbestos-containi ng products.  This section did not apply to a products liability action brought by insulation workers against the manufacturer of asbestos-containing products because the harmf ul exposure occurred prior to the point at which insulation products were incorporated into realty.

No execution shall be issued and no action brought on a judgment da ted on or after July 1, 2021, including a judgment in favor of the Commonwealth and a judgment rendered in another state or country, after 10 years from the date of such judgment or domestication of such judgment, unless the period is extended as provide d in this section, except that no execution shall be issued and no action brought on a judgment dated on or after July 1, 2021, that was created by nonpayment of child support after 20 years from the date of such judgment or domestication of such judgmen t. B. The limitat ion prescribed in subsection A may be extended by the recordation of a certificate in the form provided in subsection G prior to the expiration of the limitation period prescribed herein in the clerks office in which such judgment is recorded and exe cuted by either the judgment creditor or his assignee or by the judgment creditors or his assignees attorney or authorized agent. Recordation of the certificate shall extend the limitations period of the right to enforce such judgment for 10 year s from the date of the recordation of the certificate. A judgment creditor or his assignee may record one additional extension by recording another certificate in the form provided in subsection G prior to the expiration of the original 10-year extension of the limitation period, which shall extend the limitations period of the right to enforce such judgment for 10 years from the date of recordation of the second certificate. The clerk of the court shall index the certificate in both names in the index of the judgment lien book and give reference to the book and page in which the original li en is recorded. This procedure is subject to the exception that if the action is against a personal representative of a decedent, the motion shall be within two years from the date of his qualification, the extension may be for only two years from the ti me of the recordation of the certificate, and there may be only one such extension. C. No suit sha ll be brought to enforce the lien of any judgment, including judgments in favor of the Commonwealth, upon which the right to issue an execution or bring an action is barred by other subsections of this section, nor shall any suit be brought to enforce th e lien of any judgment against the lands that have been conveyed by the judgment debtor to a grantee for value, unless the same be brought within five years from the due recordation of the deed from such judgment debtor to such grantee and unless a notic e of lis pendens shall have been recorded in the manner provided by § 8.01-268 before the expiration of such five-year period. D. In computin g the time, any time during which the right to sue out execution on the judgment is suspended by the terms thereof, or by legal process, shall be omitted. §§ 8.01-230 et seq., 8.01-247 and 8.01-256 shall apply to the right to bring such action in l ike manner as to any right. E. This sectio n shall not be construed to impair the right of subrogation to which any person may become entitled while the lien is in force, provided that he institutes proceedings to enforce such right within five years after the same accrued, nor shall the lien of a judgment be impaired by the recovery of another judgment thereon, or by a forthcoming bond taken on an execution thereon, such bond having the force of a judgment. F. Limitations on enforcement of judgments entered in the general district courts shall be governed by § 16.1-94.1, unless an abstract of such judgment is docketed in the judgment book of a circuit court. Upon docketing such judgment, such judgment shall be treated as a judgment entered by the circuit court and may be extended in the same manner as a judgment entered by the circuit court, although the original date of entry of the judgment shall remain the date that was entered by the general district court.

The 2002 amendment by c. 394, in subsection G, added the language following § 16.1-94.1 in the first sentence, and added the second sentence. The 2005 amendments. The 2005 amendments by cc. 139 and 203 are nearly identical, and in subsection A, inserted and a judgment rendered in another state or country and or domestication of such judgment; and made minor stylistic changes.

Any such motion shall be filed within the 20-year period from the date of the original judgment or from the date of the latest extension thereof. If upon the hearing of the motion the court decides that there is no good cause shown for not extending the period of limitation, the order shall so state and the period of limitation mentioned in subsection A shall be extended for an additional 20 years from the date of filing of the motion to extend. Additional extensions may be granted upon the same procedure, subject in each case to the recording provisions prescribed in § 8.01-458. This extension procedure is subject to the exception that if the action is against a personal representative of a decedent, the motion shall be within two years from the date of his qualification, the extension may be for only two years from the time of the filing of the motion, and there may be only one such extension; and added subsection H.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms the act of limitations and this section, as use d below, refer to former provisions. Section is not applicable to commissioners suit to vacate deed to debtor.  This section refers to suits by creditors to annul voluntary conveyances by their debtors to third persons in derogation of the creditors rights, and not to a suit by a commissioner to vacate a deed executed by him to a debtor upon the ground of misrepresentation on the part of the grantee that the purchase price had been paid. Williams v. Blakey, 76 Va. 254, 1882 Va. LEXIS 27 (1882). Nor is it applicable t o fraudulent conveyances.  The limitations prescribed by this section, within which to bring a suit to set aside a voluntary conveyance, has no application to an attack on a conveyance on t he ground of actual fraud. Kinney v. Craig, 103 Va. 158, 48 S.E. 864, 1904 Va. LEXIS 22 (1904) (see also Atkinson v. Solenberger, 112 Va. 667, 72 S.E. 727 (1911)). Action claiming personal liability of corporate shareholders for fraudulent conveyance not fraud.  A claim which sought to pierce the corporate veil of automobile dealership and impose personal liability on the defendant shareholders for the fraudulent conveyan ce of the dealerships assets was not a fraud claim and thus was subject to limitation period in this section rather than § 8.01-248. Curley v. Dahlgren Chrysler-Plymouth, Dodge, Inc., 245 Va. 429, 429 S.E.2d 221, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1218, 1993 Va. LEXI S 71 (1993). Cases of actual fraud are not included under this section. Snoddy v. Haskins, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 363, 1855 Va. LEXIS 26 (1855); Flook v. Armentrout, 100 Va. 638, 42 S.E. 686, 1902 Va. LEXIS 70 (1902); Kinney v. Craig, 103 Va. 158, 48 S.E. 864, 1904 Va. LEXIS 22 (1904). It does not pr otect property in hands of distributee.  This section does not protect from liability for decedents debts property which has passed into the hands of distributees. Coles v. Ballard, 78 Va. 139, 1883 Va. LEXIS 21 (1883). Exceptions to the operation of this section must be found in the statute itself, for the doctrine of an inherent equity creating an exception where the statute creates none, is now universally exploded. Bickle v. Chrisman, 76 Va. 678, 1882 Va. LEXIS 68 (1882); Matthews &amp; Co. v. Progress Distilling Co., 108 Va. 777, 62 S.E. 924, 1 908 Va. LEXIS 96 (1908). Running of statute is not postponed until settlement is made.  The running of the act of limitation to suits to avoid voluntary conveyances is not postponed simply because no settlement has been had between the parties and th e exact amount due has not been ascertained. Vashon v. Barrett, 99 Va. 344, 38 S.E. 200, 1901 Va. LEXIS 48 (1901). Voluntary conveyance b etween husband and wife.  In the absence of fraud, a suit by creditors to annul a conveyance to a husband in trust for his wife, on the ground that the consideration was paid by the husban d, is barred in five years. Welsh v. Solenberger, 85 Va. 441, 8 S.E. 91, 1888 Va. LEXIS 53 (1888). Bankruptcy trustees action to avoid debtors transfer was timely.  Chapter 7 trustees action to avoid a debtors July 16, 2004, transfer of its interest in a limited liability company to its president was viable because th e debtor commenced the bankruptcy case on April 3, 2006, and the statute of limitations for an action to avoid a voluntary transfer under § 55-81 was five years under § 8.01-253 and the action under § 55-80 for a fraudulent transfer was subject only to laches. Bartl v. Ochsner (In re Ichiban, Inc.), No. 06-10316-SSM, No. 06-1134, 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 1255 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Apr. 4, 2007). Marriage settlement.  Under this section, a marriage settlement cannot be avoided on the ground that it is voluntary after five years from the date of its admission to record, no actua l fraud being charged. McCue v. Harris, 86 Va. 687, 10 S.E. 981, 1890 Va. LEXIS 34 (1890). Burden of proving time of transfer.  The burden of proving that the transfer, alleged to be voluntary, was made more than five years before the institution of the suit to have it set aside is on the party pleading the statute. Vashon v. Barrett, 99 Va. 344, 38 S.E. 200, 1901 Va. LEXIS 48 (1901). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  Statute did not apply in plaintiffs action seeking recission; the statute applies to scenarios involving third-party creditors who file suit to set aside volu ntary conveyances that would allow the transferor to avoid a judgment. Good v. Weaver, 98 Va. Cir. 493, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 330 (Rockingham County Aug. 22, 2016). Fraudulent conveyance.  It is clear from the absence of a specified statute of limitations for fraudulent conveyance that the General Assembly intended there be no set limitation on the period during which such claims could be advanced, so as to not allow fraudulent transfers or those designed to hinder creditors to become legal merely by the expiration of a fixed period of time; at the same time the law will not suffer a plaintiff who does not timely assert its equitable remedies.

Section 8.01-234 provides that an action barred by a statute of limitations is not revived by repeal of that limitation provision. This section provides that the 1977 amendments to the limitation provisions a re inapplicable to any cause of action that accrued prior to the effective date of those amendments. Saunders v. H.K.

Limitations periods for causes of action existing before October 1, 1977.  Circuit court did not err in granting the plea in bar of the statute of limitations in a civil action concerning alleged sexual abuse that occurred between 1971 a nd 1975 because the sexual abuse plaintiff suffered as a child inherently caused her injury when it occurred; under the former statutes of limitations, the limitations period on those claims began to run when plaintiff reached the age of majority in Marc h 1975 and expired two years later in March 1977; and all of plaintiffs causes of action existed before the effective date of Title 8.01 on October 1, 1977, and, thus, § 8.01-249, regarding the accrual date for a cause of action regarding sexual a buse of a child, did not apply.

Law Rep. 1604, 1990 Va. LEXIS 42 (1990). Denial of transfer was abuse o f discretion.  Denial of defendant railroads motion to transfer a Federal Employers Liability Act action was an abuse of discretion, where the trial court was presented with sufficient information to show good cause to transfer, including substantial inconvenience to the parties and witnesses, as well as indications of a forum originally selected for not simply justice, but perhaps justice blended with some harassment.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Venue proper.  Because the circuit court had personal jurisdiction over relatives based upon their minimum contacts with Virginia, venue was properly laid in Virginia in a lawye rs declaratory judgment action under the Virginia Declaratory Judgment Act, § 8.01-184 et seq., seeking a declaratory judgment regarding his rights and responsibilities under powers of attorney; the relatives executed the powers of attorney in Vir ginia and returned to Virginia to meet again with the lawyer, and by voluntarily creating a continuing relationship with the lawyer, who maintained an office and performed work for the relatives in Virginia, the relatives purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities within the Commonwealth.

No order, judgment, or decree shall be voidable, avoided, or sub ject to collateral attack solely on the ground that there was improper venue; however, nothing herein shall affect the right to appeal an error of court concerning venue. History History. 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-258 distinguishes between jurisdiction and venue. Historically, the concept of venue has dealt with the place where a suit is commenced and jurisdict ion deals with service of process and the power of the court to act. Yet, chapter 3 of former Title 8 made no reference to such a distinction, and confusion arose because of the multiplicity of venue provisions, the employment of jurisdiction whe n venue is meant (e.g., former §§ 8-42, 8-133; Lucas v. Biller, 204 Va. 309, 130 S.E.2d 582 (1963)), and limitations on the service of process (e.g., to the county of commencement in many actions; see former §§ 8-39 and 8-47). Moreove r, whenever venue was required to be laid in a certain county and the result of improper venue was dismissal or a void judgment, then the effect of venue was jurisdictional. E.g., former § 8-38 (9) as construed by Davis v. Marr, 200 Va. 479, 106 S.E.2 d 722 (1959). Several changes have been made in Title 8.01 to eliminate process and jurisdiction: (1) Statewide service of process in all civil actions is authorized. (2) Objections to venue are waived unless raised on or before the day of trial if in a general district court or if in a circuit court within 21 days after servic e of process commencing the action or within such other time as is fixed for filing of responsive pleadings. (3) Appropriately filed objection to improper choice of venue results not in dismissal, but rather in transfer of the action to a proper venue with the costs of t ransfer paid by the party responsible for laying improper venue. See, e.g., §§ 8.01-264, 8.01-266. (4) A judgment is not subject to collateral attack on the sole ground that the suit was commenced in an improper place. However, the right to appeal a ruling of t he court concerning venue is preserved. See §§ 8.01-258 and 8.01-267. Law Review.

History History. 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Sections 8.01-260 to 8.01-262 can be considered together. They indicate those forums where venue is proper in any action, other than those excluded by § 8.01-2 59. Sections 8.01-260 to 8.01-262 are made subject to § 8.01-264 to emphasize that venue not laid in accordance with the provisions of these sections must be objec ted to before the action will be transferred to a court of proper venue. Also, these three sections are made subject to § 8.01-265 to establish the priority of the forum non conveniens provisions of that section over the more specific venue provisions of §§ 8.01-261 and 8.01-262. Furthermore, while § 8.01-260 states that venue is proper only if laid pursuant to §§ 8.01-261 and 8.01-262, it should be understood that §§ 8.01-264 and 8.01-265 prevent any such preferred  or permissible venue from being jurisdictional. Category A (§ 8.01-261), Preferred Venue, generally lists those actions where so-called mandatory venue was applicable under former provisions of the C ode. However, Category A (§ 8.01-261), like Category B (§ 8.01-262), does not have jurisdictional effect and improper venue is waived if not affirmatively pleaded. Category B (§ 8.01-262), Permissible Venue, lists those forums in which venue is proper in actions other than those listed in Category A and other than those e xcluded by § 8.01-259; thus, Category B will be applicable to most actions.

In any action for the collection of state, county, or municipal taxes, any one of the following counties or cities shall be deemed preferred places of venue: (1) Wherein the taxpayer resides; (2) Wherein the taxpayer owns real or personal property; (3) Wherein the taxpayer has a registered office, or regularly or systematically conducts business; or (4) In case of withdrawal from the Commonwealth by a delinquent taxpayer, wherein venue was proper at the time the taxes in question were assessed or at the time of such withdrawal. b. In any action for the correction of an erroneous assessment of state taxes and tax refunds, any one of the following counties or cities shall be deemed preferred places of venue: (1) Wherein the taxpayer resides; (2) Wherein the taxpayer has a registered office or regularly or systematically conducts business; (3) Wherein the taxpayers real or personal property involved in such a proceeding is located; or (4) The Circuit Court of the City of Richmond. 14. In proceedings by writ of quo warranto: a. The city or county wherein any of the defendants reside; b. If the defendant is a corporation, the city or county where its registered office is or where its mayor, rector, president, or other chief officer resides; or c. If there is no officer or none of the defendants reside in the Commonwealth, venue shall be in the City of Richmond. 15. In proceedings to award an injunction: a. To any judgment or judicial proceeding of a circuit court, venue shall be in the court in the county or city in which the judgment was rendered or such proceeding is pending; b. To any judgment or judicial proceeding of a district court, venue shall be in the circuit court of the county or city in which the judgment was rendered or such proceeding is pend ing; or c. To any other act or proceeding, venue shall be in the circuit court of the county or city in which the act is to be done, or being done, or is apprehended to be done or the procee ding is pending. 16. [Repealed.] 17. In disbarment or suspension proceedings against any attorney-at-law, in the county or city where the defendant: a. Resides; b.

History History. 1977, c. 617; 1978, c. 334; 1979, c. 331; 1985, c. 433; 1987, c. 567; 1988, c. 766; 1989, c. 556; 1990, c. 831; 1993, c. 841. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Category A lists certain actions and denominates specific forums as the proper venue for those actions (subject to §§ 8.01-264 and 8.01-265). Under former V irginia statutes and case law, in the situations listed in Category A, venue was generally exclusive or mandatory, and timely objection to venue improperly laid would result in dismissal of the action. Also, if no timely objection were brought and such a n action proceeded to judgment, such judgment was void and subject to collateral attack. Thus, mandatory venue related more to jurisdiction than to venue. To further clarify the distinction between venue and jurisdiction, Category A uses the term preferred venue to refer to those situations in which venue ha d heretofore generally been denominated as mandatory or exclusive. Preferred venue is not jurisdictional since, under §§ 8.01-258 and 8.01-264, dismissal is not available as a remedy for improper venue and a judgment rendere d cannot be voided or collaterally attacked on such grounds. Instead, upon timely objection, the action shall be transferred to a preferred forum under this section, and, if no timely objection is made, the venue defect is waived. Subsection 1 is § 9-6.14:5 of the Administrative Process Act of 1975. In general, this subsection has eliminated the necessity for citizens being forced to go to Richmond in order to challenge administrative actions or to protect their rights against adverse administrative decisions. Subsection 2 changes the venue in former §§ 8-38 (9), 8-40 and 8-752 and establishes venue as the county or city where any defendant public officer has his official office. This provision comports with subsection 1. Subsection 3 collects in a single provision those local actions where the situs of realty has traditionally been considered the principal place of venue. With the exception of subsection 8, subsections 5 through 10 designate preferred venue in certain actions where venue was previously mandatory. Subsection 8 also consolidates venue references of former §§ 64.1-24, 64.1-30 and 64.1-34 (probate of a will is not included; for venue, see § 64.1-75). Subsection 11 restates the concept of former § 8-522. The language of former § 8-522 pertaining to the principal defendant and those jointly liable with him has been changed to those liable with or to him. This change is made to clarify the concept that potential defendants are not only those primarily liable with the principal debtor but also those who are potentially liable to the principa l debtor. Subsection 12 changes former § 8-703 which required that proceedings involving partition of personal property be brought in the jurisdiction wherein the pr operty, or the greater part thereof, is located. To avoid having to determine where the greatest share of the property is to be found, the subsection permits venue where any part of the personal property in question is located. This is the same venue criterion applied to the recovery of personal property; see subsection 5 of § 8.01-262. Because the property to be partitioned may be distinct and separately located from the evidence of that property, (e.g., stock certificate as evidence of corporat e ownership), paragraph (b) permits the latter as an additional venue site. So that the party seeking to partition personal property will be insured of a forum in which to proceed, if venue cannot lie pursuant to paragraphs a and b, parag raph c permits venue where the plaintiff resides. Subsection 13 amends the provisions of T...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-262"><akn:num>§ 8.01-262</akn:num><akn:heading>Category B or permissible venue</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In any actions to which this chapter applies except those actions enumerated in Category A where preferred venue is specified, one or more of the following counties or cities shall be permissible forums, such forums being sometimes referred to as Category B in this title: 1. Where in the defendant resides or has his principal place of employment or, if the defendant is not an individual, wherein its principal office or principal place of business is located; 2. Wherein the defendant has a registered office, has appointed an agent to receive process, or such agent has been appointed by operation of the law; or, in case of withdrawal from the C ommonwealth by such defendant, wherein venue herein was proper at the time of such withdrawal; 3. Provided there exists any practical nexus to the forum including, but not limited to, the location of fact witnesses, plaintiffs, or other evidence to the action, wherein the defendant regularly conducts substantial business activity, or in the case of withdrawal from the Commonwealth by such defendant, wherein venue herein was proper at the time of such withdrawal; 4. Wherein the cause of action, or any part thereof, arose; 5. In actions to recover or partition personal property, whether tangible or intangible, the county or city: a. Wherein such property is physically located; or b. Wherein the evidence of such property is located; c. And if subdivisions a and b do not apply, wherein the plaintiff resides. 6. In actions against a fiduciary as defined in § 8.01-2 appointed under court authority, the county or city wherein such fiduciary qualified; 7. In actions for improper message transmission or misdelivery wherein the message was transmitted or delivered or wherein the message was accepted for delivery or was misdelivered; 8. In actions arising based on delivery of goods, wherein the goods were received; 9. If there is no other forum available in subdivisions 1 through 8 of this category, then the county or city where the defendant has property or debts owing to him subject to seizure by any civil process; or 10. Wherein any of the plaintiffs reside if (i) all of the defendants are unknown or are nonresidents of the Commonwealth or if (ii) there is no other forum available under any other pr ovisions of § 8.01-261 or this section. History History. 1977, c. 617; 1978, c. 414; 1979, c. 331; 1985, c. 213; 1999, c. 73; 2004, c. 979; 2013, cc. 71, 103. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Category B, permissible venue, is applicable to most actions  specifically to those actions for which no preferred forum is designated in Category A, § 8. 01-261, and which are not excluded by § 8.01-259. The provision that one or more of the forums listed in subsections 1 through 9 are permissible, gives the plaintiff the choice of the forums enumerated. Subsection 10 is a last resort provisio n, giving the plaintiff a forum where no forum is available under any other provision of §§ 8.01-260 to 8.01-262. Together with § 8.01-263, subsection 1 incorporates former § 8-38 (1) (i.e., the residence of any defendant) and adds the defendants place of employmen t. Section 16.1-76 provides for venue at the defendants place of employment in actions in general district courts, and subsection 1 provides the same venue for all courts. Subsection 2 incorporates the substance of former § 8-38 (2) and (6) and extends these provisions to all defendants, i.e., it provides plaintiffs with at least one forum against partnerships, unincorporated associations, and individuals, as well as corporations, which are engaged in activities requiring registration or appointment of agents for service of process. The provision for principal office in former § 8-38 (2) is deleted as redundant because it is covered in § 8.01-262 (3); similarly, the provision f or venue where a corporations mayor, rector, president or other chief officer resides was deleted since subsection 1 of § 8.01-262 and subsections 3 and 10 of § 8.01-262, combine to provide at least one forum for the plaintiff against resident or nonresident defendants generally. While subsection 3 has no statutory antecedent, it establishes a logical forum when considered in the context of fairness and convenience of the parties. Subsection 4 incorporates former § 8-39. With the adoption of statewide service of process, § 8.01-292, venue based on where the cause of action arose will no longer be subject to a potential process limitation. Cf. former § 8-47. Subsection 5 reflects common-law practice in that the most convenient forum for such actions is often the forum wherein such property is located. Subsection 6 is essentially former § 8-38 (5). [Venue under this subsection is the same as venue based on a fiduciarys residence under proposed sub section 1. Dowdy v. Franklin, 203 Va. 7, 121 S.E.2d 817 (1961). Venue based on the fiduciarys place of employment under proposed subsection 1 can, however, be different than that based on the place of qualification or residence.] Subsection 7 incorporates § 56-474 by providing forums in actions against telephone and telegraph companies for improper transmission of messages. Subsection 8 extends § 3.1-720 to make the place of receipt a place of permissible venue in any action based on the delivery of goods. Subsection 9 is primarily applicable to in personam actions where seizure of property is used as a means of bringing a nonresident defendant before the court. The forums already available to the plaintiff under subsections 1 through 8 will usually encompass the place where the defendant has property or debts subject to seizure. Only when no other forum is available under these subsections will the location of def endants debts or property become a basis of venue. Subsection 10 provides the plaintiff with at least one forum, i.e., in the county or city where he resides when all the defendants are nonresidents or are unknown and when there is no other forum available under any other provision of §§ 8.01-260 to 8.01-262. This subsection includes the former venue provisions of the Virginia long-arm statutes, § 8-81.4, and the nonresident and unknown motor vehicle statutes, former §§ 8-38 (6a) and (6b), 38.1-381 (e). The 1999 amendment, in subdivision 10, substituted Wherein any plaintiffs reside if for In actions in which, inserted the clause (i) and (ii) designations, and deleted then the county or city where any of the plaintiffs reside following or this section. The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendment by c. 979 substituted substantial for affairs or in subdivision 3. The 2013 amendments. The 2013 amendments by cc. 71 and 103 are identical, and substituted not an individual, wherein its principal office or principal place of business is located  for a corporation, wherein its mayor, rector, president or other chief officer resides at the end of subdivision 1; added the proviso at the beginning of subdivision 3; and in subdivision 5, changed the clause designators from (a) through (c ) to a. through c. and substituted subdivisions a and b for subdivisions 5 (a) and 5 (b) in subdivision 5 c.; and made a minor stylistic change.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . An action for breach of contract may be brought in the jurisdiction where the contract i s made, or in that in which a breach occurs. Big Seam Coal Corp. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., 196 Va. 590, 85 S.E.2d 239, 1955 Va. LEXIS 129 (1955). An action against a liability insurer by the injured party under the contract provision required by § 38.1-380 (see now § 38.2-2200) may be brought in the county or city where execution on the judgment against the insured is returned unsatisfied. Virginia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Saccio, 204 Va. 769, 133 S.E.2d 268, 1963 Va. LEXIS 211 (1963). Action for breach of collective bargaining agreement.  An individual employee and member of a labor union may sue his employer for a breach of a collective bargaining agreement between the union and the employer in a State court. Pearman v. Industrial Rayon Corp., 207 Va. 854, 153 S.E.2d 227, 1967 Va. LEXIS 146 (1967). Where cause of action on modified contract arises.  A corporation, at its home office, employed an agent to sell its stock. Subsequently it informed the agent by telegram, in answer to a telegram from him, that it had no more stock for sale, but that he could continue to sell stock in conjunction with another, who had an option on all the stock left, and divide commissions with him. It was held that this was not a new contract, but a modification of the original a greement, and that an action to recover commissions on stock sold before and after the telegram must be brought within the jurisdiction of the home office of the corporation and could not be maintained in the jurisdiction where the telegram was received by the agent.

If on e or more of the parties is entitled to preferred venue, and such action is commenced in any such forum; provided that in any action where there are one or more residents and one or more nonresidents or parties unknown, venue shall be proper (preferred o r permissible, as the case may be) as to at least one resident defendant; 2. In all other cases, if the venue is proper as to any party. History History. 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-263 is necessary in order for the other venue provisions to function effectively in multiple party situations. Thus, by subsection 1, where any party is entitled to a preferred forum under § 8.01-261, venue will not be transferred pursuant to §§ 8.01-264, 8.01-265, if the action is commenced in a preferred forum to which any other party is entitled pursuant to § 8.01-261. The proviso to subsection 1 reflects former § 8-38 (7), and gives preference to resident defendants when both resident and nonresident defendants are involved in an action. Where subsection 1 does not apply, subsection 2 simplifies matters by recognizing no priorities. It allows the action to be maintained so long as venue is proper as to any one party. Law Review.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Venue proper as to one defendant, proper as to all defendants.  When a nursing home patient sued the general partner of the limited liability partnership that owned the nursing home, as well as current and former nursing home employees, the former employees motion to transfer venue failed because: (1) venue was found to be proper as to the general partner; and (2) once venue was found to be proper as to one defendant, venue was proper as to all defendants. Gibson v. Medic al Facilities of Am., Inc., 79 Va. Cir. 329, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 269 (Norfolk Sept. 25, 2009). Motion to transfer venue denied.  In a civil suit, the motion to transfer venue filed by defendants was denied because they failed to file any venue objections or motions within 21 days after the entry of the order granting leave to file the amended complaint, as required by § 8.01-264, therefore, they waived any right to challenge venue.

Venue laid in forums other than those designated by this chapter shall be subject to objection, but no action shall be dismissed solely on the basis of venue if there be a forum in the Commonwealth where venue is proper. In actions where venue is subject to objecti on, the action may nevertheless be tried where it is commenced, and the venue irregularity shall be deemed to have been waived unless the defendant objects to venue by motion filed, as to actions in circuit courts, within twenty-one days after service of process commencing the action, or within the period of any extension of time for filing responsive pleadings fixed by order of the court. As to actions in general district courts, a motion objecting to venue, which may be in the form of a letter or oth er written communication, shall be filed with or received by the court on or before the day of trial. Waiver by any defendant shall not constitute waiver for any other defendant entitled to object to venue. Such motion shall set forth where the defendant believes venue to be proper, may be in writing, and shall be promptly heard by the court upon reasonable notice by any party. The court shall hear the motion only on the basis of the action as commenced against the original defendant and not on the bas is of subsequent joinder or intervention of any other party. If such motion is sustained, the court shall order the venue transferred to a proper forum under the appropriate provisions of §§ 8.01-195.4, 8.01-260, 8.01-261 and 8.01-262 and shall so notify each party. B. In the even t a party defendant whose presence created venue is dismissed after the parties are at issue, then the remaining parties defendant may object to venue within ten days after such dismissal if the remaining defendants can demonstrate that the dismissed def endant was not properly joined or was added as a party defendant for the purpose of creating venue. However, nothing in this section shall impair the right of the court under § 8.01-265 to retain the action for trial on motion of a plaintiff and for g ood cause shown. C. The initial pleading, in any action brought in a general district court, shall inform the defendant of his right to object to venue if the action is brought in any forum other than that specified in §§ 8.01-261, 8.01-262, or § 8.01-263. The information to the defendant shall be stated in clear, nontechnical language reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose of this subsection. D. Where a sui t described in subdivision 19 of § 8.01-261 is filed in a venue that is not described therein, the court, on its own motion and upon notice to all parties, may transfer the suit to a venue described in such subdivision provided the transfer is impleme nted within sixty days after service of process upon all parties. History History. 1977, c. 617; 1982, c. 601; 1985, cc. 433, 492; 1986, cc. 396, 40 3; 1987, c. 709; 1991, c. 692. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-264 changes former law and requires that where an appropriate objection is made to improperly laid venue, the case shall be transferred to a proper f orum rather than be dismissed. The party responsible for improper venue is liable for costs. § 8.01-266. The section provides that improper venue, whether preferred or permissible, is waived if the defendant does not make timely objection. The result is that improper venue is not a fatal defect. Objection to venue shall be made by motion setting forth where venue is proper. See also § 8.01-276. It shall be promptly heard by the court. Objection is time ly if made on or before the day of trial if the action is commenced in a general district court. Similarly, objection to venue is timely if made within 21 days after service of process commencing an action in a circuit court or within such other time tha t such court may order for filing responsive pleadings. This changes former law; e.g., this objection is timely even if other pleadings are filed by the defendant prior to the expiration of the time for objection. If a defendants motion is not timely , the objection shall be waived but in cases of multiple defendants, the waiver shall not be binding on any other defendant whose motion is timely filed.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  Circuit court erred when it found that an indenture trustee sought timely enforcement of forum selection clauses because the trustees motion purportedly compl ied with the statutory requirements. Instead, the statute did not address or apply to motions to dismiss based upon forum selection clauses, and provided no statutory excuse for the trustees delay in asserting its alleged contractual right to a diffe rent venue. RMBS Recovery Holdings, I, LLC v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 297 Va. 327, 827 S.E.2d 762, 2019 Va. LEXIS 51 (2019). Moving party has burden of bringing transfer motion to attention of trial court.  This section, states that a venue objection and transfer motion shall be promptly heard by the court; the moving party, has the burden of promptly bringin g the matter to the trial courts attention. Faison v. Hudson, 243 Va. 413, 417 S.E.2d 302, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2754, 1992 Va. LEXIS 32 (1992). The court did not err in denying the permit holders motion to change venue because no defendant filed a timely objection to venue. The original defendant, the Department, failed to object to venue within twenty-one days of residents commencing the appeal as required by this section, and thus waived any venue objection. The permit holder intervened in the case after the twenty-one day period for objecting to v enue had passed. Thus no timely objection to venue was filed. Residents Involved in Saving Env't, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 22 Va. App. 532, 471 S.E.2d 796, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 434 (1996), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 254 Va. 278, 492 S.E.2d 431, 1997 Va. LEXIS 94 (1997). Whether to transfer or retain the case is a matter resting within the discretion of the trial court. Faison v. Hudson, 243 Va. 413, 417 S.E.2d 302, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2754, 1992 Va. LEXIS 32 (1992). Trial courts decision to retain case was not an abuse of discretion.  Where the motion to transfer venue was not heard until approximately one month before the scheduled trial, good cause existed for retaining the case, and therefor e, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in so ruling. Faison v. Hudson, 243 Va. 413, 417 S.E.2d 302, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2754, 1992 Va. LEXIS 32 (1992). Waiver.  An objection to venue is waived if not raised in a timely manner. Tyson v. Commonwealth, No. 2965-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 28, 2000). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Objections to venue.  Physicians, defendants in a medical malpractice suit, were entitled to object to the court that was considered the preferred venue, that was the place of residenc e of the patient. Bradley v. Kellum, 55 Va. Cir. 397, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 304 (Charlottesville July 18, 2001). Wife who filed an action to have a previously granted divorce decree set aside because venue was not proper in the court which granted it waived that issue by not raising it during the divorce proceedings. Price v. Price, 58 Va. Cir. 73, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 394 (Richmond Nov. 20, 2001), aff'd, No. 3266-01-2, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 636 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2002). Manufacturer properly objected to venue in a city where a worker was injured because, while one of the original defendants had a registered agent there, after the worker non-suited that defendant, the parties were not at issue until the manufacturer filed an answer, and neither the manufacturer nor the other remaining defendant conducted substantial business in the city. Duenas v. Mitek, Inc., 109 Va. Cir . 48, 2022 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Richmond Jan. 20, 2022). Time for objections.  Corporations objection to venue in an arbitration proceeding was untimely under § 8.01-264, as it came more than a year after service of process. Hilton v. Quantum Commun. Group, Inc., 59 Va. Cir. 163, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 83 (Fairfax County June 5, 2002). Default judgment.  Default judgment was entered in a contract dispute where a corporation did not file a response within the 21-day period, a church stated a breach of contract caus e of action, venue was waived and jurisdiction and notice were proper. New Life Christian Church v. Dynabilt Tech. Int'l Corp., 59 Va. Cir. 399, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 367 (Norfolk Aug. 29, 2002). Objection denied.  Defendants objection to venue under § 8.01-264 was overruled, because that section only applied if a plaintiff had mislaid venue, and the plaintiff in the instant defamation action laid venue properly. Kollman v. Jordan, 60 Va. Cir. 293, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 394 (Chesterfield County Oct. 29, 2002). Motion to transfer granted.  Third driver was entitled to transfer venue of a passengers personal injury action (the passenger was in the first vehicle that was stopped due to traffic) th e to the city where the accident occurred because the passengers inability to cite per se negligence or a factual claim of negligence left her complaint against the second driver naked of any support other than a conclusion that he was added for the purpose of creating venue, and it would be an abuse of discretion for the court to retain the case solely because of the nearness of the trial date, thereby ignoring the injustic...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-265"><akn:num>§ 8.01-265</akn:num><akn:heading>Change of venue by court</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In addition to the provisions of § 8.01-264 and notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 8.01-195.4, 8.01-260, 8.01-261 and 8.01-262, the court wherein an action i s commenced may, upon motion by any party and for good cause shown, (i) dismiss an action brought by a person who is not a resident of the Commonwealth without prejudice under such conditions as the court deems appropriate if the cause of action arose ou tside of the Commonwealth and if the court determines that a more convenient forum which has jurisdiction over all parties is available in a jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth or (ii) transfer the action to any fair and convenient forum having juri sdiction within the Commonwealth.

The court, on motion of any party and for good cause shown, may retain the action for trial. Except by agreement of all parties, no action enumerated in Category A, § 8.01-261, shall be transferred to or retained by a forum not enumerated in such category.

Code 1950, §§ 8-38, 8-157, 8-158; 1950, p. 78; 1954, c. 660 ; 1956, c. 432; 1956, Ex.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-265 consolidates the forum non conveniens transfer provisions of former §§ 8-38 (10) and 8-157 (a) and readopts former § 8-158 which was rep ealed in 1966. Venue may be generally transferred if it is improperly laid under §§ 8.01-260, 8.01-261 and 8.01-262 and objection is made by the defendant pursuant to § 8.01-264. However, if the venue is preferred and is properly laid under § 8.01-261, the court may transfer the case only upon agreement of all parties. If an action is not within § 8.01-261, though the venue may be improperly laid the court may, on motion of the plaintiff and for good cause, retain the action for trial. Th e definition of good cause encompasses former § 8-38 (10) (provision for transfer where judge is interested in case) as well as the convenience of witnesses and parties and the interest of justice of former § 8-157 (a). The adjectives fair and convenient used to describe the transferee forum give more guidance than any other forum used in former § 8-157 (a). The words having jurisdiction connote jurisdiction over the subject matter of the proceeding; and no court in the Commonwealth is prevented by any provision of this chapter from having such jurisdiction. The 2007 amendments. The 2007 amendment by c. 105, in the first paragraph, substituted party for defendant in the first sentence and any party for a plaint iff in the third sentence and added or complying with the law of any other state or the United States in the last sentence.

Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Constitutionality.  This section violates neither the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause nor the due process clause of the Va. Const., Art. I, § 11, or its prohibition a gainst special or private laws, under Va. Const., Art. IV, §§ 14 and 15. Caldwell v. Seaboard Sys. R.R., 238 Va. 148, 380 S.E.2d 910, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2859, 1989 Va. LEXIS 100 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1095, 110 S. Ct. 1169, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 915 (1990) (decided prior to the 1991 amendment). The attenuating effects, if any, upon interstate commerce inherent in the application of this section are slight, and are clearly overborne by a legitimate state interest in providing maximum access to its courts; thus, interstate commerce is not impermissibly burdened by this section. Caldwell v. Seaboard Sys. R.R., 238 Va. 148, 380 S.E.2d 910, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2859, 1989 Va. LEXIS 100 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U. S. 1095, 110 S. Ct. 1169, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1071, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 915 (1990) (decided prior to the 1991 amendment). This section does not provide for the transfer of a case from one forum to another based upon the standard that one forum is fair and substantially more convenient than another forum. City of Danville v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 18 Va. App. 594, 446 S.E.2d 466, 11 Va. Law Rep. 30, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 441 (1994). Court lacked authority to transfer.  As a circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a fathers motion to modify child support because the support order was entered by another circuit c ourt, neither § 8.01-265 nor § 20-88.49 authorized the trial court to transfer the case, rather than dismiss it. Williams v. Williams, 61 Va. App. 170, 734 S.E.2d 186, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 387 (2012). Attorney inconvenience not within good cause definition.  This section defines good cause as the avoidance of substantial inconvenience to the parties or the witnesses. It does not mention the inconvenience of th eir attorneys. If inconvenience for the attorneys for the parties was sufficient to cause a transfer of venue, the venue statutes could be manipulated because the parties could select an attorney located in the forum of their choice and circumvent the pl ain intent of the venue statute. Therefore, the inconvenience caused by one or two trips, at most, to Lynchburg from Richmond in the instant case to argue motions and the merits of the case was not adequate good cause to transfer the case under this sect ion. City of Danville v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., 18 Va. App. 594, 446 S.E.2d 466, 11 Va. Law Rep. 30, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 441 (1994). Presumption of plaintiffs choice of forum not absolute.  While the presumption of correctness attaches to a plaintiffs choice of forum, it is not absolute. Indeed, the presumption cannot be enhanced simply because t he action arises under the Federal Employers Liability Act. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Williams, 239 Va. 390, 389 S.E.2d 714, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1604, 1990 Va. LEXIS 42 (1990) (decided prior to the 1991 amendment). Forum selectio n clause.  Circuit court abused its discretion in the dismissal of an amended complaint on the basis of forum selection clauses because the indenture trustees delay in a sserting the forum selection clauses, while actively continuing litigation, resulted in a waiver of the right to rely upon that contractual provision. RMBS Recovery Holdings, I, LLC v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 297 Va. 327, 827 S.E.2d 762, 2019 Va. LEXIS 51 ( 2019). Good cause on basis of forum non conveniens.  Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding that good cause did not exist to dismiss litigation in Virginia based upon the principles of forum non conve niens because the court appropriately considered the practicalities that made a trial easy, expeditious, and inexpensive. RMBS Recovery Holdings, I, LLC v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 297 Va. 327, 827 S.E.2d 762, 2019 Va. LEXIS 51 (2019). Court lacked authority to transfer divorce action.  Where appellant consented to venue in the one county when she initially filed her bill of complaint there, and because appellee did not object to the selection of venue, he waived his privilege to have the suit transferred to a different county pursuant to this section and effectively agreed to venue in the original county of filing. On these procedural facts, the trial court was not required to act sua sponte t o transfer the suit to a different county, and moreover, had no statutory authority to do so. Decker v. Decker, 12 Va. App. 536, 405 S.E.2d 12, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2675, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 114 (1991) (decided prior to the 1991 amendment). Denial of transfer was abuse of discretion.  Denial of defendant railroads motion to transfer a Federal Employers Liability Act action was an abuse of discretion, where the trial court was presented with sufficient information to show good cause to transfer, including substantial inconvenience to the parties and witnesses, as well as indications of a forum originally selected for not simply justice, but perhaps justice blended with some harassment. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Williams, 239 Va. 390, 389 S.E.2d 714, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1604, 1990 Va. LEXIS 42 (1990) (decided prior to the 1991 amendment). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Pr ejudice as grounds for removal.  This section deals primarily with the transfer of causes from one court to another, where a change of venue is made necessary by local prejudice. Taylor v. Taylor , 185 Va. 126, 37 S.E.2d 886, 1946 Va. LEXIS 186 (1946). Local prejudice of such a character as to prevent a fair and impartial trial in the county or district where the action is brought is a well recognized ground for a change of venue. Ramsay v. Harrison, 119 Va. 682, 89 S.E. 977, 1916 Va. LEXIS 142 (1916).

In add ition, the court may award those attorneys fees deemed just and reasonable which are occasioned by such commencement of a suit or by such motion to transfer. The awarding of such costs by the transferor court shall not preclude the assessment of cost s by the clerk of the transferee court. History History. 1977, c. 617; 1994, c. 32. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-266 provides sanctions as a remedy for improper venue. By providing that the court shall award reasonable actual costs, the section makes the imposition of such costs mandatory (i.e., the court has discretion to transfer, but not as to the imposition of costs). Additionally, the court is granted discretion to award attorneys fees. The costs to be imposed are only those which have been act ually incurred up to the point in time of the granting of transfer or denial of such a motion. If transfer of the action is granted, costs should include those fees of the transferor court necessary to implement the order. Thereafter costs are to be awar ded in accordance with chapter 3 of Title 14.1. Law Review. For survey of Virginia law on practice and pleading for the year 1976-77, see 63 Va. L. Rev. 1459 (1977).

While neither transfer nor refusal to transfer are immediately appealable, the trial judges decision is ultimately reviewable on the grounds that he abused hi s discretion, or that the forum to which the action was transferred or in which the case was allowed to remain was not a proper place of venue under §§ 8.01-260 to 8.01-262.

Text On motion of any party, a circuit court may enter an order joining, coordinating, consolidating or transferring civil actions as provided in this chapter upon finding t hat: 1. Separ ate civil actions brought by six or more plaintiffs involve common questions of law or fact and arise out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences; 2. The common questions of law or fact predominate and are significant to the actions; and 3. The order (i) will promote the ends of justice and the just and efficient conduct and disposition of the actions, and (ii) is consistent with each partys right to due process of la w, and (iii) does not prejudice each individual partys right to a fair and impartial resolution of each action. Factors to be considered by the court include, but are not limited to, (i) the nature of the common questions of law or fact; (ii) the convenience of the parties, witne sses and counsel; (iii) the relative stages of the actions and the work of counsel; (iv) the efficient utilization of judicial facilities and personnel; (v) the calendar of the courts; (vi) the likelihood and disadvantages of duplicative and inconsistent rulings, orders or judgments; (vii) the likelihood of prompt settlement of the actions without the entry of the order; and (viii) as to joint trials by jury, the likelihood of prejudice or confusion. The court may organize and manage the combined litigation and enter further orders consistent with the right of each party to a fair trial as may be appropriate to avoi d unnecessary costs, duplicative litigation or delay and to assure fair and efficient conduct and resolution of the litigation, including but not limited to orders which organize the parties into groups with like interest; appoint counsel to have lead re sponsibility for certain matters; allocate costs and fees to separate issues into common questions that require treatment on a consolidated basis and individual cases that do not; and to stay discovery on the issues that are not consolidated. History History. 1995, c. 555. Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Consolidation granted as to liability only.  Six gross negligence actions involving common questions of law and fact and arising out of the same set of facts against a roofing company and a project consultan t satisfied the factors of § 8.01-267.1 with respect to liability issues and, therefore, were consolidated into a single trial on the issue of liability only where all six cases involved alleged injuries to employees due to their exposure to chemicals used by the roofing company during repairs to the roof of the building where they worked. Bond v. Baker Roofing Co., 81 Va. Cir. 439, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 269 (Norfolk Dec. 28, 2010). Severence granted.  Severance of actions brought by railroad employees under the Federal Employers Liability Act was granted, as the workers claims did not arise out of the s ame transactions or occurrences or series of transactions or occurrences. McClure v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., 54 Va. Cir. 322, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 604 (Roanoke Dec. 27, 2000). Where the patients had distinct and independent claims against the same manufacturer, promoter, and various doctors involving the patients taking of the drug OxyContin, they failed to show that consolidation of their causes of action was appropriate under § 8.01-267.1.Branch v. Purdue Pharma, L.P., 64 Va. Cir. 159, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 203 (Richmond Mar. 2, 2004). Trial court severed the corporations notice claim against the county board of supervisors, as the notice claim did not meet the requirements of the Multiple C laimants Litigation Act, and claims initially joined could be severed pursuant to § 8.01-267.5; however, the corporation was still allowed to go forward with its notice claim separately from the consolidated claims, as the trial court had not entered an order that the notice claim should be stayed pending disposition of the proceedings on the consolidated claims. Gas Mart Corp. v. Loudoun County Bd. of Supervisors, 67 Va. Cir. 159, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 171 (Loudoun County Mar. 10, 2005). Sua sponte severance.  Court could not sever the claims of six or more parties sua sponte for their failure to comply with § 8.01-267.5 of the Multiple Claimant Litigation Ac t, as the Act was not enacted for a particular substantive right; rather, it provided mandatory procedural requirements, and the failure to comply therewith did not divest the court of jurisdiction, such that it could not sever parties who filed jointly under § 8.01-267.1.Livingston v.

History History. 1995, c. 555. § 8.01-267.3. Consolidation and other combined proceedings. Text On motion of any party, a circuit court in which separate civil actions are pending which were brought by six or more plaintiffs may enter an order coordinating, consol idating or joining any or all of the proceedings in the actions upon making the findings required by § 8.01-267.1. The order may provide for any or all of the following: 1. Coord inated or consolidated pretrial proceedings; 2. A joint hearing or, if requested by any party, trial by jury with respect to any or all common questions at issue in the actions; or 3. Consolidation of the actions. History History. 1995, c. 555. § 8.01-267.4. Transfer. Text A. Whenever th ere are pending in different circuit courts of the Commonwealth civil actions brought by six or more plaintiffs which involve common issues of law or fact and arise out of the same transaction, occurrence or the same series of transactions or occurrences , any party may apply to a panel of circuit court judges designated by the Supreme Court for an order of transfer. Upon such application and upon making the findings required by § 8.01-267.1, the panel may order some or all of the actions transferred to a circuit court in which one or more of the actions are pending for purposes of coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. The circuit court to which actions are transferred may enter further orders as provided in § 8.01-267.3. Any subsequen t application for further transfer shall be made to the circuit court to which the actions were transferred. Upon completion of pretrial proceedings and any joint hearings or trials, the circuit court may remand the actions to the circuit courts in which they were originally filed or may retain them for final disposition. B. Any party w ho files an application for transfer shall at the same time give notice of such application to all parties and to the clerk of each circuit court in which an action that is the subject of the application is pending. Upon receipt of the notice, a circuit court shall not enter any further orders under § 8.01-267.3 until after the panel has entered an order granting or denying an application for transfer pursuant to subsection A. History History. 1995, c. 555. § 8.01-267.5. Joinder and severance. Text Six or more parties may be joined initially as plaintiffs in a single action if their claims involve common issues of fact and arise out of the same transaction or occu rrence or the same series of transactions or occurrences. On motion of a defendant, the actions so joined shall be severed unless the court finds that the claims of the plaintiffs were ones which, if they had been filed separately, would have met the sta ndards of § 8.01-267.1 and would have been consolidated under § 8.01-267.3. If the court orders severance, the claims may proceed separately upon payment of any appropriate filing fees due in the separate circuit courts within sixty days of entry o f the order. The date of the original filing shall be the date of filing for each of the severed actions for purposes of applying the statutes of limitations.

Section enacted to prevent harshness of former rule.  At one time, if title to real estate were at stake in litigation, the mere pendency of the suit was deemed sufficient to charge a purchaser with notice of the cha llenge to title and subject his interest in the property to the outcome of the suit. To correct the harshness of this rule, the General Assembly enacted a provision currently codified as this section, requiring any notice of pending litigation or lis pen dens to be docketed in the circuit court clerks office for the jurisdiction in which the land is located before such notice will bind a bona fide purchaser.

Difference between notices of lis pendens and attachment is only formal.  The section speaks of lis pendens or attachment, so that even if lis pendens technically were available only for actions directly involving title to real property, the identical procedure, with identical effect, may be obtained by filing a notice of attachment. The difference is formal rather than substantive. Hart v. United Va. Bank, 24 Bankr. 821, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5421 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). Filing of memorandum lis pendens neither creates nor enforces a lien. Rather, plaintiff s filing of the lis pendens pursuant to this section served merely as notice of the pendency of the suit to any one interested and a warning that he should examine the proceedings therein to ascertain whether the title to the property was affected or not by such proceedings. Green Hill Corp. v. Kim, 842 F.2d 742, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 3893 (4th Cir. 1988). Notice of lis pendens is qualified privileged communication.  Judicial proceedings have been recognized in Virginia as constituting one of the principal occasions where communications are absolutely privileged. However, that when all the interests involved are taken into consideration the filing of a notice of lis pendens is more appropriately characterized as a qualified privileged occasion. Warren v. Bank of Marion, 618 F. Supp. 317, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15785 (W.D. Va. 1985). Section not limited to suits directly involving title to real estate.  This section provides for the filing of memoranda against a defendants personal as well as his real property, which indicates an intent by the legislature tha t such filings not be restricted to suits directly involving title to real estate. Hart v. United Va. Bank, 24 Bankr. 821, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5421 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). Procedure available to any party seeking money judgment.  Under this section and § 8.01-458, the recording of a memorandum of lis pendens is open to any litigating party seeking a money judgment against an individual property owner in Virginia. Hart v. United Va. Bank, 24 Bankr. 821, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5421 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). Memorandum of lis pendens is merely a notice to third parties that a claim has been asserted to the property described. Hart v. United Va. Bank, 24 Bankr. 821, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5421 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). No lis pendens without interest in property.  Pursuant to § 55-82, as limited by subsection B of § 8.01-268, a plaintiff in an action claiming fraudulent conveyance as to a specific property is not free to file a memorandum of lis pendens on property in which he does not assert or claim an interest. Meliani v. Jade Dunn Loring Metro, L.L.C., 286 F. Supp. 2d 741, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18178 (E.D. Va. 2003). Memorandum of lis pendens proper.  Where a judgment creditor of a Chapter 11 debtor filed a memorandum of lis pendens against property held by a corporation related to the debtor, a motion to quash the lis pendens was denied because the judgment creditor was not seeking to impose a pre-judgment attachment against the property, but rather was seeking to establish its interest in the real property in question, within the meaning of subsection B of § 8.01-268. Cadle Co. II, Inc. v. Superior Constr. &amp; Contr., Inc., 362 Bankr. 687, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 3681 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2006). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section is remedial, and in construing it, there should be borne in mind the old la w, the mischief intended to be remedied, and the remedy. Vicars v. Sayler, 111 Va. 307, 68 S.E. 988, 1910 Va. LEXIS 46 (1910) (see also Swetnam v. Antonsanti, 150 Va. 534, 143 S.E. 716 (1928)). What constitutes action lis pendens.  That to constitute an action or suit lis pendens the property involved must be the identical property transferred pendente lite, of a kind subject to the rule and sufficiently described in the pleadings to identify it, and the court must have jurisdiction at the time of the transfer over the subject matter and the party from whom the interest is acquired. French v. Loyal Co., 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 627, 1834 Va. LEXIS 67 (1834); Davis v. Christian, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 11, 1859 Va. LEXIS 1 (1859); Briscoe v. Ashby, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 454, 1874 Va. LEXIS 26 (1874). It has no application to the federal courts.  This section has no application to federal courts sitting in Virginia, as such courts have no power to enforce the registration of such memoranda. King v. Davis, 137 F. 198, 1903 U.S. App. LEXIS 5453 (C.C.D. Va. 1903). Notice unnecessary where judgment obtained.  Purchasers of land are conclusively affected with notice of judgment duly obtained and docketed against the owner, and no lis pendens or other notice of a suit to subject the land to such judgment is needed to affect them. Sharitz v. Moyers, 99 Va. 519, 39 S.E. 166, 1901 Va. LEXIS 72 (1901). Lien is only upon property conveyed.  The lien thus conferred is only upon the property conveyed, and not, like the lien of a judgment, on all of the debtors estate. Davis v. Bonney, 89 Va. 755, 1 7 S.E. 229, 1893 Va. LEXIS 100 (1893).

Electronic filings in civil actions in circuit court. Text Electronic filings in civil actions and proceedings in the circuit court shall be governed by Article 4.1 (§ 17.1-258.2 et. seq.) of Chapter 2 of Title 17.1 and appl icable Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. History History. 2010, cc. 717, 760. § 8.01-271.1. Signing of pleadings, motions, and other papers; oral motions; sanctions. Text A. Except as o therwise provided in §§ 16.1-260 and 63.2-1901, every pleading, motion, or other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record who is an active member in good standing of the Virginia State Bar in hi s individual name, and the attorneys address shall be stated on the first pleading filed by that attorney in the action. A party who is not represented by an attorney, including a person confined in a state or local correctional facility proceeding p ro se, shall sign his pleading, motion, or other paper and state his address. The signature of a person other than counsel of record who is an active member in good standing of the Virginia State Bar or a pro se litigant is not a valid signature. A minor who is not represented by an attorney shall sign his pleading, motion, or other paper by his next friend. Either or both parents of such minor may sign on behalf of such minor as his next friend. However, a parent may not sign on behalf of a minor if su ch signature is otherwise prohibited by subdivision 6 of § 64.2-716. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is not signed in compliance with this paragraph, it is defective. Such a defect renders the pleading, motion, or other paper voidable. B. The signatu re of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him that (i) he has read the pleading, motion, or other paper, (ii) to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is warrante d by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and (iii) it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigati on. C. An oral mot ion made by an attorney or party in any court of the Commonwealth constitutes a representation by him that (i) to the best of his knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing l aw or a good faith argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law, and (ii) it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. D. If a pleadi ng, motion, or other paper is signed or made in violation of this section, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed the paper or made the motion, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, whi ch may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper or making of the motion, including reasonable attorney fees. E. Failure to raise the issue of a signature defect in a pleading, motion, or other paper before the trial courts jurisdiction expires pursuant to Rule 1:1 (a) and Rule 1:1B waives any challenge to that pleading, motion, or other paper based on such a defect. F. Signature d efects in appellate filings, including the notice of appeal, shall be raised in the appellate court where the appeal is taken. Failure to timely raise the issue of a defective signature in an appellate pleading, motion, or other paper while the case is p ending before the appellate court waives any challenge to that pleading, motion, or other paper based on such a defect. G. If a signat ure defect is not timely and properly cured after it is brought to the attention of the pleader or movant, the pleading, motion, or other paper is invalid and shall be stricken. A signature defect shall be cured within 21 days after it is brought to the attention of the pleader or movant. If a signature defect is timely and properly cured, the pleading, motion, or other paper shall be valid and relate back to the date it was originally served or filed.

Appeal and Error, § 276; 14B M.J. Pleading, § 13. CASE NOTES Policy considerations.  The possibility of a sanction can protect litigants from the mental anguish and expense of frivolous assertions of unfounded factual and legal claims and against the assertions of valid claims for improper purposes, but the threat of a sanction should not be used to stifle counsel in advancing novel legal theories or asserting a clients rights in a doubtful case. Gilmore v. Finn, 259 Va. 448, 527 S.E.2d 426, 2000 Va. LEXIS 52 (2000). An objective standard of reasonableness is applied in determining whether the warranted by existing law portion of this section has been violated. Tullidge v. Board of Supvrs., 239 Va. 611, 391 S.E.2d 288, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2182, 1990 Va. LEXIS 75 (1990). In determining whether ones conduct in signing a document violated the statute, the trial court applies an objective standard of reasonableness. Woodruff v. G reene, No. 0114-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 22, 1998). The Supreme Court applies an objective standard of reasonableness in order to determine whether a litigant and his attorney, after reasonable inquiry, could have formed a reasonable belief that a pleading was warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-272 extends former § 8-134 and overrules the prior prohibition against the joinder of tort and contract claims. See, e.g., Kavanaugh v. Donovan, 1 86 Va. 85, 93, 41 S.E.2d 489 (1947); Standard Products v. Woolridge, 214 Va. 476, 201 S.E.2d 801 (1974). The term claim encompasses any counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim. However, § 8.01-272 does not go as far as FRCP 18 (a) in t hat § 8.01-272 restricts the joinder to claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence. The court may, upon motion, sever such claims for separate trial. Cross references.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. This section could not be applied retroactively to allow the joinder of actions in tort and contract where the statute became effective more than 10 months after final judgment in the trial court and almost three months after a writ of error was granted, since application of the statute might materially change the substantive rights of a pa rty, as distinguished from the procedural aspects of the remedy. Goodstein v. Weinberg, Buffenstein, Hirschler &amp; Fleischer, 219 Va. 105, 245 S.E.2d 140, 1978 Va. LEXIS 166 (1978). This section changed common-law rule applicable to misjoinder and expressly permitted a party to join claims in tort with claims in contract if the claims arose out of the same transaction or occurrence. Thus, the special circumstances which compelled the result in Goodstein v. Weinberg, 219 Va. 105, 245 S.E.2d 140 (1978) are unlikely to re cur. MacLellan v. Throckmorton, 235 Va. 341, 367 S.E.2d 720, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2524, 1988 Va. LEXIS 50 (1988). Joinder of claims.  Circuit court properly dismissed a sellers second suit against the buyer on the basis of res judicata because the sellers claims  for settlement, oral contract, and quantum meruit  all fit within a single factual narrative  to be paid for work it did for the buyer  and accrued before the seller had ever filed the first suit for breach of an alleged settlement agreement, and the sellers alternative claims qualified for joinder under the same transaction or occurrence standard and constituted res judicata under the same standard where no disqualifying principle of res judicata applied. Funny Guy, LLC v. Lecego, LLC, 293 Va. 135, 795 S.E.2d 887, 2017 Va. LEXIS 7 (2017). Dismissal for misjoinder of defendants and causes of action held erroneous.  Where a fair reading of the amended motion for judgment showed that plaintiff pleaded alternative theories of recovery against the same group of defendants and th at the claims arose out of the same transaction or occurrence; the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs action on the ground of misjoinder of parties defendant and causes of action. Fox v. Deese, 234 Va. 412, 362 S.E.2d 699, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1248 , 1987 Va. LEXIS 272 (1987). The plaintiffs claim against driver for negligent operation of an automobile does not arise from the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiffs claim against doctor for medical malpractice where first, there was negligent operation of a motor vehicle by driver resulting in an accident; and, then there was negligent medical treatment of plaintiff at a later date by the doctor resulting in injury. Powers v. Cherin, 249 Va. 33, 452 S.E.2d 666, 1995 Va. LEXIS 17 (1995). Decision not to bifurcate compensatory and punitive damages portion of case upheld.  There was no abuse of discretion in the trial courts decision not to bifurcate the compensatory and punitive damages portions of a case where plaintiffs alleg ed that a driver and owner were drunk at the time of a head-on collision; when considering a request for separate trials, the trial court had to consider any resulting unnecessary delay, expense, or use of judicial resources that would flow from separate trials of the claims at issue. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Wade, 265 Va. 383, 579 S.E.2d 180, 2003 Va. LEXIS 53 (2003). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms the statute and this section, as used below, refer to f ormer provisions. Demurrer and plea to whole declaration.  It is settled under our statute that a plea and demurrer, at the same time, to the whole declaration, are admissible. Stone &amp; Co. v. Patterson, 10 Va. (6 Call) 71 , 1806 Va. LEXIS 17 (1806); Syme v. Griffin, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 277, 1809 Va. LEXIS 52 (1809) (see also Bassett v. Cunningham, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 402 (1836); C &amp; O Ry. v. American Exch. Bank, 92 Va. 495, 23 S.E. 935 (1896)). If a defendant plead and demur to the whole declaration, and the demurrer be overruled, judgment ought not to be entered, without first trying the issues joined o n the other pleas. Waller v. Ellis, 16 Va. (2 Munf) 88, 1810 Va. LEXIS 89 (1810). Pleading several matters in one plea.  The several matters are intended to be pleaded in several pleas, and if the defendant include several distinct matters of defense in one plea, he has no right to complain of the plaintiff for replying generally to such plea. If the plaintiff in such case can be said to be guilty of a fault in pleading, it is induced by his adversary, who is guilty of the first fault. O'Bannon v. Saunders, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 138, 1873 Va. LEXIS 9 (1873). Inconsistent pleas are allowable, and in trying one, the court cannot look to the existe nce of the other, hence each branch of the pleading is looked on as totally separate and distinct from every other, and the defenses under one cannot be straightened or curtailed by the existence of the other. Were it otherwise, the liberty of pleading s everal, and even contradictory, pleas would be defeated. Waller v. Ellis, 16 Va. (2 Munf) 88, 1810 Va. LEXIS 89 (1810); Norfolk Hosiery &amp; Underwear Mills v. Aetna Hosiery Co., 124 Va. 221, 98 S.E. 43, 1919 Va. LEXIS 173 (1919); Wilroy v. Halbleib, 214 Va . 442, 201 S.E.2d 598, 1974 Va. LEXIS 158 (1974). Under this section to revive a default judgment in ejectment, denying service of process, declaration, and notices in the manner at the time and places stated in the returns, and alleging service by an unauthorized person, are not objectionable, though repugnant. King v. Davis, 137 F. 198, 1903 U.S. App. LEXIS 5453 (C.C.D. Va. 1903). And alternate defenses may be submitted to jury.  Where the contestant of a will could assert inconsistent defenses and present evidence based on those defenses, it would not constitute error to submit to the jur y the alternate defenses of undue influence and forgery if justified by the evidence. Wilroy v. Halbleib, 214 Va. 442, 201 S.E.2d 598, 1974 Va. LEXIS 158 (1974). But not pleas of matters already pleaded.  Where the matter of a plea is already in issue, the plea is wholly unnecessary, and this is good ground for rejecting it. Reed v. Hanna, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 56, 1824 Va. LEXIS 42 (1824); Fant v. Miller, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 47, 1866 Va. LEXIS 7 (1866). Although this section gives the defendant the right to plead as many matters of defense as he chooses, yet it does not give him the absolute right to his special pleas setting up defenses admissible under pleas already received, and the court may strike out such special pleas though already admitted and issue joined. Virginia Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Buck, 88 Va. 517, 13 S.E. 973, 1891 Va. LEXIS 65 (1891 ). Demurrer to pleading previously answered.  Though a demurrer, an answer and other defensive pleadings may be filed at the same time, yet after an answer has been properly filed in a chancery cause, and so long as it remains filed, a litigant, adult or infant, should not thereafter be allowed to demur to the pleading that has been previously answered. Whether or not the answer may be withdrawn and the litigant then allowed to demur rests in the courts sound discretion. O'Neill v. Cole, 194 Va. 50, 72 S.E.2d 382, 1952 Va. LEXIS 206 (1952). Filing of special plea does not waive other defenses.  In a proceeding by notice of motion for judgment on notes, a special plea se...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-273"><akn:num>§ 8.01-273</akn:num><akn:heading>Demurrer; form; grounds to be stated; amendment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. In any suit in equity or action at law, the contention that a pleading does not state a cause of action or that such pleading fails to state facts upon which the relief demanded can be granted may be made by demurrer. All demurrers shall be in writing and shall sta te specifically the grounds on which the demurrant concludes that the pleading is insufficient at law. No grounds other than those stated specifically in the demurrer shall be considered by the court. A demurrer may be amended as other pleadings are amen ded. B. Wherever a demurrer to any pleading has been sustained, and as a result thereof the demurree has amended his pleading, he shall not be deemed to have waived his right to stand upon his pleading before the amendment, provided that (i) the order of the court shows th at he objected to the ruling of the court sustaining the demurrer and (ii) the amended pleading incorporates or refers to the earlier pleading. On any appeal of such a case the demurree may insist upon his earlier pleading before the amendment, and if th e same be held to be good, he shall not be prejudiced by having made the amendment. History History. Code 1950, §§ 8-99, 8-120; 1954, c. 333; 1977, c. 617; 2017 , c. 755. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Subsection A modifies former § 8-99. Subsection B incorporates the material provisions of former § 8-120. Under prior practice the specific grounds of a demurrer did not have to be stated unless a party to the action by motion, or the court, required it. Subsection A changes this and requires the demurrant to state the specific grounds in his demurrer. Only those grounds stated will be considered. The joinder in demurrer provided for in former § 8-99 has long been in disuse and has been deleted; the reference to demurrers in criminal cases has been delet ed as inappropriate for inclusion in the civil procedure title. No change is made to existing practice of testing a defensive pleading in equity and at law by a motion to strike § 8.01-274. Cross references. For rules of court on pleadings in general in civil actions, see Rules 3:2 through 3:18. The 2017 amendments. The 2017 amendment by c. 755, in subsection B, added clause (ii), substituted earlier pleading before the amendment for original pleading and made related changes. Law Review.

Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Facts in bill of complaint considered true.  In reviewing a decree sustaining a demurrer, all facts alleged in or reasonably inferable from a bill of complaint are considered true. West Alexandria Properties , Inc. v. First Va. Mtg. &amp; Real Estate Inv. Trust, 221 Va. 134, 267 S.E.2d 149, 1980 Va. LEXIS 224 (1980). Trial court did not err in denying the lot owners demurrer to the objecting lot owners declaratory judgment action, as a declaratory judgment action was p roperly filed to challenge the one lot owners plans to build an office complex on a subdivision lot that was subject to a restrictive covenant requiring that lots only be used for residential purposes; taking the facts in the bill of complaint filed by the objecting lot owners as true, an actual case or controversy existed because the facts showed that the one lot owner was already exploring plans to actually build the office building that they did not want built. River Heights Assocs. v. Batten, 26 7 Va. 262, 591 S.E.2d 683, 2004 Va. LEXIS 15 (2004). A demurrer, unlike a motion for summary judgment, does not allow the court to evaluate a nd decide the merits of a claim; it only tests the sufficiency of factual allegations to determine whether the motion for judgment states a cause of action. Fun v. Virginia Military Inst., 422 S.E.2d 770, 9 Va. Law Rep. 523, 1992 Va. LEXIS 118 (Va. 1992) , set aside, op. withdrawn, 9 Va. Law Rep. 693, 1993 Va. LEXIS 11 (Va. 1993). Brevity of demurrer not prejudicial.  Three-page demurrer commendably stated its grounds without verbosity or vitriol; its brevity could hardly be viewed as prejudicial to the ex-husband as it was, af ter all, persuasive enough to convince him of the need to voluntarily withdraw two of the three counts in his complaint. Concerning the remaining count, alleging breach of contract, the demurrer adequately identified the conceptual problems with his alle gations. Bousman v. Lhommedieu, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 199 (Va. Ct. App. July 9, 2013). Grant of dem urrer proper.  Circuit court did not err in granting a corporations demurrer because changing the corporations domicile from Virginia to Delaware did not trigger apprais al rights where Virginia did not include appraisal rights upon consummation of a domestication, Delaware did not provide appraisal rights for a sale of corporate assets, and recognition of the substance-over-form or step-transaction doctrines would not c hange the statutes. Fisher v. Tails, Inc., 289 Va. 69, 767 S.E.2d 710, 2015 Va. LEXIS 9 (2015). Circuit court correctly interpreted the Workout Agreement to preclude breach of contract claim and correctly held that the fraud claims failed because appellant h ad not alleged any justifiable reliance on the alleged misrepresentation. Sweely Holdings, LLC v. R SunTrust Bank, 296 Va. 367, 820 S.E.2d 596, 2018 Va. LEXIS 169 (2018). Grant of demurrer improper.  Trial court erred in sustaining demurrers by a teacher, his wife, and a school director as to plaintiffs action alleging intentional infliction of emotional d istress, because the trial court improperly considered the factual merit of plaintiffs allegations, and in any case plaintiffs allegations that those defendants obtained a sample of plaintiffs handwriting from her childs confidential file at a school to determine if plaintiff had sent anonymous hand-written notes stated a cause of action; but the trial court properly granted demurrers by a handwriting analyst and a handwriting expert, because plaintiff could not assert a cause of action in Virginia for civil conspiracy to intentionally inflict severe emotional distress such as the claims made against them. Almy v. Grisham, 273 Va. 68, 639 S.E.2d 182, 2007 Va. LEXIS 24 (2007). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms the statute and this section, as used below, refer to f ormer provisions. The object of this section is twofold; that is to prevent reliance being placed upon an undisclosed objection to a mere matter of form, which is capable of amendment, and to prevent the demurrant from presenting, on appeal, grounds for the demurrer not relied upon before the trial court. Morriss v. White, 146 Va. 553, 131 S.E. 835, 1926 Va. LEXIS 348 (1926). Section eliminates practice of assigning different grounds f or demurrer at trial and on appeal.  This section, if taken advantage of by the trial courts, will do away with the practice of assigning one ground of demurrer in the trial court and relying upon a wholly different ground in the appellate court  a practice which frequently results in the reversal of trial courts upon questions never presented to as considered by them. Lane Bros. &amp; Co. v. Bauserman, 103 Va. 146, 48 S.E. 857, 1904 Va. LEXIS 21 (1 904). Court may require specific writing.  While the grounds for demurrer are not required to be in writing, the trial court, on motion of any party thereto, shall, or of its own motion may, require the gr ounds of demurrer relied on to be stated specifically in the demurrer; and no grounds shall be considered other than those so stated. Klein v. National Toddle House Corp., 210 Va. 641, 172 S.E.2d 782, 1970 Va. LEXIS 175 (1970). Only grounds stated are considered.  Where grounds for a demurrer were voluntarily stated therein, only the grounds so stated would be considered. Klein v. National Toddle House Corp., 210 Va. 641, 1 72 S.E.2d 782, 1970 Va. LEXIS 175 (1970). Where a plaintiff voluntarily stated the grounds of his demurrer under the former statute only the grounds so stated could be considered. The fact that the ground s were stated voluntarily, and were not required by the court, is immaterial. The statute applies as well in one case as the other. Virginia &amp; S.W. Ry. v. Hollingsworth, 107 Va. 359, 58 S.E. 572, 1907 Va. LEXIS 48 (1907). Effect when error in sustaining demurrer harmless.  Where, under this section, the plaintiff amended his declaration under protest, a demurrer thereto having been sustained, but relied on the amended declaration in stead of the original, the question of the propriety of the action of the trial court in sustaining the demurrer becomes moot and will not be considered on appeal, as the error of the trial court, if error there was, was harmless. W.S. Forbes &amp; Co. v. So uthern Cotton Oil Co., 130 Va. 245, 108 S.E. 15, 1921 Va. LEXIS 152 (1921) (see Mears v. Accomac Banking Co., 160 Va. 311, 168 S.E. 740 (1933)). When statement of grounds not in record on appeal.  When the grounds of demurrer in an action at law have been stated in writing, in accordance with the statute, but they are not copied into the record, the Supreme Court will treat the case as if there had been no demurrer. Lane Bros. &amp; Co. v. Bauserman, 103 Va. 146, 48 S.E. 857, 1904 Va. LEXIS 21 (1904). Insufficient statement of grounds.  See Newton v. White, 115 Va. 844, 80 S.E. 561, 1914 Va. LEXIS 140 (1914); Richmond College v. Scott-Nuckols Co., 124 Va. 333, 98 S.E. 1, 1919 Va. LEXIS 128 (1919) .

The test of the sufficiency of any defensive pleading in any suit in equity or action at law shall be made by a m otion to strike; if found insufficient, but amendable, the court may allow amendment on terms. If a second pleading is adjudged insufficient, the court may enter such judgment or decree or take such other action that it deems appropriate. History History. Code 1950, § 8-122; 1954, c. 605; 1977, c. 617; 1978, c. 336. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Case law indicated that a defensive pleading at law could be tested by a motion to strike. Similarly, former § 8-122 provided that a challenge for insufficienc y, either of law or fact, directed to a defensive pleading in equity was made by a motion to strike out. Section 8.01-274 in combination with § 8.01-273 provides a uniform procedure for challenging pleadings in a civil action, whether in equity or at law: aggressi ve pleadings are to be challenged by the demurrer, and defensive pleadings by the motion to strike. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 1B M.J. Appeal and Error, § 111; 2A M.J. Appearances, § 8; 6A M.J. Demurrers, § 20; 6A M.J. Dismissal, Discontinuance and Nonsuit, § 13; 7A M.J. Equity, §§ 70, 71, 81, 116; 14B M.J. Pleading, § 17. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section has enlarged the function of exceptions to answers and covers every form of insufficiency of answer  whether nonresponsive to the allegations of the bill, evasive, or insufficient as a matter of law. Thomasson v. Walker, 168 Va. 247, 190 S.E. 309, 1937 Va. LEXIS 220 (1937). Under it the motion to strike now takes the place of exceptions to answers for insufficiency. The effect of the motion to strike is to admit that even if the facts set up in the answer are true, yet they are not sufficient as a matter of law to constitute a bar to the action or proceeding. Casilear v. Casilear, 168 Va. 46, 190 S.E. 314, 1937 Va. LEXIS 204 (1937). There is no conflict between this section and § 8.01-283, the privilege and manner of testing the answer simply being enlarged. Both sections are available to a litigant. He may exercise his choice, and unless he is willing to stake his whole case upon a hearing on bill and answer only, he may avail himself of the motion to strike, and t hereby secure a judicial expression which may guide him in further proceeding. Thomasson v. Walker, 168 Va. 247, 190 S.E. 309, 1937 Va. LEXIS 220 (1937). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Uniform Commercial Codes Statute of Frauds affirmative defense struck.  Seller and buyer had an open account under their written agreement, which was an exception to the writing requirement under the Uniform Commercial Code s Statute of Frauds, so the court denied the buyers motion to dismiss the sellers suit for payment and granted the sellers motion to strike that statute of frauds affirmative defense. Quality Foods Coop., Inc. v. New River Oils, L.L.C., 6 6 Va. Cir. 464, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 531 (Amherst County Feb. 14, 2001). Common law provides a re medy to a takings claim.  Motion to strike and dismiss a landowners objections to a condemnation petition filed by the Commissioner of Highways was denied because the common law provid ed a remedy to an Art. I, § 11 takings claim; although subsection G of § 1-219.1 and subdivision A 9 of § 25.1-417 did not expressly delineate a remedy to VDOTs finding that the portion of the land that was not subject to the taking was not an uneconomic remnant, the language of those sections also did not state that there was no remedy for an alleged wrongful determination that a parcel of land was not an uneconomic remnant. Comm'r of Hwys v. W. Dulles Props., L.L.C., 86 Va . Cir. 284, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 16 (Fairfax County Mar. 4, 2013). § 8.01-274.1. Motion or petition for rule to show cause for violation of court order. Text Except as otherwise provided by law, any party requesting a rule to show cause for a violation of a court order in any civil action in a court of record shall file with the court a motion or petition, which may be on a form prescribed by the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia. The motion or petition shall include facts identifying with particularity the violation of a specific court orde r and be sworn to or accompanied by an affidavit setting forth such facts. A rule to show cause entered by the court shall be served on the person alleged to have violated the court order, along with the accompanying motion or petition and any affidavit filed with such motion or petition. History History. 2018, c. 522. Annotations Effective date. This section became effective July 1, 2018. CASE NOTES Substituted service.  Because the circuit courts determinations were supported by the record, and the statute did not preclude substituted service of a show cause order, the circui t court properly dismissed a husbands motion to quash service of process; the wife showed proper substituted service on a family member at the husbands usual place of abode and attempted to give the husband notice of the hearing both by email and by sending the show cause rule and accompanying documents to a post office box. Koons v. Crane, 72 Va. App. 720, 853 S.E.2d 524, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (2021). Phrase served on the person in § 8.01-274.1 refers to the multiple methods for obtaining in personam jurisdiction over a party, which include substitut ed service pursuant to subdivision 2 of § 8.01-296; either substituted service on a family member or by posting is valid service upon a natural person if it occurs at the partys usual place of abode, and under subdivision 2 of § 8.0 1-296, substituted service at a partys usual place of abode may give a court jurisdiction over that person. Koons v. Crane, 72 Va. App. 720, 853 S.E.2d 524, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (2021). Husband was properly served with a show cause rule because he was a nonresident, and thus, the Virginia long-arm statute applied, and substituted service of the s how cause rule was valid; the long-arm statute did not require personal service on the nonresident, and substituted service in Washington was sufficient to give the Virginia court personal jurisdiction over the husband and satisfy the requirement that a show cause rule be served on the person. Koons v.

General Consideration. II. Illustrative Cases. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . Sectio n based upon public policy.  This section and § 8.01-678, requiring the courts to disregard trifling defects in pleadings or procedure, are based upon a sound public policy, and are suppor ted by the unanswerable logic of the progressive exponents of the best legal thought, with which the Supreme Court has been in full accord. Kennedy v. Mullins, 155 Va. 166, 154 S.E. 568, 1930 Va. LEXIS 155 (1930). Purpose.  The purpose of this section is that demurrers challenging pleadings on grounds that are not substantial or material, and which do not go to the very merits of a c ause, are no longer allowed. Griffin v. Griffin, 183 Va. 443, 32 S.E.2d 700, 1945 Va. LEXIS 191 (1945) (see Washington v. Garrett, 189 Va. 57, 52 S.E.2d 83 (1949); Turpin v. Lyle, 377 F. Supp. 170 (W.D. Va. 1974)). Formal and substantial defects distinguished.  If the matter pleaded be in itself insufficient without reference to the manner of pleading it, the defect is substantial; but if the only fault is in the form of alleging it, the defect is formal. Norfolk &amp; P. Belt Line R.R. v. Sturgis, 117 Va. 532, 85 S.E. 572, 1915 Va. LEXIS 68 (1915). A motion is sufficient if it informs the defendant of the nature of the demand made upon him, and states such facts as will enable the court to say that if the facts are proved as alleged they establish a good cause of action. Virginia Portland Cement Co. v. Luck's Adm'r, 103 Va. 427, 49 S.E. 577, 1905 Va. LEXIS 12 (1905); Virginia &amp; N.C. W heel Co. v. Harris, 103 Va. 708, 49 S.E. 991, 1905 Va.

Where motion, though inartificially commencing statement of cause of action with a quod cum, yet states the essential averments in direct and positive terms, it i s sufficient. Roanoke Nat'l Bank v. Hambrick, 82 Va. 135, 1886 Va. LEXIS 17 (1886). Test as to sufficiency of notice of motion.  The tendency of modern times is to simplify matters of mere procedure, and for this reason the procedure by motion is looked upon with great indulgence, and notic es are upheld as sufficient, however informal, where they contain sufficient substance to fairly apprise the defendant of the nature of the demand made upon him, and state sufficient facts to enable the court to say that if the facts stated are proved, t he plaintiff is entitled to recover. Mankin v. Aldridge, 127 Va. 761, 105 S.E. 459, 1920 Va. LEXIS 83 (1920). A motion is sufficient if it informs the defendant of the nature of the demand made upon him, and states such facts as will enable the court to say that if the fa cts are proved as alleged they establish a good cause of action. Stonegap Colliery Co. v. Hamilton, 119 Va. 271, 89 S.E. 305, 1916 Va. LEXIS 105 (1916). A motion is sufficient which contains sufficient matter to enable the plaintiff to prove his case and so apprises the defendant of that case as to enable him to m ake defense. Cosmopolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Koegel, 104 Va. 619, 52 S.E. 166, 1905 Va. LEXIS 142 (1905). What particularity required in motion.  The motion in a case sets forth minutely the time, the place and the circumstances under which the plaintiff received the injuries complained of. To require more would be to compel the plaintiff to set forth in the motion matters of evidence. This has never been required, even under the strict rule of pleading which formerly prevailed. Kelly v. Schneller, 148 Va. 573, 139 S.E. 275, 1927 Va. LEXIS 256 (1927). If a pleading to the merits shows sufficient substance for the court to see how to give judgment according to law and the very right of the case it is good, though defective in form, under the provisions of this section. Stonegap Colliery Co. v. Hamilton, 119 Va. 271, 89 S.E. 305, 1916 Va. LEXIS 105 (1916). That a motion is unnecessarily long is immaterial in view of this section. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Whitehurst, 125 Va. 260, 99 S.E. 568, 1919 Va. LEXIS 21 (1919). Demurrer lies only to defects apparent on face of pleading.  A demurrer properly lies for such defects and such only as are apparent upon the face of the pleading. Russell Creek Coal Co. v. Wells, 96 Va. 416, 31 S.E. 614, 1 898 Va. LEXIS 109 (1898); Watts v. Commonwealth, 99 Va. 872, 39 S.E. 706, 1901 Va. LEXIS 111 (1901). Demurrer proper when motion sets out facts insufficient on their face.  Under this section, providing that a demurrer shall not be sustained to a motion alleging negligence of defendant because the particulars of the negligence are no t alleged, should the facts relied upon to establish negligence be set out in the motion and are on their face insufficient, then a demurrer may be interposed. Crosswhite v. Shelby Operating Corp., 182 Va. 713, 30 S.E.2d 673, 1944 Va. LEXIS 224 (1944). Dupl icity is no ground of demurrer.  Since the effect of this section is to abolish special demurrers, mere duplicity in a count in a declaration is no longer a good ground of demurrer. Norfolk &amp; W.R .R. v. Ampey, 93 Va. 108, 25 S.E. 226, 1896 Va. LEXIS 57 (1896). Affidavit accompanying pleadings not subject to demurrer.  A demurrer to a plea required by statute to be verified by affidavit does not bring to the attention of the court the lack of the affidavit, which is no part of t he plea. Plaintiff should object to the reception of the plea when tendered because not so verified. He cannot make objection after having taken issue, either of law, or fact, on it. Lewis v. Hicks, 96 Va. 91, 30 S.E. 466, 1898 Va. LEXIS 64 (1898). Decision of an issue of law on a demurrer is a decision on the merits and constitutes re s adjudicata as to any other proceedings where the same parties and the same issues are involved. Turpin v. Lyle, 377 F. Supp. 170, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8249 (W.D. Va. 1974). A demurrer must go to the heart of the cause, and if it is sustained it is a decision on the merits of the cause. Griffin v. Griffin, 183 Va. 443, 32 S.E.2d 700, 1945 Va. LEXIS 191 (1945). A demurrer goes to the heart of the case, and if sustained, it is a decision on the merits. Thus a judgment rendered thereon has the effect of a judgment on the m erits where there has been no amendment sought or appeal noted. Turpin v. Lyle, 377 F. Supp. 170, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8249 (W.D. Va. 1974). What defects not cured.  Where there has been a demurrer to any pleading and the same has been overruled, this section cures no defect, imperfection, or omission therein, except such as c ould have been regarded on demurrer. Southern Ry. v. Willcox, 98 Va. 222, 35 S.E. 355, 1900 Va. LEXIS 29 (1900). It is defendants right and duty to call for a bill of particulars if the notice of m otion in a wrongful death action failed to particularize the acts of negligence. P.L. Farmer, Inc. v. Cimino, 185 Va. 965, 41 S.E.2d 1, 1947 Va. LEXIS 234 (1947) (see Washington v. Garrett, 189 Va. 57, 52 S.E.2d 83 (1949)). II.Illustrative Cases. Practice when general allegation of negligence insufficient in plaintiff s pleading.  The plaintiff may not, under the provisions of this section, force a defendant into a trial upon the evidence upon a general averment alleging that the defendant has been negligent without alleging any specific act which he charges to have constituted the negligence of the defendant. In such a case, if the defendant calls for a bill of particulars and the bill of particulars filed, when read in conjunction with t he notice of motion, fails to set forth with reasonable certainty and particularity any specific act of negligence charged and sufficient facts with reference thereto to enable the court to say that if the facts set forth be proven substantially as alleg ed, the defendant has been guilty of some specific act of negligence for which the plaintiff is entitled to recover, the defendant may move the court to strike out the bill of particulars and exclude all evidence tendered by the plaintiff. Kaylor v. Qual ity Bread &amp; Cake Co., 155 Va. 156, 154 S.E. 572, 1930 Va. LEXIS 154 (1930). Allegation of duty.  An allegation of duty is only a conclusion of law. When the facts alleged show the duty, and are stated with sufficient clearness to prevent surprise and enable t he court to proceed upon the merits of the cause, a motion ought to be sustained. Virginia &amp; N.C. Wheel Co. v. Harris, 103 Va. 708, 49 S.E. 991, 1905 Va. LEXIS 41 (1905).

If the motion challenges the venue of the action, the movant shall state therein why venue is improperly laid and what place or places within the Commonwealth would con stitute proper venue for the action. History History. 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-276 abolishes the obsolete demurrer to the evidence of former § 8-140 and, in its place, recognizes the more common motion to strike the evidence, Virginias analogue to the federal motion for a directed verdict. The section also abolishes pleas in abatement; instead, a written motion stating specifically the relief demanded and the grounds therefor is required. Former §§ 8-98 and 8-133 have been deleted accordingly. Cross references. As to when plaintiff may take a nonsuit, see § 8.01-380. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 1A M.J.

II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. When motion to strike granted.  When the sufficiency of a plaintiffs evidence is challenged by a motion to strike, the trial court should grant the motion only when it conclusively appears t hat the plaintiff has proved no cause of action against the defendant, or when it plainly appears that the trial court would be compelled to set aside any verdict found for the plaintiff as being without evidence to support it. Newton v. Veney, 220 Va. 9 47, 265 S.E.2d 707, 1980 Va. LEXIS 189 (1980). Doubts as to sufficiency of evidence resolved in plaintiffs favor.  When the sufficiency of a plaintiffs evidence is challenged by a motion to strike, the trial court should resolve any reasonable doubts as to the sufficiency of the evidence in plaintiffs favor. Newton v. Veney, 220 Va. 947, 265 S.E.2d 707, 1980 Va. LEXIS 189 (1980). Since it may obviate delay and expense of new trial.  When the sufficiency of a plaintiffs evidence is challenged by a motion to strike, the trial court should resolve any reasonable doubt as to the sufficiency o f the evidence in plaintiffs favor; this is so because when a judgment based on a granted motion is reversed on appeal, a new trial must be conducted, but, when a plaintiffs verdict follows a denied motion, whether the verdict is set aside or con firmed by judgment below, the appellate court may enter final judgment thereby obviating the delay and expense of a new trial. Trail v. White, 221 Va. 932, 275 S.E.2d 617, 1981 Va. LEXIS 230 (1981). Demurrer sustained.  Circuit court correctly interpreted the Workout Agreement to preclude breach of contract claim and correctly held that the fraud claims failed because appellant h ad not alleged any justifiable reliance on the alleged misrepresentation. Sweely Holdings, LLC v. R SunTrust Bank, 296 Va. 367, 820 S.E.2d 596, 2018 Va. LEXIS 169 (2018). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The object of this section in requiring the grounds of a demurrer to the evidence (now m otion to strike) to be stated in writing was at least twofold: First, to require the demurrant (now movant) to give notice in writing of the grounds or causes of demurrer (now motion) which he intended to rely on, and, second, to prevent him from assigni ng grounds of demurrer (now motion) in the appellate court wholly different from those relied on in the trial court. McMenamin v. Southern Ry., 115 Va. 822, 80 S.E. 596, 1914 Va. LEXIS 136 (1914); Black v. Daughtry, 130 Va. 24, 107 S.E. 694, 1921 Va. LEX IS 139 (1921). Practice of subsequently reducing to writing not prejudicial.  It is common practice among lawyers, upon the announcement of a demurrer to the evidence (now motion to strike), to agree that it may be subsequently reduced to w riting. And it is not perceived that plaintiff was prejudiced by that irregularity in that respect in this instance, especially as defendants counsel duly delivered the grounds of demurrer (now motion) in writing to counsel for the plaintiff and to t he court. Cooper v. Norfolk S.R.R., 125 Va. 73, 99 S.E. 606, 1919 Va. LEXIS 7 (1919). How evidence considered on motion.  On a demurrer to the evidence (now motion to strike), the court is bound to consider all evidence of the demurrant (now movant) in conflict with that of the demur ree (now movee) as withdrawn, the credibility of the latters witnesses admitted, and all facts admitted which the demurrees (now movees) evidence, thus considered, proved or conduced to prove, or which might reasonably be inferred from his wh ole evidence, direct and circumstantial. Newberry v. Watts, 116 Va. 730, 82 S.E. 703, 1914 Va. LEXIS 83 (1914). Refusal to allow amendment of grounds of motion not prejudicial.  The refusal to permit a demurrant to the evidence (now movant) to amend his grounds of demurrer (now motion) after a verbal joinder in the demurrer (now motion) h as been announced by the demurree (now movee) is not prejudicial to the demurrant (now movant) where, under the grounds already assigned he has the right to rely upon, and does in fact argue the same point proposed to be made and relied on by the amendme nt. Virginia Iron &amp; Coke Co. v. Munsey, 110 Va. 156, 65 S.E. 478, 1909 Va. LEXIS 129 (1909). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Motion to strike denied.  Plaintiffs motion to strike, pursuant to § 8.01-276, a doctors testimony on grounds that the testimony constituted an improper attempt to introduce the opinions of two other doctors was denied; § 8.01-401.1 permitted an expert witness to render an opinion that was based on data that might not be admissible in evidence, and the doctor repeatedly stated that he neither consulted nor relied upon the re ports of the other two doctors, and defendant did not attempt to argue substantively the contents of the other doctors reports. Young v. Waddell, 60 Va. Cir. 264, 2002 Va. Cir.

A person, u pon whom process to answer any action has been served, may take advantage of any defect in the issuance, service or return thereof by a motion to quash filed prior to or simultaneously with the filing of any pleading to the merits. Upon sustaining the mo tion, the court may strike the proof of service or permit amendment of the process or its return as may seem just. B. A person, u pon whom process has not been served within one year of commencement of the action against him, may make a special appearance, which does not constitute a general appearance, to file a motion to dismiss. Upon finding that the plaintiff did not exercise d ue diligence to have timely service and sustaining the motion to dismiss, the court shall dismiss the action with prejudice. Upon finding that the plaintiff did exercise due diligence to have timely service and denying the motion to dismiss, the court sh all require the person filing such motion to file a responsive pleading within 21 days of such ruling. Nothing herein shall prevent the plaintiff from filing a nonsuit under § 8.01-380 before the entry of an order granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to the provisions of this section. Nothing in this subsection shall pertain to cases involving asbestos. History History. Code 1950, § 8-118; 1954, c. 333; 1977, c. 617; 1994, c. 37; 2 006, c. 151. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Former § 8-118 required that the pleaders use a plea in abatement when the process was defective and amendable and a motion to quash when the process was inval id and thus not amendable. Section 8.01-277 adopts the motion to quash as the one form of motion to bring process questions before the court. The court will then decide either that the error in process or the return is curable by amendment and permit cor rection or that the error is not curable and that the action should therefore be dismissed.

Process, §§ 14, 46, 54, 55. CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Statute inapplicable where process never served.  By its express terms, this statute applies only where process has actually been served on the defendant; it does not permit a defendant to simultaneously make a v oluntary general appearance and assert the bar provided by rule because he was not served with process. Gilpin v. Joyce, 257 Va. 579, 515 S.E.2d 124, 1999 Va. LEXIS 54 (1999); Brown v. Burch, 30 Va. App. 670, 519 S.E.2d 403, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 551 (1999 ) (decided prior to 2006 amendments). General appearance waived service issues.  Because a general appearance waived all questions concerning service of process, the judgment of the trial court which granted a motion to dismiss under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:5(e) [see now Rule 3:8] was reversed. Under § 8.01-277, the individual, a defendant in a personal injury case, had to assert any defect in service by a motion filed prior to or simultaneously with filing any pleading to the merits. Lyren v. O hr, 271 Va. 155, 623 S.E.2d 883, 2006 Va. LEXIS 13 (2006) (decided prior to 2006 amendments). Service untimely.  Employees nonsuit, and its subsequent vacatur, did not change the service of process requirement set forth under §§ 8.01-275.1 and 8.01-335; the twelve- month period for service ended on August 15, 2012, but the employee did not serve process until August 31, 2012, and her service of process was therefore untimely under Virginia law. Rice v. Alpha Sec., Inc., 556 Fed. Appx. 257, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 3483 (4th Cir. 2014). Standing.  Defendant did not have standing to raise an objection to the method and place of service of a subpoena duces tecum on defendants cell phone service provider b ecause standing to do so rested solely with the cell phone service provider. Furthermore, the cell phone service provider never objected to the method of service of the subpoena duces tecum and in fact requested service by facsimile at its New Jersey off ices. Reed v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 233 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2016). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. A motion to quash process is not like a former plea in abatement but simply an informal method to raise a question, which ordinarily could have been raised by a plea in abatement. Eure v. Morgan Jones &amp; Co., 195 Va. 678, 79 S.E.2d 862, 1954 Va. LEXIS 147 (1954). Objection to improperly executed process.  Where the service of process on a defendant is invalid, because it was not legally executed, objection thereto may be made informally by motion, or in case of non appearance of the defendant, the court will itself raise the objection, if observed, and no formal plea is required. Commonwealth ex rel. Duvall v. Hall, 194 Va. 914, 76 S.E.2d 208, 1953 Va. LEXIS 158 (1953). Courts are liberal in allowing officers to amend their returns, according to the truth, when a casual and honest mistake has occurred. Amendments may be allowed, even to take away a cause of action on the original return, and though the officer has gone out of office, or is dead. Stotz v. Collins &amp; Co., 83 Va. 423, 2 S.E. 737, 1887 Va. LEXI S 87 (1887); Shenandoah V.R.R. v. Ashby's Trustees, 86 Va. 232, 9 S.E. 1003, 1889 Va. LEXIS 30 (1889). But allowance not ground for continuance.  The allowance of an amendment to the sheriffs return on a writ of summons is not ground for a continuance, though before the amendment, there was nothing to s how a valid service of the writ, especially, where the case had been previously set for trial by consent. Atlantic &amp; D.R.R. v. Peake, 87 Va. 130, 12 S.E. 348, 1890 Va. LEXIS 102 (1890). When she riff may amend return.  A sheriff may be allowed to amend his return after judgment by default, so as to show proper service. Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Everhart's Adm'r, 88 Va. 9 52, 14 S.E. 836, 1892 Va. LEXIS 55 (1892). Amendments may be allowed after action commenced against sheriff and sureties, but not after judgment. Wardsworth v. Miller, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 99, 1847 Va. LEXIS 28 (1847); Carr v. Meade, 77 Va. 142, 1883 Va. LEXIS 45 (1883). Amendments have been allowed after lapses of seven or thirteen years. Rucker v. Harrison, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 181, 1818 Va. LEXIS 35 (1818); Shenandoah V.R.R. v. Ashb y's Trustees, 86 Va. 232, 9 S.E. 1003, 1889 Va. LEXIS 30 (1889). Amendmen ts in federal courts.  Returns of substituted service which are defective may be amended in the federal court, and the decisions of the State court are not binding as to such amendment. King v. Davis, 137 F. 198, 1903 U.S. App. LEXIS 5453 (C.C.D. Va. 1903). No amendme nt without notice.  Where a return of substituted service is fatally defective, and the court has not otherwise acquired jurisdiction of the defendant, application to amend the retur n will not be granted without notice. King v. Davis, 137 F. 198, 1903 U.S. App. LEXIS 5453 (C.C.D. Va. 1903). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS General appearance found.  Neither Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:3 [see now Rule 3:5] nor § 8.01-277 allowed an engineering firm to file a demurrer, a special plea of the statute of limitations, an objection of venue, a motion to drop, a motion for a bill of particulars, a motion craving oyer, and a removal petition, participation in depositions, and provision of expert assistance to another defendant in the case, without making a general appearanc e and waiving any challenge to the personal jurisdiction of the trial court; § 8.01-277 was to be strictly construed and provided for challenges to defects in process. City of Portsmouth v. Buro Happold Consulting Eng'rs, 69 Va. Cir. 397, 2005 Va. Cir . LEXIS 255 (Portsmouth Dec. 22, 2005). Simultaneous pleading.  This section clearly provides for a challenge to defects in process but does not permit a defendant to simultaneously make a general appearance; stated another wa y, § 8.01-277 allows simultaneous pleading only when a challenge is made to a technical defect in the servicefor example service on a corporate representative not authorized by statute. This interpretation is reinforced by the last sentence of the statute [now the last sentence of subsection A], which provides that the court may strike the proof of service or permit amendment of the process or its return as may seem just. City of Portsmouth v. Buro Happold Consulting Eng'rs, 69 Va. Cir. 397, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 255 (Portsmouth Dec. 22, 2005). Filing subpoena waived objections to personal jurisdiction.  Publishers motion to dismiss a defamation case based on lack of personal jurisdiction was denied because, before filing that motion, the publishers attorn ey filed an attorney-issued subpoena duces tecum, which took advantage of the courts power, which did not question jurisdiction, and which, therefore, was not a special appearance under § 8.01-277; by filing the subpoena, the publisher waived obje ctions to personal jurisdiction and subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the court. Marsinko v. Burwell, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 125 (Roanoke County Oct. 1, 2008).

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-279 combines former §§ 8-114 to 8-116 which dispense with the proof of certain facts alleged in pleadings unless the verity of such facts is pu t in issue by an affidavit. The only substantive change has been to expand subsection B (formerly § 8-115) to include partnerships and unincorporated associations. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2A M.J.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Consideration. II. Handwriting. III. Ownership. IV. Partnership; Incorporation. II. Handwriting. III. Ownership. IV. Partnership; Incorporation. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . II.Handwriting. The basis of statutes dispensing with proof of signature, in the absence of an affidavit denying the allegations of such, is that the failure of the defendant to establish, set up or assert his defense, in the manner prescribed by law, raises a presumption that the material facts alleged or pleaded are admitted to be true. Bova v. Roanoke O il Co., 180 Va. 332, 23 S.E.2d 347, 1942 Va. LEXIS 175 (1942). When subsection A applicable.  Subsection A only applies where the declaration alleges that the defendant, or the person stated to have made the writing, subscribed his name thereto. Kelley v. Paul, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 191, 1846 Va. LEXIS 41 (1846); Shepherd, Hunter &amp; Co. v. Frys, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 442, 1847 Va. LEXIS 4 (1847). Subsection A does not apply to a transfer of paper by mere delivery. Clason v. Parrish, 9 3 Va. 24, 24 S.E. 471, 1896 Va. LEXIS 48 (1896). Subsection A applies to instruments signed with the name of the partnership. But the que stion is still open, whether the persons sought to be charged are members of the partnership. Shepherd, Hunter &amp; Co. v. Frys, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 442, 1847 Va. LEXIS 4 (1847). The defenses contemplated by subsection A involve a denial of the making (the factum) of the writing, indorsement, assignment, acceptance or other writing by the person charged therewith, not of other facts in connection with rights of the holder to recover thereon. Holdsworth v. Anderson Drug Co., 118 Va. 359, 87 S.E. 565, 1916 Va. LEXIS 1 6 (1916). A plea under subsection A is equivalent to a plea of non est factum. Holdsworth v. Anders on Drug Co., 118 Va. 359, 87 S.E. 565, 1916 Va. LEXIS 16 (1916); Hillman v. Cornett, 137 Va. 200, 119 S.E. 74, 1923 Va. LEXIS 148 (1923). Answer under oath sufficient.  Subsection A was substantially complied with by the answer, under oath, filed in the cause, in which the genuineness of the alleged receipt was disputed, and its validity challenged, and the strictest proof of its genuineness called for. Harnsberger v. Cochran, 82 Va. 727, 1 S.E. 120, 1887 Va. LEXIS 138 (1887) (see also Piedmont Bank v. Hatcher, 94 Va. 229, 26 S.E. 505 (1897)). Affidavit may be filed during trial at the discretion of the court.  In an action upon a note the court allowed the plaintiff during the trial to file an affidavit denying the signature of payee to a receipt for a part payment upon the note. Defendants had relied upon subsection A, and objected to any evidence denying the genuineness of the signature to the receipt. Their objection was properly sustained. Then, upon motion, the plaintiff was permitted to file an affidavit denying the genuineness of such signature, which was approved on appeal. Keister v. Philips, 124 Va. 585, 98 S.E. 674, 1919 Va. LEXIS 150 (1919). Photocopy of license agreement held properly admitted.  Where plaintiff questioned at trial the authenticity of the signatures on the license agreement and objected to the fact that the manager for defendants store who identified the agreement could not authenticate the signatures from personal knowledge, but did not comply with the statutory mandate, and moreover, in conjunction with its motion to dismiss, defendant submitted the affidavit of its manager identify ing the document and verifying the signatures, the trial court properly admitted a photocopy of the license agreement. Carmody v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 234 Va. 198, 361 S.E.2d 128, 4 Va. Law Rep. 793, 1987 Va. LEXIS 229 (1987). Objection to the evidence must be made in trial court.  A plaintiff in equity files with his bill, as the ground of his claim, an order on one of the defendants, which has not been accepted. No proof of the execution o f the order is given, but its genuineness is not questioned in the court below, and it is made the basis of a decree in favor of the plaintiff. It is too late to make objection in the appellate court, to the want of proof of the order. James River &amp; Kana wha Co. v. Littlejohn, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 53, 1867 Va. LEXIS 34 (1867). Bill dismissed upo n default of proof.  Where the answer of the maker of a note denies that the payee indorsed it to the complainant as alleged in the latters bill, and the denial is supported by af fidavit, as required by subsection A, the burden of proof is thrown upon the complainant to show such indorsement, and in default thereof his bill should be dismissed. Harnsberger v. Cochran, 82 Va. 727, 1 S.E. 120, 1887 Va. LEXIS 138 (1887); Piedmont Ba nk v. Hatcher, 94 Va. 229, 26 S.E. 505, 1897 Va. LEXIS 66 (1897); Hillman v. Cornett, 137 Va. 200, 119 S.E. 74, 1923 Va. LEXIS 148 (1923). Effect of failur e to deny by affidavit.  When any writing whatsoever is relied on in a pleading, unless it is questioned by an affidavit or sworn pleading it cannot be questioned at all and the party rel ying on it will not be required to introduce any evidence at all to prove it. Chestnut v. Chestnut, 104 Va. 539, 52 S.E. 348, 1905 Va. LEXIS 131 (1905); Taylor v. Carter, 117 Va. 845, 86 S.E. 120, 1915 Va. LEXIS 103 (1915); Hillman v. Cornett, 137 Va. 20 0, 119 S.E. 74, 1923 Va. LEXIS 148 (1923). Where notice of motion for judgment alleged that contract was signed by defendant, and there was no affidavit denying such signature, proof thereof was not requir ed. Bova v. Roanoke Oil Co., 180 Va. 332, 23 S.E.2d 347, 1942 Va. LEXIS 175 (1942). In view of § 8.01-389 providing for the admission of foreign deeds in evidence, and this section, it was proper for the court to admit a deed of trust in evide nce which was not filed with the answer, but was subsequently offered, where such deed was relied upon by the defendant in answer to an attachment and not denied by affidavit of plaintiff. F.D. Cummer &amp; Son Co. v. R.M. Hudson Co., 141 Va. 271, 127 S.E. 1 71, 1925 Va. LEXIS 406 (1925). Title bond sufficient evidence of title where execution not denied.  Under this statute, prior to the 1919 revision, where an answer set up a title bond as a source of title and the bond was filed as part of the answer, the executi on and delivery of the title bond not being denied, no other evidence of its execution was necessary. Robinett v. Taylor, 121 Va. 583, 93 S.E. 616, 1917 Va. LEXIS 60 (1917) (see also Simmons v. Simmons, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 451 (1880)). A bill having alleged that the order filed as the ground of plaintiffs claim was drawn by one of the defendants, no proof of the signature was necessary. James River &amp; Kanawha Co. v. Littlejohn, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 53, 1867 Va. LEXIS 34 (1867). Effect of plea denying that plaintiff is holder in due course.  The fact that the defendant swears to a plea denying that the plaintiff is the holder in due course of the negotiable note sued on does not throw upon the plainti ff the burden of showing that he is such holder. Holdsworth v. Anderson Drug Co., 118 Va. 359, 87 S.E. 565, 1916 Va. LEXIS 16 (1916). III.Ownership. The purpose of the legislature should not be ignored. That purpose was to make it unnece ssary to prove ownership or agency where ownership or agency is alleged, unless an affidavit is filed putting the matter in issue. Subsection B is a wise statute, but it may not be invoked unless proper allegations are made. It was not the purpose of sub section B to catch the unwary, but to obviate the necessity of proving matter which rests peculiarly in the possession of the defendant. Carlton v. Martin, 160 Va. 149, 168 S.E. 348, 1933 Va. LEXIS 194 (1933) (see Kirn v. Bembury, 163 Va. 891, 178 S.E. 5 3 (1935)). The basis of subsection B dispensing with proof of ownership, in the absence of an affid avit denying the allegation of such, is that the failure of the defendant to establish, set up or assert his defense, in the manner prescribed by law, raises a presumption that the material facts alleged or pleaded are admitted to be true.

CASE NOTES Sufficiency of affidavit.  If an affidavit in support of a pleading is sufficient when affiant swears that he believes it to be true, there is no reason in principle for holding tha t an affidavit concluding true to the best of his knowledge and belief is not a substantial compliance with former version of this section. Paris v. Brown, 143 Va. 896, 129 S.E. 678, 1925 Va.

A party ass erting either a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim or a defense may plead alternative facts and theories of recovery against alternative parties, provided that such claims, defenses, or demands for relief so joined arise out of the sa me transaction or occurrence. Such claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim may be for contribution, indemnity, subrogation, or contract, express or implied; it may be based on future potential liability, and it shall be no defense thereto that the party asserting such claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim has made no payment or otherwise discharged any claim as to him arising out of the transaction or occurrence. B. The court m ay, upon motion of any party, order a separate trial of any claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, and of any separate issue or of any number of such claims; however, in any action wherein a defendant files a third-party motion for judgm ent alleging that damages to the person or property of the plaintiff were caused by the negligence of the third-party defendant in the operation of a motor vehicle, the court shall, upon motion of the plaintiff made at least five days in advance of trial , order a separate trial of such third-party claim. History History. Code 1950, § 8-96.1; 1974, c. 355; 1977, c. 617; 1981, c. 426; 1983, c. 183. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Former § 8-96.1 restricted pleading in the alternative to actions arising out of a motor vehicle accident. Section 8.01-281 removes this restriction. Subsection A grants a party asserting any claim or defense the right to join alternative claims or defenses  i.e. to present alternative statements of the fac ts or alternative legal theories. Subsection B provides that upon motion of any party the court may sever claims for a separate trial. NB: This section does not provide for class actions. Cross references.

CASE NOTES Rule 3:10 [see now Rule 3:13] and this section are mere procedural devices to promote judicial economy by having all claims, actual or potential, arising from the same transaction or occurrence, determined in one proceeding. Virginia Int'l Terms., Inc. v. Ceres Marine Terms., Inc., 879 F. Supp. 31, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2428 (E.D. Va. 199 5). The 1981 amendment to this section was a procedural device for the sake of judicial economy. It just allows third-party plaintiffs to make indemnity claims before the actual claim has technically accrued. Wingo v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 638 F. Supp. 107, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25214 (W.D. Va. 1986). Sufficiency.  Where the allegations of a pleading support two alternative theories of recovery, the pleading of one is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of the other. Balzer &amp; Assocs. v. Lakes on 360, Inc., 250 Va. 527, 463 S.E.2d 453, 1995 Va. LEXIS 139 (1995). Cl aim based on future potential liability in contribution.  According to subsection A of this section and Supreme Court Rule 3:10(a) [see now Rule 3:13(a)], a claim based on future potential liability in contribution may b e asserted in a third-party motion for judgment filed in a pending suit even though the third-party claimant has made no payment or otherwise discharged any claim against him. Gemco-Ware, Inc. v. Rongene Mold &amp; Plastics Corp., 234 Va. 54, 360 S.E.2d 342, 4 Va. Law Rep. 431, 1987 Va. LEXIS 245 (1987). Effect of section.  In the absence of this section and Rule 3:10 [see now Rule 3:13], a party having a claim for indemnity or contribution against another would be prevented from pur suing the claim until it accrued. Virginia Int'l Terms., Inc. v. Ceres Marine Terms., Inc., 879 F. Supp. 31, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2428 (E.D. Va. 1995). Accrual of indemnification action.  This section authorizes a party in a pending action to file a third-party motion for judgment (complaint) seeking indemnification or contribution. Rule 3:10(a) [s ee now Rule 3:13(a)] establishes the procedure for filing such a claim. When a claim for indemnity or contribution is filed as a separate cause of action, it does not accrue until the person seeking the relief has paid more than his or her share of the o bligation. Virginia Int'l Terms., Inc. v. Ceres Marine Terms., Inc., 879 F. Supp. 31, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2428 (E.D. Va. 1995). Dismissal for misjoinder of defendants and causes of action held erroneous.  Where a fair reading of the amended motion for judgment showed that plaintiff pleaded alternative theories of recovery against the same group of defendants and th at the claims arose out of the same transaction or occurrence; the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs action on the ground of misjoinder of parties defendant and causes of action. Fox v. Deese, 234 Va. 412, 362 S.E.2d 699, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1248 , 1987 Va. LEXIS 272 (1987). Chancellor correctly determined activities were a nuisance.  Because it was a suit in equity and there was no motion for an issue out of chancery, the chancellor correctly held that he must first determine whether the activ ities complained of constituted a nuisance. Packett v. Herbert, 237 Va. 422, 377 S.E.2d 438, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1984, 1989 Va. LEXIS 34 (1989). Seller could not sue buyer for installment payments under assigned contract.  Where a seller assigned to a finance company all of the sellers rights to payment on a contract for the sale of a truck, § 8.01-281 did not permit the sell er to sue a buyer for the full amount of the installment payments due under the contract because: (1) the finance company had not even filed a claim against the seller; and (2) the finance company recouped some of the value of the sales contract by resel ling the truck. Because the finance company had not sued the buyer for the remaining deficiency for which the buyer was liable pursuant to former § 8.9-504(2), the finance company was not in a posture to sue the seller. Nigh v. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC , Inc., No. 00-1634-A, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26274 (E.D. Va. Aug. 15, 2001). Joinder of claims.  Circuit court properly dismissed a sellers second suit against the buyer on the basis of res judicata because the sellers claims  for settlement, oral contract, and quantum meruit  all fit within a single factual narrative  to be paid for work it did for the buyer  and accrued before the seller had ever filed the first suit for breach of an alleged settlement agreement, and the sellers alternative claims qualified for joinder under the same transaction or occurrence standard and constituted res judicata under the same standard where no disqualifying principle of res judicata applied. Funny Guy, LLC v. Lecego, LLC, 293 Va. 135, 795 S.E.2d 887, 2017 Va. LEXIS 7 (2017). Alternative pleading permitted in workers compensation case.  Workers Compensation Commission did not hold that employee could not advance two alternative theories of compensability and still meet her burden of proof; in stead, the Commission found that the medical evidence and testimony presented by the employee did not prove either of her theories, and the Commission merely pointed out that, in addition to the lacking evidence, the employees presentation of two alt ernative theories was yet another factor demonstrating that the employee did not definitively know the cause of her accident. Burney-Divens v. Cmty. Corr. Admin., 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 145 (Va. Ct. App. May 3, 2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Joinder.  Where couple asserted, in addition to counts seeking indemnity against liability, direct contract claims having no indemnity flavor to them at all, under § 8.0 1-281 A, the challenged counts qualified as claims that could be joined to non-indemnity claims. Jackson v. Quantrex Integrated Tech. Group, Inc., 57 Va. Cir. 368, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 42 (Southampton County Feb. 12, 2002). Third-party plaintiffs motion for judgment was not subject to demurrer because, under § 8.01-281, third-party plaintiffs properly joined their fraud claim against the party suing them for breach of contract in the same action, as the fraud was alleged to have occurred as to the same contract. Colinsky Consulting, Inc. v. Holloway, 57 Va. Cir. 403, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 225 (Norfolk Mar. 1, 2002). Joinder of the estates claims against the pharmaceutical manufacturers and the health-care providers was permitted because the right of action against each de fendant rested upon the allegation that the decedents death resulted from the negligence of each and thus, the claims arose out of the same transaction or occurrence. Wright v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., 66 Va. Cir. 195, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 316 (Portsmouth Nov . 15, 2004). Car dealers demurrer to a buyers amended motion for judgment was overruled as: (1) the tort and contract claims demonstrated an ongoing series of negotiat ions with respect to one specific good, the purchase of a car, (2) the claims involved the same witnesses, documents, and nexus of facts, and (3) judicial economy would be served by trying the claims together; that insurance information would be introduc ed at trial with respect to the contract claim, but it would be improper to introduce such information with respect to the tort claims...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-282"><akn:num>§ 8.01-282</akn:num><akn:heading>Motion to strike evidence</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When a defendant moves the court to strike out all of the evidence, upon any grounds, and such motion is overruled by the court, such defendant shall not thereafter be precluded from introducing evidence in his behalf.

Service of process; waiver, duty to save costs, request to waive, how served. Text A. In an actio n pending in general district court or circuit court, the plaintiff may notify a defendant of the commencement of the action and request that the defendant waive service of process as provided in subsection B. Any person subject to service as set forth i n § 8.01-296, 8.01-299, §§ 8.01-301 through 8.01-306 or § 8.01-320, with the exception of the Secretary of the Commonwealth and the Clerk of the State Corporation Commission, who receives actual notice of an action in the manner provided in t his section, has a duty to avoid any unnecessary costs of serving process. B. The notice and request shall incorporate the request for waiver and shall: 1. Be in writing and shall be addressed directly to the defendant, if an individual, or else to an officer, director or registered agent authorized by appointment or law to receive service of process of a defendant subject to service under § 8.01-299, § § 8.01-301 through 8.01-306 or § 8.01-320; 2. Be dispatched through first-class mail or other reliable means; 3. Be accompanied by a copy of the motion for judgment, bill of complaint or other such initial pleading and identify the court in which it has been filed; 4. Inform the defendant, by means of a form provided by Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court, of the consequences of compliance and failure to comply with the request; 5. Set forth the date on which the request is sent; 6. Allow the defendant a reasonable time to return the waiver, which shall be no more than 30 days from the date on which the request is sent, or 60 days from that date if the defendant s address is outside the Commonwealth; and 7. Provide the defendant with an extra copy of the notice and request, as well as a prepaid means of compliance in writing. If a defendant fails to comply with a request for waiver made by a plaintiff, the court shall impose the costs subsequently incurred in effecting service on the defendant unless good cause for the failure is shown. C. A defendant that, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver so requested is not required to serve a grounds of defense or other responsive pleading to the motion for judgment or other initial pleading until 60 days after the date on which the reques t for waiver of service was sent, or 90 days after that date if the defendants address was outside the Commonwealth. D. When the pl aintiff files a waiver of service with the court, the action shall proceed as if a notice and motion for judgment or other initial pleading had been served at the time of filing the waiver, and no proof of service shall be required. E. The costs t o be imposed on a defendant for failure to comply with a request to waive service of a summons shall include the costs subsequently incurred in effecting service under § 8.01-299, §§ 8.01-301 through 8.01-306 or § 8.01-320, together with the costs, including reasonable attorneys fees, of any motion required to collect the costs of service. This provision does not apply to the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Secretary of the Commonwealth or the Clerk of the State Cor poration Commission. F. A defendant who waives service of process pursuant to this section does not thereby waive any objection to the venue or to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of that defendant, or to any other defense or objection other than objections based on inadequac y of process or service of process.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Plaintiff not en titled to quash service of process.  Denial of a former patients request to quash service of process on health care providers was appropriate when the patient contended that the patient, who was proceeding in forma pauperis, did not wish for the health care providers to be served at the time when the patient filed the patients complaint. Rundle v. Carter, 91 Va. Cir. 177, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 171 (Norfolk Sept. 17, 2015). Waiver not shown.  Reconsideration was proper because there was no evidence that a mother waived service under § 8.01-286.1, and the fathers mere mailing of the pleadings and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 4:15(e) certification were insufficient to constitute proper service under § 8.01-296. Natal v. Natal, 86 Va. Cir. 278, 2012 Va. Cir.

CASE NOTES This section cures defective service when process actually reaches the necessary person within the prescribed time limit. This cure extends to actions unless the particular statute specifically provides it will not apply. Bendele ex rel. Bendele v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Medical Assistance Servs., 29 Va. App. 395, 512 S.E.2d 827, 1999 Va. A pp. LEXIS 194 (1999). Defendants actual notice of habitual offender proceeding, received after entry of the related adjudication order, did not excuse the Commonwealth from complyi ng with the statute regarding notice by publication; thus, the Commonwealth could not rely on § 8.01-288 to cure defect in its notice of publication, but since the Commonwealth relied on the presumption of regularity to establish that the underlying o rder adjudicating defendant as a habitual offender conformed to law and defendant did not rebut that presumption, defendants conviction for driving with a revoked license while a habitual offender pursuant to § 46.2-357 was affirmed. Powell v. Com monwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 101 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 13, 2007). Defective service cure d when process received.  The denial of the motion to quash service of process was proper because the process was actually received by the corporations registered agent even though pro cess had not been properly served; the language of § 8.01-288 evidences a legislative intent to exclude service of process from its saving provision only in certain limited instances, furthermore use of the word may in § 8.01-299 indicates that some other kind of service might be proper. Frey v. Jefferson Homebuilders, Inc., 251 Va. 375, 467 S.E.2d 788, 1996 Va. LEXIS 26 (1996). Irregular se rvice of process did not deny due process.  Court was inclined to hold that the Alexandria Circuit Court had personal jurisdiction over debtor and that the failure to serve her with the summons and to mail her copies of the status conference notices and pretrial order, while irregular, did not deprive her of notice and an opportunity to be heard, which was the bedrock of due process under U.S. Const., Amend. V and XIV, where: (i) debtor was served with bot h the complaint and a notice of hearing; (ii) and, as a result of reviewing the case file, she received a copy of the summons 17 days prior to the trial and had actual knowledge of the trial date, at which she in fact appeared, argued, and testified.

Court-issued process required.  Virginia courts have made it abundantly clear that the operation of Virginias curing statute, § 8.01-288, requires that the defendant have received court i ssued process, notwithstanding § 8.01-285, which states that the term process shall be deemed to include notice. Campbell v. Hampton Rds. Bankshares, Inc., 925 F. Supp. 2d 800, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24026 (E.D. Va. 2013). Section applicable to petitions for judicial review of decisions of the Vi rginia Employment Commission.  Petitions for judicial review under former subsection B of § 60.2-500 [see now subsection C] must comply with the requirements of Chapter 8 of Title 8.01 (§ 8.01-285 et seq.) and Rule 2A of the Rules of the Supreme Court; the curing statute (§ 8.01-288) applies to the service of petitions under former subsection B of § 60.2-500 [see now subsection C] because this section does not specifically prescribe a particular method of service. VEC v. Porter-Blaine Corp., 27 Va. App. 153, 497 S.E.2d 889, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (1998). Insufficiency of petition for judicial review of Virginia Employm ent Commissions decision cured by this section.  Circuit court did not err when it denied Virginia Employment Commissions motion to dismiss petition for judicial review due to insufficient service. Although service of petition upon the Commissioner by overnight mail failed to comply with the requirements for personal service set forth in Chapter 8 of Title 8.01, the commissioner actually received the two copies of the petition by mail within the time limits prescribed by law, making service sufficient under § 8.01-288. VEC v. Porter-Blaine Corp., 27 Va. App. 153, 497 S.E.2d 889, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (1998). Delivery of copy to servant held valid .  Where the deputy marshal served the notice of the motion of judgment upon the defendant by leaving a copy thereof at his residence with the servant who answered t he door, and made return that he had left a copy at defendants residence with his wife, more than 15 days before the return day, the attorney for defendant going to the deputy marshal and asking that he change the return to show delivery to the serva nt, motion to dismiss was denied on the ground that the notice had reached its destination within the time prescribed by law. The fact that the attorney for defendant, more than 15 days before the return day, was requesting that the deputy marshal change his return, was sufficient proof that the notice had reached its destination within the time prescribed by law. Eley v. Gamble, 75 F.2d 171, 1935 U.S. App. LEXIS 2889 (4th Cir. 1935) (decided under prior law). Timely service held not shown.  Where the only evidence of the time of receipt of process offered by plaintiffs, other than an undated return receipt, was the testimony of their own counsel that an employee of defendant insurer had telephoned him two days before the return day, even if counsels testimony had been admitted into evidence, it would not have proved that the letter was received in the time required by this section and § 16.1-82. Davis v. American Interinsurance Exch., 228 Va. 1, 319 S.E.2d 723, 1984 Va. LEXIS 167 (1984). Section not applicable to juveni le cases.  This section is not applicable to the service of a summons under § 16.1-264, which provides for service in juvenile cases, since it excepts process commencing actions wherein service of process is specifically prescribed by statute. Garritty v. Virginia Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Sinift, 11 Va. App. 39, 396 S.E.2d 150, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 159 (1990). Savings provisions of this section did not apply when party mailed simple copy of the pe tition for appeal that she had filed to the agency. That was not process. Bendele ex rel. Bendele v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Medical Assistance Servs., 29 Va. App. 395, 512 S.E.2d 827, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (1999). Trial court erred in denying an ambulance services motion to vacate a default judgment pursuant to § 8.01-428 entered in favor of an injured party, as the service was not served with the notice portion of the motion for judgment required to be served under Rule 3:3(c) [see now Rule 3:5], and trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the default judgment; this section did not cure the defective process, as t he statute cured only defects in the manner process was served, not defects in the process itself, and notwithstanding the services actual notice of the proceedings, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the default judgment. Lifestar Response of Md., Inc. v. Vegosen, 267 Va. 720, 594 S.E.2d 589, 2004 Va. LEXIS 64 (2004). Service of process not found.  Appeal of Virginia Board for Contractorss revocation of appellants license was properly dismissed, as his mailing of a courtesy copy of a petition for appeal to the Boards Secretary did not constitute service of process under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2A:4(a), nor did it satisfy the relaxed requirements of the curative statute, § 8.01-288. Muse Constr. Group, Inc. v. Commonwealth Bd. for Contrs., 61 Va.

Service on agency secretary.  Trial court did not err in denying state regulation challengers motion for summary judgment, in dismissing the state regulation challengers petition for a ppeal, and in awarding sanctions, including attorney fees, to the state commission, as the state regulation challenger did not serve his petition on the agency secretary and did not furnish the clerk of court, in writing, the name and address of each defendant even though he knew from previous, similar litigation that he was required to do so.

However, in a ny case in which custody or visitation of a minor child or children is at issue and a summons is issued for the attendance and testimony of a teacher or other school personnel who is not a party to the proceeding, if such summons is served on school prop erty, it shall be served only by a sheriff or his deputy; or 3. A private process server. For purposes of this section, private process server means any person 18 years of age or older and who is not a party or otherwise interested in the s ubject matter in controversy, and who charges a fee for service of process. Whenever in this Code the term officer or sheriff is used to refer to persons authorized to make, return, or do any other act relating to service of pro cess, such term shall be deemed to refer to any person authorized by this section to serve process. B. Notwithstan ding any other provision of law (i) only a sheriff or high constable may execute an order or writ of possession for personal, real, or mixed property, including a writ of eviction arising out of an action in unlawful entry and detainer or ejectment; (ii) any sheriff, high constable, or law-enforcement officer as defined in § 9.1-101 may serve any capias or show cause order; and (iii) only a sheriff, the high constable for the City of Norfolk or Virginia Beach, or a treasurer may levy upon property.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-293 combines portions of former §§ 8-52 and 8-54. The former proviso of subsection 2, relating to suits for annulment and divorce, retained from former § 8-54 the requirement that service of original process i n divorce suits be by the sheriff. Former law was changed to the extent that other service in divorce suits, e.g., notice for the taking of depositions where the other party was not represented by counsel, was not required to be served by the sheriff. Th e definition of the term sheriff in § 8.01-2 eliminates any need for the exception clause of former § 8-54 (i.e., the reference to § 15.1-77). Cross references. As to acceptance of service of process generally, see § 8.01-327.

Process, §§ 7, 15; 16 M.J. Sheriffs, § 1. CASE NOTES Service by publication.  Divorce court had not obtained personal jurisdiction over a husband where the wifes service by order of publication in a local newspaper appeared to have had no realistic possibility of ever reaching him, and she did not demonstrate why the most inferior method of service was the best that she could have done. The wifes ineffectual method of constructive service by order of publication revealed a lack of due diligence rendering the entire exercise inferior to the substituted-service option available under the long-arm statute, § 8.01-293. Evans v. Evans, 300 Va. 134, 860 S.E.2d 381, 2021 Va. LEXIS 84 (2021). Reading the various service-of-process statutes as a harmonious whole, the legislative intent is unmistakable. Service of process under Virginia statutes involves a cascading series of efforts designed to provide due process by ensuring that the method of notice be reasonably calculated to reach the intended recipient and be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accompl ish it. Consistent with the Commonwealths common-law traditions, statutory hierarchies of methods of service, primus personal, deinde substituted, deinde constructive, are best understood not as alternatives but successive methods, ranging from most effective notice to least effective. Evans v. Evans, 300 Va. 134, 860 S.E.2d 381, 2021 Va. LEXIS 84 (2021). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Levy by sheriff against personal property when serving writs of fieri facias.  Writs of fieri facias, debtor interrogatories and garnishments are distinct, but related proceedings, so that, although sheriff or other executing officer may be required to levy on the tangible personal property of a judgment debtor when executing a writ of fieri facias, no such requirement is imposed when serving a Summons for Interrogatories or Garnishment Summons. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honora ble L.J. Ayers, III, Sheriff for Amherst County, 10-075, 2011 Va. AG LEXIS 3 (02/04/11). Civilian process servers.  Subject to the exceptions specified in § 8.01-293 and exceptions elsewhere in the Code, a civilian employee of the sheriff who is eighteen years of age or olde r and not a party to or otherwise involved in the action may serve process; and no training is required of civilian employees who serve civil process. A sheriff may contract with private process servers or a private process server company to serve proces s. Although a sheriff's exposure to liability would depend on the particular facts and circumstances, in general a sheriff would not be liable for the discretionary acts of his civilian employees, and a sheriff would generally be exposed to minimal risk of liability for the actions of private process servers engaged as independent contractors.

In such case, the return is due on the next day following such Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Failure to make return of service of process by anyone authorized to serve process under § 8.01-293 within the time specified in this section shall not invalidate an y service of process or any judgment based thereon. In the event a late return prejudices a party or interferes with the courts administration of a case, the court may, in its discretion, continue the case, require additional or substitute service of process, or take such other action or enter such order as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.

By de livering a copy thereof in writing to the party in person; or 2. By substituted service in the following manner: a. If the party to be served is not found at his usual place of abode, by delivering a copy of such process and giving information of its purport to any person found there, who is a member of his family, other than a temporary sojourner or guest, and who is of the age of 16 years or older; or b. If such service cannot be effected under subdivision 2 a, then by posting a copy of such process at the front door or at such other door as appears to be the main entrance of such place of abode, provided that not less than 10 days before judgment by default may be entered, the party causing service or his attorney or agent mails to the party served a copy of such process and thereafter files in the office of the clerk of the cou rt a certificate of such mailing. In any civil action brought in a general district court, the mailing of the application for a warrant in debt or affidavit for summons in unlawful detainer or other civil pleading or a copy of such pleading, whether yet issued by the court or not, which contains the date, time and place of the return, prior to or after filing such pleading in the general district court, shall satisfy the mailing requirements of this section.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-296 generally incorporates former § 8-51 and makes it clear that the section applies only to service of process on natural persons. Subdivision 3 interrelates the publication provisions of §§ 8.01-316 through 8.01-320 with the provisions of subdivisions 1 and 2 regarding personal and substituted service and stipulates when service by publication is available on natural persons. To increase the likelihood of actual notice, § 8.01-296 revises former § 8-51 to require that before a default judgment can be entered, process must be mai led not less than ten days prior to the entry of judgment, to the defendants last known address, in addition to posting at his abode, when personal service or service on a family member cannot be obtained. This changes former § 8-51 which requires only the posting of process on the front door of the defendants usual place of abode as a means of substituted service. Cross references.

Tyson v. Commonwealth, No. 2965-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 28, 2000). Terms allowing constructive service must be strictly followed.  Statutes authorizing constructive service of process are to be complied with strictly. National Trust for Historic Preservation v. 1750 K Inv. Partnership, 100 F. R.D. 483, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20412 (E.D. Va. 1984), aff'd, 755 F.2d 927 (4th Cir. 1985), aff'd, 755 F.2d 929 (4th Cir. 1985). Failure to mail copy of complaint to defendant prior to entry of default.  Where the plaintiff does not mail a copy of the complaint to the defendant prior to the entry of a default judgment, the service is not complete and therefore is invalid; in such instance, the court never has in personam jurisdiction over the defendant and a judgment in plaintiffs favor must be vacated. National Trust for Historic Preservation v. 1750 K Inv. Partnership, 100 F.R.D. 483, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20412 (E.D. Va. 1984), aff'd, 755 F.2d 927 (4th Cir. 1985), aff'd, 755 F.2d 929 (4th Cir. 1985). Service of process was proper under § 8.01-329 A of long-arm statute.  Where personal jurisdiction was authorized by the Virginia long-arm statute, § 8.01-328.1, and defendant was served in the manner provided for in Chapter 8 ( § 8.01-285 et seq.) of Title 8.01, namely under subdivision 2 a of this section, service of process was proper under § 8.01-329 A of the Virginia long-arm statute, and defendants motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over the person was de nied. Frederick v. Koziol, 727 F. Supp. 1019, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 241 (E.D. Va. 1990). Because substituted service is sufficient to give a court personal jurisdiction over a party, where the evidence establishes service on a family member at the par tys usual place of abode, the court has authority to adjudicate that partys contempt and award sanctions. Koons v. Crane, 72 Va. App. 720, 853 S.E.2d 524, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (2021). Husband was properly served with a show cause rule because he was a nonresident, and thus, the Virginia long-arm statute applied, and substituted service of the s how cause rule was valid; the long-arm statute did not require personal service on the nonresident, and substituted service in Washington was sufficient to give the Virginia court personal jurisdiction over the husband and satisfy the requirement that a show cause rule be served on the person. Koons v. Crane, 72 Va. App. 720, 853 S.E.2d 524, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (2021). Substituted service constituted constructive notice insufficient under § 46.2-357.  Serving the habitual offender order on defendants father at defendants usual place of abode, even if such service may have conformed with the requirements of subdivision 2 a of this section, constituted a form of constructive notice only. Constructive notice does not satisfy the statutory requirement contained in § 46.2-357, the requirement that defendant knew his license had been suspended, th at he had been declared to be an habitual offender and ordered not to drive. Reed v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 467, 424 S.E.2d 718, 9 Va. Law Rep. 657, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (1992). Substituted service.  Phrase served on the person in § 8.01-274.1 refers to the multiple methods for obtaining in personam jurisdiction over a party, which include substitut ed service pursuant to subdivision 2 of § 8.01-296; either substituted service on a family member or by posting is valid service upon a natural person if it occurs at the partys usual place of abode, and under subdivision 2 of § 8.01-296, substituted service at a partys usual place of abode may give a court jurisdiction over that person.

This procedure does not require service on the convicts committee and to this extent represents a departure from the requirement of former § 8-55 when alimony was so ught from the convict.

Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, may refer to former provisi ons. Applicability.  The denial of the motion to quash service of process was proper because the process was actually received by the corporations registered agent even though pro cess had not been properly served; the language of § 8.01-288 evidences a legislative intent to exclude service of process from its saving provision only in certain limited instances, furthermore use of the word may in § 8.01-299 indicates that some other kind of service might be proper. Frey v. Jefferson Homebuilders, Inc., 251 Va. 375, 467 S.E.2d 788, 1996 Va. LEXIS 26 (1996). The thrust of this section concerns the initial service of process on a domestic corporation rather than interim service of notice for subsequent hearings and oth er proceedings, such as the filing of a praecipe, after the parties are properly before the court. Fredericksburg Constr. Co. v. J.W. Wyne Excavating, Inc., 260 Va. 137, 530 S.E.2d 148, 2000 Va. LEXIS 106 (2000). Service on officers is valid.  Where process is duly served on officers of corporation, such service is valid, though they disclaim the right to answer officially. Lewis' Adm'r v. Glenn, 84 Va. 947, 6 S.E. 866, 1888 Va. LEXIS 170 (1888). But service is not recognition that officer is legal representative in all proceedings.  The fact that this section (as it formerly read) authorizes service of process against a corporation on its treasurer is not a recognition of the treasurer as the representative of the corporation in all legal proceedings. Taylor v. Sutherlin-Meade Tobacco Co., 107 Va. 787, 60 S.E. 132, 1908 Va. LEXIS 141 (1908). Service on a director who has been notified of his election, is valid, especially where he makes no disclaimer. The fact that he does not notify the corporation is immaterial. Danville &amp; W.R.R. v. Brown, 90 Va. 340, 18 S.E. 278, 1893 Va. LEXIS 56 (1893). Service of nonresident president by third party is insufficient.  Where a suit is brought in a county in this State against a corporation domiciled in that county, and process is served upon the president of the corporation resi dent in Philadelphia, by a third party, who makes affidavit, as required, such service is insufficient to give the court jurisdiction. Dillard v. Central Va. Iron Co., 82 Va. 734, 1 S.E. 124, 1887 Va. LEXIS 139 (1887).

Service in case of defunct corpora tions.  Service of process on the late president of a corporation which has ceased to exist is sufficient. Richmond Union Passenger Ry. v. New York &amp; S.B. Ry., 95 Va. 386 , 28 S.E. 573, 1897 Va. LEXIS 47 (1897). Effect of directors disclaimer on validity of return.  The return of an officer is to be taken as true. This is true irrespective of a disclaimer on the part of a director, who was served, which is stated in the retur n, for such disclaimer may be treated as surplusage, and at most is a statement made out of court of a fact which might or might not be proved at the hearing. Davis Bakery, Inc. v. Dozier, 139 Va. 628, 124 S.E. 411, 1924 Va. LEXIS 138 (1924). When president of corporatio n may be served.  Service of process on the president of a corporation in the county or city wherein the action is brought and in which he resides may be made at any time before or on the return day of such process. Jones &amp; Co. v. C.W. Hancock &amp; Sons, 117 Va. 511, 85 S.E. 460, 1915 Va. LEXIS 65 (1915).

City of Lynchburg, 113 Va. 627, 75 S.E. 233, 1912 Va. LEXIS 82 (1912). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Service on registered agent.  Homeowners motion for default judgment was denied for improper service of process because although the complaint was addressed to the registered agent of a li mited liability company, it was not served on the agent but was served on a project coordinator; service on a non-designated, non-member employee was not sufficient to give the LLC notice of the pendency of the action against it. Nichols v. Vico Constr. Corp., 98 Va. Cir. 204, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 28 (Chesapeake Mar. 1, 2018). Service through the Secretary of the Commonwealth.  Service through the Secretary of the Commonwealth was properly effected, as there was due diligence conducted to locate and serve the corporations registered agent, which included seven attempts at personal service and inquiry with the State Corporation Commission on where he could be found, and this effort was sworn to the Secretary of the Commonwealth in an affidavit as required; where due diligence yielded no success in serving a party actively evading process, service of the corporation through the Secretary of the Commonwealth was proper.

By pe rsonal service on any officer, director or on the registered agent of a foreign corporation which is authorized to do business in the Commonwealth, and by personal service on any agent of a foreign corporation transacting business in the Commonwealth wit hout such authorization, wherever any such officer, director, or agents be found within the Commonwealth; 2. By substituted service on a foreign corporation in accordance with §§ 13.1-766 and 13.1-928, if such corporation is authorized to transact business or affairs within the Commonwe alth; 3.

History History. Code 1950, § 8-60; 1977, c. 617; 1991, c. 672; 2005, c. 866; 2 013, c. 113. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-301 clarifies the methods of service on foreign corporations. Generally, the proposal does not change present law; but, by consolidation and cross-re ference, it indicates in a single section the interrelationship among process provisions of Title 13.1 (§§ 13.1-111 and 13.1-274), of the Virginia Long-Arm Statute (§§ 8.01-328 ff.), for orders of publication (§§ 8.01-316 and 8.01-317), and for personal service (former § 8-60). Subsection 4 also delineates when service by publication is available on foreign corporations. Section 8.01-301 effects a substantive change in former law by allowing service in the alternative (i.e., at the option of the plaintiff under Title 13.1 or under the Long-Arm Statute) in cases where the prerequisites are met for long-arm jurisdiction over foreign corporations. This changes former § 8-81.3 whereby substituted service was available only where service could not otherwise be effected under the Co de. The result of the former statutory scheme was that where §§ 13.1-111 and 13.1-274 were applicable (i.e., to foreign corporations authorized to transact business within the State), substituted service could always be made thereunder on the clerk of the State Corporation Commission and, thus, service under § 8-81.3 on the Secretary of the Commonwealth was never available in such cases. On the other hand, where the foreign corporation to be served was not authorized to do business within the S tate, service under §§ 13.1-111 and 13.1-274 was not available, and service on such foreign corporation could be had by service on the Secretary of the Commonwealth under former § 8-81.3. The revision eliminates such unnecessary intricacies in c ases where long-arm jurisdiction applies by allowing the plaintiff to choose to effect service under either the Long-Arm Statute or Title 13.1. Another substantive change comports with the change permitting statewide service under § 8.01-292. Section 8.01-301 allows service on a corporation to be made personally anywhere within the state (1) on an officer, director, or registered agent of a foreign corporation authorized to do business in Virginia and (2) on an officer, director, or any agent of a foreign corporation which is not authorized to do busi ness within Virginia. Thus, although § 8.01-301 retains the distinction between registered and unregistered corporations, the effect of § 8.01-292 is to make all personal service under proposed § 8.01-301 sufficient so long as the officer, direc tor, registered or other agent is served within the State. Cross references. As to service by publication, see §§ 8.01-316 through 8.01-324. Editors note. Sections 13.1-111 and 13.1-274, referred to in the Revisers note, were repealed by Acts 1985, c. 522.

Persons Who May Be Served. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. A. General Consideration. B. Persons Who May Be Served. C. Doing Business. I.Decisions Under Current Law. A.General Cons ideration. Burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish jurisdiction through proper service pur suant to this section, and this is true even where the action has been removed to federal court. Consolidated Eng'g Co. v. Southern Steel Co., 88 F.R.D. 233, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14370 (E.D. Va. 1980). B.Doing Business. Contacts must be extensive if injury did not arise in forum state.  When a plaintiff in a suit against a foreign corporation is a nonresident and its claimed injury does not arise in the forum State, the contacts between the forei gn corporation and the forum must be substantial to invoke the exercise of jurisdiction over the corporation, and if the plaintiffs injury does not arise out of something done in the forum State, then other contacts between the corporation and the St ate must be fairly extensive before the burden of defending a suit there may be imposed upon it without offending traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Consolidated Eng'g Co. v. Southern Steel Co., 88 F.R.D. 233, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14370 (E.D. Va. 1980). Mere fact that a wholly owned subsidiary corporation is present or doing business in the forum State is an insufficient basis for invoking in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident parent corporation, not otherwise present or doing business in the forum since the test is not the degree of control over the subsidiary by the parent but, rather, the factual question is whether the subsidiary and the parent keep their corporate operations distinct and separate; therefore, as long as the two corporations maintain formal corporate separateness in all respects, the de facto control of one by the other does not justify piercing the corporate veil. Consolidated Eng'g Co. v. Southern Steel Co., 88 F.R.D. 233, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14370 (E.D. Va. 1980). Nonparty subpoena duces tecum.  In a case in which a website appealed a judgment of the court of appeals affirming an order of the circuit court holding the website in civil contempt for failing to comply with a nonparty subpoena duces tecum served upon it by a carpet cleaning business, the Supreme Court concluded that the circuit court was not empowered to enforce the nonparty subpoena against the website, which was headquartered in California .

Service on registered agent not required.  The fact that the person on whom service was effected is not the registered agent of a foreign corporation is not dispositive as an agents authority to accept service may be implied in fact. Davies v. Jobs &amp; Adverts Online, GmbH, 94 F. Supp. 2d 719, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6488 (E.D. Va. 2000). Se rvice on attorney insufficient.  Where the plaintiff presented no evidence to establish that the defendant, a foreign corporation, either explicitly or implicitly authorized its local counsel to accept service of process or that the attorney ever represented to anyone that he had such authority, service on the attorney was insufficient. Davies v. Jobs &amp; Adverts Online, GmbH, 94 F. Supp. 2d 719, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6488 (E.D. Va. 2000). Substituted service not defective.  Substituted service on a corporation was not defective because the language of § 8.01-329 reflected a legislative intent to serve process at a single address, not multiple addresses; the record showed that the corporation received mail at the post office box shown on the affidavit for substituted service, that the university mailed correspondence by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the corporation at that address, that both the corporations president and general manager received or signed the certification of mailing accompanying correspondence from the university, and that the corporation used both the post office box and the physical address during its contractual relationship with the university. This demonstrated that the address the university identified on the affidavit was reasonably calculated to provide notice to the corporation and was not unconstitutional. Va.

References to lessees in former § 8-64 are eliminated as no longer appropriate, since lessees should not be agents f or the service of process on lessors. Service on the receiver or trustee of the corporation is the primary means of obtaining jurisdiction, but if unavailable then process may be served by any other appropriate method. The only substantive change is the deletion of the last sentence of former § 8-64 which makes service by publication on a receiver or trustee the equivalent of personal service.

The section makes no substantive change to former § 8-59.1 but clar ifies the manner in which service may be made on a limited partnership as provided by § 50-73.7. Because the general partner controls the business, process must be served on a general rather than a limited partner unless the action is to enforce the l imited partners liability to the partnership.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . This section is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. Warner v. Maddox, 68 F. Supp. 27, 1946 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2089 (D. Va. 1946). Due process.  In considering whether this section complies with the requirements of due process, the crucial issue is the extent of the defendants contacts with the jurisdi ction. North River Ins. Co. v. Davis, 237 F. Supp. 187, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6452 (W.D. Va. 1965), aff'd, 392 F.2d 571, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 7701 (4th Cir. 1968). Virginia may provide for substituted service upon former residents of the State in actio ns arising from acts done in the State during the period of their residence. North River Ins. Co. v. Davis, 237 F. Supp. 187, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6452 (W.D. Va. 1965), aff'd, 392 F.2d 571, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 7701 (4th Cir. 1968). Section renders § 8.01-229 inap plicable.  Where, under this section and § 8.01-310, plaintiff can obtain service of process upon defendant before the expiration of the two-year limitation period prescr ibed by § 8.01-243 and secure a valid personal judgment if he is so entitled, his remedy is complete and unaffected by the absence of defendant, and § 8.01-229, the tolling statute, is not applicable. Bergman v. Turpin, 206 Va. 539, 145 S.E.2d 135, 1965 Va. LEXIS 231 (1965) (commented on in 7 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 406 (1966)). Section authorizes service on nonresident joint tort-feasor in action for contribution.  A passenger on a bus operated by plaintiff brought an action against plaintiff and also against the owner and the driver of a truck for injuries received by her a s a result of a collision between plaintiffs bus and the truck. Plaintiff effected a settlement in good faith and sued the owner, the driver, and the lessee-operator of the truck for contribution as joint tort-feasors. As nonresidents, defendants wer e served by service of process upon the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles under this section. They appeared specially and moved to quash the process as void, alleging that this section had no application. This motion was properly overruled, for this section by express terms covers a situation of this kind and authorizes such process and service thereof. McKay v. Citizens Rapid Transit Co., 190 Va. 851, 59 S.E.2d 121, 1950 Va. LEXIS 175 (1950).

Barber v. Textile Mach. Works, 178 Va. 435, 17 S.E.2d 359, 1941 Va. LEXIS 179 (1941). Relationship with Virginias poor debtor exemption statute.  Debtors powerboat did not constitute a motor vehicle for which they could claim an exemption under the poor debtors exemption of § 34-26 because, consi dering the dictionary definition as well as the way the term motor vehicle was used elsewhere in the Code of Virginia, the General Assembly did not intend the term motor vehicle as used in the exemption statute to include a powerboat, whi ch did not operate on a highway, did not have rubber tires for use on a highway, and was an entirely different creature, a vessel used for transportation on water.

The terms the statute and this section, as used below, re fer to former provisions. This section is constitutional.  This section makes reasonable provision for probable communication and is constitutional. Carroll v. Hutchinson, 172 Va. 43, 200 S.E. 644, 1939 Va. LEXIS 219 (193 9). But it is in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed. Warner v. Maddo x, 68 F. Supp. 27, 1946 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2089 (D. Va. 1946). Failure to comply prevents val id judgment.  This section definitely requires a copy of the summons or notice to be forthwith sent to the defendant or defendants; therefore, failure to comply with that certa in and definite provision of the section cannot result in any valid judgment against the defendant. Weiss v. Magnussen, 13 F. Supp. 948, 1936 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1568 (D. Va. 1936). Under the provisions of this section, failure on the part of the plaintiff to furnish the correct information to enable him to send the summons or notice to the d efendant or defendants will prevent the plaintiff from obtaining any valid judgment against the defendants. Weiss v. Magnussen, 13 F. Supp. 948, 1936 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1568 (D. Va. 1936). Section does not provide for service upon a personal representative.  See Warner v. Maddox, 68 F. Supp. 27, 1946 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2089 (D. Va. 1946). Meaning of forthwith.  It was early settled in Virginia that forthwith means with due diligence, under all the circumstances. Wooddy v. Old Dominion Ins. Co., 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 362, 1879 Va. LEXIS 10 (1879); Omohundro v. Palmer, 158 Va. 693, 164 S.E. 541, 1932 Va. LEXIS 288 (1932). There is no precise definition, so far as time is concerned, of the word forthwith. The term does not in all cases mean instanter, but it does have a rela tive meaning, and has been construed by the courts to mean within a reasonable time, or with reasonable celerity or reasonable dispatch, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Reynolds v. Dorrance, 94 F.2d 184, 1938 U. S. App. LEXIS 4383 (4th Cir. 1938). There is no accurate definition of the term forthwith and the mailing within a reasonably prompt time, where the interest of none of the parties has been affected, would seem to be a compliance with the statute. Devier v. George Cole Motor Co., 27 F. Supp. 978, 1939 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2774 (D. Va. 1939). Prompt correction of error held substantial compliance.  Where the notices were promptly mailed to the defendant at a wrong address the day after they were filed, and when the error in the defendants address was dis covered and his right address ascertained they were again promptly mailed to him by the official, and the notices were received by the defendant 21 days prior to the return day of the notices, it was held that the notices were served in a manner substant ially complying with this section. Reynolds v. Dorrance, 94 F.2d 184, 1938 U.S. App. LEXIS 4383 (4th Cir. 1938). The statute does not require delivery or receipt of the notice. It requires that it be s ent by registered mail to the defendant. The statute is not violative of the United States Constitution if it makes reasonable provision for probable communication of notice to the defendant. The court recognizes the intention of the legislature to be th at the place to which the notice is sent must be one at which receipt will probably be had by the addressee. Powell v. Knight, 74 F. Supp. 191, 1947 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2050 (D. Va. 1947). And the return receipt need not be filed as an exhibit. The request for a return receipt was never essential. Powell v. Knight, 74 F. Supp. 191, 1947 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2050 (D. Va. 1947). Purpose of return receipt.  The only purpose of the return receipt is to verify delivery to the addressee and it would seem to follow that if a return receipt is not mandatory under this sec tion, actual receipt by the addressee of a copy of summons and complaint sent by the official to the residence of the nonresident defendant is not mandatory in order to comply with this section and effect valid process. Powell v. Knight, 74 F. Supp. 191, 1947 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2050 (D. Va. 1947). Service valid despite court being advised notice returned undelivered.  Trial court had jurisdiction over defendant, who was served in accordance with the statutory requirements of former §§ 46.1-387.5 and 8-67.2, where the tria l court was advised that the statutory notice given defendant of the proceedings was returned undelivered; the trial court did have jurisdiction over defendant because service was effectuated in accordance with the applicable statute. Steed v. Commonweal th, 11 Va. App. 175, 397 S.E.2d 281, 7 Va. Law Rep. 592, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 178 (1990). Affidavit of counsel is not necessary.  It was contended that the service of the notices of motion was defective because counsel who left the notices with the Director (now Commissioner) filed no affida vit.

For the sta tutory agent appointed pursuant to §§ 8.01-308 and 8.01-309, the address for the mailing of the process as required by § 8.01-312 shall be the last known address of the nonresident or, where appropriate under subdivision B 1 or 2 of § 8.01-31 0, of the executor, administrator, or other personal representative of the nonresident. However, upon the filing of an affidavit by the plaintiff that he does not know and is unable with due diligence to ascertain any post-office address of such nonresid ent, service of process on the statutory agent shall be sufficient without the mailing otherwise required by this section. Provided further that: 1. In th e case of a nonresident defendant licensed by the Commonwealth to operate a motor vehicle, the last address reported by such defendant to the Department of Motor Vehicles as his address on an application for or renewal of driving privileges shall be deem ed to be the address of the defendant for the purpose of the mailing required by this section if no other address is known, and, in any case in which the affidavit provided for in § 8.01-316 is filed, such a defendant, by so notifying the Department o f such an address, and by failing to notify the Department of any change therein, shall be deemed to have appointed the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles his statutory agent for service of process in an action arising out of operation of a motor vehicle by him in the Commonwealth, and to have accepted as valid service such mailing to such address; or 2. In the case of a nonresident defendant not licensed by the Commonwealth to operate a motor vehicle, the address shown on the copy of the report of accident required by § 46.2-372 fi led by or for him with the Department, and on file at the office of the Department, or the address reported by such a defendant to any state or local police officer, or sheriff investigating the accident sued on, if no other address is known, shall be co nclusively presumed to be a valid address of such defendant for the purpose of the mailing provided for in this section, and his so reporting of an incorrect address, or his moving from the address so reported without making provision for forwarding to h im of mail directed thereto, shall be deemed to be a waiver of notice and a consent to and acceptance of service of process served upon the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles as provided in this section.

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the reference to § 26-59 was changed to § 64.2-1426 to conform to the recodification of Ti tle 64.1 by Acts 2012, c. 614, effective October 1, 2012. Acts 2020, cc. 1227 and 1246, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall become effective on January 1, 2021. Acts 2020, cc. 1227 and 1246, cl. 4 provides: That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment. Pursuant to § 30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities; therefore, Chapter 854 of the Acts of Assembly of 2019 requires the Vi rginia Criminal Sentencing Commission to assign a minimum fiscal impact of $50,000.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Subdivision A 2, providing for use of the nonresident defendants address as reported on the accident report or as reported by the defendant to the investigati ng officer, is strictly a secondary provision which is triggered only in the event that no other address is known. Read in its entirety, this section requires that the plaintiff utilize the last-known address of the defendant, and that failing th at, the accident report address or address reported to the investigating officer may be used. Consequently, this section requires notice of service that is reasonably probable to result in a nonresident defendant receiving actual notice and is therefore constitutional. Banks v. Leon, 975 F.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE The only significant change in former § 8-69 accomplished by § 8.01-314 is the inversion of the present provision requiring five days notice before entr y of an order directing service on the attorney of record so that service on the attorney is good without more unless the attorney objects within five days of receiving such service. The change allows the same amount of time for the attorney served to ac t, but requires service to be made only once rather than twice as under the former statute. Service would be made in accordance with Rule 1:12. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2A M.J. Attorney and Client, §§ 19, 25; 5A M.J. Costs, § 20; 6A M.J. Divorce and Alimony, § 37; 14B M.J. Process, § 19. CASE NOTES This section compared with § 8.01-319 .  Section 8.01-319 imposes different, not less, notice requirements for a pro se litigant than one represented by counsel. A pro se litigant is required to advise the clerk of court of his address and any change in it. If a litigant is not pro se, but is represented by counsel, papers may be served on an attorney authorized to practice law in this Commonwealth who has entered a general appearance f or the litigant pursuant to this section. Both of these provisions serve to ensure that notice of the proceedings may be served on the litigants. Eddine v. Eddine, 12 Va. App. 760, 406 S.E.2d 914, 8 Va. Law Rep. 10, 1991 Va.

Failure of litigant to inform clerk of change of address.  If a litigant wishes to be informed of the proceedings, he or she must either keep the court advised of where service may be accomplished or be represented by cou nsel upon whom service may be had. In a domestic relations case the husbands failure to receive notice because he moved from his residence without notifying the clerk for his new address did not deprive him of due process of law. Eddine v. Eddine, 1 2 Va. App. 760, 406 S.E.2d 914, 8 Va. Law Rep. 10, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (1991). Service held valid where subsequent proceeding was continuation of first proceeding.  In a proceeding on a motion to vacate, service of a copy of the motion on the attorney who had been defendants counsel of record in a prohibition proceeding w as not defective, since the two proceedings were continuing stages of a proceeding initiated by the defendant and counsel had never withdrawn by leave of court and notice to defendant, pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 1:5.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Default vacated where at torney had withdrawn.  Mailing of a wifes post decree motion to determine support arrearage, which was mailed to an attorney who had withdrawn as counsel for the husband months befo re the final decree was entered over 11 years before, was not valid service, and a default judgment was vacated.

The purpose of an order of publication, which is in lieu of process, is to bring the def endant into court, to apprise the defendant of the nature of the proceedings, and to notify the party that his or her rights will be affected by the litigation. Because the notice is constructive only, the order of publication and the statute authori zing it both must be strictly construed. Dennis v. Jones, 240 Va. 12, 393 S.E.2d 390, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2523, 1990 Va. LEXIS 102 (1990). The object of this section and § 8.01-317 is to protect parties by giving them notice and an opportunity to present a defense, and because service by publicati on constitutes constructive notice only, these sections must be strictly construed.

Grounds stated must be true and not idle declarations.  Even though this section provides that the party seeking service shall file an affidavit stating one or more of the required grounds, the grounds so state d must, in fact, be true and not merely idle declarations having no factual basis. Dennis v. Jones, 240 Va. 12, 393 S.E.2d 390, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2523, 1990 Va. LEXIS 102 (1990).

App. 356, 443 S.E.2d 924, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1383, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (1994). The noun diligence means devoted and painstaking application to accomplish a n undertaking. The determination whether diligence has been used is a factual question to be decided according to the circumstances of each case. Dennis v. Jones, 240 Va. 12, 393 S.E.2d 390, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2523, 1990 Va. LEXIS 102 (1990). No demonstration of devoted effort to locate defendant.  Mere informal contacts with unnamed friends at two governmental agencies, made only prior to the sheriffs effort to serve process, did not demonstrate devoted and painstaking efforts to locate defendant, especially where the evidence established without conflict that routine methods were readily available to plaintiff. Dennis v. Jones, 240 Va. 12, 393 S.E.2d 390, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2523, 1990 Va. LEXIS 102 (1990). Husband clearly did not exercise the diligence required in trying to locate wife for pur poses of service by publication where it was uncontested that husband knew of and attended the pending criminal proceedings in juvenile and domestic relations court which he initiated by complaint, that he met with wife in court, and that during this sam e period of time he filed with the circuit court a sworn affidavit stating that he had used due diligence in attempting to locate [his wife]. Although it was true that he did not know her precise address, he did know of the concurrent proceedings in the juvenile and domestic relations courts office or from the Commonwealth Attorneys office, and in addition, husbands failure to reveal to wife the pending annulment suit prevented her from receiving actual notice by allowing possible ac ceptance of service. Khanna v. Khanna, 18 Va. App. 356, 443 S.E.2d 924, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1383, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (1994). Default judgment void and should have been set aside.  Where, the attempt to serve defendant through the DMV was ineffective, and personal jurisdiction was not obtained over her, the default judgment was void and shou ld have been set aside under the provisions of Code § 8.01-428(A). Dennis v. Jones, 240 Va. 12, 393 S.E.2d 390, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2523, 1990 Va. LEXIS 102 (1990). Substituted servic e.  Because the circuit courts determinations were supported by the record, and substituted service of a show cause order was not precluded, the circuit court pro perly dismissed a husbands motion to quash service of process; the wifes evidence included a return of service indicating that the amended show cause order and sworn petition were served on the husbands mother-in-law at the address that the h usband provided in the divorce decree as his residential address of record. Koons v. Crane, 72 Va. App. 720, 853 S.E.2d 524, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (2021). Insufficient affidavit.  It is necessary under the order of publication method to file an affidavit stating that the party to be served by the order of publication is a nonresiden t individual; a statement that the individual may not be a resident of the Commonwealth is insufficient.

Compliance requires certificate filing.  Compliance with the mailing requirement of this section will not be assumed if certificate attesting to such compliance is absent. Proof that order was posted on a courthouse door and delivered to a newspaper was not proof that the order was also mailed. Instead, the absence of the required certificate plainly suggested the opposite conclusion. Therefore, in the absence of evidence that the clerks office had filed a certificate of compliance, service of process was defective. Carlton v. Paxton, 14 Va. App. 105, 415 S.E.2d 600, 8 Va.

Section st rictly construed.  The statutes, § 8.01-316 and this section, authorizing an order of publication as a substitute service of process must be strictly construed and applied. Rober tson v. Stone, 199 Va. 41, 97 S.E.2d 739, 1957 Va. LEXIS 159 (1957). This section does not require the place of appearance to be stated. If the caption of th e order shows the style of the suit and the court in which it is pending, this gives the parties sufficient notice where they must appear, and the words in the clerks office of this court are mere surplusage and may be disregarded. Blalock v. Riddick, 186 Va. 284, 42 S.E.2d 292, 1947 Va. LEXIS 151 (1947). But the names of parties must be stated.  An order of publication to commence a suit against parties not previously served with process must state their names. Martin v. South Salem Land Co., 94 Va. 28, 2 6 S.E. 591, 1896 Va. LEXIS 141 (1896). And stated correctly.  A defendant whose name is Steinman is not properly proceeded against by publication where the name is spelled Stainmau in the caption of the order which is the notice, and Stinman in the part of the publication which is regarded as the warning, although the initials of his Christian name are correctly given in each place. Steinman v. Jessee, 108 Va. 567, 62 S.E. 275, 1908 Va. LEXIS 69 (190 8). Absolute accuracy in identifying party is not required.  Although the person or persons to whom the notice is directed must be identified with reasonable certainty absolute accuracy is not required. Robertson v. Stone, 199 Va. 41, 97 S.E.2d 739, 1957 Va. LEXIS 159 (1957). A nonresident party to a partition suit was named in the order of publication as Alma E. Robinson whereas her correct name was Alma E. Robertson. The record showe d that she took her interest in the land under her fathers will which named her Robinson, that she had signed deeds to other lands under this name, and that while the order of publication mailed by the clerk to her correct address was returned marked unclaimed, she was sent and signed for notice of the hearing before the commissioner. In the light of this evidence the order of publication was a sufficient compliance with the statutes to give the court jurisdiction and its decree ordering the sale was not void. Robertson v.

Notice of subsequent proceedings.  Where an order of publication has been duly executed against nonresident or unknown defendants, no other notice is required to be given them in any proceeding in court, or before a commissioner, or for the purpose of taking depositions, unless specially ordered by the court. But if they so appear, then they are entitled to notice in all the subsequent proceedings in the suit. Burwell v. Burwell, 78 Va. 574, 1884 Va. LEXIS 31 (1884). It is entirely competent for the legislature to dispense with more than one publication, and to provide that one publication shall be notice of all proceedings in the cause subsequent to the completion of the order, and the legislature of this State has so provided by this section. Jeffries v. Jeffries, 123 Va. 147, 96 S.E. 197, 1918 Va. LEXIS 12 (1918). Notice of certification of record not required.  If the original order of publication is found to have been in proper form, it dispenses with the necessity of giving nonresident beneficiaries notice of the appli cation for a certification of the record. Such certification is a proceeding in court within the meaning of this section. Blalock v. Riddick, 186 Va. 284, 42 S.E.2d 292, 1947 Va. LEXIS 151 (1947). Noti ce of taking of depositions.  Under this section, the case may be tried or heard as to the nonresident, but the section does not authorize the taking of the bill for confessed at any t ime nor the doing of any act before the completion of the order. Depositions taken before that time without other notice than that furnished by the order are not taken pursuant to the statute, and cannot be given in evidence against a nonresident who has not appeared in the case, nor assented thereto.

In any case in which a nonresident party or party originally served by publication has been served as provided by law, and notice of further proceedings in the case is required but no method of service thereof is prescribed either by statute or by order or rule of court, such notice may be served by publication thereof once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper published or circulated in the city or county in which the original proceedings are pending. If the original proceedings were instituted by ord er of publication, then the publication of such notice of additional or further proceedings shall be made in the same newspaper. A party, who appears pro se in an action, shall file with the clerk of the court in which the action is pending a written sta tement of his place of residence and mailing address, and shall inform the clerk in writing of any changes of residence and mailing address during the pendency of the action. The clerk and all parties to the action may rely on the last written statement filed as aforesaid. The court in which the action is pending may dispense with such notice for failure of the party to file the statement herein provided for or may require notice to be given in such manner as the court may determine. B. Notwithstan ding any provision to the contrary in paragraph A hereof, depositions may be taken, testimony heard and orders and decrees entered without an order of publication, when the defendant has been legally served with or has accepted service of process to comm ence a suit for divorce or for annulling or affirming a marriage, and he or she or the plaintiff: 1. Shall thereafter become a nonresident; or 2. Shall remove from the county or city in which the suit is pending, if a resident thereof, or in which he or she resided at the time of the institution of the suit, or was served with p rocess, without having filed with the clerk of the court where the suit is pending a written statement of his or her intended future place of residence, and a like statement of subsequent changes of residence; or 3. When after such written statement has been filed with the clerk, notice shall have been served upon him or her at the last place of residence given in the written statement as provided by law; or 4. Could not be found by the sheriff of the county or city for the service of the notice, and the party sending the service makes affidavit that he has used due diligence to find the adve rse party without success. If such absent party has an attorney of record in such suit, notice shall be served on such attorney, as provided by § 8.01-314. C. This sectio n shall not apply to orders of publication in condemnation actions. History History.

CASE NOTES This section compared with § 8.01-314 .  This section imposes different, not less, notice requirements for a pro se litigant than one represented by counsel. A pro se litigant is required to adv ise the clerk of court of his address and any change in it. If a litigant is not pro se, but is represented by counsel, papers may be served on an attorney authorized to practice law in this Commonwealth who has entered a general appearance for t he litigant pursuant to § 8.01-314. Both of these provisions serve to ensure that notice of the proceedings may be served on the litigants. Eddine v. Eddine, 12 Va. App. 760, 406 S.E.2d 914, 8 Va. Law Rep. 10, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (1991). Filing of a responsive pleading which contains the pro se partys address is sufficie nt to satisfy the requirements of subsection A; once this pleading has been filed, if the defendant does not remove from the county, city or state in which the suit is pending, depositions can be taken, oral testimony heard, and orders and decrees entere d without publication so long as notice has been served as provided by law.

Subsection B inapplicable where service by mail of notice was not proper service.  Since service by mail of the notice of the commissioners hearing was not proper service pursuant to § 20-99, subsection B was not applicable to the case. S oliman v. Soliman, 12 Va. App. 234, 402 S.E.2d 922, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2083, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 58 (1991). Failure to inform clerk of c hange of address.  If a litigant wishes to be informed of the proceedings, he or she must either keep the court advised of where service may be accomplished or be represented by cou nsel upon whom service may be had. In a domestic relations case, the husbands failure to receive notice because he moved from his residence without notifying the clerk for his new address did not deprive him of due process of law. Eddine v. Eddine, 12 Va. App. 760, 406 S.E.2d 914, 8 Va. Law Rep. 10, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (1991). In a divorce case, where wife failed to provide a written statement of her address to the clerk of the trial court after her attorney withdrew from the case, and husband mailed the notice and a copy of the decree to the marital residence where wife was served with the bill of complaint, wifes own failure to notify the court and husband of her proper mailing address resulted in her not receiving notice of entr y of the final decree. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not err in entering the final decree in wifes absence. Schlieper v. Schlieper, No. 2219-94-4 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 17, 1995). Applies to corporations.  An unrepresented litigant who wishes to be informed of the proceedings must either keep the court advised of where service may be accomplished or retain counsel u pon whom service may be had. We see no reason why this rule should not apply to corporations as well as natural persons. Fredericksburg Constr. Co. v. J.W. Wyne Excavating, Inc., 260 Va. 137, 530 S.E.2d 148, 2000 Va.

Subject to § 8.01-286.1, service of a process on a nonresident person outside the Commonwealth may be made by: (i) any person authorized to serve process in the jurisdiction where the party to be served is located; or (ii) any person 18 years of age or older who is not a party or otherwise interested in the subject matter of the controversy and notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, such person need not be authorized by the circuit court to serve process which commences divorce or annulment actions. When the court can exercise jurisdiction over the nonresident pursuant to § 8.01-328.1, such service shall have the same effect as personal service on the nonresident within Virginia. Such service when no jurisdiction can be exercised pursua nt to § 8.01-328.1, or service in accordance with the provisions of subdivision 2 a of § 8.01-296 shall have the same effect, and no other, as an order of publication duly executed, or the publication of a copy of process under this chapter, as the case may be; however, depositions may be taken at any time after 21 days notice of the taking of the depositions has been personally served. The person so served shall be in default upon his failure to file a pleading in response to original process within 21 days after such service. If no responsive pleading is filed within the time allowed by law, the case may proceed without service of any additional pleadings, including the notice of the taking of depositions. B. Any persona l service of process outside of this Commonwealth executed in such manner as is provided for in this section prior or subsequent to October 1, 1977, in a divorce or annulment action is hereby validated. Personal service of process outside this Commonweal th in a divorce or annulment action may be executed as provided in this section. History History.

Effect of subsection A on manner of service and jurisdiction.  While subsection A limits the effect of service of process on a nonresident outside of Virginia, this section does not pertain to the manner of service or elimina te jurisdiction once conferred. Frederick v. Koziol, 727 F. Supp. 1019, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 241 (E.D. Va. 1990). Limitations of subsection A do not apply to § 8.01-329 A.  As an order of publication confers only in rem jurisdiction, application of subsection A of this section to subsection A of § 8.01-329 would destroy the person al jurisdiction conferred by the long-arm statute in § 8.01-328.1; moreover, application of subsection A of this section to subsection A of § 8.01-329 would mean that service on the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who need only mail a copy to the p erson to be served at his last known address, would sustain personal jurisdiction, whereas personal service or substituted service designed to provide actual notice would support only in rem jurisdiction; therefore, the limitations of subsection A of thi s section do not apply to service of process pursuant to subsection A of § 8.01-329.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Personal service is equivalent to order of publication.  The acknowledgment by nonresidents of legal service within the District of Columbia must be treated as equivalent to an order of publication duly posted and publi shed, and does not give the court jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants so as to entitle it to render personal decrees against them. Smith &amp; Winnsatt v. Chilton, 77 Va. 535, 1883 Va. LEXIS 87 (1883). It is obvious that the personal service of the notice under this section makes such notice not only equivalent to an order of publication duly executed, but gives to the receiver of the notice the advantage and benefit of actual knowledge which he might not otherwise receive.

A person proceeded against by order of publication is a party not served with process wi thin the meaning of the Code of Virginia. Thus, where service by publication is the method by which personal jurisdiction is sought to be obtained in a divorce proceeding, a jurisdictional question inevitably arises. Hayes v. Hayes, 3 Va.

Defendant who has been served not entitled to two-year period.  The General Assembly has provided that a nonresident defendant who has formal notice of a judgment shall have less time than the usual two-year period to petition for a rehearing. Implicit in this provision is concern that a defendant may not be aware of an adverse judgment or decree until he receives formal notice of it. If a defendant has received personal service at the commencement of the litigation, however, and fails to protect his interests, he accepts the risk of an unfavorable result. Therefore, such a defendant is beyond the intendment of the statute. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 227 Va. 31, 314 S.E.2d 45, 1984 Va. LEXIS 264 (1984). Section is intended to protect a party who has no knowledge at all of litigation affecting him. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 227 Va. 31, 314 S.E.2d 45, 1984 Va. LEXIS 264 (1984); Stephens v. Stephens, 229 Va. 610, 331 S.E.2d 484, 1985 Va. LEXIS 239 (1985). Su pport proceeding not barred.  When the only service upon wife was by publication, and she neither appeared in person nor by counsel, and the court entered a decree dissolving the bonds of matr imony by reason of the separation of the parties for more than two consecutive years immediately preceding the institution of the suit for divorce by husband, this section did not bar wifes statutory right to an award of support against husband when her request was made more than two years after the final decree of divorce was entered. Hayes v. Hayes, 3 Va. App. 499, 351 S.E.2d 590, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1493, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 388 (1986). Jurisdiction over equitable distribution application.  The two-year period provided in this section did not vest jurisdiction in the circuit court to reconsider wifes application for equitable distribution. Toomey v. Toomey, 251 Va. 168, 465 S.E.2d 838, 1996 Va. LEXIS 3 (1996). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Section applies alike in equity and at law.  This section is a general statute applicable alike to suits in equity and actions at law. Robertson v. Stone, 199 Va. 41, 97 S.E.2d 739, 1957 Va. LEXIS 159 (1957) . Section is limited by, and must be construed together with, § 8.01-113, which provide s that the title of purchasers at judicial sales shall not be disturbed after 12 months from the date of the decree or order confirming the sale, but there may be restitution of the proceeds to those entitled. Robertson v. Stone, 199 Va. 41, 97 S .E.2d 739, 1957 Va. LEXIS 159 (1957). This section is not applicable where the defendant was fully cognizant of the proceedings and made several special appearances prior to his general appearance, participated in the proceedings, testified as a witness, and was granted exhaustive hearings. Lawrence v. Lawrence, 212 Va. 44, 181 S.E.2d 640, 1971 Va. LEXIS 291 (1971). A party who has been proceeded against by order of publication as required is a party who was not served with process within the meaning of this statute. Robertson v. Stone, 199 Va. 41, 97 S.E.2d 739, 1957 Va. LEXIS 159 (1957). This section provides that any defendant who was not served with process and who did not appear in a suit may petition for a rehearing within the relevant times prescribed therein. A party proceeded against by an order of publication has not been served with process within the meaning of this section. The petitioners, who were so proceeded against and had not appeared in a suit devisavit vel non u nder § 64.1-88 [now see § 64.2-448], were therefore entitled under this section to petition the court for a rehearing. Thomas v. Best, 209 Va. 103, 161 S.E.2d 803, 1968 Va. LEXIS 202 (1968). Effe ct of acknowledged service.  A defendant in a chancery suit who has acknowledged service of the summons to commence the suit is bound by the decrees and orders entered therein which relate to matters put in issue by the bill, but is not bound by a decree against him founded upon a petition filed in the cause, of which he had no notice, and may, under this section, file a petition in the cause, within the time prescribed therein to have the c ase made by such petition reheard. Keys Planing Mill Co. v. Kirkbridge, 114 Va. 58, 75 S.E. 778, 1912 Va. LEXIS 112 (1912). Misrepresentation, fraud, or deceit need not be alleged.  This section, which permits a direct attack, does not require a petitioner to allege or prove misrepresentation, fraud, or deceit as a condition to his right to a rehearing. Thomas v. Best, 209 Va. 103, 161 S.E.2d 803, 1968 Va. LEXIS 202 (1968). No statute authorizes a court to grant an indefinite time within which to move to reinstate a suit in which a final decree has been rendered, and which has been stricken from the docket, without notice. Hence a decree for divorce a vinculo which gives leave to either party to move the court to reinstate the suit without notice is erroneo us. Shelton v. Shelton, 125 Va. 381, 99 S.E. 557, 1919 Va. LEXIS 30 (1919). Thus, after the prescribed time has expired a bill of review comes too late. Johnson v. M errit, 125 Va. 162, 99 S.E. 785, 1919 Va. LEXIS 16 (1919). And leave to file a petition for rehearing does not stop the running of the statute fixi ng the time within which the petition must actually be filed. Woodson v. Leyburn, 83 Va. 843, 3 S.E. 873, 1887 Va. LEXIS 130 (1887). But void decree may be attacked after prescribed time.  Failure to file a petition within two years from date of decree is not fatal to that part of a divorce decree which was void, and it could be attacked at any time and in any court in which it was brought into question. Watson v. Mose, 165 Va. 661, 183 S.E. 428, 1936 Va. LEXIS 251 (1936). Rehearing in partition suit.  One who files a petition under this section for rehearing in a partition suit is entitled to have corrected the injustice created by sale of the property at less than its true value; however, the amount due petitioner is determined by taking the value of the land at the time of the sale rather than at the time of the rehearing. Robertson v. Stone, 199 Va. 41, 97 S.E.2d 739, 1957 Va. LEXIS 159 (1957). Right to rehearing in divorce suit.  A defendant in a divorce suit who was proceeded against as a nonresident by order of publication, as provided in this section, was not served with process within the meaning of that term as used in this section, and as she did not appear and was not served with a copy of the decree, she was entitled to a rehearing. Sims v. Sims, 140 Va. 435, 126 S.E. 486, 1924 Va. LEXIS 184 (1924). Unjust c ompromise agreement.  This section permits a court upon a rehearing to correct any injustice in the proceedings. An injustice was done to the petitioners and to other heirs and distributees who were not parties to a compromise agreement in a suit under § 64.1-88 [now see § 64.2-448]. By the compromise agreement the parties sought to settle a suit to impeach the decedents will, which suit, if successful, would have re sulted in benefits for all the decedents heirs and distributees. But the compromise agreement provided that certain heirs and distributees, parties to the agreement, should receive shares of the decedents estate and tha...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-323"><akn:num>§ 8.01-323</akn:num><akn:heading>In what counties city newspapers deemed published for purpose of legal advertisements</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Any newspaper published in a city adjoining or wholly or partly within the geographical limits of any county shall be deemed to be published in such county or counties as well as in such city, for the purpose of legal advertisements.

As used in this section and throughout the Code, the terms newspaper of record and newspaper of general circulation are interchangeable and identical in meaning. B. Whenever an y ordinance, resolution, notice, or advertisement is required by law, regulation, or judicial order to be published in a newspaper, newspaper of record, or newspaper of general circulation, such newspaper, newspaper of record, or newspaper of general cir culation, in addition to any qualifications otherwise required by law, shall: 1. Have a bona fide list of paying subscribers; 2. Have been published and circulated in printed form at least once a week for at least 50 of the preceding 52 weeks; 3. Provide general news coverage of the area in which the notice is required to be published; 4. Be printed in the English language; and 5. Have a periodicals mailing permit issued by the United States Postal Service (USPS). If the newspaper has such a mailing permit, it must publish the USPS Statement of Ownership (Form 3 526) in such newspaper at least once per calendar year and maintain a copy of such form that is available for public inspection during regular business hours. C. However, a newspaper that does not have a periodicals mailing permit issued by the USPS pursuant to subdivision B 5 may petition the circuit court for the jurisdiction in which ordinances, resolutions, notices, or advertisements are required to be published to be c ertified as a newspaper of record for that jurisdiction. Prior to filing the petition, the newspaper shall publish a notice of intention to file a petition pursuant to this subsection in another newspaper of record in the jurisdiction in which the petiti on will be filed. If no such newspaper exists, such notice of intent may be published in a newspaper in a neighboring jurisdiction. The court shall grant the authority for a period of one year upon finding that the newspaper (i) meets the requirements of subdivisions B 2, 3, and 4; (ii) employs a local news staff, reports local current events and governmental meetings, has an editorial page, accepts letters to the editor, and is, in general, a news forum for the jurisdiction in which authority is sought ; and (iii) has an audit of printed circulation for a time period ending no more than 24 months prior to the filing of such petition certified by an independent auditing firm or a business recognized in the newspaper industry as a circulation auditor. Su ch audit shall provide a breakdown of such newspapers circulation by zip code or jurisdiction. The authority shall be continued for successive one-year periods upon the filing of a copy of such newspapers most recent audit of circulation, complet ed within the prior 24 months, and an affidavit certifying that the newspaper continues to meet the requirements of this subsection. D. If a county with a population of less than 15,000 had regularly advertised its ordinances, resolutions, and notices in a newspaper published in the county that had a general circulation in the county, a bona fide list of paying subscribers, and a periodicals permit , and the newspaper continued to be published in the county and continued to have a general circulation in the county but failed to maintain its bona fide list of paying subscribers and its periodicals permit, any advertisement of ordinances, resolutions , or notices in the newspaper by the county shall be deemed to have been in compliance with this section. E. If a locali ty determines that no newspaper meets the requirements of subsection B or C with regard to its jurisdiction, such locality may petition the circuit court for its jurisdiction for authority to have such ordinances, resolutions, notices, or advertisements published in another printed medium. Such petition shall not be filed without a majority vote of approval by such localitys local governing body. The court shall grant such authority for good cause shown. Such authority shall be granted for one year and may be continued for successive one-year periods for good cause shown. F. Any newspap er authorized by this section to publish ordinances, resolutions, notices, or advertisements shall (i) print such ordinances, resolutions, notices, or advertisements together under an identifying heading and such heading shall be in boldface letters no s maller than 24-point type and (ii) maintain at least three years worth of print archives of such newspaper containing any such ordinance, resolution, notice, or advertisement and make such archives available to the public for inspection upon request. G. In all case s in which an ordinance, resolution, notice, or advertisement is required to be published in a newspaper of general circulation, the newspaper shall (i) post the complete notice on the newspapers website, if a website is published by such newspaper, where it shall be posted contemporaneously with the notices first print publication and shall remain on the website for at least as long as the notice appears in such newspaper; (ii) include on its website homepage a link to its public notice section ; and (iii) post the complete notice on a searchable, statewide repository website, established and maintained as a joint venture of the majority of Virginia newspapers as a repository for such notices, where it shall remain on such repository website fo r at least as long as it appears in the newspaper. Any notice published on a website pursuant to this section shall be accessible to the public at no charge. H. An error in a notice placed on a newspaper website or statewide website, or temporary website outages or service interruptions prohibiting the posting or display of such notice, shall be considered harmless error, and proper legal notice requirements shall be consi dered met if the notice published in the newspaper otherwise complies with the requirements for publication.

For related discussion, see 13B M.J. Newspapers, § 3; 14A M.J. Notice, § 4. CASE NOTES Jurisdiction.  Judgment was reversed and the order was vacated because subsection A of § 8.01-324 lacked any grant of subject matter jurisdiction to the circuit courts. As su ch, the circuit court had no subject matter jurisdiction to enter the order in question here and the order was, therefore, null and void. Virginian-Pilot Media Cos., LLC v. Dow Jones &amp; Co., 280 Va. 464, 698 S.E.2d 900, 2010 Va. LEXIS 235 (2010), limited, Watson v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 347, 827 S.E.2d 782, 2019 Va. LEXIS 50 (2019). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS List of subscribers.  Newspaper that served the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C., was denied authority to publish legal notices for the County of Fairfax, Virginia, because the pu blishing company had not provided the court with a bona fide list of paying subscribers as required by § 8.01-324. Under an intermediate scrutiny analysis, the requirement, as applied, did not impinge upon the companys First Amendment rights and a ssisted the Commonwealth in a legitimate state interest in assuring that such notices are seen by a broad audience. Wash. Newspaper Publ'g Co., 72 Va. Cir. 186, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 201 (Fairfax County Oct. 24, 2006). Second class mailing certificate.  Publications with a second-class mailing certificate are not required to obtain court approval before publishing legal notices. In re Landmark Communications, Inc . v. Commonwealth, 264 Va. 568, 570 S.E.2d 836, 2002 Va. LEXIS 159 (2002). Requirements.  Where a newspaper had a bona fide list of paying subscribers, that was, more than a de minimis number, had been published and circulated at least once a week for 24 consecutive weeks without interruption for dissemination of news of a general or legal character, had a general circulation in the area in which the notice was required to be published, given the diversity of the news published and of the interests of its subscribers and the breadth of the area in which the newspaper was circulated and distributed, was printed in the English language, and had a second-class mailing permit issued by the United States Postal Service, it met the requirements of § 8.0 1-324. Little Piney Run Estates, L.L.C. v. Loudoun County Bd. of Supervisors, 74 Va. Cir. 400, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 294 (Loudoun County Nov. 30, 2007). Circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant a corporation authority to publish legal notices within a city in its newspaper under subsection A of § 8.01-324 because the newspaper lacked the breadth of circulation in the city enjoyed by another newspaper, but, depending upon the facts of a case, due process requirements for notice by publication could be met by publishing in either or neither of the two newspapers; publication of notices in newspapers meeting the requirements of § 8.01-324 may not survive a due process scrutiny. In re Dow Jones &amp; Co., 79 Va. Cir. 514, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 246 (Norfolk Nov. 17, 2009). Jurisdiction t o consider whether requirements met.  Circuit court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether a petitioning newspaper meets the requirements of subsection A of § 8.01-324 because such jurisdiction is not granted by the Virginia Constitution or Code and would be redundant and contrary to the intent of the General Assembly; neither the Virginia Constitution nor any statute granted the circuit court jurisdiction to decide fitness under s ubsection A o...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-325"><akn:num>§ 8.01-325</akn:num><akn:heading>Return by person serving process</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Unless othe rwise directed by the court, the person serving process shall make return thereof to the clerks office within seventy-two hours of service, except when such return would be due on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. In such case, the return is due on the next day following such Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. The process shall state thereon the date and manner of service and the name of the party served. B. Proof of se rvice shall be in the following manner: 1. If se rvice by sheriff, the form of the return of such sheriff as provided by the Rules of the Supreme Court; or 2. If service by any other person qualified under § 8.01-293, whether service made in or out of the Commonwealth, his affidavit of such qualifications; the date and manner of service a nd the name of the party served; and stamped, typed, or printed on the return of process, an annotation that the service was by a private server, and the name, address, and telephone number of the server; or 3. In case of service by publication, the affidavit of the publisher or his agent giving the dates of publication and an accompanying copy of the published order. C. The clerk s office shall accept a photocopy, facsimile, or other copy of the original proof of service as if it were an original, provided that the proponent provides a statement that any such copy is a true copy of the original. History History. Code 1950, §§ 8-52, 8-329; 1977, c. 617; 1996, c. 538; 2020 , c. 158. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-325 consolidates in a single section former §§ 8-52 and 8-329 regarding the method of return of service. Though the language of subsections 1 a nd 2 is more concise than that of former § 8-52, no change in substance is intended. The reference in subsection 1 to the Rules of Court relates to Rules 2:5 and 3:4. Subsection 3 in requiring an affidavit by the publisher or his agent, alters former § 8-329 which, though designating certain publication officials, provides that affidavit of any other person is also sufficient to evidence service by publication. See also additional service requirements under §§ 8.01-296 and 8.01-427.1 regarding default judgments and decrees. Editors note.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Invalid service of process.  Where nothing in the record established that process server was qualified to serve process under Virginias procedural requirements, service of process was inv alid, and the court did not acquire personal jurisdiction over defendant. Harrel v. Preston, 15 Va. App. 202, 421 S.E.2d 676, 9 Va. Law Rep. 388, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 247 (1992). Statements in service return of protective order not testimonial.  Trial court did not err in admitting into evidence a deputy sheriffs statements in the return portion of a preliminary protective order because defendant had no right to confront the deputy who made them when the statements were not testimonial; the statements were primarily created to comply with statutory provisions that governed the service of the protective order and, therefore, enable the entity to admin ister its affairs, a non-prosecutorial purpose. Logan v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. App. 568, 838 S.E.2d 548, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 53, aff'd, 72 Va. App. 309, 845 S.E.2d 228, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 214 (2020). Statements contained in service returns on protective orders are not testimonial; the primary purpose of the return of service is to show that it has been served on the subject of that protective order and is, therefore, in effect. Logan v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. App. 568, 838 S.E.2d 548, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 53, aff'd, 72 Va. App. 309, 845 S.E.2d 228, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 214 (2020). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. What const itutes the return.  A return on a writ or process is the short official statement of the officer indorsed thereon of what he has done in obedience to the mandate of the writ, or why he has done nothing. The signature of the officer thereto is no part of the return, but is merely intended to authenticate it. Slingluff v. Collins, 109 Va. 717, 64 S.E. 1055, 1909 Va. LEXIS 87 (1909). Effect of return executed in person.  A return executed in person, signed by the deputy sheriff with his own name and that of his principal shows that the summons was actually served on the de fendants. Barksdale v. Neal, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 314, 1862 Va. LEXIS 3 (1862). Retu rn must show time of service.  Upon a return not found, and copy left, etc., without showing when the copy was left, it did not appear that the summons was duly served. Wynn v. Wyatt, 3 8 Va. (11 Leigh) 584, 1841 Va. LEXIS 11 (1841). Courts will look to dates on return when necessary.  Process to commence a suit is part of the record for the purposes of amendment, and the court will look to the return thereon, when necessary, not only to show th e date of the return, but also the date of the execution of the writ. House v. Universal Crusher Corp., 115 Va. 558, 79 S.E. 1049, 1913 Va. LEXIS 70 (1913). Pres umption as to time of return.  In the absence of a date, or other evidence showing when the return of an officer on a writ was made, it is presumed to have been made at a time when he had the r ight to make it, and in due time, as the prima facie presumption is that the officer has done his duty. Rowe v. Hardy, 97 Va. 674, 34 S.E. 625, 1899 Va. LEXIS 84 (1899). The court may allow the sheriff to amend his return so as to show a proper service. Stot z v. Collins &amp; Co., 83 Va. 423, 2 S.E. 737, 1887 Va. LEXIS 87 (1887). When oath required.  The simple statement of an officer as to the manner of service is sufficient, while the statement of another person must be upon oath. This difference under early statutes did not exist, but the statement was required to be on oath, whether made by an officer or another person. Barksdale v. Neal, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 314, 1862 Va. LEXIS 3 (1862). Service by any person is valid if return is verified by affidavit.  This section authorizes service by any person if the return be verified by affidavit. So a plea alleging that the person making the service was the paid agent of the plaintiff, employed to compromise with divers claimants of the land sued for and to aid the plaintiff in recovering the land, etc., is insufficient. King v. Davis, 137 F. 198, 1903 U.S. App. LEXIS 5453 (C.C.D. Va. 1903). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction with other law.  Virginia Sup. Ct. R. 2:4 and 2:5 [see now Rules 3:5 and 3:6] necessarily imply that a return of service filed outside the 72-hour time limit, set forth in both § 8.01-325 and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2:4 [now Rule 3:5], will not invalidate either the service or a decree entered based on the in personam jurisdiction resulting from that service; such a return constitutes prime facie evidence that the party was served i n accordance with the return. Small v. Small, 58 Va. Cir. 114, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 361 (Fairfax County Dec. 21, 2001). Failure to file return.  Where an insurer was properly served, but the court clerk failed to file the return within 72 hours, as required by § 8.01-325, and the insurer thereafter fail ed to timely respond to proper notice as required by Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 1:1, the insurer did not direct the court to any law that would either require or grant discretion to modify the default judgment; in any event, § 8.01-288 cured any possible defec t in the process return. Remley v. Griffin, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 125 (Portsmouth June 28, 2004), aff'd, 270 Va. 209, 618 S.E.2d 316, 2005 Va.

History History. 1977, c. 627. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-326 alters former case law by abolishing the anachronistic verity rule and providing that a return by any qualified person shall constitute evidence of service and that a sheriffs return shall constitute prima facie evidence of service. The section overrules the line of cases represented by Caskie v. Durham, 152 Va. 345, 147 S.E. 218 (1929). Law Review. For survey of Virginia law on practice and pleading for the year 1976-77, see 63 Va. L. Rev. 1459 (1977). CASE NOTES Service established.  In a case in which two protective orders were issued by the trial court finding that the mother committed an act of family abuse and ordered her not to commit any future acts of family abuse against her children, the circuit court did not err in denying the mothers motion to dismiss because introduction of the returns of service into evidence satisfied the fathers burden of production; and the trial court made a finding that the mother was served, implicitly determining that the returns of service were more credible than the mothers bare claim that she did not receive service. Walker v. Pierce, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 297 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 8, 2020). Substituted service.  Because the circuit courts determinations were supported by the record, and substituted service of a show cause order was not precluded, the circuit court pro perly dismissed a husbands motion to quash service of process; the wifes evidence included a return of service indicating that the amended show cause order and sworn petition were served on the husbands mother-in-law at the address that the h usband provided in the divorce decree as his residential address of record. Koons v. Crane, 72 Va. App. 720, 853 S.E.2d 524, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (2021). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction with other law.  Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2:4 and 2:5 [see now Rules 3:5 and 3:6] necessarily imply that a return of service filed outside the 72-hour time limit, set forth in both § 8. 01-325 and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2:4 [now Rule 3:5], will not invalidate either the service or a decree entered based on the in personam jurisdiction resulting from that service; such a return constitutes prime facie evidence that the party was served in accor dance with the return. Small v. Small, 58 Va. Cir. 114, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 361 (Fairfax County Dec. 21, 2001). Evidentiary hearing required.  Because a return of service contained factual statements that arguably contradicted one another, an evidentiary hearing was needed to decide whether process actua lly reached a defendant within the prescribed time; the court had to determine whether § 8.01-326 could cure any defect in the manner in which process was served. Corbin v. Frazier, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Madison County Jan. 30, 2006). Service established.  Notice of a zoning violation by a town zoning administrator was properly served on a property owner pursuant to subsection A of § 15.2-2311 and § 8.01-326, as the notice of violation bore a sheriffs stamp that showed that a deputy sheriff had posted the notice on a set date; the owner was unable to rebut the presumption of service that was established by the sheriffs stamp that showed the return of service of the notice. McLane v. Martinez, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 207 (Fairfax County Dec. 27, 2010). § 8.01-326.1. Service of process or notice on statutory agent; copy to be sent to defendant and certificate filed with court; effective date of service. Text Any statutory agent who has been served with process or notice shall forthwith mail a copy of such process or notice to the person or persons to be served at the last k nown post office address of such person and file a certificate of compliance with the papers in the action. Service of process or notice on a statutory agent shall be effective as of the date the certificate of compliance is filed with the clerk of the court in which the action or suit is pending.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Last known address.  Plaintiff is not required to find the single best address, but only the one last known; therefore, in a medical malpractice case, an argument that the requirement to send service to the last known post office address meant that service had to be sent to a home address was rejected.

Therefore, immun ity from arrest and service of process is available to a party only if permitted under the common law. Lester v. Bennett, 1 Va. App. 47, 333 S.E.2d 366, 1985 Va.

Person appearing for custody proceeding not immune from process in su pport action.  The relationship which exists between a suit to enforce support payments and a proceeding to change custody of a minor child is such that to grant immunity to the party who is in Virginia seeking to obtain custody of the minor child from arrest and service of process in connection with an action brought by his former wife to collect delinquent child support payments would obstruct the due administration of justic e.

When the ex ercise of personal jurisdiction is authorized by this chapter, service of process or notice may be made in the same manner as is provided for in Chapter 8 (§ 8.01-285 et seq.) in any other case in which personal jurisdiction is exercised over such a p arty, or process or notice may be served on any agent of such person in the county or city in the Commonwealth in which that agent resides or on the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia, hereinafter referred to in this section as the Secretary,  who, for this purpose, shall be deemed to be the statutory agent of such person. B. When servic e is to be made on the Secretary, the party or his agent or attorney seeking service shall file an affidavit with the court, stating either (i) that the person to be served is a nonresident or (ii) that, after exercising due diligence, the party seeking service has been unable to locate the person to be served. In either case, such affidavit shall set forth the last known address of the person to be served. For the mailing, by the clerk to the party or his agent or attorney, in accordance with subsectio n C, of verification of the effective date of service of process, the person filing an affidavit may leave a self-addressed, stamped envelope with the clerk.When the person to be served is a resident, the signature of an attorney, party or agent of the p erson seeking service on such affidavit shall constitute a certificate by him that process has been delivered to the sheriff or to a disinterested person as permitted by § 8.01-293 for execution and, if the sheriff or disinterested person was unable t o execute such service, that the person seeking service has made a bona fide attempt to determine the actual place of abode or location of the person to be served. C. Service of such process or notice on the Secretary shall be made by the plaintiffs, his agents or the sheriffs leaving a copy of the process or notice, together with a copy of the affidavit called for in subsection B and the fee prescribed in § 2.2-4 09 in the office of the Secretary in the City of Richmond, Virginia. Service of process or notice on the Secretary may be made by mail if such service otherwise meets the requirements of this section. Such service shall be sufficient upon the person to b e served and shall be effective on the date when service is made on the Secretary. It shall be the duty of the Secretary to: 1. Provi de a receipt to a party seeking service who serves process on the Secretary by hand delivery or any other method that does not provide a return of service or other means showing the date on which service on the Secretary was accomplished. The party seeki ng service shall be responsible for filing such receipt in the office of the clerk of the court in which the action is pending; 2. Forthwith send by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person or persons to be served at the last known post-office address of such person notice of such service, a copy of the process or notice, and a copy of the affidavit; and 3. Forthwith file with the papers in the action a certificate of compliance herewith by the Secretary or someone designated by him for that purpose and having knowledge of such compliance .Upon receipt of the certificate of compliance, the clerk of the court shall mail verification of the date the certificate of compliance was filed with the court to the person who filed the affidavit required by subsection B, in the self-addressed, stamp ed envelope, if any, provided to the clerk at the time of filing of the affidavit. The clerk shall not be required to mail verification unless the self-addressed, stamped envelope has been provided.

D. Service of process in actions brought on a warrant or motion for judgment pursuant to § 16.1-79 or 16.1-81 shall be void and of no effect when such service of process is received by the Secretary within ten days of any return day set by the warrant. In such case s, the Secretary shall return the process or notice, the copy of the affidavit, and the prescribed fee to the plaintiff or his agent. A copy of the notice of the rejection shall be sent to the clerk of the court in which the action was filed. E. The Secreta ry shall maintain a record of each notice of service sent to a person for a period of two years. The record maintained by the Secretary shall include the name of the plaintiff or the person seeking service, the name of the person to be served, the date s ervice was received by the Secretary, the date notice of service was forwarded to the person to be served, and the date the certificate of compliance was sent by the Secretary to the appropriate court. The Secretary shall not be required to maintain any other records pursuant to this section. History History.

Limitations of § 8.01-320 A do not apply to subsection A.  As an order of publication confers only in rem jurisdiction, application of subsection A of § 8.01-320 to subsection A of this section would destroy the person al jurisdiction conferred by the long-arm statute in § 8.01-328.1; moreover, application of subsection A of § 8.01-320 to subsection A of this section would mean that service on the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who need only mail a copy to the pe rson to be served at his last known address, would sustain personal jurisdiction, whereas personal service or substituted service designed to provide actual notice would support only in rem jurisdiction; therefore, the limitations of subsection A of § 8.01-320 do not apply to service of process pursuant to subsection A of this section.

Serving process on the Secretary of the Commonwealth is permissible only in the situatio ns outlined by § 8.01-328.1.V &amp; V Mining Supply, Inc. v. Matway, 295 F. Supp. 643, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8339 (W.D. Va. 1969) (decided under prior law). The former version of this section authorizes service on the Secretary of the Commonwealth in a suit against a foreign corporation as to any cause of action arisi ng from its transacting any business in this State. John G. Kolbe, Inc. v. Chromodern Chair Co., 211 Va. 736, 180 S.E.2d 664, 1971 Va. LEXIS 258 (1971) (decided under prior law). Service of process on the Secretary of the Commonwealth.  Where the exercise of personal jurisdiction was authorized under the long-arm statute, the defendants were amenable to service of process on the Secretary of the Commonwealth, and the action did not have to be dismissed for insufficiency of process. Furmanite Am., Inc. v. Durango Assocs., 662 F. Supp. 348, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20498 (E.D. Va. 1986). Defendants, served through the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia, in attempt to comply with § 8.01-329, argued that to be served in this manner, person al jurisdiction had to exist; defendants stated they were non-residents, not subject to personal jurisdiction, and hence, were not properly served. Because the court lacked personal jurisdiction over some of the defendants, service of process on them was insufficient. However, the court had personal jurisdiction over set of defendants, service of process on them through the Secretary was sufficient. Income Tax Sch., Inc. v. Lopez, No. 3:12-CV-334, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110779 (E.D. Va. Aug. 7, 2012). Plaintiff was not required to serve Secretary of Commonwealth.  Subsection A provides for three modes of service  service in the manner of the provisions of Chapter 8, of Title 8.01 (§ 8.01-285 et seq.), service on an a gent within the Commonwealth, and service on the Secretary of the Commonwealth; therefore, plaintiff was not required to serve the Secretary of the Commonwealth as the statutory...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-330"><akn:num>§ 8.01-330</akn:num><akn:heading>Jurisdiction on any other basis authorized</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A court of this State may exercise jurisdiction on any other basis authorized by law.

Except as p rovided in subsection C, any court in which is pending an action, wherein for more than two years there has been no order or proceeding, except to continue it, may, in its discretion, order it to be struck from its docket and the action shall thereby be discontinued. However, no case shall be discontinued if either party requests that it be continued. The court shall thereafter enter a pretrial order pursuant to Rule 4:13 controlling the subsequent course of the case to ensure a timely resolution of tha t case.

The clerk of the court shall notify the parties in interest if known, or their counsel of record at his last known address, at least fifteen days before the entry of such order of discontinuance so that all parties may have an opportunity to be heard on it. Any case discontinued under the provisions of this subsection may be reinstated, on motion, aft er notice to the parties in interest if known or their counsel of record, within one year from the date of such order but not after. B. Any court i n which is pending a case wherein for more than three years there has been no order or proceeding, except to continue it, may, in its discretion, order it to be struck from its docket and the action shall thereby be discontinued. The court may dismiss ca ses under this subsection without any notice to the parties. The clerk shall provide the parties with a copy of the final order discontinuing or dismissing the case. Any case discontinued or dismissed under the provisions of this subsection may be reinst ated, on motion, after notice to the parties in interest, if known, or their counsel of record within one year from the date of such order but not after.

Upon dismissal pursuant to this subsection, the judgment of the ge neral district court shall stand and the appeal bond shall be forfeited after application of any funds needed to satisfy the judgment. D. Any court i n which is pending a case wherein process has not been served within one year of the commencement of the case may, in its discretion, order it to be struck from the docket, and the action shall thereby be discontinued. The clerk of the court shall notify the plaintiff or his counsel of record at his last known address at least 30 days before the entry of an order of discontinuance so that the plaintiff may have an opportunity to show that service has been timely effected on the defendant or that due dil igence has been exercised to have service timely effected on the defendant. Upon finding that service has been timely effected or that due diligence has been exercised to have service timely effected, the court shall maintain the action on the docket and , if service has not been timely effected but due diligence to effect service has been exercised, shall require the plaintiff to attempt service in any manner permitted under Chapter 8 (§ 8.01-285 et seq.) of this title. Nothing herein shall prevent t he plaintiff from filing a nonsuit under § 8.01-380 before the entry of a discontinuance order pursuant to the provisions of this subsection.

I.Decisions Under Current Law. Constr uction with other law.  Because: (1) the circuit court lacked the authority to dismiss plaintiffs personal injury action under Norfolk, Va., Cir. Ct. R. 2(F)(3); (2) the local rule c onflicted with the provisions governing the discontinuance of cases set forth in § 8.01-335; and (3) the local rule abridged plaintiffs right to take a nonsuit under § 8.01-380 and recommence the action, said dismissal was void ab initio, and n ot subject to the limitation period of Va.Sup. Ct. R. 1:1. Collins v. Shepherd, 274 Va. 390, 649 S.E.2d 672, 2007 Va. LEXIS 116 (2007). Purpose of sub section A.  Subsection A provides a device designed to benefit the trial courts in setting cases for trial and expediting litigation; it does not provide substantive rights t o litigants to have cases dismissed for failure to prosecute within two years. Nash v. Jewell, 227 Va. 230, 315 S.E.2d 825, 1984 Va. LEXIS 237 (1984). The purpose of subsection A is to enable trial courts to identify cases which litigants or their counsel are not interested in pursuing to a conclusion. Nash v. J ewell, 227 Va. 230, 315 S.E.2d 825, 1984 Va. LEXIS 237 (1984). Subsection A does not apply to suits in which a final order or decree has been entered. Schoenwetter v. Schoenwetter, 8 Va. App. 601, 383 S.E.2d 28, 6 Va. Law Rep . 168, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 106 (1989). Purpose of subsection B is to enable trial courts to eliminate from their dockets cases for which there is no reasonable prospect of trial. Nash v. Jewell, 227 Va. 230, 315 S.E.2d 825, 1984 Va. LEXIS 237 (1984). Subsec tions A and B compared.  Subsection B permits courts to dismiss inactive cases without notice; by contrast, the purpose of subsection A is to enable courts to ascertain from the plaintiff s whether there is a desire and intent to try cases which have been dormant for two or more but less than five years. Nash v. Jewell, 227 Va. 230, 315 S.E.2d 825, 1984 Va. LEXIS 237 (1984). Proper use of two-year statute in subsection A is to expedite rather than to terminate litigation. Nash v. Jewell, 227 Va. 230, 315 S.E.2d 825, 1984 Va. LEXIS 237 (1984). Trial court improperly used subsection A to strike a suit in which a final decree had be en entered and since the trial court employed a mode of procedure to discontinue a case that clearly did not fall within the authorization of this section the order of discontinuance entered in the case was void. Schoenwetter v. Schoenwetter, 8 Va. App. 601, 383 S.E.2d 28, 6 Va. Law Rep. 168, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 106 (1989). Prospective order of discontinuance invalid.  Subsection B of § 8.01-335 does not allow a trial court to enter a self-executing order prospectively discontinuing or dismissing an action. Instead, if a tria l court first determines that there has been no order or proceeding in an action for more than three years, it then may discontinue or dismiss the action pursuant to subsection B of § 8.01-335. Rutter v. Oakwood Living Ctrs. of Va., Inc., 282 Va. 4, 7 10 S.E.2d 460, 2011 Va. LEXIS 123 (2011). Trial court erred by concluding that its order, requiring the suit to be discontinued under subsection B of § 8.01-335 if no action was taken in the next three years, automatically discontinued the action three years later. The order merely removed the action from the docket; under subsection B of § 8.01-335, a subsequent order was required to dismiss the action. Rutter v. Oakwood Living Ctrs. of Va., Inc., 282 Va. 4, 710 S.E.2d 460, 2011 Va. LEXIS 123 (2011). Notice not required.  Trial court clerk was not required by § 8:01-335 to notify appellant of a docket call and the proposed discontinuance of his dormant appeal; nor did the clerk s failure to send appellant timely notice after discontinuance of his inactive appeal deny him any opportunities as he still had 10 months left to seek reinstatement but elected not to do so. Heard v. Heard, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 116 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 26, 2002). Failure to provide notice rendered order voidable.  Trial courts failure to provide notice to a party in interest that the court was reinstating an action under subsection B of § 8.01-335 rendered the order voidable rather than void ab initio. Zedan v. Westheim, 60 Va. App. 556, 729 S.E.2d 785, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 257 (2012). Failure to provide copy of dismissal order.  Wife, who claimed that the trial court clerk had not provided her with a copy of the dismissal order as required by the provision had not overcome the presumption that the clerk had discharged his duties property; moreover, even if the clerk did fail to comply with the statute, the dismissal order would not be void.

B. Waiver o f jury trial.  In any action at law in which the recovery sought is greater than $20, exclusive of interest, unless one of the parties demands that the case or any issue thereof be tried by a jury, or in a criminal action in which trial by jury is dispensed with as provided by law, the whole matter of law and fact may be heard and judgment given by th e court. C. Court-or dered jury trial.  Notwithstanding any provision in this Code to the contrary, in any action assert ing a claim at law in which there has been no demand for trial by jury by any party, a circuit court may on its own motion direct one or more issues, including an issue of damages, to be tried by a jury. D. Trial by jury of plea in equity.  In any action in which a plea has been filed to an equitable claim, and t he allegations of such plea are denied by the plaintiff, either party may have the issue tried by jury. E.

If a civil action or an issue in the action is triable of right by jury under s ubsection A, unless a party to such action requests that the action or issue be so tried, he waives that right. The $20 amount in former § 8-211 has been increased to $100 in the enacted statute. Subsection C, Court ordered jury trial, is declaratory of established practice. Subsection D, Trial by jury of plea in equity, is former § 8-213 without substantial change. Subsection E, Issue out of chancery, is former § 8-214 without substantial change. Cross references.

In equity, a litigant has no constitutional right to trial by jury, and, absent a plea i n equity, no statutory right. Wright v. Castles, 232 Va. 218, 349 S.E.2d 125, 3 Va. Law Rep. 945, 1986 Va. LEXIS 248 (1986). All parties to civil litigation are entitled to a fair and impartial trial by a jury of persons who stand indifferent in the cause. Edlow v. Arnold, 243 Va. 345, 415 S.E.2d 436, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2266, 1992 Va. LEXIS 8 (1992). Right to jury trial not improperly denied where plaintiff did not follow procedure.  Dismissal of suit, which complained only of the denial of a trial by jury and asserted a collusion by defendants to deny him one, was proper, where plaintiffs own actions in bringing suit in the general district court rather than the circuit court deprived him of a trial by jury. He had originally brought his personal injury claim in circuit court, as he was entitled to by § 17-123, he would have received a jury upon request under this section. He also could have received a de novo jury trial by properly perfecting his appeal from general district court under § 16.1-113. His failure to receive a jury trial, therefore, was the result of his own failure to follow valid state procedures rather than the result of any collusion by defendants in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Beaudett v. City of Hampton, 775 F.2d 1274, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 24559 (4th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1088, 106 S. Ct. 14 75, 89 L. Ed. 2d 729, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 963 (1986). Additional demand for trial by jury not required.  Distributor had not waived its statute of limitations defense and was entitled to present its theory to the jury because it specifically set forth in a responsive pleading its defense of the statute of limitations; since the customers demand for a trial by jury did not specify any limits on the issues on which a jury trial was requested, the distributor had no obligation to make an additional demand. Ferguson Enters., Inc. v. F.H. Furr Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., 297 Va. 539, 830 S.E.2d 917, 2019 Va. LEXIS 87 (2019). Distributor was not required to file an additional demand for a trial by jury because its customer had already demanded a jury trial as to all issues, and the dis tributor was entitled to rely upon the demand for a jury trial made by the customer as to all issues in controversy between them; the statutes do not require duplicate jury demands to preserve the right to a trial by jury. Ferguson Enters., Inc. v. F.H. Furr Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., 297 Va. 539, 830 S.E.2d 917, 2019 Va. LEXIS 87 (2019). Defense to be hear d by jury.  Distributor was entitled to have its statute of limitations defense heard by a jury especially where the issue was initially presented to the trial judge for deci sion, and the judge declined to decide the matter because evidence was required. Ferguson Enters., Inc. v. F.H. Furr Plumbing, Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc., 297 Va. 539, 830 S.E.2d 917, 2019 Va. LEXIS 87 (2019). Bankruptcy courts authority to provide jury trial.  The common-law right of trial by jury imbedded in the Constitution of the United States and of Virginia coupled with the statutory enabling statutes eliminates an y question as to whether or not the bankruptcy court is vested with the authority to provide a trial by jury where such right otherwise exists in other courts, whatever the forum. Brown v. Frank Meador Buick, Inc., 8 Bankr. 450, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 5132 (B ankr. W.D. Va. 1981). What is a plea.  A plea, whether at law or in equity, is a discrete form of defensive pleading; distinguished from an answer or grounds of defense, a plea does not address the mer its of the issues raised by the bill of complaint or the motion for judgment; rather, it alleges a single state of facts or circumstances (usually not disclosed or disclosed only in part by the record) which, if proven, constitutes an absolute defense to the claim. Nelms v. Nelms, 236 Va. 281, 374 S.E.2d 4, 5 Va. Law Rep. 883, 1988 Va. LEXIS 153 (1988). Pleadings in general answers and a cross-bill were not pleas in equity within the intend ment of subsection D; consequently, the chancellor could not have relied on this subsection for his decision to submit a question of mental competence to a jury. Nelms v. Nelms, 236 Va. 281, 374 S.E.2d 4, 5 Va. Law Rep. 883, 1988 Va. LEXIS 153 (1988). Trial court did not err in denying fathers request for a jury trial.  Although father maintained that a jury should have been impanelled to determine whether he should have been relieved of his obligation to support his child due to violation of his rights by mothers seduction of him and decision to keep the child, even assuming the allegations were true, they did not constitute a bar to the enforcement of his support obligations; in Virginia, both parents of a child owe that c hild a duty of support during minority.

Plaintiff may withdraw consent to three-person special jury before trial has begun.  Given the clearly expressed constitutional purpose and legislative intent to preserve the right to trial by jury in both criminal and civil cases, a consent to a special three-person jury under subsection D of § 8.01-359 may be withdrawn before trial under the same conditions...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-337"><akn:num>§ 8.01-337</akn:num><akn:heading>Who liable to serve as jurors</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text All citizens over 18 years of age who have been residents of the Commonwealth one year, and of the county, city, or town in which they reside six months next preceding their being summoned to serve as such, and competent in other respects, except as hereinafter provided, shall be liable to serve as jurors.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Disqualification and exemption provisions nondiscriminatory.  Virginia law has many disqualification and exemption provisions for selection to the jury list, none of which are discriminatory. Stephens v. Cox, 449 F.2d 657, 1 971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7635 (4th Cir. 1971). Some Virginia disqualifications and exemptions, by an entirely impartial operation, may disqualify more African Americans than whites. Stephens v. Cox, 449 F.2d 657, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7635 (4th Cir. 1971). Duty to learn who is qualified.  Where personal knowledge of the races of persons to be selected for the jury list is a factor, a charge of discrimination may not be avoided by a showing that suf ficient qualified African Americans were unknown to the selecting officials. There is a duty to learn who is qualified. The same principle is applicable to the preparation of the list of potential grand jurors. Stephens v. Cox, 449 F.2d 657, 1971 U.S. Ap p. LEXIS 7635 (4th Cir. 1971). Token inclusion of A frican Americans forbidden.  The Constitution forbids not only the exclusion of African Americans from jury service, but all discrimination by race. A token inclusion of African Americans is also forbidden. Stephens v. Cox, 449 F.2d 657, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7635 (4th Cir. 1971). Prima facie case of racial dis crimination.  A showing that a substantial disparity exists between the proportion of presumptively qualified African Americans in the general population and their proportion o n juries will establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, if the disparity is coupled either with additional positive indicia of discrimination or with a showing that the selection procedure provides an opportunity for discrimination. Stephens v. Cox, 449 F.2d 657, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7635 (4th Cir. 1971). Suggestion of circumstances lawfully accounting for disparity insufficient.  Where there are many possible circumstances which, if they exist, might account lawfully for an observed disparity between the number of adult African Americans a nd the number of African Americans serving on juries in a certain locality, the suggestion of their possible existence is not enough. It must be demonstrated by the Commonwealth when the facts shown prima facie are indicative of discrimination. Stephens v. Cox, 449 F.2d 657, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 7635 (4th Cir. 1971). Discrimination against women not proved.  Where the jury list was properly chosen in accord with this section, the mere absence of women did not constitute proof of purposeful and intentional discriminati on. Near v. Commonwealth, 202 Va. 20, 116 S.E.2d 85, 1960 Va. LEXIS 186 (1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 873, 81 S. Ct. 907, 5 L. Ed. 2d 862, 1961 U.S. LEXIS 1430 (1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 862, 82 S.

No error in failure to strike visually impaired juror.  Trial courts failure to strike a potential juror for cause based on the potential jurors impaired vision did not deny defendant of the right to trial by a n impartial jury, because the potential juror was not without sight, the impairment was not obvious to those in the courtroom, and the court stated its intention to make accommodations for the juror.

Added is new subsection 3 which disqualifies as jurors all persons under a disabilit y as defined in § 8.01-2, which is obviously broader in coverage than the former disqualification. Law Review.

CASE NOTES No showing of probable injustice.  Although two convicted felons served on defendants jury, trial court was not required to set aside verdict and grant him a new trial for no evidence was prese nted to the court to suggest that the two jurors legal disability as felons would probably cause injustice to the defendant.

Code Ann. § 8.01-338 was not error where he had been twice convicted of felony DUI, the Virginia Criminal Information Netw ork did not show that his rights had been restored, and he could not name the governor who he claimed restored his rights, nor the date when they were supposedly restored. Warren v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2023). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Right to serve on jury.  Defendant was not entitled to an order requiring the clerk of the court to disclose the juror questionnaires and the responses to those questionnaires of a juror list because felons whose right to serve on juries were purportedly restored by an order of the Governor of Virginia were not eligible when the jury questionnaires were distributed.

Text The court, at the request of a person selected for jury service or on its own motion, may exempt any person from jury service for a particular term of court, or limit t hat persons service to particular dates of that term, if serving on a jury during that term or certain dates of that term of court would cause such person a particular occupational inconvenience.

Selection of cross-section required.  Nothing in this section prevents the commissioners from selecting jurors who represent a cross-section of the population of the community suitable in intelligence and honesty for that duty. To the contrary, the commissioners are required, in the performance of their duty, to select prospective jurors who represent a cross-section of the community. Archer v.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-345 is largely identical with former § 8-208.10 with the following change: The former statute required the prior authorization of the chief judge of the circuit in order for the jury commissioners to use random selection techniques, and then the use of such techniques was merely permissible. Section 8.01-345 dispenses with the prior authority of the chief judge and makes the use of random selectio n techniques mandatory upon the commissioners. The duty of the chief judge to promulgate procedural rules to ensure the integrity of the random selection process and compliance with other laws with respect to jury selection and service is retained.

Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Denial of motion to strike jury panel proper.  There was no manifest error in the trial courts denial of defendants motion to strike the jury panel because defendant could not establish either an irreg ularity in the jury selection process or a violation of his right to a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community; he offered no proof that young individuals, white individuals, or males were more likely to complete their questionnaires bef ore older individuals, African-American individuals, or females. Rogers v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 384 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 1, 2009), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 1071, 131 S. Ct. 663, 178 L. Ed. 2d 495, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 9319 (2010). Evidence was insufficient to establish prima facie case of racial dis crimination.  Where the evidence adduced showed that jury commissioners never hand-picked jurors, where the jury selection process in county was done by random computer selecti on from the voter registration list, where the voter registration list did not indicate the race of the prospective jurors and jury commissioners had no way of knowing the race of prospective jury members until they arrived, and where this section sets o ut the procedure for jury selection and no evidence suggested that this selection process was not followed, based on this evidence, appellant failed to show intentional racial discrimination or that the juror selection process left open this opportunity, and therefore, appellants evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refer to former provisions. Statutory provisions with respect to empaneling juries are mandatory and not directory. Harmon v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 442, 185 S.E.2d 48, 1971 Va. LEXIS 370 (1971). There is a constitutional right to a jury drawn from a group which represents a cross section of the community. And a cross section of the community includes persons with varying degrees of training and intelligence and with varying economic and social positions. Under the United States Constitution, the jury is not to be made the represe ntative of the most intelligent, the most wealthy or the most successful, nor of the least intelligent, the least wealthy, or the least successful. It is a democratic institution, representative of all qualified classes of people. Witcher v. Peyton, 405 F.2d 725, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9388 (4th Cir. 1969). And selection must accord with this.  Section of jurors must always accord with the fact that the proper functioning of the jury system, and, indeed, our democracy itself, requires that the jury be a body truly representative of the community, and not the organ of any special group or class. If that requirement is observed, the officials charged with choosing jurors may exercise some discretion to that end that competent jurors may be called. But the y must not allow the desire for competent jurors to lead them into selections which do not comport with the concept of the jury as a cross section of the community. Tendencies, no matter how slight, toward the selection of jurors by any method other than a process which will insure a trial by a representative group are undetermining processes weakening the institution of jury trial, and should be sturdily resisted. That the motives influencing such tendencies may be of the best must not blind courts to the dangers of allowing any encroachment whatsoever on this essential right. Steps innocently taken may one by one lead to the irretrievable impairment of substantial liberties. Witcher v. Peyton, 405 F.2d 725, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9388 (4th Cir. 1969). In the selection of juries recognition must be given to the fact that those eligible for jury service are to be found in every stratum of society. Jury competence is an individual rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the very heart of the jury system. To disregard it is to open the door to class distinctions and discriminations which are abhorrent to the democratic ideals of trial by jury. Witch er v. Peyton, 405 F.2d 725, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9388 (4th Cir. 1969). Admission of discrimination not needed to attack jury selection procedure.  It is not necessary to a successful attack upon a jury selection procedure that petitioner obtain an admission from the judge and jury commissioners that they hav e discriminated. Witcher v. Peyton, 405 F.2d 725, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9388 (4th Cir. 1969). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Service by felons on jury.  Defendant was not entitled to an order requiring the clerk of the court to disclose the juror questionnaires and the responses to those questionnaires of a juror list because felons whose right to serve on juries were purportedly restored by an order of the Governor of Virginia were not eligible when the jury questionnaires were distributed.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-352 consolidates certain provisions found in former §§ 8-208.7, 8-208.27, and 8-208.29. Under this section, objections to any irregularity in t he jury list, etc., or to any legal disability generally must be made before the jury is sworn. Thereafter, such objections may be made only with leave of court. This alters former § 8-208.27 which permits objection only before the jury is sworn. Furt hermore, the present section places an objection to a legal disability under former § 8-208.29 on the same footing as an objection to jury list irregularity under former § 8-208.27. The revisers believe that the term legal disability is mea nt to incorporate all exemptions or disqualifications from jury service found in §§ 8.01-338 through 8.01-342. The provision in former § 8-208.7 making it reversible error if the court should permit a juror to serve twice during the one-year period mentioned in § 8.0 1-342 over the objection of a party, has been eliminated.

Challenge after jury empanelled.  In a breach of contract action, property owners claim that a pool company and its owner did not acquire leave of court to challenge a specific juror after the jurors had been empanelled and therefore the issue was waived under § 8.01-352 was rejected as the trial court considered the challenge to the specific juror as to his impartiality and therefore implicitly granted leave to raise the challenge. Robert M. Seh Co. v. O'Donnell, 277 Va. 599, 675 S.E.2d 202, 2009 Va. LEXIS 53 (2009). Denial of defendants Batson challenge was reviewed, despite defendants failure to contemporaneously and specifically object to a prosecutors peremptor y strike, because, when defendant raised the issue seven months later, while not expressly granting defendant leave to make the untimely argument, it was assumed without deciding that the trial court concluded the untimely argument merely amplified a tri al argument. Bethea v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 730, 831 S.E.2d 670, 2019 Va. LEXIS 101 (2019). Erroneous exclusion of all jurors who had served on any felony panel.  Section 8.01-355 permits the trial court to excuse any jurors whose names were drawn for service on a particular panel and, thus, authorizes the trial courts direction to the clerk. The clerks misunderstanding of the trial courts direction and the subsequent exclusion of all jurors who had served on any felony panel in the then-current term was an irregularity under subsection A of this section, which is cured under subsection B of this section, because the exclusion was not intentional, nor did it operate to cause any prejudice to defendant. Accordingly, held no reversible error in the selection of the venire. O'Dell v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 672, 36 4 S.E.2d 491, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1651, 1988 Va. LEXIS 5, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 871, 109 S. Ct. 186, 102 L. Ed. 2d 154, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 3673 (1988). Exclusion from jury pool based on juror availability upheld.  Trial judges exclusion from the jury pool of those who were not available to serve on the four-day trial was not irregular as it did not exclude anyone or any cognizable group. Reeves v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 650, 593 S.E.2d 827, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 115 (2004). No error in failure to strike visually impaired juror.  Trial courts failure to strike a potential juror for cause based on the potential jurors impaired vision did not deny defendant of the right to trial by a n impartial jury, because the potential juror was not without sight, the impairment was not obvious to those in the courtroom, and the court stated its intention to make accommodations for the juror. Clarke v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 243 (Va. C t. App. May 26, 2009). No showing of probable injustice.  Although two convicted felons served on defendants jury, trial court was not required to set aside verdict and grant him a new trial for no evidence was prese nted to the court to suggest that the two jurors legal disability as felons would probably cause injustice to the defendant. Mighty v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 495, 438 S.E.2d 495, 10 Va. Law Rep. 678, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 639 (1993). Record failed to demonstrate that a juror who purportedly lacked proficiency in the English language had a disability which was such as to probably cause inju stice where challenged juror understood all of the trial courts questions and the trial court made a factual finding that she had a sufficient level of understanding of the English language which permitted her to participate fully in the jury del iberations. Mason v. Commonwealth, 255 Va. 505, 498 S.E.2d 921, 1998 Va. LEXIS 68 (1998). Juror who served on jury panel in defendants arson case did not have a hearing impairment that was so pronounced as to deny defendant a fair trial. A hearing regarding the jurors impairment showed that the impairment was not such that it probably caused injustice in violation of § 8.01-352 in a case where defendant was convicted on the arson charge. Sloan v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 452 (Va. C t. App. Oct. 7, 2008). A motion for a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and, unless there has been abuse of that discretion, the judgment below will not be reversed on appeal. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Moorefield, 231 Va. 260, 343 S.E.2d 329, 1986 Va. LEXIS 141 (1986). And cour t has duty to investigate charges of misconduct.  In considering a motion to set aside when juror misconduct is alleged, the trial court has the affirmative duty to investigate the charges and to ascertain whethe r or not, as a matter of fact, the jury was guilty of such misconduct. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Moorefield, 231 Va. 260, 343 S.E.2d 329, 1986 Va. LEXIS 141 (1986). And trial court may properly summon one or more jurors to testify under oath in open court and to answer relevant questions propounded by the court and counsel about what transpired. This is an exception to the general rule that testimony of jurors is inadmissible to impeach their verdict. Ordinarily, jurors will not be allowed to explain th eir verdict by stating the reasons upon which their conclusions are based. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Moorefield, 231 Va. 260, 343 S.E.2d 329, 1986 Va. LEXIS 141 (1986). Hearsay affidavits not admissible in support of motion for new trial.  Although juror testimony may be received upon an issue of juror misconduct, hearsay affidavits are not admissible in support of a motion for a new trial. Neverthe less, such an affidavit may be sufficient to require the trial court to investigate the matters recited in the document. Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Moorefield, 231 Va. 260, 343 S.E.2d 329, 1986 Va. LEXIS 141 (1986). Waiver of peremptory strikes not ground for seating partial panel.  Under appropriate circumstances, a waiver of peremptory strikes by one or both parties is helpful and useful to the alleviation of an overcrowded docket. However, where a defendant, as here, has alerted the court to the existence of a potential problem and elects to stand on the statutory mandate of a panel of 20 jurors, he is entitled to a full panel of impartial jurors and may not be required to accept a lesser number simply because the Commonwealth agrees to waive one or more of its peremptory strikes. Fuller v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 277, 416 S.E.2d 44, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2614, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 113 (1992).

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-353 is largely based on former § 8-208.16, but the reference to the term of court is omitted so that the judge may now summon the jurors for the p articular day on which their attendance is required. Furthermore, service of the original notice to prospective jurors is to be in accordance with § 8.01-298. Editors note. Acts 1993, c. 929, cl. 3, as amended by Acts 1994, c. 564, cl. 1, and Acts 1996, c. 616, cl. 3, provided that the enactment of § 8.01-353.01 by Acts 1993, c. 9 29, cl. 1, would become effective June 1, 1998, only if state funds are provided by the General Assembly sufficient to provide adequate resources, including all local costs, for the court to carry out the purposes of this act and to fulfill its missi on to serve children and families of the Commonwealth. The funding was not provided.

CASE NOTES Failure to provide timely information concerning panel members not reversible error.  The statutory scheme does not contemplate that a full and accurate jury panel list will always be available for counsel forty-eight hours before the trial but rec ognizes that, under certain circumstances, the members of the actual jury panel necessarily will vary from those persons listed on a jury panel list provided forty-eight hours before trial. A trial court thus did not err in reconstituting a jury panel du e to the limited number of potential jurors available where there was no dispute as to the need to reconstitute the panel and where there was no claim that the resulting jury was not impartial or that the complaining party was otherwise prejudiced. Norfo lk S. Ry. v. Bowles, 261 Va. 21, 539 S.E.2d 727, 2001 Va. LEXIS 8 (2001). Where defense counsel was given time to review the list of the members on the new jury panel and then voiced no specific need for additional time to investigate a ny particular juror, defendant failed to show any specific prejudice amounting to a denial of due process even though defense counsel did not receive a copy of the new jury panel list at least 48 hours prior to trial. Butler v. Commonwealth, 264 Va. 614, 570 S.E.2d 813, 2002 Va. LEXIS 158 (2002). Copy of jury panel.  Trial court did not err by denying defendants motion to continue trial when copy of jury panel had not been made available to defense counsel at least 48 hour s before trial where circumstances required reconstitution of jury panel. Butler v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 668 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 11, 2001), aff'd, 264 Va. 614, 570 S.E.2d 813, 2002 Va. LEXIS 158 (2002). Provisions regarding counsels right to receive a copy of the jury panel list at least 48 hours prior to trial is directory rather than mandatory, and a failur e to comply with those provisions is not a per se basis for reversing a trial courts judgment in eith er a civil or a criminal case; rather, adherence to the provisions of § 8.01-353 is required to the extent necessary to insure due process. Butler v. Commonwealth, 264 Va. 614, 570 S.E.2d 813, 2002 Va. LEXIS 158 (2002). The statutory provisions with respect to empaneling juries are mandatory and not directo ry. Harmon v.

Jury, §§ 20, 32, 48, 49. CASE NOTES Denial of motion to strike j ury panel proper.  There was no manifest error in the trial courts denial of defendants motion to strike the jury panel because defendant could not establish either an irreg ularity in the jury selection process or a violation of his right to a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community; he offered no proof that young individuals, white individuals, or males were more likely to complete their questionnaires bef ore older individuals, African-American individuals, or females. Rogers v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 384 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 1, 2009), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 1071, 131 S. Ct. 663, 178 L. Ed. 2d 495, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 9319 (2010). Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendants motion to strike a prospective juror for cause because, viewing the voir dire in its entirety, the record supported the trial courts conclusion that the juror could remain fair and impartial. Twice the juror responded that she was not sure if her best friends murder would affect her judgment in the case, but in its entirety the trial court determined that the jurors voir dire indicated that she could remain fair and impartial. Purnell v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (Va. Ct. App. June 23, 2020). The right to a trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions and this guarantee is reinforced by legislative enactment and by the rules of court. Gosling v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 642, 376 S.E.2d 541, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1666, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 9 (1989). Doubts as to impartiality resolved in favor of accused.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a prospective jurors ability to give the accused a fair and impartial trial must be resolved in favor of the accused. Shanklin v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 18, 2000). Every prospective juror must stand indifferent to the cause and any reasonable doubt as to a jurors qualifications must be resolved in favor of the accused. M urray v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 182 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 10, 2001). Deferral of argument on chal lenge for cause.  A trial judge may have good reason to defer argument on a challenge for cause until after voir dire has been completed. However, argument on a challenge for cause should not be deferred until after the parties have exercised their peremptory challenges and the jury has been sworn. Brooks v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 523, 484 S.E.2d 127, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 236 (1997). Juror properly retained on panel.  The trial court did not erroneously overrule motion on part of defendant, who was convicted by a jury of murder in the first degree, to remove a juror from the pa nel for cause where juror was a conscientious and perceptive juror, fully cognizant of the duties and responsibilities attendant to that service, her responses during voir dire revealed an impartial mind, untainted by prejudgment and receptive to conside ration of the case in accordance with the evidence and instructions of the court, notwithstanding prior knowledge and interest in the offenses, and she, therefore, stood indifferent to the cause and was properly retained on the panel. Swanson v. Commonwe alth, 18 Va. App. 182, 442 S.E.2d 702, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1148, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 192 (1994). In a first-degree murder case, there was no error in the denial of a motion to strike a prospective juror for cause because the jurors preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of defendant was not sufficient to justify disqualification where the juror said he could lay aside that opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented. During individual voir dire, the juror unequivocally committe d himself to set aside any prior opinion and based his decision on the evidence provided. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 448, 796 S.E.2d 859, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (2017). The trial court did not err in refusing to strike potential juror for cause.  The prospective juror acknowledged awareness of accounts of the crime in the media but his awareness was coextensive with the brief summary of allegations provide d by the trial judge at the commencement of voir dire. Although he characterized the medias account as prejudging the accused, the prospective juror repeatedly stated that he would base his decision upon the evidence presented at trial. The t rial judge did not err by refusing to strike this prospective juror for cause. DeLaurencio v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 443 (Va. Ct. App. June 20, 2000). Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to exclude a juror for cause because the juror made it clear during voir dire that he would not necessarily a ccept a police officers testimony that conflicted with other testimony; the juror readily agreed, when specifically directed to his statements regarding police officer credibility, that he could and would reserve judgment on the credibility of a witn ess until he had seen and heard the witness at trial. Rogers v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 384 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 1, 2009), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 1071, 131 S. Ct. 663, 178 L. Ed. 2d 495, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 9319 (2010). Circuit court did not commit manifest error by denying defendants motion to strike a juror for cause; defendant focused on two isolated statements made by the juror, not the entirety of her voir dire, and both statements were taken out of context. The court concluded that the circuit court heard the juror emphasize the word can in her reply, I think I can be fair. Keepers v. Commonwealth, 72 V a. App. 17, 840 S.E.2d 575, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (2020). Circuit court did not commit manifest error by denying defendants motion to strike a juror for cause; she explained that she and her husband shared a social m edia account, she did not like the news story about defendant being denied bond, and she was not the one who posted the comment about defendant receiving capital punishment. The juror unequivocally stated that she could be fair and impartial. Kee pers v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. App. 17, 840 S.E.2d 575, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (2020). The trial court erred in refusing to strike potential juror for cause where, although she stated that she would attempt not to base her judgment on information she had gained through the news media, she could not assure the court that she would render her verdict based solely on the evidence adduced at trial. Her answers raised a reasonable doubt as to her qualification to serve as a juror, a doubt that should have been resolved by granting defendants motion to strike her for cause. DeHart v. Commonwealth, 1 9 Va. App. 139, 449 S.E.2d 59, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 630 (1994). Circuit court erred in failing to strike a prospective juror for cause because the juror was related to a Commonwealths witness  a police officer/witness s father was the jurors first cousin  the jurors answers to the questions posed during voir dire did not demonstrate that he could be fair and impartial where, although the juror responded affirmatively when asked if he could be fair and impartial and make a decision based on the evidence and not solely on testimony, and the Commonwealth attorneys attempt to rehabilitate the juror was insufficient to establish that his personal relationship with the officer would not affect his abili ty to be impartial and give appellant a fair trial. Bell v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 8, 2017). Jurors to be removed for cause before peremptory challenges.  An accused is entitled to a panel of jurors free from exception before exercising peremptory challenges. Cressell v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 744, 531 S.E.2d 1, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 500 (2000). Error to force use of peremptory str ike.  This section assures a defendant a right to an impartial jury drawn from a panel of 20 free from exceptions, and it is prejudicial error for the trial court to fo rce a defendant to use the peremptory strike afforded him by § 19.2-262 to exclude a venireman who is not free from exception. Justus v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 971, 266 S.E.2d 87, 1980 Va. LEXIS 192 (1980). Putting the defense in a position where it is forced to exercise its peremptory challenges to exclude a biased juror is not harmless error. Gosling v. Commonwealt h, 7 Va. App. 642, 376 S.E.2d 541, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1666, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 9 (1989). Under Virginia law, compelling defendant to use peremptory challenge to remove juror who should have been removed for cause is prejudicial error. Satcher v. Neth erland, 944 F. Supp. 1222, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20132 (E.D. Va. 1996), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 126 F.3d 561, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 25188 (4th Cir. 1997). Trial court erred in disallowing inquiry into prospective jurors previous employment as a law-enforcement officer, and in denying defendants motion to str ike prospective juror for cause, which forced defendant to use a peremptory strike to remove prospective juror.

Impartiality as to Punishment. C. Illustrative Cases. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. A.General Cons ideration. An accused is entitled to an impartial jury as a matter of constitutional guarantee, rei nforced by legislative mandate and by the rules of court. Martin v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 436, 271 S.E.2d 123, 1980 Va. LEXIS 263 (1980). The right to a trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions and this guarantee is reinforced by legislative en actment and by the rules of court. Gosling v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 642, 376 S.E.2d 541, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1666, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 9 (1989). Which is a sub stantive right.  The constitutional and statutory guarantee of an impartial jury is no mere legal technicality, but a substantive right scrupulously to be observed in the day-to-d ay administration of justice. Martin v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 436, 271 S.E.2d 123, 1980 Va. LEXIS 263 (1980). All doubt as to juror impartiality must be resolved in accuseds favor.  When asked if there was doubt in her mind whether she could sit impartially as a juror, juror responded, Its possible but not likely. While it is unc lear from the record whether juror meant to say that it was possible but not likely that she could be impartial or whether she meant it was possible she was prejudiced but not likely, all doubts as to the impartiality of a juror must be resolved in favor of the accused and the trial court abused its discretion and committed manifest error by refusing to strike juror for cause. Foley v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 149, 379 S.E.2d 915, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2449, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (1989). Where the voir dire in this case raised reasonable doubt concerning a jurors ability to stand indifferent in the cause as required by this section, reversal o f the conviction was required. Clements v. Commonwealth, 21 Va. App. 386, 464 S.E.2d 534, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 919 (1995). Viewing the venire persons voir dire in its entirety, the record disclosed a series of tentative, equivocal responses to questioning intended to probe and asc ertain the venire persons state of mind, leaving reasonable doubt of her partiality as a matter of law and requiring that she be removed for cause. Under such circumstances, it was reversible error to require defendant to exhaust a peremptory strike to remove the juror. Pennington v. Commonwealth, No. 1346-95-3 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 4, 1997). Every prospective juror must stand indifferent to the cause and any reasonable doubt as to a jurors qualifications must be resolved in favor of the accused. M urray v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 182 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 10, 2001). Discretion of court in jury selection.  Generally, whether a prospective juror should be excluded for cause is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its action in refusing to excl ude a particular venireman is entitled to great weight on appeal. Martin v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 436, 271 S.E.2d 123, 1980 Va. LEXIS 263 (1980). As long as the selection procedure results in a fair and impartial jury, the manner in which a jury is to be selected is properly within the trial courts soun d discretion. Turner v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 513, 273 S.E.2d 36, 1980 Va. LEXIS 273 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1011, 101 S. Ct. 2347, 68 L. Ed. 2d 863, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 2180 (1981). Whether a venireman can lay aside a preconceived opinion and render a verdict solely on the evidence is a mixed question of law and fact. Resolution of the questi on rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Calhoun v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 256, 307 S.E.2d 896, 1983 Va. LEXIS 314 (1983). It is the courts duty to procure an impartial jury. The courts fulfillment of this duty, however, involves the exercise of sound judicial discretion. Scot t v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 447, 339 S.E.2d 899, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 222 (1986), aff'd, 233 Va. 5, 353 S.E.2d 460, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1839, 1987 Va. LEXIS 152 (1987). The courts duty, in the exercise of its discretion, is to empanel jurors who are free from bias or prejudice against the parties and who stand indifferent in the cause. Scott v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 447, 339 S.E.2d 899, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 222 (1986), aff'd, 233 Va. 5, 353 S.E.2d 460, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1839, 1987 Va. LEXIS 152 (1987). Upon review, the appellate court gives deference to the trial courts decision as to whether to retain or exclude prospective jurors, and a trial courts de cision on this issue will be affirmed unless there has been manifest error amounting to an abuse of discretion. Cantrell v. Crews, 259 Va. 47, 523 S.E.2d 502, 2000 Va. LEXIS 22 (2000). Trial courts decision whether to retain or exclude an individual venireman is given deference on appeal, since it is in a position to see and hear the juror. Caprio v. Commonwealth, No. 2225-98-1 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 14, 2000). Sufficient explanations for peremptory strikes.  Commonwealths concerns with jurors who were not paying attention, one of whom was seen smiling at appellant, provided sufficient race-neutral explanations for the use of two of its peremptory strikes. Allred v. Commonwealth, No. 0223-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals March 14, 1995). Trial court is not required to exclude all jurors who have any preconceived opinion of the case. Calhoun v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 256, 307 S.E.2d 896, 1983 Va. LEXIS 314 (1983). To hold that the mere existence of any preconceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a p rospective jurors impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. Calhoun v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 256, 307 S.E.2d 896, 1983 Va. LEXIS 314 (1983). It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside impression or opinion and render verdict based on evidence presented in court. Calhoun v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 256, 307 S.E.2d 896, 1983 Va. LEXIS 314 (1983). Curative instruction insufficient to negate prejudice due to improper comments during voir dire.  Trial courts curative instruction was neither explicit nor sufficient and created a manifest probability of prejudice because, based on the totality of the ci rcumstances during voir dire and in the rebuttal argument, the improper comments during voir dire were so impressive as to remain in the minds of the jurors and influence their verdict; the curative instruction addressed only statements made by counsel i n opening statements and closing remarks, not during voir dire, the nature of the prosecutors inappropriate comment that victims of rape usually delay reporting directly addressed a central, if not the central, issue in the case and increased the lik elihood of prejudice, and nothing in the record indicated the prosecutor ever intended to present any evidence to substantiate the opinion. Smith v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 595, 580 S.E.2d 481, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (2003). Disc retion of court as to voir dire.  Where the court carefully reviewed defendants refused questions and concluded that he was not prejudiced thereby, and where defendant cannot show that the tri al court abused its discretion in refusing to ask the remaining questions, the Supreme Court will not disturb the lower courts ruling. Bassett v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 844, 284 S.E.2d 844, 1981 Va. LEXIS 382 (1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 938, 102 S. Ct. 1996, 72 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1982). The questions propounded by counsel must be relevant and the trial court must, in its discretion, decide the issue of relevancy, subject to review for abuse. LeVa sseur v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 564, 304 S.E.2d 644, 1983 Va. LEXIS 257 (1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1063, 104 S. Ct. 744, 79 L. Ed. 2d 202, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 728 (1984); Henshaw v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 213, 348 S.E.2d 853, 3 Va. Law Rep. 763, 1986 Va . App. LEXIS 353 (1986). It is the duty of the court to procure an impartial jury. Consistent with this duty, the trial courts of Virginia conduct the examination of the venire, including the mandatory seven questions set out in Rule 3A:14. The trial courts responsibility in the matter of the venire, however, does not exclude the participation of counsel. Scott v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 447, 339 S.E.2d 899, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 222 (1986), aff'd, 233 Va. 5, 353 S.E.2d 460, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1839, 1987 Va. LEXIS 152 (1987).

Where there are more than two parties, all plaintiffs shall share three s trikes between them and all defendants and third-party defendants shall share three strikes between them. C. In any case in which there are two or more parties on the same side, if counsel or the parties are unable to agree on the full number to be stricken, or, if for any other reason a party or his counsel fails or refuses to strike off the full number of jurors allowed such party, the clerk shall place in a box ballots bearing the names of the jurors whose names have not been stricken and shall cause to be drawn from the box such number of ballots as may be necessary to complete the number of strikes allowed the party or parties failing or refusing to strike. Thereafter, if the opposing side is entitled to further strikes, they shall be made in the usual manner. D. In any civi l case in which the consent of the plaintiff and defendant shall be entered of record, it shall be lawful for the plaintiff to select one person who is eligible as a juror and for the defendant to select another, and for the two so selected to select a t hird of like qualifications, and the three so selected shall constitute a jury in the case. They shall take the oath required of jurors, and hear and determine the issue, and any two concurring shall render a verdict in like manner and with like effect a s a jury of seven. History History.

App. 702, 467 S.E.2d 294, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 127 (1996). Replacement of r egular juror with alternate juror.  Trial court acted within its discretion when it replaced one of the regular jurors with the alternate juror because the regular juror informed the trial court tha t she was scared and worried as a result of her interaction with the young woman who was with defendants party in which the young woman informed the regular juror that her grandparents lived down the street from the regular jurors house; and the trial court reasonably questioned the regular jurors ability to remain impartial and whether she might consider things other than the law and evidence. Brown v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 59, 764 S.E.2d 297, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 366 (2014). Ne cessity for discharge is discretionary with trial court.  There is no general rule as to what facts and circumstances constitute such a necessity to discharge a jury, but the trial court is authorized to exercise its dis cretion in making the determination according to the circumstances of the case. Turnbull v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 328, 218 S.E.2d 541, 1975 Va. LEXIS 292 (1975) (decided under prior law). Discharge where ju ry agreed to two-thirds verdict.  Where the defendant was denied his right to a unanimous verdict in his first trial when the jury agreed to a two-thirds verdict, there was a manifest necessity as required by this section that the trial court declare a mistrial so that the petitioner would be assured of his right not to be convicted without the unanimous consent of the whole jury. Price v. Slayton, 347 F. Supp. 1269, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11937 ( W.D. Va. 1972) (decided under prior law). Manife st necessity for declaration of mistrial existed.  Despite the accuseds willingness to proceed with a jury of less than 12 members following the illness of a juror, where the Commonwealth insisted upon its co- equal right to a jury of 12 members, and where no alternate jurors had been impaneled, the trial court properly declared that a mistrial was necessary; and a second trial for the same offenses did not violate double jeopardy principles. King v. Commonwea lth, 40 Va. App. 364, 579 S.E.2d 634, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2003) (decided under prior law). In a capital case in which the circuit court determined that a juror failed to follow its instructions because the juror revealed that he had not maintained his h onest convictions during the guilt phase when he expressed that he did not believe the Commonwealth had proved that defendant was guilty of capital murder after the jury had returned a unanimous guilty verdict and he refused to follow an Allen charge, th e circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it declared a mistrial due to manifest necessity arising out of juror misconduct, discharged the jury, and granted a retrial of the entire case. Prieto v. Commonwealth, 278 Va. 366, 682 S.E.2d 910, 2009 V a. LEXIS 94 (2009), cert. denied, 560 U.S. 969, 130 S. Ct. 3419, 177 L. Ed. 2d 332, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 4926 (2010), . No d ouble jeopardy where manifest necessity for mistrial.  Although jeopardy attaches to a criminal defendant when the jury is sworn, the trial court, in its sound discretion, may declare a mistrial where there appears to be a manifest necessity for it or where the ends of justice so require. Where this is the case, the defendant may be retried without a violation of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. Price v. Slayton, 347 F. Supp. 1269, 1972 U.S. Dist. L EXIS 11937 (W.D. Va. 1972) (decided under prior law). Defendant did not object to the trial courts declaration of a mistrial on a finding of manifest necessity under § 8.01-361, in a way that would have preser ved his double jeopardy right because counsel declined the offer to select another member of the jury and counsels use of the phrase please note my exception did not communicate anything beyond general disagreement with the ruling of the cour t. He failed to made known to the court the action he sought the court to take or the objection to the courts actions and his grounds, as required by subsection A of § 8.01-384. Kahlil v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (Va. Ct. App. May 6, 2008). Appearance of defendant in shackles.  The trial court abused its discretion by not discharging the jury when the defendant was brought into the courtroom in shackles in full view of the jury although he had only been charged with a nonviolent crime and the Commonwealth made no assertion that he was violent or dangerous. Miller v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 367, 373 S.E.2d 721, 5 Va. Law Rep. 813, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 123 (1988). Accuseds right s in selecting replacement juror.  While this section does not specifically prescribe the procedure for selecting a replacement juror, due process requires that the procedure afford the accused equ ivalent safeguards of his rights as those furnished when selecting additional jurors before the trial begins.

Defendants convictions for statutory burglary, attempted robbery, unlawful wounding, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony were proper because a motion for a mistrial was untimely when it was made after the jury had retired from the courtroom and defendant renewed his motions for mistrial after the jury had retired for deliberation. Clatterbaugh v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (Va. Ct. A pp. July 27, 2010). Motion for mistrial waived.  Defendants convictions for statutory burglary, attempted robbery, unlawful wounding, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony were proper because hi s motions for mistrial were waived for appellate purposes since defense counsel failed to move for a mistrial when the objectionable words were spoken. Clatterbaugh v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (Va. Ct. App. July 27, 2010). While defendant eventually moved for a mistrial based on the inadmissible statements at the conclusion of the officers testimony, the objectionable element ha d already been injected into the case at that time; thus, the motion for a mistrial was untimely and he waived appellate review. Grant v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 264 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 11, 2016). Manifest necessity for declaration of mistrial did not exist.  Judge did not err by dismissing the indictments based on double jeopardy grounds because whether a witness lied was an issue of credibility for the jury, as the f act finder, to resolve; and no manifest necessity existed for a mistrial as there were narrower alternatives available because there was nothing to prevent the Commonwealth from seeking to reopen its case and present the video that defendant and the witn ess had met as impeachment evidence to challenge the witnesss testimony and credibility that he did not really know defendant, or the trial court could have allowed the case, as presented, to go to the jury and, thus, allowed the jury to asse ss the credibility of the witnesss testimony. Commonwealth v. Jordan, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 169 (Va. Ct. App. June 9, 2020). Trial court abused its discretion by declaring a mistrial over defendants objection because the record was bereft of any evidence clearly reflecting that the trial court considered any less drastic alternatives and as a result, the record did not support a ruling that the mistrial was manifestly necessary at the time it was declared; Because the sua sponte mistrial during defendants first trial was grante d in error, defendant was twice placed in jeopardy when he was tried on the same indictments before a different jury during his second trial, and therefore the trial court erred by denying defendants motion to dismiss the indictments.

CASE NOTES The court may refuse to summon a jury from another county until an ineffectual effort has been made to obtain an impartial jury from the county where the trial is to take place. Rees v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 850, 127 S.E.2d 406, 1962 Va. LEXIS 228 (1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 964, 83 S. Ct. 1088, 10 L. Ed. 2d 128, 1963 U.S. LEXIS 1830 ( 1963) (decided under prior law). Trial courts decision to import venire from another county was sound decision.  Trial judges decision to avoid any possible prejudice by importing venire from another county in homicide prosecution due to extensive news coverage of previo us trial was a sound exercise of discretion for it clearly eliminated any possibility that defendant would not be tried by a fair and impartial jury. Fisher v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 447, 431 S.E.2d 886, 9 Va. Law Rep. 11376, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 171 ( 1993). Defendant was not entitled to a change of venue or venire where there was no evidence of inflammatory newspaper or radio coverage of the case, no evidence of mass prejudice, hostility or threat of mob action, either before the jury was sworn or during the course of the trial, nor unusual difficulty in securing an impartial jury. Rees v. Com monwealth, 203 Va. 850, 127 S.E.2d 406, 1962 Va. LEXIS 228 (1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 964, 83 S. Ct. 1088, 10 L. Ed. 2d 128, 1963 U.S. LEXIS 1830 (1963) (decided under prior law). Refusal to exclude veniremen who read newspaper article not error.  Trial court did not err in refusing to exclude all of the veniremen who had read a news article about defendant, published two days before her trial for manslaugh ter, where defendant failed to show that the publicity created a widespread feeling of prejudice within the community that was reasonably certain to prevent a fair and impartial trial. Wilmoth v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 169, 390 S.E.2d 514, 6 Va. Law R ep. 1854, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 55 (1990). Br evity of jurys deliberations held not to show prejudice.  Defendants contention that prejudice on the part of the jury was proved by the fact they deliberated only a relatively short time was without merit.

Whenever an y person is or may be exposed to multiple liability through the existence of claims by others to the same property or fund held by him or on his behalf, such person may file a pleading and require such parties to interplead their claims. It is not ground for objection to the joinder that the claims of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do not have a common origin or are not identical but are adverse to and independent of one another, or that the plaintiff avers that he is n ot liable in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants. A defendant in an action who is exposed to similar liability may likewise obtain such interpleader. The provisions of this rule supplement and do not in any way limit the joinder of parties pe rmitted in § 8.01-5. B. The remedy herein provided is in addition to and in no way supersedes or limits the remedy provided by any other section of this Code. C. In any acti on of interpleader, the court may enter its order restraining all claimants from instituting or prosecuting any proceeding in any court of the Commonwealth affecting the property involved in the interpleader action until further order of the court.Such c ourt shall hear and determine the case and may discharge the appropriate party from further liability, make the injunction permanent, and make all appropriate orders to enforce its judgment. D. A person in terpleading may voluntarily pay or tender into court the property claimed, or may be ordered to do so by the court; and the court may thereupon order such party discharged from all or part of any liability as between the claimants of such property. History History. Code 1950, § 8-226; 1977, c. 617; 1978, c. 415. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-364 is a new section in Title 8.01 and replaces former § 8-226. The purpose of the statute is to provide Virginia with a comprehensive modern stat utory method of interpleader comparable to those which exist in most other jurisdictions, including the federal system. Despite the expression of apprehension to the contrary by some critics when the section was being considered, it is not intended to authorize the bringing of  class actions. Neither its content nor its structure is adaptable to such actions. Like most modern interpleader statutes, § 8.01-364 is patterned in large part upon 28 U.S.C. § 1335 and FRCP 22. While the statute does not expressly supers ede the traditional equity suit for interpleader it is believed that in practice the equity procedure will be displaced because of the greater availability, simplicity, and completeness of remedy which the statute affords. Cf. Bell Storage Company v. Har rison, 164 Va. 278, 180 S.E. 320 (1935). It is to be noted that the statute expressly provides in subsection B The remedy herein provided is in addition to and in no way supersedes or limits the reme dy provided by any other section of this Code . (Emphasis added.) This provision is significant becau se of the statutory interpleader procedure provided for in the Uniform Commercial Code (§ 8.7-603) for the benefit of bailees as defined in Article 7 of the U.C.C. and which is applicable principally to warehousemen and carriers. The fact that a rule of the Supreme Court of Virginia has been added to Part Two of the Rules, designed to implement § 8.01-364, should not be interpreted as a dding to the statute the restrictions of the traditional equity suit for interpleader which the statute itself does not require.

CASE NOTES This section does not enlarge the rules governing bills of interpleader nor limit or aff ect equitable jurisdiction by suit. This section merely furnishes another special, cumulative and concurrent remedy. Runkle v. Runkle, 112 Va. 788, 72 S.E. 695, 1911 Va. LEXIS 151 (1911) (decided under prior law). It does not apply where defendant has guaranteed payment to plaintiff.  Where defendants, for whom a building was being erected, agreed with plaintiff, who furnished supplies to a contractor, to retain sufficient funds and pay plainti ff for the materials furnished, defendants were not mere stakeholders of the fund because they guaranteed the debt to plaintiff, and hence were not entitled to have plaintiff and the mechanics lienors interpleaded and required to litigate their respe ctive claims. Nicholas v. Harrisonburg Bldg. &amp; Supply Co., 181 Va. 207, 24 S.E.2d 452, 1943 Va. LEXIS 169 (1943) (decided under prior law). Answer held not interpleader.  See Rinehart &amp; Dennis Co. v. McArthur, 123 Va. 556, 96 S.E. 829, 1918 Va. LEXIS 53 (1918) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Voluntary payment doctrine.  Virginias voluntary payment doctrine barred a borrowers claims for declaratory judgment and judgment for excessive fees because the borrower listed her to wnhouse for sale of her own accord, after falling into default on the promissory note, the borrower paid the full sum of attorneys fees after consultation with counsel, did not face an immediate foreclosure on the house, and had adequate time to cont est the fees in court, which would not have delayed settlement or impaired title to the house, moreover, if the borrower truly claimed entitlement to a portion of the attorneys fees, she should have made her claim known to the title company, which wo uld have then been obliged to file its own interpleader action. Boyer v. Cambra, 98 Va. Cir. 235, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 40 (Fairfax County Mar. 15, 2018). Interpleading of funds allowed by court.  Defendant doctors motion for interpleader of a settlement check executed by their insurer, which was in receivership, was granted because the doctors were exp osed to multiple liabilities: plaintiff malpractice claimant, her current and former attorney, and the insurers receiver all claimed that they were entitled to the settlement proceeds. Jones v. Caldwell, 61 Va. Cir. 408, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 220 (Winc hester Mar. 31, 2003). In an insurers interpleader action, seeking an order requiring it to pay the policy limits into the clerk of court pending the determination of the rights of an insureds wife and the personal representatives of the insureds niece and mother-in-law, the insurer was ordered to pay its $50,000 in policy limits into court because the insurer and the nieces representative consented to the order, and § 8.01-364 authorized such an order. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Eusufzai, 75 Va. Cir. 1, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2008). Interpleading of funds not a llowed by court.  Trial court denied interpleader plaintiffs motion to interplead funds, pursuant to § 8.01-364, arising from a terminated construction contract dispute, whe re the amount sought to be tendered to the court was still subject to judicial determination and was not a set fund; additionally, the court noted that allowing such a motion and filing of funds would limit the remedy available to all defendants under th e mechanics lien statutes, § 43-1 et seq. Goel v. Osage Contr., Inc., 62 Va. Cir. 335, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 99 (Fairfax County July 22, 2003). Litiga tion stayed pending interpleader determination.  In an insurers interpleader action, seeking an order requiring it to pay the policy limits into the clerk of court pending the determination of the rights of an insureds wife and the personal representatives of the insureds niece and mother-in-law and to restrain them from prosecuting any proceedings, all litigation in the Commonwealth affecting the policy limits was stayed under subsection C of § 8.01-364 pending determination of the interpleader because there were other claimants who could have greater entitlement to the insurers funds, and the insurer filed an interpleader action. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Eusufzai, 75 Va. Cir. 1, 2 008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2008). Discharge denied.  In an insurers interpleader action, seeking an order requiring it to pay the policy limits into the clerk of court pending the determination of the rights of an insureds wife and the personal representatives of the insureds niece and mother-in-law, neither the insurer nor the wife could be discharged from further liability under subsection C of § 8.01-364 because the parties had not addressed the i ssue of whether the insurers duty to defend would terminate upon exhaustion of its policy limits; the parties also had not addressed the issue of whether the insureds estate was in possession of any funds above and beyond the policy limits. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Eusufzai, 75 Va. Cir. 1, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2008). Attorney fees and costs awarded.  The court acted within its discretion in awarding attorney fees and costs to the bank, because the bank acted in good faith and showed a willingness throughout th e proceedings to submit the disputed funds to the court so that the court could determine the rightful owner of those funds.

The term this section, as used below, may refer to former provisi ons. Section is substitute for replevin.  The statutory proceeding by interpleader in Virginia is a substitute for the common-law writ of replevin. Kiser v. Hensley, 123 Va. 536, 96 S.E. 777, 1918 Va. LEX IS 50 (1918) (see Allen v. Hart, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 722 (1868)). This section and § 8.01-370 are remedial and are to be liberally construed, and are n ot to be construed in such manner as to make them unconstitutional if it can be avoided. Sauls v. Thomas Andrews &amp; Co., 163 Va. 407, 175 S.E. 760, 1934 Va. LEXIS 193 (1934). A motion to quash under § 8.01-477 may not be used by strangers to the underlying judgment as a substitute for the statutory method prescribed in this section or in lieu of a common law action of trespass. The application of § 8.01-477 is limited to attacks on the regularity and validity of a writ of fieri facias. Barbuto v. Southern Bank, 231 Va. 63, 340 S.E.2d 813, 1986 Va. LEXIS 164 (1986). Third parties who claimed ownership of certain property levied upon improperly sought to prosecute a common law action of trespass and to simultaneously claim own ership of the property seized in the levy. This was an improper use of the statutory motion to quash. Their remedy was under this section, a statute specifically providing strangers to the underlying judgment a swift, direct, and summary method to determ ine conflicting ownership of property seized in a levy. Barbuto v. Southern Bank, 231 Va. 63, 340 S.E.2d 813, 1986 Va. LEXIS 164 (1986). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Bond requirement.  Trial court found that in a garnishment case, where the prospective intervenor filed a motion to intervene to obtain the funds that the bank had tendered to the c ourt from the judgment debtors account, after the judgment creditor had served a garnishment against the bank and the prospective intervenor claimed that the funds did not belong to the judgment debtor but belonged to the prospective intervenor, the prospective intervenor was required to post a suspending bond in order to intervene; none of the statutes relevant or possibly relevant to the garnishment action made the posting of such a bond a prerequisite to filing a proceeding in court claiming owne rship of money subject to a garnishment and the judgment creditor could not show that it would be prejudiced by the prospective intervenors failure to post one.

If any offi cer levies or is required to levy a fieri facias, an attachment, or a warrant of distress on property, and the officer doubts whether such property is liable to such levy, he may give the plaintiff, his agent or attorney-at-law, notice that an indemnifyi ng bond is required in the case; bond may thereupon be given by any person, with good security, payable to the officer in a penalty equal to the value of the property in the case of a fieri facias or a warrant of distress on property and equal to double the value of the property in case of an attachment, with condition to indemnify him against all damage which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of such property and to pay to any claimant of such property all damage which he may sustain in consequence of such seizure or sale, and also to warrant and defend to any purchaser of the property such estate or interest therein as is sold. If the officer has performed more than one levy for a single plaintiff, the officer may permit the plaint iff to give a single indemnifying bond for such levies, provided that any such bond shall be in a penalty amount not less than the aggregate sum of the penalty amounts of the bonds required had the levies been bonded individually.Provided, however, that when the property claimed to be liable by virtue of the process aforesaid is in the possession of any of the parties against whom such process was issued but is claimed by any other person or is claimed to belong to any other person, the officer having s uch process in his hands to be executed shall proceed to execute the same notwithstanding such claim unless the claimant of the property or someone for him shall give a suspending bond as provided by § 8.01-370 and shall within 30 days after such bond is given proceed to have the title to the property settled in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. And in case such claimant or someone for him fails to give such suspending bond, or having given such bond fails to have such proceedings insti tuted to settle the title thereto, the claimant shall be barred from asserting such claim to the property and the officer shall proceed to execute the process, and the officer who executes such process shall not be liable to any such claimant for any dam ages resulting from the proper execution of such process as is required by this section. If an indemnifying bond is not given within a reasonable time after such notice, the officer may refuse to levy on such property, or may restore it to the person fro m whose possession it was taken. If such bond is given, the officer shall proceed to levy (i) if he has not already done so, or (ii) if necessary to restore a levy previously released. B. The Commonw ealth shall not be required to give an indemnifying bond under the provisions of this section. History History.

The provision in the former section that the property shall be conclusively presumed to be the property of t he party in possession if the indemnifying bond has not been given, has been removed. But the officer is absolved of liability to the adverse claimant failing to give the bond. The 2005 amendments.

One indemnifying bond may be taken on several executions. Davis v. Davis, 43 Va. (2 Gratt .) 363, 1845 Va. LEXIS 56 (1845). And it is not necessary to set out the executions in the bond. Davis v. Davis, 43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 363, 1845 Va. LEXIS 56 (1845). Omission of provision for protection of purchaser does not invalidate bond.  A bond under this section may be sufficient for the protection of the sheriff from the action of the claimant of the property, although it does not contain a prov ision for the protection of the purchaser of the property. Aylett v. Roane, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 282, 1844 Va. LEXIS 32 (1844). Bond executed by one partner in partnership name is sufficient.  Where the plaintiffs in the execution are a firm, a bond executed by one of the firm, in the partnership name, is a good bond of the person so executing it, and t he recital in the bond of the names of the plaintiffs in the execution by their partnership name is sufficient. Davis v. Davis, 43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 363, 1845 Va. LEXIS 56 (1845). This section does not preclude injunction to prevent sale.  A sheriff having doubts as to the title to property taken in execution may demand from the creditor an indemnifying bond, yet this remedy is not in exclusion of a bill of injunction to prevent the sale. Wilson v. Butler, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 559, 1813 Va. LEXIS 12 (1813). But the sheriff, having received the bond of indemnity, is bound to sell the property ta ken in execution, whether it belongs to the debtor or not. Stone v. Pointer, 19 Va. (5 Munf) 287, 1816 Va. LEXIS 47 (1816). And he is liable if he releases property instead of requiring bond.  Where an officer released property as to which the debtor wrongfully claimed the benefit of the homestead exemption without demanding an indemnifying bond of the creditor, or even notifying him of the claim of homestead, and the property was subsequently lost to the creditor, the sheriff and his sureties were liable to the creditor for the resulting damages. Sage v. Dickinson, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 1, 74 Va. (33 Gra tt.) 361, 1880 Va. LEXIS 18 (1880). But he i s excused if creditor fails to give bond on demand.  A deputy was excusable for not levying and selling under the circumstances, where after the one who had issued the fieri facias had failed to give the indemnifyin g bond demanded of him; and, therefore the creditor could not recover against the sheriff and his sureties, on his official bond, the debt thus lost by the failure to levy. Huffman v. Leffell, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 41, 1879 Va. LEXIS 45 (1879). Remedy to prevent levy and stop sale.  A third party who claims ownership of property that has been levied on, or is about to be levied on, has an orderly remedy under this section and § 8.01-370 no t only to stop the sale after levy but to prevent the levy from being made in the first place. This is accomplished by giving a suspending bond and by proceeding within 30 days to have title to the property settled. Alternatively, the third party has the option to file an action for common law trespass in a separate proceeding. Barbuto v. Southern Bank, 231 Va. 63, 340 S.E.2d 813, 1986 Va. LEXIS 164 (1986). Action must be brought in the name of the officer.  An action on an indemnifying bond given to a sheriff for sale of property taken in execution must be brought in the name of the sheriff, but it can only be mainta ined at the relation of the party injured. But though the party injured is not named as relator in the declaration or other pleadings, yet if the breach assigned is that the obligors did not pay the damages sustained by B. by reason of the sale, and if a special verdict in the cause shows that B. was considered the real plaintiff, this is enough to show that B. is the relator; or supposing the pleadings defective in this particular, the defect is cured after verdict by the statute of jeofails. Lewis v. Adams, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 320, 1835 Va. LEXIS 35 (1835). By holder of legal title to property.  An indemnifying bond given to a sheriff, under this section, can only be put in suit at the relation of the person having the legal title to the property taken in execution and sold by the sheriff, not at the relation of any person having an equitable right therein. Garland v. Jacobs, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 651, 1830 Va. LEXIS 56 (1830). Recovery is value of goods not retur ned.  Recovery on a replevin bond, when part of the goods only are returned, is the value of the goods not so returned. Kiser v. Hensley, 123 Va. 536, 96 S.E. 777, 1918 Va. LEXIS 50 (1918). Or value of claimants interest therein.  In an action on an indemnifying bond, the relator claims title to the property sold, under a sale made by one partner without the knowledge or consent of the othe r, of partnership property. The relator may recover for the undivided interest of the partner who made the sale, under a general allegation in the declaration of his ownership of the property. Forkner v. Stuart, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 197, 1849 Va. LEXIS 37 ( 1849). And evidence is admissible to show claimant is only life tenant.  In debt on an indemnifying bond given to a sheriff for seizure and sale of a slave under execution, it is competent to the defendants to prove, that the claimant had only a life estate in the slave, though it appear that he had bona fide purchased of the tenant for life an absolute estate. Stevens v. Bransford, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 246, 1835 Va. LEXIS 29 (1835). Plea of bond need not set out judgment.  In an action against a constable, for taking the property of the plaintiff, upon three executions against a third person, the constable filed a special plea, in w hich he set up an indemnifying bond executed by the plaintiffs in the executions. It was held that it is not necessary to set out the judgments in the plea. Davis v. Davis, 43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 363, 1845 Va. LEXIS 56 (1845).

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Officer has discharged his duty in taking indemnifying bond.  By his act in giving an indemnifying bond under this section, the creditor agrees to save the officer harmless from the claims of any third party, and when the of ficer takes from an execution creditor the proper indemnifying bond with ample security and then proceeds to sell and pay the money received to the execution creditor, he has discharged his duties to all parties. Wheeler v. City Sav. &amp; Loan Corp., 156 Va . 402, 157 S.E. 726, 1931 Va. LEXIS 199 (1931). If bond conforms to § 8.01-367.  The constable, sheriff, or other officer who sells property taken under execution is not protected from an action of trespass by the claimant, unless the indemnif ying bond taken by him under § 8.01-367 conforms in all respects to that section, and particularly contains the clause inserted for the benefit of the person claiming title to the property. MClunn v. Steel, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 256 (1821). And obligors thereon are solvent.  If the claimant should bring his action against the officer, it will not be sufficient for him to show that he has established his claim to the property in the ac tion on the indemnifying bond; he must go further, and show that the officer failed in his official duty, in not taking a solvent bond. Stevens v. Bransford, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 246, 1835 Va. LEXIS 29 (1835). Claimants sole r emedy is against such obligors.  Claimant was barred by this section from pursuing the property in the possession of a purchaser at an execution sale, and his remedy was not against the officer a nd his surety but against the obligors on the indemnifying bond.

If the property claimed to be liable by virtue of such process is in the possession of any of the parties against whom such process was issued, but is claimed by any other person, or is claimed t o belong to any other person, the officer having such process in his hands to be executed shall, whether an indemnifying bond has been given or not, after notice to the claimant, or his agent, proceed to execute the same notwithstanding such claim, unles s the claimant of such property or someone for him shall give the suspending bond aforesaid, and shall within thirty days after such bond is given proceed to have the title to such property settled in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, may refer to former provisi ons. Remedy to prevent levy and stop sale.  A third party who claims ownership of property that has been levied on, or is about to be levied on, has an orderly remedy under § 8.01-367 and this section no t only to stop the sale after levy but to prevent the levy from being made in the first place. This is accomplished by giving a suspending bond and by proceeding within 30 days to have title to the property settled. Alternatively, the third party has the option to file an action for common law trespass in a separate proceeding. Barbuto v. Southern Bank, 231 Va. 63, 340 S.E.2d 813, 1986 Va. LEXIS 164 (1986). Claimant must gi ve bond and institute proceedings.  Where an execution is levied on property in the possession of the execution debtor, and the property is claimed by another, it is necessary, under the provisions of this section, not only for the claimant to execute a suspending bond, but also, within 30 days after the execution of such bond, to institute proceedings to settle the title to the property so levied on, else it will be conclusively presumed to be the property of the party in possession. Fields-Watkins Co. v. Hensley, 117 Va. 661, 86 S.E. 113, 1915 Va. LEXIS 82 (1915). Fa ilure to do so within 30 days establishes validity of levy.  Where the sole defense in distress proceedings was that the property levied upon was not that of the defendant therein, but no suspending bond had been given and no effort made to have title settled until more than 30 days had elapsed from the date of service of notice under this section or the time required to give the suspending bond, this section established the conclusive presumption that the property in ques tion was the property of the party in possession, and concluded the question of ownership and established the validity of the levy. Boswell v. Lipscomb, 172 Va. 33, 200 S.E. 756, 1939 Va. LEXIS 218 (1939). And claimant then holds prop erty at his risk.  Where claimant failed to institute his interpleader proceedings within 30 days from the date of the suspending bond, it was held that from the expiration of the p eriod of 30 days, the possession of the property by the claimant was unlawful, and hence at his risk. Kiser v. Hensley, 123 Va. 536, 96 S.E. 777, 1918 Va. LEXIS 50 (1918). When bond was given and proceedings instituted is question for court.  When the suspending bond was given and when the proceedings were instituted are questions to be determined by the court as they appear on the record, and it is er ror to refer them to the jury. Fields-Watkins Co. v. Hensley, 117 Va. 661, 86 S.E. 113, 1915 Va. LEXIS 82 (1915).

Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms the statute and this section, as used below, ma y refer to former provisions. To be good as statutory bonds, bonds must substantially conform to the statutes authoriz ing their execution. Under this section, a bond payable to the sheriff and not to the creditor, which does not recite the amount due upon the execution, including the fee for taking the bond, commissions and other charges, and conditioned that the claima nt shall have property forthcoming and subject to the order of the court, instead of forthcoming at such time and place of sale as may be thereafter lawfully appointed, as required by the statute, is not good as a statutory forthcoming bond. Kiser v. Hen sley, 123 Va. 536, 96 S.E. 777, 1918 Va. LEXIS 50 (1918). But bond not good under this section may be construed as at common law.  It is proper to construe a bond not valid as a statutory forthcoming bond under this section, but good as a common-law bond, as it would have been construed at co mmon law, if it had been a replevin bond, or a redelivery bond, in an action of replevin. Kiser v. Hensley, 123 Va. 536, 96 S.E. 777, 1918 Va. LEXIS 50 (1918). Measure of r ecovery on such bonds is value of property.  The measure of recovery on a bond given by a claimant to sheriff for property levied on under an execution, which bond was not valid as a statutory forthcoming bo nd under this section, but was good as a common-law bond, for failure to produce for sale the property levied on, was not the execution debts, principal, interest, costs and commissions, but the value of the property levied upon, and it may be doubted wh ether, even if the bond had conformed strictly to the statute, the measure would have been different. If the value of the property levied on had exceeded the amount of the execution, the measure of recovery would have been the amount of the execution, in terest, costs, etc. Kiser v. Hensley, 123 Va. 536, 96 S.E. 777, 1918 Va. LEXIS 50 (1918). If a sheriff improperly refuses to receive a forthcoming bond he is responsible for damages to those who may be injured. Hamilton v.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Sufficient compliance when bill and answer admit destruction.  It is a sufficient compliance with this section where a sworn bill alleges and an answer admits the destruction of the original papers in a cause where there was a decree for sale of certain lands, and there is filed a certified copy of the papers from the Supreme Court, where the cause was on appeal. An injunction will not lie to such sale on the ground that no affidavit of the destruction was filed. Hud son v. Yost, 88 Va. 347, 13 S.E. 436, 1891 Va. LEXIS 40 (1891). Reinstatement of cause.  Where the records in a cause which was on the docket of the circuit court at its last session before the Civil War were destroyed, it not appearing that the cause had been legally removed, it was no error to reinstate it on proper motion. Dismal Swamp Land Co. v. McCauley, 85 Va. 16, 6 S.E. 697, 1888 Va. LEXIS 3 (1888). § 8.01-374.1. Consolidation or bifurcation of issues or claims in certain cases; appeal. Text A. In any circ uit court in which there are pending more than forty civil actions against manufacturers or suppliers of asbestos or products for industrial use that contain asbestos in which recovery is sought for personal injury or wrongful death alleged to have been caused by exposure to asbestos or products for industrial use that contain asbestos, the court may order a joint hearing or trial by jury of any or all common questions of law or fact which are at issue in those actions. The court may order any or all t he actions consolidated, unless the court finds consolidation would adversely affect the rights of the parties to a fair trial. The court may submit special interrogatories to the jury to resolve specific issues of fact, and may make such orders concerni ng proceedings therein consistent with the right of each of the parties to a fair trial as may be appropriate to avoid unnecessary costs, duplicative litigation or delay. B. To further convenience or avoid prejudice in such consolidated hearings, when separate or bifurcated trials will be conducive to judicial economy, the court may order a separate or bifurcated trial of any claim, or any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or separate issues, always preserving the right of trial by jury. However, in any such bifurcated proceeding, the entitlement of an individual plaintiff to an award of punitive damages against any defendant shall not be determined un less compensatory damages have been awarded to that individual. C. Any order e ntered pursuant to this section shall, for purposes of appeal, be an interlocutory order. Any findings of the court or jury in any bifurcated trial shall not be appealable until a final order adjudicating all issues on a specific claim or consolidated g roup of claims has been entered. D. This sectio n shall not apply to actions arising under Article 6 (§ 8.01-57 et seq.) of Chapter 3 of this title or the Federal Employers Liability Act (45 U.S.C. § 51 et seq.). In addition, this section shall not apply to any party defendant unless that defend ant was a manufacturer of, or a supplier of, asbestos or products for industrial use that contain asbestos, at any of the times alleged in the motion for judgment.

CASE NOTES The purpose of this section is to discourage and expose fabrication and collusion by wit nesses and to minimize the likelihood that witnesses will alter their testimony so that such testimony is consistent with testimony provided by other witnesses. Motley v. Tarmac Am., Inc., 258 Va. 98, 516 S.E.2d 7, 1999 Va. LEXIS 86 (1999). Testimony of witness violating order directing his exclusion.  There is nothing in the language of this section to support the argument of counsel for the defendant that the presence of a witness in the courtroom, in disobedi ence of the order of exclusion, disqualifies such witness from testifying. On the contrary, it is generally held that it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to permit the testimony of a witness who has violated an order directing his exclus ion from the courtroom. Brickhouse v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 533, 159 S.E.2d 611, 1968 Va. LEXIS 145 (1968) (decided under former § 8-211.1). Review of transcripts of another witness.  Doctors review of transcripts of another witness did not automatically disqualify the doctor as a witness, because all the questions posed to the doctor regar ding the other witnesss testimony could have been asked in the form of a hypothetical question. Hey v. Arlington County Dep't of Human Servs., 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 572 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2008). Section gave an accused an absolute right to have all witnesses excluded from the courtr oom during his trial. Martin v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 847, 234 S.E.2d 62, 1977 Va. LEXIS 246 (1977) (decided under former § 8-211.1). While a defendants right to exclusion under former § 8-211.1 before its amendment in 1975 was qualified, i.e., it extended only to those witnesses whose pr esence at trial was not necessary, the amendment, which deleted the words whose presence is not necessary to the proceedings following witness, removed that qualification and made a defendants right absolute. In its amended form, form er § 8-211.1 permitted no rational construction but that upon the motion of any party a trial court shall exclude every witness during the trial of every case, civil or criminal. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 682, 23 2 S.E.2d 741, 1977 Va. LEXIS 222 (1977) (decided under prior law). Exception for agent of corporation.  Former employee, whose negligent acts and omissions were at issue in litigation, was not an agent of the defendant within the intent of this section because he wa s neither employed by the defendant at the time of trial, nor did he have any other relationship with the defendant at that time. Thus, former employee should not have been allowed to remain in the courtroom to observe the testimony of other witnesses. M otley v. Tarmac Am., Inc., 258 Va. 98, 516 S.E.2d 7, 1999 Va. LEXIS 86 (1999). No error in excluding witness.  To the extent the circuit court erred in permitting a sibling to remain in the courtroom, such error was not a sufficient reason to reverse the judgment because g iven the timing and nature of the siblings testimony, and the testimony of other witnesses before and after his testimony, his presence in the courtroom did not prevent a brother from receiving a fair trial on the merits; the focus of the sibling s testimony was a batch of e-mails, which were admitted into evidence.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. History of section.  This provision in the statute of law of the State first appeared in the Code of 1849 (chapter 162, page 629, § 10), and with the exception of the words civ il or criminal, added by the act of December 10, 1903 (Acts 1902-3-4, page 605) [and changed to civil in Acts 1977, c. 617], has remained unchanged. Noell v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 600, 115 S.E. 679, 1923 Va. LEXIS 48 (1923), overruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 425, 317 S.E.2d 482, 1984 Va. LEXIS 210 (1984) (see also Litton v. Commonwealth, 101 Va. 833, 44 S.E. 923, 1903 Va. LEXIS 95 (1903)). Scope of section.  In regard to a view of the premises by the jury, this section undertakes to occupy the whole field upon this subject. Noell v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 600, 115 S.E. 679, 1923 Va. LEXIS 48 (1923), overruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 425, 317 S.E.2d 482, 1984 Va. LEXIS 210 (1984). Object of view.  The view of the grounds at the scene of an accident which is the basis of an action may better enable the jury to apply the testimony disclosed upon the trial, bu t does not authorize them to base their verdict on such view, nor to become silent witnesses to facts which were not testified to in court. City of Norfolk v. Anthony, 117 Va. 777, 86 S.E. 68, 1915 Va. LEXIS 94 (1915); Lorillard Co. v. Clay, 127 Va. 734, 104 S.E. 384, 1920 Va. LEXIS 82 (1920). A view is not intended to supply e vidence.  It has been definitely and repeatedly said by the Supreme Court that a view is not intended to supply evidence, but only to explain and clarify it. Noell v. Commo nwealth, 135 Va. 600, 115 S.E. 679, 1923 Va. LEXIS 48 (1923), overruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 425, 317 S.E.2d 482, 1984 Va. LEXIS 210 (1984). But is a source of proof.  A view by a jury is to be considered as constituting a source of proof for or against the accused. Even in those cases in which it has been held as a general prop osition that the presence of the prisoner at a view is not essential, it is never questioned that if evidence is taken during the view in the prisoners absence, he cannot be convicted. Noell v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 600, 115 S.E. 679, 1923 Va. LEXIS 48 (1923), overruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 425, 317 S.E.2d 482, 1984 Va. LEXIS 210 (1984). Necessity of motion for view by part ies.  Under this section, a view ought not to be ordered in any case except upon the motion of one or both parties, or by consent of both parties, which would be tantam ount to a joint motion. Although it might be error to order a view over the protest of both parties, where neither party objects, their acquiescence is equivalent to consent. Noell v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 600, 115 S.E. 679, 1923 Va. LEXIS 48 (1923), ove rruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 425, 317 S.E.2d 482, 1984 Va. LEXIS 210 (1984). Right to view rests in discretio n of court.  The right to a view is not an absolute right of a litigant, but rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, subject to review under proper circumstances. B &amp; O R.R. v. Polly, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 447, 1858 Va. LEXIS 38 (1858); Litton v. Commonwealth, 101 Va. 833, 44 S.E. 923, 1903 Va. LEXIS 95 (1903); In re Cutchin, 113 Va. 452, 74 S.E. 403, 1912 Va. LEXIS 58 (1912); Lorillard Co. v. Clay, 127 Va. 734, 104 S. E. 384, 1920 Va. LEXIS 82 (1920); Noell v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 600, 115 S.E. 679, 1923 Va. LEXIS 48 (1923), overruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 425, 317 S.E.2d 482, 1984 Va. LEXIS 210 (1984). The propriety of ordering a view lies largely in the discretion of the trial court, which should only grant it when it is reasonably certain that it will be of su bstantial aid to the jury in reaching a correct verdict, and its decision refusing a view will not be reversed unless the record shows that it did appear to the trial court that such view was necessary to a just decision, and that the statutory provision for expenses in a civil case was complied with. C &amp; O Ry. v. Nickel, 157 Va. 382, 161 S.E. 248, 1931 Va. LEXIS 328 (1931); Early v. City of Norfolk, 183 Va. 659, 33 S.E.2d 177, 1945 Va. LEXIS 210 (1945). When view proper.  A court should only grant a view when it is reasonably certain that it will be of substantial aid to the jury in reaching a correct verdict. In re Cutchin, 113 Va . 452, 74 S.E. 403, 1912 Va. LEXIS 58 (1912); Abernathy v. Emporia Mfg. Co., 122 Va. 406, 95 S.E. 418, 1918 Va. LEXIS 106 (1918); Scott v. Doughty, 124 Va. 358, 97 S.E. 802, 1919 Va. LEXIS 130 (1919); Lorillard Co. v. Clay, 127 Va. 734, 104 S.E. 384, 192 0 Va. LEXIS 82 (1920). When properly refused.  A view of the premises was rightly refused where the accident happened some 18 months prior, when conditions may have been different, especially in view of the ab sence of any evidence that conditions were the same when the view was asked as when the accident happened. Lorillard Co. v. Clay, 127 Va. 734, 104 S.E. 384, 1920 Va. LEXIS 82 (1920); Noell v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 600, 115 S.E. 679, 1923 Va. LEXIS 48 (19 23), overruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 425, 317 S.E.2d 482, 1984 Va. LEXIS 210 (1984). Effect of view unauthorized by the court.  Generally a new trial will not be granted where an unauthorized view is casual, incidental, and not reasonably calculated to influence a jury in arriving at a ver dict. Crockett v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 687, 47 S.E.2d 377, 1948 Va. LEXIS 259 (1948). Where the gist of the action is the character or condition of the locus in quo, or where a better view of it will enable the jurors better to determine the credib ility of witnesses and other disputed facts, or where the mere fact of an inspection, in view of the nature of the suit, is calculated to influence the jury to the prejudice of the unsuccessful party, it will be presumed that the knowledge obtained by an unauthorized view was in fact prejudicial, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a new trial will be granted. Crockett v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 687, 47 S.E.2d 377, 1948 Va. LEXIS 259 (1948). Discretion held not abused.  There was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in permitting a view by the jury of the place on defendants premises where plaintiff slipped on an alleged ly worn stair tread. Evidence was first taken to establish that the condition of the stair was substantially the same as at the time of plaintiffs fall. Culpepper v. Neff, 204 Va. 800, 134 S.E.2d 315, 1964 Va.

Pu rpose is to prevent surprise.  The rule that the proofs must correspond with the allegation is fully recognized, but like every other rule should be reasonably applied. Its purpose is to preven t surprise. Where there is no surprise to the party invoking it, there is no good reason for enforcing the rule. Graves Constr., Inc. v. National Cellulose Corp., 226 Va. 164, 306 S.E.2d 898, 1983 Va. LEXIS 282 (1983). Party entitled to adversarys ground of complaint.  A court may not base a judgment or decree upon facts not alleged or upon a right, however meritorious, that has not been pleaded and claimed; every litigant is en titled to be told in plain and explicit language the adversarys ground of complaint. Hensley v. Dreyer, 247 Va. 25, 439 S.E.2d 372, 10 Va. Law Rep. 708, 1994 Va. LEXIS 19 (1994). In a case of variance, this section gives a trial court the discretion to apply principl e that it may not base a judgment or decree upon facts not alleged or upon a right, however meritorious, that has not been pleaded or claimed, reasonably either by permitting amendment of the pleadings (and possibly postponing the trial) or, in lieu of a mendment, by having the facts determined and rendering judgment, but only on the condition that no prejudice results; while the statute is remedial in purpose and should be liberally construed, it should not be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with i ts plain language. Hensley v. Dreyer, 247 Va. 25, 439 S.E.2d 372, 10 Va. Law Rep. 708, 1994 Va. LEXIS 19 (1994). In an action for damages by an information technology company and its sole owner against a former partner, his wife, and their new corporation, the trial court er red by allowing a breach of fiduciary duty claim to proceed on an unpled claim that the former partner breached a fiduciary duty as a partner where there was a variance between the evidence and the allegation that the breach was as an employee, not a par tner. Syed v. Zh Techs., Inc., 280 Va. 58, 694 S.E.2d 625, 2010 Va. LEXIS 73 (2010). Amendm ent properly allowed.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing an employer to amend its answer, by way of a motion made pursuant to § 8.01-377 prior to the close of the employees case-in-chief, to include a repudiation defense as the employees own testimony, offered during his case-in-chief, established facts supporting the employers repudiation defense.

Langhorne v. Richmond City Ry., 91 Va. 364, 22 S.E. 357, 1895 Va. LEXIS 33 (1895); New River Mineral Co. v. Painter, 100 Va. 507, 42 S.E. 300, 1902 Va. LEXIS 52 (1902); C &amp; O Ry. v.

Liberal construction is especially the case where the amendment will further the ends of justice and permit the controversy to be determined on its merits. McKee v. Bunting, McNeal Real Estate Co., 114 Va. 639, 77 S.E. 515, 1913 Va. LEXIS 125 (1913). Leave to amend pleadings should be liberally granted in furtherance of the ends of justice. Haymore v. Brizendine, 210 Va. 578, 172 S.E.2d 774, 1970 Va. LEXIS 166 (1970). This section expressly authorizes a court to impose conditions to the granting of leave to amend pleadings. Haymore v. Brizendine, 210 Va. 578, 172 S.E.2d 774, 1970 Va. LEXIS 166 (1970). Objection or motion to exclude proper.  In case of variance between the evidence and allegations, the usual and correct practice is to object to the evidence when offered or move to exclude it. Attentio n is thus called to the discrepancy and an opportunity afforded the trial court to meet the emergency, in a proper case, in one of the modes prescribed by this section. Portsmouth St. R.R. v. Peed's Adm'r, 102 Va. 662, 47 S.E. 850, 1904 Va. LEXIS 114 (19 04); Holdsworth v. Anderson Drug Co., 118 Va. 359, 87 S.E. 565, 1916 Va. LEXIS 16 (1916). The proper method of objecting to a variance between the allegations and proof is by motion to exclude the evidence. Southern Ry. v. Finley &amp; Seymour, 127 Va. 132 , 102 S.E. 559, 1920 Va. LEXIS 39 (1920). Where there is a variance between a contract set out in a plea, and the contract offered in evidence in support of the plea, and no motion is made to amend the pl ea, as provided by this section then the contract offered in evidence should be excluded. Richmond Standard Steel, Spike &amp; Iron Co. v. Chesapeake Coal Co., 102 Va. 417, 46 S.E. 397, 1904 Va. LEXIS 86 (1904). Objection may be waive d.  No objection having been made to the admission of evidence, and no motion made to exclude it on account of a supposed variance, the objection must be considered a s having been waived. Burruss v. Suddith, 187 Va. 473, 47 S.E.2d 546, 1948 Va. LEXIS 237 (1948). Pursuant to this section, that no objection having been made to the admissibility of evidence, or no motion to exclude it on account of the supposed variance, the objection must be considered as having been waived. Newport News &amp; O.P. Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v. McCormick, 106 Va. 517, 56 S.E. 281, 1907 Va. LEXIS 115 (1907). An objection to a variance between proof and pleadings is waived where no objection is made to the admission of evidence, and no motion is made to exclude it beca use of the supposed variance. If this rule of practice was not adhered to, it would deprive parties of their right to amend their pleadings to conform with the evidence, which is permitted in proper cases under this section. Culmore Realty Co. v. Caputi, 203 Va. 403, 124 S.E.2d 7, 1962 Va. LEXIS 159 (1962). Ef fect of failure to invoke statute.  This statute authorizes amendments upon terms fair to both parties, whenever a variance between the pleadings and the proof develops during the trial. It has alwa ys been regarded with favor, and construed with liberality by the courts. Having failed to avail himself of the remedy thus provided, or to give the opposite party or the court the opportunity to invoke it, a party cannot take advantage of an irregularit y which the statute would have cured. Chandler v. Kelley, 149 Va. 221, 141 S.E. 389, 1928 Va. LEXIS 361 (1928). The record in a consolidated action is competent evidence in a companion case for the plaintiffs.

Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, may refer to former provisi ons. Directed verdicts prohibited.  Directed verdicts were expressly prohibited by statute in Virginia prior to 1958, and are prohibited now. During the interval 1958-1986, directed verdicts were pe rmitted only where the court had sustained a motion to strike the evidence. Kesler v. Allen, 233 Va. 130, 353 S.E.2d 777, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1988, 1987 Va. LEXIS 148 (1987). Validity of statute.  The court declined to pass on the constitutionality of this section in Linkous v. Harris, 134 Va. 63, 113 S.E. 831 (1922). This section is not in conflict with § 8.01-430, declaring that if a verdict be set a side as contrary to the evidence, etc., the trial court shall render judgment, for this section is intended to prevent errors by the court in the heat of trial, while § 8.01-430 allows the court to act after deliberation. W.S. Forbes &amp; Co. v. Southern Cotton Oil Co., 130 Va. 245, 108 S.E. 15, 1921 Va. LEXIS 152 (1921). Nor does it affect § 8.01-380 as to nonsuits.  After a motion by defendant for a directed verdict, a plaintiff has no absolute right then to suffer a nonsuit. Section 8.01-380, against taking a nonsuit after t he jury retires, does not govern in view of the accepted Virginia practice under this section not to direct verdicts. Pannill v. Roanoke Times Co., 252 F. 910, 1918 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 973 (D. Va. 1918). Nor is the scintilla doctrine re instated.  This section applies only to peremptory instructions which direct what verdict the jury shall render. The statute is not to be construed as applying to cases in w hich the verdict of the jury depends necessarily and exclusively upon a question of law, nor is it to be construed as reinstating the scintilla doctrine formerly prevailing in this State but now rejected. Barksdale v. Southern Ry., 152 Va. 604, 148 S.E. 683, 1929 Va. LEXIS 195 (1929). Purpose is to prohibit application of doctrine of harmless error.  This section was passed for the express purpose of prohibiting the application of the doctrine of harmless error to the mandatory direction of verdicts. Small v. Virginia Ry. &amp; Power Co., 125 Va. 416, 99 S.E. 525, 1919 Va. LEXIS 33 (1919). Under this section even in a case where no other verdict could have been properly rendered, and the error might therefore have been regarded as harmless, yet a pe remptory instruction directing the verdict must be regarded as prejudicial and reversible error. Small v. Virginia Ry. &amp; Power Co., 125 Va. 416, 99 S.E. 525, 1919 Va. LEXIS 33 (1919). Distinction between directed verdicts and demurrers to evidence.  Obviously the laws of Virginia recognize a marked distinction between demurrer to evidence and direction of a verdict  the former is permitted; the latter is expressly prohibited. Barrett v. Virginian Ry., 250 U.S. 473, 39 S. Ct. 540, 63 L. Ed. 1092, 1919 U.S. LEXIS 1766 (1919). Methods of accomplishing same results as by directed verdict.  This section forbids the trial court to direct a verdict, but under Virginia practice it is still possible by less summary methods to accomplish the same results. A demurrer to evidence may be interposed; evidence may be stricken out; the trial court may set aside the verdict, and in a proper case give final judgment; the trial court may decline to give any instruction where the evidence would not sustain a verdi ct, and it may in substance direct a verdict by stating in an instruction a hypothetical case and telling the jury if they so believe, to find, etc. Davis v. Rodgers, 139 Va. 618, 124 S.E. 408, 1924 Va. LEXIS 137 (1924). Section does not apply to criminal cases.  In a prosecution for car breaking, the defendant asked for an instruction that, There is no evidence in this case to support the charge of car breaking. I t was held that while this section, which expressly forbids such an instruction in a civil case, does not apply to criminal cases, the practice of giving such instructions as that in question cannot be approved by the courts, although not forbidden by st atute. Myers v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 746, 111 S.E. 463, 1922 Va. LEXIS 74 (1922). Even in a criminal case it has been held that it is not the practice of the courts of this State to give instructions which amount in substance to telling the jury that the evidence is not sufficient to convict a prisoner, and such instructions should not be given. Montgomery v. Commonwealth, 98 Va. 852, 37 S.E. 1, 1900 Va. LEXIS 114 (1900); Mazer v. Commonwealth, 142 Va. 649, 128 S.E. 514, 1925 Va. LEXIS 369 (1925), limited, Parsons v. Commonwealth, 154 Va. 832, 152 S.E. 547, 1930 Va. LEXIS 249 (1930) (see Small v. Virginia Ry. &amp; Power Co., 125 Va. 416, 99 S.E. 525 (1919)). Spirit of section to be observed.  An instruction is objectionable which violates the spirit, if not the letter, of this statute against directing verdicts. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Simmons, 127 Va. 419 , 103 S.E. 609, 1920 Va. LEXIS 61 (1920) (see also Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Hardy, 152 Va. 783, 148 S.E. 839 (1929)). Statement tantamount to direction of verdict.  A statement by the court, Yes, as I have already told you, you cannot recover a verdict against the defendant, taking place as it did in the presence of t he jury, was tantamount to a direction by the court of a verdict for the defendant. Small v. Virginia Ry. &amp; Power Co., 125 Va. 416, 99 S.E. 525, 1919 Va. LEXIS 33 (1919). Direct ing verdict on probate of will within prohibition.  A soldier wrote his aunt that his war risk insurance was made payable to his mother, but that his mother in case of his death was to give his aunt half of it. Thi s letter was admitted to probate as the soldiers will. On appeal by the mother from the order of probate, the circuit court instructed the jury to find against the proposed will, because the letter designated no beneficiary under the war risk insuran ce act and under that act the aunt could not be named as beneficiary. It was held that this was error as the jury were not concerned with what, if anything, passed by the will, and the instruction was directly within the prohibition of this section. Reev es v. White, 136 Va. 443, 118 S.E. 103, 1923 Va. LEXIS 96 (1923). To what instructions applied.  This section is not to be construed as applying to cases in which the verdict of the jury depends necessarily and exclusively upon a question of law, such as the legal effect of a deed or contract. An instruction, therefore, which merely contained the construction of a written contract by the trial judge is not per se in violation of this section, although directing a verdict for one of the parties. Small v. Virg inia Ry. &amp; Power Co., 125 Va. 416, 99 S.E. 525, 1919 Va. LEXIS 33 (1919); Realty Co. v. Burcum, 129 Va. 466, 106 S.E. 375, 1921 Va. LEXIS 110 (1921); Harrison v. Gardner Inv.

Striking out evidence does not violate section.  Where the court simply strikes out the evidence offered by a party because no verdict could be properly rendered thereon sustaining the contention of the party it does not direct the verdict in violation of this section. Barksdale v. Southern Ry., 152 Va. 604, 148 S.E. 683, 1929 Va. LEXIS 195 (1929). Directed verdict improper where no motion to strike had been granted.  An instruction directing the jury what verdict to return was contrary to the prohibition contained in this section where no motion to strike had first been grante d.

CASE NOTES Itemization on non-economic damages proper in closing argument.  In a personal injury suit, allowing a motorist, in closing argument, to argue itemized amounts of non-economic damages to a jury did not violate § 8.01-379.1 b ecause: (1) the statute did not state, when addressing the jury about the total amount sought, a plaintiff could only do so in terms of one lump sum; and (2) a court could not add such language to the statute. Wakole v. Barber, 283 Va. 488, 722 S.E.2d 23 8, 2012 Va. LEXIS 37 (2012). Counsel cannot request damages in excess of amount alleged in ad damnum clause.  Circuit court erred in allowing the malpractice plaintiffs counsel to request $10 million in damages from the jury in both his opening statement and closing a rgument because, as pled in his legal malpractice complaint, the malpractice plaintiffs ad damnum clause alleged $6 million in damages. Smith v. McLaughlin, 289 Va. 241, 769 S.E.2d 7, 2015 Va. LEXIS 23 (2015). § 8.01-379.2. Jury instructions.

CASE NOTES Proffered instructions.  Where a drivers proffered jury instructions were confusing, not a correct statement of the law, and/or not supported by the evidence, the instructions were pr operly refused; as a result, the drivers motions to set aside the verdict or for a new trial were also properly denied. Honsinger v. Egan, 266 Va. 269, 585 S.E.2d 597, 2003 Va. LEXIS 91 (2003). § 8.01-379.2:1. Spoliation of evidence. Text A. A party or potential litigant has a duty to preserve evidence that may be relevant to reasonably foreseeable litigation. In determining whether and at what point such a duty to preserve arose, the court shall include in its consideration the totality of the circums tances, including the extent to which the party or potential litigant was on notice that specific and identifiable litigation was likely and that the evidence would be relevant. B. If evidence that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, or is otherwise disposed of, altered, concealed, destroyed, or not preserved, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court (i) upon finding prejudice to another party from such loss, disposal, alteration, concealment, or destruction of the evidence, may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice, or (ii) only upon finding that the party acted recklessly or with the intent to deprive another party of the evidences use in the litigation, may (a) presume that the evidence was unfavorable to the party, (b) instruct the jury that it may or shall presume that the evidence was unfavorable to the party, or (c) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment. C. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as creating an independent cause of action for negligent or intentional spoliation of evidence. History History. 2019, c. 732.

Hawkins, 294 Va. 544, 808 S.E.2d 384, 2017 Va. LEXIS 197 (2017). § 8.01-379.3. General verdict accompanied by answer to interrogatories. Text Except in actions for negligence resulting in injury to person or death by wrongful act, in civil actions when the court determines that the complexity of the issues wa rrant, the court may submit to the jury, together with appropriate forms for a general verdict, written interrogatories upon one or more issues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict. In actions for negligence resulting in injury to pers on or death by wrongful act, the court shall submit to the jury a general verdict form only, provided that the court may submit interrogatories to the jury if otherwise specifically authorized by law, if under substantive law governing the case comparati ve negligence applies, or if all parties to the action agree that interrogatories may be submitted to the jury. The court shall give such explanation or instruction as may be necessary to enable the jury both to make answers to the interrogatories and to render a general verdict, and the court shall direct the jury both to make written answers and to render a general verdict. When the general verdict and the answers are consistent, the appropriate judgment upon the verdict and answers shall be entered b y the court. When the answers are consistent with each other but one or more is inconsistent with the general verdict, or when the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment shall not be entered and the court shall either order the jury to further consider its answers and verdict or order a new trial.

A party sha ll not be allowed to suffer a nonsuit as to any cause of action or claim, or any other party to the proceeding, unless he does so before a motion to strike the evidence has been sustained or before the jury retires from the bar or before the action has b een submitted to the court for decision. After a nonsuit no new proceeding on the same cause of action or against the same party shall be had in any court other than that in which the nonsuit was taken, unless that court is without jurisdiction, or not a proper venue, or other good cause is shown for proceeding in another court, or when such new proceeding is instituted in a federal court. If after a nonsuit an improper venue is chosen, the court shall not dismiss the matter but shall transfer it to the proper venue upon motion of any party. B. Only one no nsuit may be taken to a cause of action or against the same party to the proceeding, as a matter of right, although the court may allow additional nonsuits upon reasonable notice to counsel of record for all defendants and upon a reasonable attempt to no tify any party not represented by counsel, or counsel may stipulate to additional nonsuits. The court, in the event additional nonsuits are allowed, may assess costs and reasonable attorney fees against the nonsuiting party. When suffering a nonsuit, a p arty shall inform the court if the cause of action has been previously nonsuited. Any order effecting a subsequent nonsuit shall reflect all prior nonsuits and shall include language that reflects the date of any previous nonsuit together with the court in which any previous nonsuit was taken. C. If notice t o take a nonsuit of right is given to the opposing party within seven days of trial or during trial, the court in its discretion may assess against the nonsuiting party reasonable witness fees and travel costs of expert witnesses scheduled to appear at t rial, which are actually incurred by the opposing party, solely by reason of the failure to give notice at least seven days prior to trial. The court shall have the authority to determine the reasonableness of expert witness fees and travel costs. Invoic es, receipts, or confirmation of payment shall be admissible to prove reasonableness without the need to offer testimony to support the authenticity or reasonableness of such documents, and may, in the courts discretion, satisfy the reasonableness re quirement under this subsection. Nothing herein shall preclude any party from offering additional evidence or testimony to support or rebut the reasonableness requirement. D. A party sha ll not be allowed to nonsuit a cause of action, without the consent of the adverse party who has filed a counterclaim, cross claim or third-party claim which arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the claim of the party desiring to nonsuit u nless the counterclaim, cross claim or third-party claim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court. E. A voluntary nonsuit taken pursuant to this section is subject to the tolling provisions of subdivision E 3 of § 8.01-229. F. Upon the ti mely perfection of an appeal from a judgment of a general district court, pursuant to § 16.1-106, a party may suffer a nonsuit as otherwise set forth in this section, and such nonsuit shall annul the judgment of the general district court.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-380: (1) adopts the provisions of former § 8-220 but (2) restricts the number of nonsuits which may be taken in an action by a party as a matter o f right, and (3) expands the final sentence of former § 8-244. Subsection A adds to the language of former § 8-220 the phrase as to any cause of action or any other party to the proceeding. Subsection B adds severa l provisions to the former section. First, a party is restricted to one nonsuit as a matter of right. After taking the first nonsuit, a party can, with leave of court, or upon stipulation of the other party, be allowed additional nonsuits. The court, in permitting the additional nonsuit, may impose costs and reasonable attorneys fees upon the nonsuiting party. Similarly, a party agreeing to an additional nonsuit may stipulate upon what conditions he will permit the nonsuit. Subsection C is former § 8-244 expanded to cover cross-claims and third-party claims. Additionally, even if the adverse party who has filed such a claim does n ot consent to the nonsuit, a nonsuit may be taken if such claim can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court.

Application of section .  The venue restriction of this section applies only to causes filed and nonsuited in Virginia. Clark v. Clark, 11 Va. App. 286, 398 S.E.2d 82, 7 Va. Law Rep. 938, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (1990). A statutory plea filed pursuant to this section, successor to former § 8-241, is not a counterclaim as that term is used in subsection C of this section, succe ssor to former § 8-244. Therefore, the conditions attaching to a nonsuit under subsection C do not apply. Bremer v. Doctor's Bldg. Partnership, 251 Va. 74, 465 S.E.2d 787, 1996 Va. LEXIS 14 (1996). Because: (1) the circuit court lacked the authority to dismiss plaintiffs personal injury action under Norfolk, Va., Cir. Ct. R. 2(F)(3); (2) the local rule c onflicted with the provisions governing the discontinuance of cases set forth in § 8.01-335; and (3) the local rule abridged plaintiffs right to take a nonsuit under § 8.01-380 and recommence the action, said dismissal was void ab initio, and n ot subject to the limitation period of Va.Sup. Ct. R. 1:1. Collins v. Shepherd, 274 Va. 390, 649 S.E.2d 672, 2007 Va. LEXIS 116 (2007). Prisoners petition for a writ of actual innocence was not a civil action to which the nonsuit statute applied. In re Phillips, 296 Va. 433, 822 S.E.2d 1, 2018 Va. LEXIS 182 (2018). Plaintiff has absolute right to one nonsuit.  Under this section, a plaintiff has an absolute right to one nonsuit. The election is his and if he insists upon taking the nonsuit within the limitations imposed by this section, neither the trial court nor opposing counsel can prevent him from doing so. Nash v. Jewell, 227 Va. 230, 315 S.E.2d 825, 1984 Va. LEXIS 237 (1984). The common law considerations of prejudice were codified in this section by prohibiting a nonsuit if a pending counterclaim, cross claim, or third-party claim cou ld not be independently adjudicated. Therefore, a plaintiff is entitled to one nonsuit as a matter of right if the provisions of this section are met without further analysis of prejudice to the defendant. Bremer v. Doctor's Bldg. Partnership, 251 Va. 74 , 465 S.E.2d 787, 1996 Va. LEXIS 14 (1996).

Greater Richmond Transit Co., 241 Va. 300, 402 S.E.2d 214, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1723, 1991 Va. LEXIS 30 (1991). Handwriting ex emplars.  Once handwriting exemplars were admitted into evidence, the trial judge had the discretion to allow the jury to examine them in the jury room. He did not abuse hi s discretion by doing so. Lynn v. Commonwealth, No. 0129-93-3 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 17, 1995). Defendants recorded out-of-court statement held an exhibit.  An out-of-court statement, whether written or recorded, which is introduced into evidence, is an exhibit. Therefore, the jury was entitled to take murder defendants recorded statement, which was introduced into evidence as an exhibit, into the jury room. Pugliese v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 82, 428 S.E.2d 16, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1057, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 56 (1993). Trial court did not err by making defendants videotaped confession, previously shown to jury at trial, available to jury during deliberations. Cull v. Commonw ealth, No. 2202-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 28, 2000). Video tape of defendants confession properly allowed during deliberat ions.  Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to take a video tape of defendants confession into the jury room during deliberations where it did not result in undue emphasis on defendants confession and an investigators testimony regarding his interrogation of defendant because the video tape was an exhibit available to the jury during the deliberations under § 8.01-381, a nd the fact that jurors might have put emphasis on certain evidence, such as the video tape, was simply part of what they did when weighing and considering the evidence. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 178, 590 S.E.2d 520, 2004 Va. LEXIS 8, cert. denied , 543 U.S. 891, 125 S. Ct. 168, 160 L. Ed. 2d 155, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 5213 (2004). Possible overemphasis by jury not grounds for withholding evidence.  The risk that a jury may overemphasize a videotaped statement by the accused if permitted to view such statement in the jury room exists when a jury peruses any e xhibit; nothing in the Virginia statutes or case law requires the trial judge to supervise the jurys review of evidence to prevent overemphasis and the fact that a jury may dwell upon or emphasize any evidence, whether testimony or exhibits, is withi n the jurys purview in weighing and considering the evidence. Cull v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 237 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2000). Harmless error.  When defendant claimed that he was guilty only of second-degree murder, not first-degree murder, any violation of § 8.01-381 by not allowing the jury to replay defendants videotaped confession while deliberating was harmless error under § 8.01-678. The facts that defendant entered his wifes room and retrieved a loaded gun from a closet, fired twice at her at point-blank range, buried her in a makesh ift grave, lied about her whereabouts, and admitted that he killed her because he did not want to take any more verbal harassment from her were irrefutable proof of his specific intent to kill; replaying the videotape would have added little to the delib erative process, given the Commonwealths stipulation of its narrative content, the jurys previous viewing of it, the jurys in-court review of an agreed transcript, and the nearly identical evidence presented from an investigator. Kirby v. Com monwealth, 50 Va. App. 691, 653 S.E.2d 600, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 442 (2007). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The documents or statements must have been introduced in evidence.  The inference from the evidence that the statements carried to the jury room were introduced in evidence was irresistible, and it followed that there could be no valid objection to the jury carrying them into the jury room. Ballard v. Commonwealth, 156 Va. 980, 159 S.E. 222, 1931 Va. LEXIS 253 (1931). The plaintiff has no right under this section to demand that papers shown to a witness for the purpose of identifying the signature of a defendant thereto but whi ch were never introduced in evidence, shall be allowed to go to the jury for their inspection after the conclusion of the evidence and arguments. Wilson v. Wooldridge, 118 Va. 209, 86 S.E. 872, 1915 Va. LEXIS 143 (1915). Depositions.  A deposition which has been read to the jury may be taken with them in their retirement if what is objectionable in it has been erased. Hansbrough v. Stinnett, 66 Va.

The final order, judgment or decree entered shall provide for such interest until such principal su m be paid. If a final order, judgment or decree be rendered which does not provide for interest, the final order, judgment or decree awarded or jury verdict shall bear interest at the judgment rate of interest as provided for in § 6.2-302 from its dat e of entry or from the date that the jury verdict was rendered. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any judgment entered for a sum due under a negotiable instrument, as defined by § 8.3A-104, shall provide for interest on the principal sum in accordance with § 8.3A-112 at the rate specified in the instrument. If no such rate is specified, interest on the principal sum shall be at the judgment rate provided in § 6.2-302. Final orders may be recorded, enforced, and satisfied as orders or decrees of a circuit court upon certification of such orders by the agency head or his designee. History History.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Former § 8-223 has been rewritten to place the court and the jury on the same footing when it comes to providing for interest on the principal sum awarded in t he judgment or decree. Also, § 8.01-382 applies to all actions and suits, and thereby expands the former sections application which was limited to actions on contract, tort, and suits in equity. Finally, this section provides that the interest awa rded shall become part of the judgment or decree. Editors note. Effective October 1, 2010, § 6.2-302 was substituted for § 6.1-330.54, to conform to the recodification of Title 6.1 by Acts 2010, c. 794. The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendment by c. 646 substituted or jury verdict shall bear interest at the judgment rate of interest as provided for in § 6.1-330.54 from its date of entry or from the date that the jury verdict for shall bear interest from its date of entry, at the rate as provided in § 6.1-330.54, and judgment or decree entered accordingly; provided, if the judgment entered in accordance with the verd ict of a jury does not provide for interest, interest shall commence from the date that the verdict and inserted judgment preceding rate provided. The 2008 amendments. The 2008 amendment by c. 219 inserted Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.) action or near the beginning of the first sentence, inserted  final order preceding judgment once in the second sentence and twice in the third sentence, and made related changes.

Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Judgment def ined.  The word judgment, when used in the context of this section, contemplates a debt that is presently due and owing, not a debt due and payable in the future . Pledger v. Pledger, 6 Va. App. 627, 371 S.E.2d 43, 5 Va. Law Rep. 169, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 80 (1988). General comment.  This section states that if a judgment be rendered which does not provide for interest, then the interest shall commence from the date of entry. It also permits t he court to provide for interest and fix the period at which the interest shall commence. Hayes v. Hayes, No. 2038-96-4 (Ct. of Appeals June 3, 1997). Constr uction with other law.  Section 15.1-549 (see now § 15.2-1244) prohibits a county from paying interest on a judgment. This section simply had no application here. The supreme court ha d to apply former § 15.1-549 in this appeal because it was a statute of specific application which took precedence over this section, a statute of general application. County of Fairfax v. Century Concrete Servs., Inc., 254 Va. 423, 492 S.E.2d 648, 19 97 Va. LEXIS 117 (1997). Version of § 20-107.3 in effect at time divorce matter was commenced did not expressly authorize or prohibit application of this section requiring interest on judgments to monetary awards. Therefore husband was precluded from recovering interest on equitable distribution award. Hird v. Gaynor, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 205 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 21, 2000). Where plaintiff partner successfully sued defendant partner for unjust enrichment, he was awarded damages plus interest pursuant to §§ 6.1-330.53 [now § 6.2-301] and 8.01-382, consisting of his initial and subsequent investments, but not profits that defendant enjoyed from those payments as plaintiff was not entitled to a disgorgement of the profits, nor was it inequitable for defendant to retain them. T he initial investment was not barred by the three-year statute of limitations that was applicable to oral contracts under § 8.01-246 because, given that there was no agreed upon repayment date of an alleged obligation to pay money, it was deemed payab le on demand; thus, the statute of limitations accrued from the time that the money was transferred from plaintiff to defendant, and, as the unjust enrichment did not occur until one year before filing, any timeliness issues were dismissed. Clarke v. New ell, No. 1:05cv1013, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74251 (E.D. Va. Oct. 12, 2006). As a former husbands failure to pay his former wife and childrens medical insurance expenses, which were in the nature of spousal and child support, creat ed a judgment by operation of law under subdivision 12 of § 20-60.3 (now see subdivision 14) as these expenses came due, pursuant to § 8.01-382, the wife was entitled to prejudgment interest on these amounts. Whitney v. Whitney, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 203 (Va. Ct. App. May 15, 2007). Virginia law governs award of prejudgment interest in diversity case.  See Hitachi Credit Am. Corp. v. Signet Bank, 166 F.3d 614, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 593 (4th Cir. 1999). Purpose of prejudgment interest.  The award of prejudgment interest is to compensate a plaintiff for the loss sustained by not receiving the amount to which he was entitled at the time he was enti tled to receive it, and such award is considered necessary to place the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the party in default had fulfilled his obligated duty. Walker v. Pfeiffer, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 506 (Va. Ct. App. July 11, 2000). Prejudgment interest is permitted by statute, and is designed to compensate the plaintif f who has been without relief for an extended period of time. Gill v. Rollins Protective Servs. Co., 836 F.2d 194, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 16617 (4th Cir. 1987). Postjudgment interest is not an element of damages, but is a statutory award for the del ay in the payment of money actually due. Ragsdale v. Ragsdale, 30 Va. App. 283, 516 S.E.2d 698, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 452 (1999). Distinction between prejudgment and postjudgment interest.  By its express language, this section draws an important distinction between prejudgment and postjudgment interest. This section provides for the discretionary aw ard of prejudgment interest by the trier of fact, who may provide for such interest and fix the time of its commencement. The accrual of postjudgment interest, however, is mandatory; the entire amount of a judgment or decree shall bear interest from its date of entry. Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Douthat, 248 Va. 627, 449 S.E.2d 799, 1994 Va. LEXIS 158 (1994). Postjudgment interest is extra-contractual obligation.  Although the insurers duty to pay damages is a contractual liability, enforced by the insurance statutes, the duty to pay postjudgment interest is an extra-co ntractual obligation that is imposed as a statutory penalty for failure to pay a liquidated debt when due. Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Douthat, 248 Va. 627, 449 S.E.2d 799, 1994 Va. LEXIS 158 (1994). No p rejudgment interest duty.  Because no such obligation is imposed by this section or any other statute, an insurer has no duty to pay prejudgment interest in excess of policy limits, absent a contractual provision to the contrary. Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Douthat, 248 Va. 627, 449 S.E.2d 799, 1994 Va. LEXIS 158 (1994). Prejudgment interest should have been awarded from date of loss not date of suit.  Trial court erred in calculating prejudgment interest from the date suit was filed rather than the date the loss was incurred which was the date the wife took out a loan to ensure retention of the wifes property that the husband put up as collateral for a loan by forging the wifes name on necessary documents. Hardey v. Metzger, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 409 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 26, 2008). Accrual date for prejudgment interest.  In a case in which a district court determined that the loss payee on two insurance policies was entitled to prejudgment interest at the rate of six percent per a nnum, the appropriate date from which prejudgment interest would accrue was the date that the insurer decided to deny coverage. On that date, more than a year of investigation and time to review the policies terms, the insurer made its determination; from that date forward, it was appropriate for the insurer to bear the consequences of its conclusion. Wells Fargo Equip. Fin., Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 823 F. Supp. 2d 364, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115533 (E.D. Va. 2011).

Discretion of court.  In awarding a new trial, it is within the trial judges discretion to decide whether a new trial should be on all issues or solely on the issue of damages. Sam pson v. Sampson, 221 Va. 896, 275 S.E.2d 597, 1981 Va. LEXIS 225 (1981). In determining whether an excessive damage award requires a new trial on all issues, a new trial limited to damages, an order of remittitur, or a judgment confirm ing the award, a trial judge is vested with broad discretion, and the Supreme Court will not reverse his ruling unless the record plainly shows an abuse of discretion. Ford Motor Co. v. Bartholomew, 224 Va. 421, 297 S.E.2d 675, 1982 Va. LEXIS 312 (1982). Before a new trial should be limited to the amount of damages, it should be reasonably c lear that the misconception of the jury has not extended to its determination of the question of liability as well as to its determination of the amount of damages. Rutherford v. Zearfoss, 221 Va. 685, 272 S.E.2d 225, 1980 Va. LEXIS 290 (1980). Amount of damages in personal injury cases.  In personal injury cases, where the action merely sounds in damages, and there is no rule for measuring such damages, the amount to be awarded is left largely to the discretion of the jury. The verdict of the jury, arrived at upon competent evidence and controlled by proper instructions, has always been held to be inviolate against disturbance by the courts. Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 224 Va. 562, 299 S.E .2d 340, 1983 Va. LEXIS 162 (1983). After-discovered evidence.  One of the criteria for determining whether a new trial should be ordered for after-discovered evidence is whether the evidence could have been discovered before trial by the exercise of due diligence. Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 224 Va. 562, 299 S.E.2d 340, 1983 Va. LEXIS 162 (1983). B.Excessive Damages. Remittitur discretionary .  The power to order remittitur lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. Robinson v. Old Dominion Freight Line, 236 Va. 125, 372 S.E.2d 142, 5 Va. Law R ep. 560, 1988 Va. LEXIS 125 (1988). When court will corr ect award.  Where the attack upon a verdict is based upon its alleged excessiveness, if the amount awarded is so great as to shock the conscience of the court and to create t he impression that the jury has been motivated by passion, corruption or prejudice, or has misconceived or misconstrued the facts or the law, or if the award is so out of proportion to the injuries suffered as to suggest that it is not the product of a f air and impartial decision, the court is empowered, and in fact obligated, to step in and correct the injustice. Rutherford v. Zearfoss, 221 Va. 685, 272 S.E.2d 225, 1980 Va. LEXIS 290 (1980). Trial de novo not mandatory where award not based on sympathy or bias.  A trial de novo is not mandatory, when the monetary award, though out of proportion to the injuries suffered, is not so excessive as to compel the conclusion that the liability verdict was the product of sympathy for the plaintiff or bias against the defendant. In such case, if the evidence before the jury clearly supports its finding of liability, a trial judge has two options. He may put the plaintiff on terms to accept a remittitur in lieu of a new trial, § 8.01-383.1, or he may grant the defendant a new trial limited to damages, under this section. Ford Motor Co. v. Bartholomew, 224 Va. 421, 297 S.E.2d 675, 1982 Va. LEXIS 312 (1982). Error to remit compensatory damages award, rather than granting a new trial.  When a seaman sued a shipowner for maintenance and cure compensatory and punitive damages, it was error for the trial court to remit a compensatory damages award, rather than granting a new trial, because (1) the evidence did not support the claims, so it was error to instruct on the claims, and (2) a new trial was required, as the instruction, and the admission of the shipowners net worth, were not harmless errors, and remittitur did not correct the instruction. Hale v. Maersk Line Ltd., 284 Va. 358, 732 S.E.2d 8, 2012 Va. LEXIS 156 (2012). Court may require part of award be remitted or order new trial.  Although the amount to award the wronged party is a matter within the discretion of the jury, if the trial court concludes that a verdict is excessive, it also ha s the authority under this section and § 8.01-383.1 to require plaintiff to remit a portion of the award or to submit to a new trial. If a new trial is ordered, it is within the trial courts discretion to grant a new trial on all issues or solely on the issue of damages. LaVay Corp. v. Dominion Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 645 F. Supp. 612, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19954 (E.D. Va. 1986), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 830 F.2d 522, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 13005 (4th Cir. 1987). C.Inadequate Damages . As a general rule, a court cannot set aside a verdict and order a new trial where the de fendant claims that the plaintiffs verdict was inadequate; a court erred granting the drivers motion to set aside the injured partys verdict as inadequate. Shepherd v. Smith, 265 Va. 327, 576 S.E.2d 427, 2003 Va. LEXIS 30 (2003). In cases in which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a verdict finding defendant not liable, the court will set aside a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the ground of inadequacy and grant a new trial, whether the verdict be for merely a nominal amount or for a substantial but inadequate sum. And the new trial should be limited to the question of the amount of the damages. Sampson v. Sampson, 221 Va. 896, 275 S.E.2d 597, 1981 Va. LEXIS 225 (1981). Error in refusal to set aside verdict in wrongful death action.  In a wrongful death action where the decedents widow and children were awarded nothing for sorrow, mental anguish and solace, and the children were awarded no thing for lost services and protection, the award by the jury rendered the entire verdict suspect and lead to the conclusion that the jury must have misconceived or misunderstood the facts or the law; hence, the trial court erred in refusing to set aside the verdict. Johnson v. Smith, 241 Va. 396, 403 S.E.2d 685, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2225, 1991 Va. LEXIS 64 (1991). Verdict not inadequate.  In a negligence action arising out of an automobile accident, a verdict awarding damages to plaintiff was not inadequate as a matter of law because evidence creat ing questions as to whether plaintiffs injuries were aggravated or even causally related to the car collision at issue permitted the jury to find that plaintiff had not been injured as seriously as she claimed or that special damages were not reasona bly related to the accident. Accordingly, plaintiff was not entitled to a new trial. McMonigle v. Walton, No. 5:03CV00069, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30988 (W.D. Va. Apr. 27, 2007). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Purpose.  The General Assembly intended, in enacting this section, that trial judges be empowered in their sound discretion to exercise supervision over the verdicts of jur ies. Clatterbuck v. Miller, 215 Va. 359, 209 S.E.2d 904, 1974 Va. LEXIS 292 (1974). Litigant entitled to one fair trial.  Under a sound public policy, the law accords to every litigant one fair and regular trial, but only one. Vaughan v. Mayo Milling Co., 127 Va. 148, 102 S.E. 597, 1 920 Va. LEXIS 41 (1920). A motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. Citizen s Bank v. Taylor &amp; Co., 104 Va. 164, 51 S.E. 159, 1905 Va. LEXIS 83 (1905). A sound discretion is vested in the trial court as to whether the ends of justice will be better served by setting aside, or refusing to set aside, an inadequate verdict. Rawle v. McIlhenny, 163 Va. 735, 177 S.E. 214, 1934 Va. LEXIS 213 (1934). Greater latitude is allowed the trial court in granting than in refusing a new trial on the ground that the verdict is contrary to the evidence. Cardwell v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 114 Va. 500, 77 S.E. 612, 1913 Va. LEXIS 112 (1913). Remittitur d iscretionary.  This section and § 8.01-383.1 tacitly recognize and implicitly ratify the common-law rule that the power to order remittitur lies within the sound discretion o f the trial court. Bassett Furn. Indus., Inc. v. McReynolds, 216 Va. 897, 224 S.E.2d 323, 1976 Va. LEXIS 223 (1976); Bunch v. State Hwy. &amp; Transp. Comm'r, 217 Va. 627, 231 S.E.2d 324, 1977 Va. LEXIS 211 (1977). Review of discretion.  The appellate court will not reverse the action of the trial court setting aside a verdict as inadequate unless it plainly appears from the record that its action in so doing is plainly wrong. Rawle v. McIlhenny, 163 Va. 735, 177 S.E. 214, 1934 Va. LEXIS 213 (1934).

Formal exce ptions to rulings or orders of the court shall be unnecessary; but for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary, it shall be sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which he desires the court to take or his objections to the action of the court and his grounds therefor; and, if a party has no opportunity to object to a ruling or order at the time it is made, the absence of an objection shall not thereafter prejudice him on motion for a new trial or on appeal. No party, after having made an objection or motion known to the court, shall be required to make such objection or motion again in order to preserve his right to appeal, challenge, or mov e for reconsideration of, a ruling, order, or action of the court. No party shall be deemed to have agreed to, or acquiesced in, any written order of a trial court so as to forfeit his right to contest such order on appeal except by express written agree ment in his endorsement of the order. Arguments made at trial via written pleading, memorandum, recital of objections in a final order, oral argument reduced to transcript, or agreed written statements of facts shall, unless expressly withdrawn or waive d, be deemed preserved therein for assertion on appeal. B. The failure to make a motion for a new trial in any case in which an appeal, writ of error, or supersedeas lies to or from a higher court shall not be deemed a waiver of any objection made during the trial if such objection be properly made a part of the record.

Verdict, § 36. CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. The primary function of the contemporaneous objection rule is to alert the trial judge t o possible error so that the judge may consider the issue intelligently and take any corrective actions necessary to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 547, 458 S.E.2d 599, 12 Va. Law Rep. 5, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 554 (1995). The purpose of this rule is to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials by allowing the trial judge to intelligently consider an issue and, if necessary , to take corrective action. Gurley v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 166, 538 S.E.2d 361, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 836 (2000). Both this section and Rule 5A:18 are not limited to evidentiary rule or other rulings r elating to incidents of the trial. This section is applicable to any rulings or order of the court. Rule 5A:18 includes the phrase that [a] mere statement that the judgment or award is contrary to the law and the evidence is not sufficient.  Both provisions negated appellants contention that Rule 5A:18 was applicable only to evidentiary and similar rulings and not legal decisions and findings. The myriad of cases interpreting Rule 5:25, Rule 5A:18s counterpart for the Supreme C ourt, also belied that contention. Lee v. Lee, 12 Va. App. 512, 404 S.E.2d 736, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2647, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 102 (1991). Procedure to preserve on appeal issue objected to at trial court.  Neither this section nor Rule 5A:18 mandate a specific procedure to preserve for appeal an issue objected to in the trial court. A simple statement that embodies the objection and reason therefor suffices. However, neither this section nor Rule 5A:18 is complied with merely by objecting generally to an order. Lee v. Lee, 12 Va. App. 512, 404 S.E.2d 736, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2647, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 102 (1991). Individuals may satisfy the requirements of Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 5A:18 and § 8.01-384 in many ways; for instance, a partys counsel may, if counsel has previou sly failed to do so, include an objection and reasons for the objection in the final order or at least tender such an order to the trial judge. Taylor v. Caccia, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2003). Where trial court on its own motion instructed jury to ignore parts of an instruction, w ithout previous consultation with counsel, defense counsel did not have an opportunity to object to the trial courts ruling, and was not precluded from raising the issue on appeal. Mason v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 339, 373 S.E.2d 603, 5 Va. Law Rep. 799, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 138 (1988). Court has affirmative duty to instruct on principles of law.  When a principle of law is vital to a defendant in a criminal case, a trial court has an affirmative duty to properly instruct a jury about the matter. That princ iple applies even when an objection has not been stated. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 547, 458 S.E.2d 599, 12 Va. Law Rep. 5, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 554 (1995). Motion to set aside verdict did not save failure to object to instructions.  Where the defendant did make a motion to set aside the verdict, this does not save him from his failure to object to the instructions which submitted the issues o f contributory negligence and proximate cause to the jury. Spitzli v. Minson, 231 Va. 12, 341 S.E.2d 170, 1986 Va. LEXIS 157 (1986). No opportunity to raise objection in trial court.  Wife was not procedurally barred from raising issues in an appeal of a summary contempt order even though they had not been raised in the trial court because, due to the nature of the summary contempt, the wife had not been afforded any opportunity to raise any objections at the time the order was entered. Amos v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 730, 740 S.E.2d 43, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 111 (2013), aff'd, 287 Va. 301, 75 4 S.E.2d 304, 2014 Va. LEXIS 29 (2014). Defendant ones challenge to the courts act of entertaining and answering the jurys questions when neither he nor his counsel were present could be con sidered on appeal under the contemporaneous objection exception as he did not contest the content of the courts answers to the jurys questions; defendant one and his counsel did not have the opportunity to be present and challenge the courts decision to address questions from the jury in their absence. Maxwell v. Commonwealth, 287 Va. 258, 754 S.E.2d 516, 2014 Va. LEXIS 31 (2014). Contemporaneous objection exception applied and no further steps were required to preserve defendants issues for appellate review as defendant was not a party in the proceeding in which she was held in contempt, but was a witness, was not represented by counsel, and after the ruling, was immediately taken to jail without any further consideration by the court; the actions of the trial court prevented defendan t from presenting a contemporaneous objection. Commonwealth v. Amos, 287 Va. 301, 754 S.E.2d 304, 2014 Va. LEXIS 29 (2014). When failure to raise a contemporaneous objection or otherwise bring an objection to the courts attention results from a partys actions, the contemporaneo us objection exception does not apply, and the preservation issue shall be decided under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 or 5:25; however, when a party was denied the opportunity to raise a contemporaneous objection, the contemporaneous objection exception applies , and there is no requirement that the party file a post-conviction objection or otherwise bring the objection to the courts attention later in the proceedings. Commonwealth v. Amos, 287 Va. 301, 754 S.E.2d 304, 2014 Va. LEXIS 29 (2014). Because the trial court did not allow defendant to state and argue his full objection to the Commonwealths argument until it dismissed the jury to deliberate, defendant sufficiently preserved his objection and the trial court was given an opportunity to consider the asserted error and rectify its effect on the trial. Exline v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 407 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2014). Defendant lacked an opportunity to make a contemporaneous objection not through any fault of his own, but rather because the circuit court misunderstood the relev ant procedural law when he noted his appeal. Because the circuit court mistakenly believed that defendants appeal was untimely, it denied the appeal sua sponte, without a hearing, and outside the presence of defendant or his counsel. Jacks v. Commonw ealth, 74 Va. App. 783, 872 S.E.2d 233, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 173 (2022). Failure to indicate or seek action of trial court.  Merely stating an objection to the irregularity of the jury failed to indicate what action the defendant wanted the trial court to take; thus, defendant s failure to seek a mistrial or other action by the trial court prevented consideration of the error as a basis for a reversal. Parker v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 592, 421 S.E.2d 450, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3123, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (1992).

CASE NOTES When compliance with section n ot required.  In a proceeding under the Habitual Traffic Offender Act wherein a licensee who has been convicted of driving while intoxicated in two other states did not raise a ny challenge with respect to the similarity between the Virginia statute and the laws under which he had been convicted, it was unnecessary for the trial court to comply with this section. Davis v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 808, 252 S.E.2d 299, 1979 Va. LEXI S 173 (1979). Because citations to Utah usury law provided the court with sufficient information regarding the substance of Utah law on that subject pursuant to the choice of l aw provision of a loan agreement, the circuit court erred in refusing to apply such in construing that agreement. Thus, the judgment in favor of the debtor based on her claim of usury was reversed. Settlement Funding, LLC v. Neumann-Lillie, 274 Va. 76, 6 45 S.E.2d 436, 2007 Va. LEXIS 85 (2007).

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Medicare/Medicaid surveys.  Judicial notice was properly taken under § 8.01-388 of the Virginia Department of Healths (VDH) Medicare/Medicaid nursing home surveys as: (1) they were de scribed as official documents in both the regulation mandating the disclosure of survey results and in the Medicare State Operations Manual; (2) they represented the VDHs formal assessment of the quality of care at Medicare-supported facilities; (3) even though 42 C.F.R. § 488.325 did not require the surveys to be published, § 488.325 required that the documents be made available to the public. and (4) although Virginia law provided that the word publish included posting items on an agency s website, it did not re-define the word to require Internet publication.

The records of any judicial proceeding and any other official records of any court of this Commonwealth shall be received as prima facie evidence provided that such records are certified by the clerk of the court where preserved to be a true record. For the purpose s of this section, judicial proceeding shall include the review of a petition and issuance of a temporary detention order under § 16.1-340.1 or 37.2-809. A1. The record s of any judicial proceeding and any other official record of any court of another state or country, or of the United States, shall be received as prima facie evidence provided that such records are certified by the clerk of the court where preserved to be a true record. B. Every court of this Commonwealth shall give such records of courts not of this Commonwealth the full faith and credit given to them in the courts of the jurisdiction from whence they come. B1. In any ins tance in which a court not of this Commonwealth shall have entered an order of injunction limiting or preventing access by any person to the courts of this Commonwealth without that person having had notice and an opportunity for a hearing prior to the e ntry of such foreign order, that foreign order is not required to be given full faith and credit in any Virginia court. The Virginia court may, in its discretion, hold a hearing to determine the adequacy of notice and opportunity for hearing in the forei gn court. C. Specificall y, recitals of any fact in a deed or deed of trust of record conveying any interest in real property shall be prima facie evidence of that fact. D. Records  as used in this article, shall be deemed to include any memorandum, report, paper, data compilation, or other record in any form, or any combination thereof. E. The use of the term copy teste, true copy, or certified copy or a substantially similar term on a certification affixed or annexed to a copy of an official record maintained by a clerk of court that bears the signature of the clerk or any de puty clerk, and that has the name of the court where such record is preserved on the document or on the certification, shall be prima facie proof that such record is certified by such clerk to be a true copy of the official record kept in the office of t he clerk. Nothing herein shall be construed to require or prevent a clerk from using an official seal or prevent a clerk from using any other acceptable method of certification for a court record. F. The certifi cation of any record pursuant to this section shall automatically authenticate such record for the purpose of its admission into evidence in any trial, hearing, or proceeding.

Authentication, etc. Authentication is merely the process of showing that a document is genuine and that it i s what its proponent claims it to be. Owens v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 309, 391 S.E.2d 605, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2336, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 83 (1990). Circuit court did not err in admitting a general district courts records because after the records were properly certified by the circuit court clerk, they be came a part of the circuit courts file, were properly authenticated when the circuit court clerk certified them, and were admissible as evidence. Snowden v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 482, 749 S.E.2d 223, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 303 (2013). Although clause (i) of subsection A of § 17.1-123 provides that an order book page shall be admissible when the judges signature is shown in the order, nei ther of the other permissible methods require that the judges signature appear on the individual order for it to be admissible. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 186 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2017). Circuit court did not err in admitting pages from an order book because it was maintained in conformity with clause (ii) of subsection A of § 17.1-123; even if subsection A of § 17.1-123 required that the identity of the presiding judge be ascertainable, the sequence of the various orders and the respective signatures of the judges indicated that one judge presided over the case under which his signature ap peared and the other judge presided over the cases, including defendants, under which his signature appeared. Hubbard v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 186 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2017). Circuit court did not err in failing to admit a purported Iranian court order where the documents did not include a certification by the court clerk, were not tru e copies, and were not authenticated. Pourbabai v. Pourbabai, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 233 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 21, 2018). Court orders were properly admitted under subsection A, and since defendant had only assigned error to the admissibility of the orders, the authenticity of the re cords was not properly before the court of appeals. Raspberry v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. App. 19, 833 S.E.2d 894, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 241 (2019). The terms authenticated and certified are basically synonymous, and the court of appeals is unwilling to place undue significance on the fact they are used in the conjunctive in the statute. Owens v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 309, 391 S.E.2d 605, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2336, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 83 (1990); Taylor v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 1, 502 S.E.2d 113, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 428 (1998). No requirement of certificate stating clerks independent knowledge o f facts.  The words authenticated and certified do not require the attesting clerk to attach to the copy of the official document an additional certificate stating that he or she is aware of and/or has independent knowledge of the facts stated or offered therein; where the document was a certified copy properly attested to by a deputy clerk, and where the conviction order was stamped and undersigned by the deputy c lerk, this was sufficient to authenticate and certify the document within the meaning of this section. Owens v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 309, 391 S.E.2d 605, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2336, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 83 (1990). Criminal doc ket entries.  Criminal docket entries were properly admissible as prima facie evidence of the public record of defendants criminal convictions in Maryland and, as public re cords, the contents of the records fell under an exception to the hearsay rule, subsection A1 of § 8.01-389. Broward v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 370 (Va. Ct. App. July 1, 2003). Foreign order properly certified.  A prior convictions order reflecting a defendants convictions in California complied with the requirements of this section and was properly admitted into evid ence where the order was marked on the back with a stamp reading, Allen Slater, Executive Officer and Clerk of the Superior Court of the State of California, in and for the County of Orange, contained the seal of the Orange County Superior Court and was signed by Flor L. Perez, whose signature appeared next to the word, Deputy. Medici v. Commonwealth, 260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28, 2000 Va. LEXIS 86 (2000), overruled in part, Townsend v. Commonwealth, 270 Va. 325, 619 S.E.2d 71, 200 5 Va. LEXIS 81 (2005). This section codifies as part of the written records exception to the hearsay rule judic ial records which are properly authenticated. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 1, 502 S.E.2d 113, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 428 (1998). Blood alcohol analysis photocopy admissible.  Where the Commonwealth introduced into evidence a certified photocopy of the defendants original certificate of analysis, previously identified by a Commonwea lth witness as a xeroxed copy of the original certificate for analysis, it was proper under the statute, and defendants contention that the photocopy was hearsay and that only the original could be admitted was without merit. Ingram v. Common wealth, Nos. 0721-95-4, 0722-95-4 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 23, 1996). Juvenile court petition was properly admitted.  Juvenile court petition was properly admitted as evidence of a minors age for purposes of § 18.2-255 conviction as the legislature had determined that offi cial records were admissible as prima facie evidence if properly authe...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-390"><akn:num>§ 8.01-390</akn:num><akn:heading>Nonjudicial records as evidence (Subdivision (10)(a) of Supreme Court Rule 2:803 derived from subsection C of this section)</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

A digitally certified copy of a record provided pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 38.2 (§ 2.2-3817 et seq.) of Title 2.2, whether in electronic form or in print form with visible assurance of the digital signature, shall be deemed to be authenticated by the custodian of the record unless evidence is presented to the contrary. B. Records and recordings of 911 emergency service calls shall be deemed authentic transcriptions or recordings of the original statements if they are accompanied by a certificate that meets the provisions of subsection A and the certificate contains the date and time of the incoming call and the incoming phone number, if available, associated with the call. C. An affidavi t signed by an officer deemed to have custody of such an official record, or by his deputy, stating that after a diligent search, no record or entry of such record is found to exist among the records in his office is admissible as evidence that his offic e has no such record or entry.

Such official records are to be received as prima facie evidence provided they are doubly authenticated. Editors note. At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the notation to the Virginia Rules of Evidence was added to the catchline of this section. Acts 2012, cc. 688 an d 708, cl. 6 provides: That pursuant to the authority set forth in §§ 30-146 and 30-147 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission shall direct any party with whom the Virginia Code Commission contracts to publish the Code of Virgini a to include in the catchline of every section of the Code of Virginia from which any rule contained in the Rules of Evidence has been derived a notation specifying such rule. The 2000 amendments.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 7B M.J. Evidence, §§ 84, 91. CASE NOTES This section creates the official written statements exception to the hearsay rule. Under this exception, records and reports prepared by public officials pursuant to a duty imposed by statute, or required by the nature of their offices, are admissible as proof of the facts stated therein. Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp. , 224 Va. 562, 299 S.E.2d 340, 1983 Va. LEXIS 162 (1983). This section codifies the official written documents exception to the hearsay rule and, under that exception, records and reports prepared by public offic ials pursuant to a duty imposed by statute, or required by the nature of their office, are admissible as proof of the facts stated therein. Williams v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 545, 546 S.E.2d 735, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 285 (2001). This section has codified the official written documents exception recognized in Virgini a for documents or copies of documents that are properly authenticated in accordance with its requirements. Ingram v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986). Documents must relate facts within personal knowledge and observation of recording official.  Although a record or report may qualify as a public document, the hearsay objection is overcome only if the document relates facts or events within the personal k nowledge and observation of the recording official to which he could testify should he be called as a witness. Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 224 Va. 562, 299 S.E.2d 340, 1983 Va. LEXIS 162 (1983). And must be properly authenticated.  While a document qualified as an official document and thus would have been admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule created by this section, it still w ould be inadmissible where not authenticated properly pursuant to it. This section fixes a simple, easy way to authenticate an official document, and no reason suggests itself for excusing a failure to follow the prescribed course. Taylor v. Maritime Ove rseas Corp., 224 Va. 562, 299 S.E.2d 340, 1983 Va. LEXIS 162 (1983). Double authentication necessary.  To comply with this section double authentication is necessary to prove genuineness as a prerequisite to admission of a copy. Proper authentication under this sec tion requires not only certification of the copy as a true copy by the custodian of the record and the person to whom he reports, but also a showing that the persons certifying are indeed the custodian and the person to whom he reports. Ingram v. Commonw ealth, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986) (decided prior to 2000 amendment.). Proper authentication under this statute requires not only certification of the copy as a true copy by the custodian of the record and the person to whom he repor ts, but also a showing that the persons certifying are indeed the custodian and the person to whom he reports. Zubricki v. Motter, 12 Va. App. 999, 406 S.E.2d 672, 8 Va. Law Rep. 350, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 193 (1991) (decided prior to 2000 amendment.). Custodian.  Law does not require the use of the specific words custodian or person to whom the custodian reports in order for a certification to meet the requ irements of the official records exception; rather, the proponent of the evidence needs to provide the trial court with a basis to find that the person who authenticated the challenged document was the custodian or someone to whom the custodian reported in terms of their actual responsibilities and not merely his or her job title. Adjei v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 727, 763 S.E.2d 225, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (2014). Section avoids inconvenience of requiring officials to be present.  The inconvenience of requiring public officials to appear in court and testify concerning the subject matter of their statements would be suffered not only by a d eclarant whose statements are sought to be introduced into evidence but also by the officials whose authentication is required by this section, viz., the custodian of the records containing the statements and the person to whom the custodian reports. Hen ce, the court appearance of none of these officials is required, provided the records are authenticated properly. Taylor v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 224 Va. 562, 299 S.E.2d 340, 1983 Va. LEXIS 162 (1983). The official records exception allows the admission of certain official public documents, without the necessity of producing the record keeper, so long as the kee per or entrant had personal knowledge contained in those records and could be called to testify regarding them. Hooker v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 454, 418 S.E.2d 343, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2979, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 137 (1992). Documents held admissible.  Because authentication of court records under § 8.01-389 by a deputy court clerk was equivalent to authentication by the court clerk, defendants prior conv iction orders were properly authenticated and were admissible even though the boxes indicating the signatorys title as either the clerk or the deputy clerk were not checked. Conley v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 516 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2005) . Records of Department of Motor Veh icles.  In light of the established official written statements exception to hearsay recognized in Virginia, one of the obvious purposes of the single authenticat ion provision in former § 46.1-34.1 (now see § 46.2-215), rather than double authentication as required by this section, is to ease the burden on the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles in certifying records that are frequently utilized at trial. Ingram v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986) (decided prior to 2000 amendments). Records of Department of Family Services.  Letters a Department of Family Services (DFS) sent to a mother relating to the execution of foster care plans were admissible in a termination of parental rights proceeding under § 8.01-390, the official records exception to the hearsay rule, as the DFS social worker who authenticated them was the custodian of these documents and the records contained facts within her personal knowledge. Redditt v. Fairfax Cou nty Dep't of Family Servs., 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 3 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2005). Records of Department of Social Services.  Statement contained in a foster care service plan were admissible, because the plan was prepared by a social worker in the course of her duties with the Charlotte sville Department of Social Services, an agency of the Commonwealth. Burns v. Charlottesville Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 8, 2005). Records of Virginia Workers Compensation Commission.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in finding that a certificate was not issued pursuant to § 65.2-710 because the certificate of authent ication was issued pursuant to the general authority of the commission under §§ 8.01-390 and 8.01-391, and th...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-391"><akn:num>§ 8.01-391</akn:num><akn:heading>Copies of originals as evidence (Subdivision (6) of Supreme Court Rule 2:902 derived in part from subsection D of this section and Supreme Court Ru le 2:1005 derived from this section)</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Whenever th e original of any official publication or other record has been filed in an action or introduced as evidence, the court may order the original to be returned to its custodian, retaining in its stead a copy thereof.

If any depa rtment, division, institution, agency, board, or commission of this Commonwealth, of another state or country, or of the United States, or of any political subdivision or agency of the same, acting pursuant to the law of the respective jurisdiction or ot her proper authority, has copied any record made in the performance of its official duties, such copy shall be as admissible into evidence as the original, whether the original is in existence or not, provided that such copy is authenticated as a true co py either by the custodian of said record or by the person to whom said custodian reports, if they are different, and is accompanied by a certificate that such person does in fact have the custody. C. If any cour t or clerks office of a court of this Commonwealth, of another state or country, or of the United States, or of any political subdivision or agency of the same, has copied any record made in the performance of its official duties, such copy shall be admissible into evidence as the original, whether the original is in existence or not, provided that such copy is authenticated as a true copy by a clerk or deputy clerk of such court. D. If any busi ness or member of a profession or calling in the regular course of business or activity has made any record or received or transmitted any document, and again in the regular course of business has caused any or all of such record or document to be copied , the copy shall be as admissible in evidence as the original, whether the original exists or not, provided that such copy is satisfactorily identified and authenticated as a true copy by a custodian of such record or by the person to whom said custodian reports, if they be different, and is accompanied by a certificate that said person does in fact have the custody. Such identification and authentication may be made through witness testimony or a certificate by affidavit or by declaration pursuant to § 8.01-4.3, or a combination of witness testimony and a certificate. Copies in the regular course of business shall be deemed to include reproduction at a later time, if done in good faith and without intent to defraud. Copies in the regular course of business shall include items such as checks which are regularly copied before transmission to another person or bank, or records which are acted upon without receipt of the original when the original is retained by another party. E. The origina l of which a copy has been made may be destroyed unless its preservation is required by law or its validity has been questioned. F. The introdu ction in an action of a copy under this section precludes neither the introduction or admission of the original nor the introduction of a copy or the original in another action. G.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-391 addresses the evidentiary status of copies of publications and records. Subsection A recognizes the authority of the court to exchange the origin al for a copy. Subsections B and C (now subsections B and D), respectively, place copies of official records covered by §§ 8.01-388 and 8.01-389 and business records on the same evidentiary footing as the original provided such copy is doubly authe nticated. Cross references. As to admissibility in evidence of reproductions of checks or drafts drawn by the Treasurer of Virginia, see § 2.2-1812. As to vouchers and statement of assets on hand, see § 64.2-1311. Editors note. Former § 8-266, one of the sections from which this § 8.01-391 derives, was amended by Acts 1977, c. 532. Since the substance of the amendment was already i ncorporated in § 8.01-391 as enacted by Acts 1977, c. 617, the Code Commission did not make any change in the above section pursuant to the amendatory act. At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the notation to the Virginia Rules of Evidence was added to the catchline of this section. Acts 2012, cc. 688 an d 708, cl. 6 provides: That pursuant to the authority set forth in §§ 30-146 and 30-147 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission shall direct any party with whom the Virginia Code Commission contracts to publish the Code of Virgini a to include in the catchline of every section of the Code of Virginia from which any rule contained in the Rules of Evidence has been derived a notation specifying such rule. The section catchline is set out above at the direction of the Virginia Code Commission in order to reflect the correct Supreme Court Rules from which it is deriv ed.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Exception to best evidence rule.  This section, which concerns copies of originals as evidence, is a statutory exception to the best evidence rule and, under subsection B, provides that, when prop erly authenticated, copies made of their official records by governmental entities acting pursuant to the law of the respective jurisdiction or other proper authority are as admissible as the original records, whether the original records are in existenc e or not. Williams v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 545, 546 S.E.2d 735, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 285 (2001). Availability of original irrelevant.  Under subsection B of this section, a copy of an official record is admissible without regard to the availability of the original if the copy is properly authenti cated. Williams v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 545, 546 S.E.2d 735, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 285 (2001). In order to admit a business record into evidence, it must be verified by testimony of t he entrant of the record or of a superior who testifies to the regular course of business. Sparks v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 279, 482 S.E.2d 69, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (1997). True copy  construed.  The legislature intended for the term true copy as it appears in § 46.2-882 to be controlled by the requirements for authenticating a true copy found i n subsection B of this section. Statutes must be construed consistently with each other so as to reasonably and logically effectuate their intended purpose. There is no conflict between this section and § 46.2-882; the former defines the requirements for authenticating a true copy, and the latter uses that term in a consistent manner. Untiedt v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 836, 447 S.E.2d 537, 11 Va. Law Rep. 131, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 561 (1994). Certified transfer order.  Trial court properly admitted a prior certified transfer order from a city indicating that the defendant had been convicted for burglary and a sentencing order de scribing the sentenced imposed for a burglary conviction because the city courts attestation proclaimed that each document was a true copy of a record in the court and the documents certified were part of that courts record. In addition, the cour t had sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant was a convicted felon and that he possessed contraband because the transfer order recited that the defendant had been found guilty of violating § 18.2-89. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 26 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 18, 2005), superseded, 46 Va. App. 408, 617 S.E.2d 431, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 324 (2005). Photocopy lacking proper attestation inadmissible.  While certificate admitted as evidence of the accuracy of the tuning forks used to calibrate the radar device contained a notary publics attestation, that att estation did not aver that the notary was the custodian of the original nor that she had (or had at the time) the original in her custody. Accordingly, the photocopy of the certificate was not a true copy within the meaning of the Code, but was, rather, inadmissible hearsay. Untiedt v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 836, 447 S.E.2d 537, 11 Va. Law Rep. 131, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 561 (1994). Trial court erred in admitting copies of certificates of tuning fork accuracy, which were offered into evidence to establish defendants speed, because, where the copies were not signed by the purported custodian or supervisor, they did not meet the requirements of §§ 8....</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-392"><akn:num>§ 8.01-392</akn:num><akn:heading>When court order book or equivalent is lost or illegible, what matters may be reentered</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When any book, microfilm record, or record in other form containing judgments, decrees, orders or proceedings of a court is lost, destroyed, or illegible, and there can be again entered correctly, by means of any writing, any matters which were in such book, such court may cause its clerk to have such matters reentered, and such reentries shall have the same effect as the original entries.

Lost Instruments and Records, § 11. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Effect of recording.  The act of the clerk admitting a paper to record is conclusive upon the question whether the paper is what it purports to be and evidence to prove that the copy w as not certified by the clerk whose name is affixed to the certificate but by another person, who was not authorized to make the certificate, is inadmissible in a collateral action. Taliaferro v. Pryor, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 277, 1855 Va. LEXIS 19 (1855). When copy of a copy admissible.  A paper offered in evidence was a certified copy taken from a county deed book which was made from an attested copy in 1894, by which paper it was shown that the original deed was recorded in 1874, that a certified copy was made in 1883, and that this copy was recorded in 1894. The testimony of the clerk and custodian of the county deed books was that the book in which the original deed was recorded was not in ex istence. The copy was admissible under this section. Virginia &amp; W. Va. Coal Co. v. Charles, 251 F. 83, 1917 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 780 (D. Va. 1917), aff'd, 254 F. 379, 1918 U.S. App. LEXIS 1313 (4th Cir. 1918). Original will and will-book having been destroyed, and a copy previously made from said will-book, and exhibited in a suit, having been withdrawn by leave and rec orded, a copy from the copy thus recorded must be taken, prima facie, as a true copy of the will. Effinger v. Hall, 81 Va. 94, 1885 Va. LEXIS 14 (1885). Copy from another county is inad missible.  When a copy of a deed taken from the deed book of one county which shows that the record was made from the attested copy of the deed taken from the deed book of a nother county, this section does not apply, and as evidence of the transfer of title the copy was inadmissible. Virginia &amp; W. Va. Coal Co. v. Charles, 251 F. 83, 1917 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 780 (D. Va. 1917), aff'd, 254 F. 379, 1918 U.S. App. LEXIS 1313 (4th C ir. 1918). When a copy of a deed was taken from a deed book of a certain county and it appeared from the county clerks certificate of admission to record that the paper presented to him was not the original deed, but was a copy, and no evidence was offered to show that any of the land conveyed lay in such county, the case did not come under the terms of either § 55-109 or this section and the copy was inadmissible.

Text A. Any person desirous of proving the contents of any such book, record, or other paper as is mentioned in either § 8.01-392 or § 8.01-393, may file before the circuit court of the county or city in which such record, book, or other paper was a petition in writi ng, stating the nature of the record, book, or paper, the contents of which he desires to prove, and what persons may be affected by such proof. Thereupon the court shall appoint a time and place for proceeding on such petition, of which reasonable notic e shall be given by him to all parties named in such petition, or interested in the proceedings, and to any others who shall be known to the court, or who shall claim to be so interested. If any party interested other than the petitioner, or who may be a ffected by the proof, be a person under a disability, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent his interest in the proceeding. B. The evidenc e upon said petition shall be in writing and filed, and the court shall make such order in respect to such record, book, or other paper, or anything therein, as may be necessary to secure the benefits thereof to the parties interested, or such other orde r as may be proper in the case.Before such court shall make such order, the petitioner shall cause to be served on the persons interested a notice in writing that he will apply for such order, in the manner provided by § 8.01-296, at least ten days be fore such order is to be made; but if such persons, or any of them, do not reside in this Commonwealth, or after due diligence cannot be found therein, an order of publication may be issued as provided by §§ 8.01-316 and 8.01-317.

Lost Instruments and Records, § 11. CASE NOTES Editors note. Many of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this statute and this section, as used below, m ay refer to former provisions. Applicability.  Absent authentication and/or certification of exhibit, Commonwealth was required to follow § 8.01-392 or this section to replace lost original conviction order . Johnson v. Commonwealth, No. 0348-98-4 (Ct. of Appeals June 22, 1999). Nature of statute.  This statute is only cumulative, and does not deprive the party of his remedy at common law. Smith v. Carter, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 167, 1825 Va. LEXIS 13 (1825). A party is under no obligation to avail himself of the provisions of this section. It gi ves only a cumulative remedy. Smith v. Carter, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 167, 1825 Va. LEXIS 13 (1825); Newcomb v. Drummond, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 57, 1832 Va. LEXIS 33 (1832); Corbett v. Nutt, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 624, 1868 Va.

After proof of loss of record of will, its contents may be established by parol and secondary evidence, such being the best proof the nature of the case admits of under this statute. Apperson v. Dowdy, 82 Va. 776, 1 S.E. 105, 1887 Va. LEXIS 145 (1887). Description of property and persons affected is jurisdictional.  Compliance with respect to naming the persons and describing the property which might be affected is necessary to give the court jurisdiction with regard to the s ubject matter, and the parties affected thereby. Mountain Mission School, Inc. v. White, 204 Va. 256, 130 S.E.2d 452, 1963 Va. LEXIS 141 (1963). Notice to interested parties.  The statute, in order to be valid must be construed as being intended to meet the requirements for due process of law under the Constitutions of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States. It is elementary that every man is entitled to a day in court to defend his rights, and that a decree rendered against him when he has had no opportunity for defense, is a nullity and may be so pronounced by any court w herein it may be drawn into controversy. Mountain Mission School, Inc. v. White, 204 Va. 256, 130 S.E.2d 452, 1963 Va. LEXIS 141 (1963). Effect of lapse of time.  Where 10 years after the destruction of a record, an effort is made to assail for the first time a title and possession long enjoyed, by proceedings to set up a l ost will upon evidence of its contents, by a witness then 85 years old testifying that 68 years before she had heard the will read and stating the testamentary disposition of the testators property, the testimony, though admissible, is insufficient.

CASE NOTES Section only cures irregularities.  This section is a curative statute only created to provide a remedy in addition to that afforded by the common law. It applies where there have been irregularitie s in the set up proceeding, but not to a null and void proceeding. It was not intended to breathe life into a proceeding which never had any validity.

CASE NOTES Child co mpetent to testify in sexual penetration trial.  Child victim, in an action charging defendant with animate object sexual penetration of a child under the age of 13, was found competent to testify where she prom ised to tell the truth about what happened, she stated that it would be bad to do otherwise, she testified that she remembered the incidents, and her account of the incidents paralleled defendants version of the events. The fact that the vict im had spoken to others about the incident did not, in itself, support the conclusion that she had no independent memory of the event or that her testimony was coached. Avalos v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 241 (Va. Ct. App. June 21, 2005). Child witness competent.  Circuit court carefully considered the relevant factors and did not abuse its discretion in finding a child witness competent to testify because it found that the child witness demonstrated good observational and recall skills, was mature and highly competent, had good verbal skills, and knew the difference between the truth and lies; those findings were supported by the footage of the forensic interview, as well as testimony from other witnesses.

Purpose.  One of the purposes of this section is to prevent a surviving party from having the benefit of his own testimony where, by reason of the death of his adversary, t he latters personal representative is deprived of the decedents version of the transaction. Hereford v. Paytes, 226 Va. 604, 311 S.E.2d 790, 1984 Va. LEXIS 302 (1984). The statute was designed to prevent an opportunity for the survivor to prevail by relying on his own unsupported credibility, while his opponent, who alone might have contradicted him, is silenced by death. Hereford v. Paytes, 226 Va. 604, 311 S.E.2d 790, 1984 Va. LEXIS 302 (1984). The statute substitutes a requirement that testimony be corroborated in place of the harsher common law rule which disqualified the surviving witness for interest . Diehl v. Butts, 255 Va. 482, 499 S.E.2d 833, 1998 Va. LEXIS 65 (1998). Phrase from any cause does not refer to the scope of issues before the tribunal, but rather to the cause of a partys incapacity to testify. Shumate v. Mitchell, 296 Va. 532, 822 S.E.2d 9, 2018 Va. LEXIS 195 (2018). Dead Mans Statute contains two distinct, but related, evidentiary rules applicable in actions by or against persons incapable of testifying or their represent atives; any relevant hearsay declaration of the decedent or incapacitated person is admissible even if the survivor does not testify. Shumate v. Mitchell, 296 Va. 532, 822 S.E.2d 9, 2018 Va. LEXIS 195 (2018). Adverse party and interested party distinguished.  The phrase adverse or interested party refers to two, distinct categories of persons, namely adverse parties and interested parties; an adverse party is one who is a party to the record while an interested party is one, not a party to the record, who is pecuniarily interested in the result of the suit. Stephens v. Caruthers, 97 F. Supp. 2d 698, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6507 (E.D. Va. 2000). Interested party.  A person is an interested party when that person is in some way beneficially interested in the judgment or decree that is sought to be obtained. In that r egard, a person has a beneficial interest in litigation where, inter alia, that person has an interest in the property concerned in the litigation that may be benefited or adversely affected by the result of the suit or a beneficial interest in the fund sought to be recovered. Stephens v. Caruthers, 97 F. Supp. 2d 698, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6507 (E.D. Va. 2000). Dead Mans Statute contains two distinct, but related, evidentiary rules applicable in actions by or against persons incapable of testifying or their represent atives; no judgment may be rendered for a testifying survivor unless his or her testimony is corroborated, and this corroboration requirement is inapplicable when another interested party whose interest derives from the decedent or incapacitated person t estifies on that persons behalf. Shumate v. Mitchell, 296 Va. 532, 822 S.E.2d 9, 2018 Va. LEXIS 195 (2018). Exception to defend against testimony of other interested party.  An exception to the bar of testimony by an interested party against a deceased party allows such testimony where some person, having an interest in or under a con tract or transaction derived from the party so incapable of testifying, has testified in behalf of the latter or of himself, as to such contract or transaction. Paul v. Gomez, 118 F. Supp. 2d 694, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15751 (W.D. Va. 2000). The Virginia dead mans statute did not apply to prevent a defendant physician from testifying to his version of the treatment he gave his patient where the pa tient was deceased but where the patients wife was present at the meetings between her husband and the physician and would testify as to the alleged negligent treatment. Paul v. Gomez, 118 F. Supp. 2d 694, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15751 (W.D. Va. 2000). Spouse who will benefit financially an interested party.  Where the party to the record in a will contest asserts that she is entitled to recover from a testators estate on the grounds that the testator had previousl y executed a joint and reciprocal will and declares that her spouse will share in the inheritance should the contest succeed, the spouse is an interested party whose testimony may not serve as corroborating evidence under the dead mans statut e. Stephens v. Caruthers, 97 F. Supp. 2d 698, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6507 (E.D. Va. 2000). Corroboration unnecessary where witness is not interested party.  Testimony elicited from a nurse regarding an order she received from a subsequently deceased doctor during the delivery of an infant did not require corroboration as the nurse was not an interested party for purposes of § 8.01-397; the testimony the nurse gave left her potentially liable under a contribution theory, and in any event, the testimony she gave regarding the order to apply fundal pressure w as neutral regarding the dispositive issue in the case, whether the order was given before or after the doctor had managed to free the infants shoulder from the birth canal. Jones v. Williams, 280 Va. 635, 701 S.E.2d 405, 2010 Va. LEXIS 259 (2010). The dead mans statute (this section) is inapplicable in instances where a plaintiff offers an adverse partys testimony in his case and that testimony is not contradicted or inherently improbable. Brown v. Metz, 240 Va. 127, 393 S.E.2d 402, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2658, 1990 Va. LEXIS 88 (1990). Argument that dead mans statute (this section) was not applicable because the jury u ltimately returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and, thus, no judgment was rendered in favor of an adverse or interested party was without merit because under this analysis, a trial court would be required to wait until after the jury rend ered a verdict before determining whether a partys testimony must be corroborated. Certainly this section does not mandate this illogical procedure. Diehl v. Butts, 255 Va. 482, 499 S.E.2d 833, 1998 Va. LEXIS 65 (1998). The deadmans statute (this section) is an evidentiary rule inapplicable to hearings before the Industrial (now Workers Compensation) Commission. Armada, Inc. v. Lucas, 2 Va. App. 414, 345 S.E.2d 14, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (1986...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-398"><akn:num>§ 8.01-398</akn:num><akn:heading>Privileged marital communications (Subsection (a) of Supreme Court Rule 2:504 derived from this section)</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Husband and wife shall be competent witnesses to testify for or against each other in all civil actions. In any civil proceeding, a person has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent anyone else from disclosing, any confidential communication between his spouse a nd him during their marriage, regardless of whether he is married to that spouse at the time he objects to disclosure. This privilege may not be asserted in any proceeding in which the spouses are adverse parties, or in which either spouse is charged wit h a crime or tort against the person or property of the other or against the minor child of either spouse. For the purposes of this section, confidential communication means a communication made privately by a person to his spouse that is not intended for disclosure to any other person. History History. Code 1950, §§ 8-287, 8-289; 1977, c. 617; 2005, c. 809. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Subsection A of § 8.01-398 is a combination of former §§ 8-287 and 8-289. The common-law rule that neither husband nor wife could sue the other has been eliminated by statute and case law except with respect to personal injury actions ( other than those arising out of an automobile accident). However, a change in the law of evidence has not accompanied this expansion of the spouses rights of action. Subsection B of this section therefore provides t hat if by the laws of this Commonwealth one spouse is permitted to sue the other, the privileged status of communications between the two made while married is abrogated as to such proceedings. Former § 8-288 (Testimony of husband and wife in criminal cases) was transferred to § 19.2-271.2. Cross references. As to testimony of husband and wife in criminal cases, see § 19.2-271.2. Editors note. At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the notation to the Virginia Rules of Evidence was added to the catchline of this section. Acts 2012, cc. 688 an d 708, cl. 6 provides: That pursuant to the authority set forth in §§ 30-146 and 30-147 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission shall direct any party with whom the Virginia Code Commission contracts to publish the Code of Virgini a to include in the catchline of every section of the Code of Virginia from which any rule contained in the Rules of Evidence has been derived a notation specifying such rule. The 2005 amendments.

Witnesses, §§ 7, 29. CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. The privilege embodied in this statute has been construed broadly to include all informa tion or knowledge privately imparted and made known by one spouse to the other by virtue of and in consequence of the marital relation through conduct, acts, signs, and spoken or written words. Burns v. Commonwealth, 261 Va. 307, 541 S.E.2d 872, 2001 Va. LEXIS 29, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1043, 122 S. Ct. 621, 151 L. Ed. 2d 542, 2001 U.S. LEXIS 10671 (2001). Applicability in criminal cases.  The phrase in § 19.2-271.2, subject to the exception stated in § 8.01-398 is construed as a cross-reference which embodies the proviso in this secti on concerning confidential communications. This has the effect of retaining, as a part of the law of criminal procedure, the historic interspousal confidential communication privilege which was formerly contained in § 8-289, notwithstanding the appare nt confinement of its successor statute, the present § 8.01-398, to civil actions. In the absence of an express enactment to that effect, the Supreme Court will not assume that the General Assembly intended to abrogate this long-standing rule. Church v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 208, 335 S.E.2d 823, 1985 Va. LEXIS 271 (1985). Defendants convictions for rape and forcible sodomy of defendants teenage stepdaughter were not obtained in violation of defendants ex post facto clau se rights; admission was proper of the testimony of the victims mother, defendants wife, of statements that defendant made to her and a tape recording the mother made containing defendants incriminating statements under amendments to §§ 8.01-398 and 19.2-271.2 since the evidence did not change the quantum of proof necessary to obtain the convictions but only changed the admissibility of evidence that could be offered to obtain the convictions. Carpenter v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 84, 654 S.E.2d 345, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 463 (2007). Admissibility of observations about attire.  There is no per se rule allowing the admission of spouses observations of others attire. Some acts, such as cross-dressing, or wearing bloody clothing, mi ght be considered confidential communications. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 470, 457 S.E.2d 797, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 494 (1995). Communication made during now-dissolved marriage.  The interspousal confidential communication privilege survived the dissolution of marriage. The confidential communications made by the defendant to his wife duri ng their marriage must be treated as privileged if the case is tried again. Church v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 208, 335 S.E.2d 823, 1985 Va. LEXIS 271 (1985). Permissible te stimony.  Wifes description of the defendants clothing, which he displayed in public when he left the home, was not a confidential communication. Further, it is rea sonable to infer that clothing worn in public was not intended to be kept private or confidential. Therefore, the wifes testimony about the defendants attire on the evening of the offense was properly admitted. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App . 470, 457 S.E.2d 797, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 494 (1995). The wifes testimony about the defendants interest in purchasing a car and his intent to test-drive a car with an older couple was also not the sort of com munication a spouse would reasonably consider of a secret nature between husband and wife. The information was not conveyed with an expression of confidentiality, nor did its content imply that it should be kept confidential. In fact, the defendant not o nly expressed his intent to the victim and his wife, but also arranged to meet them in a public place, further supporting a finding that this communication was not a marital secret. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 470, 457 S.E.2d 797, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 494 (1995). Defendants wifes testimony that the defendant instructed her over the phone to meet him at his relatives house was not disclosure of a secret communic ation because it lacked any objective indicia of confidential intent. If anything, the defendants actions indicate the opposite, since he instructed her to meet him at a place where other people would be present to witness the meeting. Edwards v. Com monwealth, 20 Va. App. 470, 457 S.E.2d 797, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 494 (1995). When the wife testified that she looked through the defendants belongings, which he had deposited in their bedroom outside of her presence, and found a wallet containing the victims drivers license and credit card, she was not describing a communication. While a spouses conduct may convey information to the other spouse and would, therefore, be privileged, a spouses conduct which does not conv ey information to the other spouse is not privileged. The former wifes discovery of the contents of the wallet conveyed information to her, as did the fact that she discovered it among the defendants belongings. However, the defendants conduc tleaving the wallet among his belongingswas not observed by the former wife and did not convey information to her. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 470, 457 S.E.2d 797, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 494 (1995). St atements properly admitted.  Because defendants communication to his estranged wife over a cell phone concerned acts for which the wife had a right of action against defendant, neither § 8.01-398 nor the exception in former § 19.2-271.2 forbade her testimony as to his statement. Braxton v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. July 18, 2006). Privilege inapplicable to testimony by third party.  The plain words utilized in this statutory provision limit the privilege to situations where a spouse is being examined in an action or is revealing a private com munication through testimony. The statute does not prevent a third party who is in possession of letters written by one spouse to the other, and who has gained that possession lawfully, from testifying. Burns v. Commonwealth, 261 Va. 307, 541 S.E.2d 872, 2001 Va. LEXIS 29, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1043, 122 S. Ct. 621, 151 L. Ed. 2d 542, 2001 U.S. LEXIS 10671 (2001). Immunity rests with testifying spouse.  Trial court erred in limiting defendants cross-examination of the alleged shooting victims wife, as neither the Commonwealth nor the victim had the right to invoke spousal immunity if the victims wife was willing to tes...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-399"><akn:num>§ 8.01-399</akn:num><akn:heading>Communications between physicians and patients (Supreme Court Rule 2:505 derived from this section)</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Except at t he request or with the consent of the patient, or as provided in this section, no duly licensed practitioner of any branch of the healing arts shall be permitted to testify in any civil action, respecting any information that he may have acquired in atte nding, examining or treating the patient in a professional capacity. B. If the phys ical or mental condition of the patient is at issue in a civil action, the diagnoses, signs and symptoms, observations, evaluations, histories, or treatment plan of the practitioner, obtained or formulated as contemporaneously documented during the cours e of the practitioners treatment, together with the facts communicated to, or otherwise learned by, such practitioner in connection with such attendance, examination or treatment shall be disclosed but only in discovery pursuant to the Rules of Court or through testimony at the trial of the action. In addition, disclosure may be ordered when a court, in the exercise of sound discretion, deems it necessary to the proper administration of justice. However, no order shall be entered compelling a party to sign a release for medical records from a health care provider unless the health care provider is not located in the Commonwealth or is a federal facility. If an order is issued pursuant to this section, it shall be restricted to the medical records t hat relate to the physical or mental conditions at issue in the case. No disclosure of diagnosis or treatment plan facts communicated to, or otherwise learned by, such practitioner shall occur if the court determines, upon the request of the patient, tha t such facts are not relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or do not appear to be reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Only diagnosis offered to a reasonable degree of medical probability shall be admissible at trial. C. This sectio n shall not (i) be construed to repeal or otherwise affect the provisions of § 65.2-607 relating to privileged communications between physicians and surgeons and employees under the Workers Compensation Act; (ii) apply to information communicated to any such practitioner in an effort unlawfully to procure a narcotic drug, or unlawfully to procure the administration of any such drug; or (iii) prohibit a duly licensed practitioner of the healing arts, or his agents, from disclosing information as r equired by state or federal law. D. Neither a l awyer nor anyone acting on the lawyers behalf shall obtain, in connection with pending or threatened litigation, information concerning a patient from a practitioner of any branch of the healing arts without the consent of the patient, except through discovery pursuant to the Rules of Supreme Court as herein provided. However, the prohibition of this subsection shall not apply to: 1. Commu nication between a lawyer retained to represent a practitioner of the healing arts, or that lawyers agent, and that practitioners employers, partners, agents, servants, employees, co-employees or others for whom, at law, the practitioner is or ma y be liable or who, at law, are or may be liable for the practitioners acts or omissions; 2. Information about a patient provided to a lawyer or his agent by a practitioner of the healing arts employed by that lawyer to examine or evaluate the patient in accordance with Rule 4 :10 of the Rules of Supreme Court; or 3. Contact between a lawyer or his agent and a nonphysician employee or agent of a practitioner of healing arts for any of the following purposes: (i) scheduling appearances, (ii) request ing a written recitation by the practitioner of handwritten records obtained by the lawyer or his agent from the practitioner, provided the request is made in writing and, if litigation is pending, a copy of the request and the practitioners response is provided simultaneously to the patient or his attorney, (iii) obtaining information necessary to obtain service upon the practitioner in pending litigation, (iv) determining when records summoned will be provided by the practitioner or his agent, (v) determining what patient records the practitioner possesses in order to summons records in pending litigation, (vi) explaining any summons that the lawyer or his agent caused to be issued and served on the practitioner, (vii) verifying dates the practit ioner treated the patient, provided that if litigation is pending the information obtained by the lawyer or his agent is promptly given, in writing, to the patient or his attorney, (viii) determining charges by the practitioner for appearance at a deposi tion or to testify before any tribunal or administrative body, or (ix) providing to or obtaining from the practitioner directions to a place to which he is or will be summoned to give testimony.

F. Nothing her ein shall prevent a duly licensed practitioner of the healing arts, or his agents, from disclosing any information that he may have acquired in attending, examining or treating a patient in a professional capacity where such disclosure is necessary in co nnection with the care of the patient, the protection or enforcement of a practitioners legal rights including such rights with respect to medical malpractice actions, or the operations of a health care facility or health maintenance organization or in order to comply with state or federal law.

CASE NOTES To whom privilege granted.  The plain meaning of this section grants the privilege only to the minister, priest or rabbi, not to the penitent or lay communicant. Seidman v. Fishburne-Hudgins Educ. Found., Inc., 724 F.2d 413, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 26635 (4th Cir. 1984). Consent of penitent not required for disclosure.  Most penitent-priest statutes have a common feature: they explicitly prohibit the clergyman from disclosing the contents of a confidential communication witho ut the consent of the person making the communication. Significantly, this section contains no such prohibition; it simply says that no regular minister, priest, rabbi or accredited practitioner . . . shall be required to disclose any information  entrusted to him in a confidential conversation. This language plainly invests the priest with the privilege and leaves it to his conscience to decide when disclosure is appropriate. Seidman v. Fishburne-Hudgins Educ. Found., Inc., 724 F.2d 413, 198 4 U.S. App. LEXIS 26635 (4th Cir. 1984). Penitents disclosures treated differently from disclosures to doctor or psychologist.  The legislature included provisions in §§ 8.01-399 and 8.01-400.2 which allow communicants to require doctors or psychologists to give testimony concerning confidential disclosures. The legislatures omission of a similar provision from the priest-penitent statute strongly indicates that the clergymans privilege cannot be affected by the communicant. Seidman v. Fishburne-Hudgins Educ. Found., Inc., 7 24 F.2d 413, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 26635 (4th Cir. 1984). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Disclosure to third party.  Where a minister did not provide counseling services to the husband as a minister, but as a counselor for compensation and the husband shared the information with a psychologist, the ministers records could be discovered by the wife.

CASE NOTES Testimony of marriage counselor.  Admission of marriage counselors testimony was not an abuse of discretion where the trial court was required to consider the physical and mental conditions of the parties in determining spousal support and equitable distribution under §§ 20-107.1 and 20-107.3, and thus, the exception to § 8.01-400.2, permitted the admissibility of the otherwise privileged communications.

Contem pt proceedings involving a mother in divorce case.  Contempt finding against a mother in a divorce proceeding was reversed, because the trial court violated former § 20-124.3:1 by permitting the father to admit testimony about the mother from the mental health care provider appointed by the trial court to counsel the parties children. Schwartz v. Schwartz, 46 Va. App. 145, 616 S.E.2d 59, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 296 (2005).

I.Decisions Under Current Law. Ap plicability of subsection A.  Subsection A has been held applicable to criminal cases, and in that subsection, the word party is not limited to litigants. Sluss v. Commonwealth, No. 12 52-93-3 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 10, 1995). Refusal to answer questions pertinent to the issues involved.  Implicit in subsection B of this section is the requirement that the party who is seeking affirmative relief and who has exercised the privilege against self-incr imination must have refused to answer questions pertinent to the issues involved; such party asserting the privilege must have frustrated an attempt by the other party to obtain information relevant to the cause of action alleged and to possible defenses to the claim. Davis v. Davis, 233 Va. 452, 357 S.E.2d 495, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2710, 1987 Va. LEXIS 214 (1987). Where the plaintiffs claims dealt with recovery of one-half of the proceeds of a cashiers check, the assertion by the defendant of his constitutional righ t against self-incrimination bore on issues relevant to those claims; however, the claims of the defendant set forth in the crossbill and counterclaim dealt with demands for debts allegedly due him by his former wife based on credit card charges and othe r advances made on her behalf, and his refusal to answer questions about the negotiation of the check was not pertinent to the issues involved in the claims which he sought to prosecute, nor did such conduct frustrate any attempt by the plaintiff to obta in information relevant to his claims against her or possible defenses to those claims; consequently, the trial court erred in striking the cross-bill and counterclaim pursuant to subsection B of this section. Davis v. Davis, 233 Va. 452, 357 S.E.2d 495, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2710, 1987 Va. LEXIS 214 (1987). Scope of examination of adverse witness.  This section, which applies in both criminal and civil actions, provides that a party may call to the stand a witness having an adverse interest and may e xamine the witness according to the rules applicable to cross-examination. Weller v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 886, 434 S.E.2d 330, 10 Va. Law Rep. 110, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 335 (1993). An employee of a party litigant is not per se an adverse witness. Hegwood v. Virginia Na tural Gas, Inc., 256 Va. 362, 505 S.E.2d 372, 1998 Va. LEXIS 103 (1998). Witness must be hostile or adverse for this rule to apply.  The application of this rule is limited to instances when it is clear that the witness is in fact hostile or adverse at trial. The determination of whether a witn ess is unwilling or hostile is a matter that rests with the discretion of the trial court. Weller v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 886, 434 S.E.2d 330, 10 Va. Law Rep. 110, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 335 (1993). This section also applies where the witness has no adverse interest, but is shown to be adverse or hostile to the party introducing him. Weller v. Commonw ealth, 16 Va. App. 886, 434 S.E.2d 330, 10 Va. Law Rep. 110, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 335 (1993). Adverse interest is more than testimony being adverse to calling party.  A nonparty witness does not have an adverse interest simply because his or her testimony is adverse to the calling party. The test is not whether the witn ess testimony would necessarily be adverse, but whether the witness has an adverse interest. Weller v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 886, 434 S.E.2d 330, 10 Va. Law Rep. 110, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 335 (1993). Adverse party may be impeached by prior inconsistent statements.  Where driver hit victim in a car accident, and the trial court permitted driver to call victim to the stand as a part of his case in rebuttal, solely to impeach h er credibility, trial court did not err in permitting such impeachment on rebuttal even though it could have been done earlier in the cross-examination of victim, subsection A and § 8.01-403 do not preclude impeachment of an adverse party by prior inc onsistent statements. Mastin v. Theirjung, 238 Va. 434, 384 S.E.2d 86, 6 Va. Law Rep. 587, 1989 Va. LEXIS 140 (1989). Refusal to allow cross-examination as adverse witness proper.  The trial court properly refused to allow the defendant to cross-examine a defense witness who testified that he was at home at the time of the crimes at issue as an adverse witness, since the witness had been totally exonerated of the crimes by DNA testing, especially as the court allowed the defendant to thoroughly question the witness regarding his conflicting statements to the police. Painter v. Commonwealth, No. 1502-97-1 (Ct. of Appeals April 7, 1998). Refusal to allow cross-examination was error.  Trial court erred when it did not permit a husband to cross-examine a wifes handwriting expert and a factual witness regarding the parties disputed marita l agreement. Because an opportunity to cross-examine was a fundamental right, the trial court abused its discretion by its arbitrary refusal to allow any cross-examination whatsoever. Campbell v. Campbell, 49 Va. App. 498, 642 S.E.2d 769, 2007 Va. App. L EXIS 141 (2007). Impeachment of Commonwealths own witness held improper.  Trial court erred in allowing prosecution to impeach its own witness; the Commonwealth should not have been allowed to impeach the witness merely because the witn esss testimony did not live up to expectations. Smallwood v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. App. 483, 553 S.E.2d 140, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 550 (2001). No abu se of discretion found.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen the Commonwealths case for further cross-examination of the victim as defendant had the opportu nity to call the victim as his own witness under the rules applicable to cross-examination under § 8.01-401. Mott v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 16, 2003). There was no abuse of discretion in declaring defendants brother to be a hostile witness because the brother was a person with an interest adverse to the pros ecution. Teleguz v. Commonwealth, 273 Va. 458, 643 S.E.2d 708, 2007 Va. LEXIS 64 (2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1191, 128 S. Ct. 1228, 170 L. Ed. 2d 78, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1412 (2008). Trial court did not deny a mother her right to cross-examine her partner because it provided the mother with substantial latitude to cross-examine the partner, ev en though the mothers allotted time had already expired. Higgins v. Pearce, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 296 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 28, 2017). Preservation for review.  Defendant failed to preserve for review any error in the denial of a request to treat a witness as adverse because defendants request at trial was based on in jurious or damaging testimony under Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-403 and did not assert that the witness had an adverse interest under this section as contended on appeal. Ellis v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 44 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2022). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Strict construction required.  Subsection B of this section is in derogation of the common law, and, therefore, must be strictly construed. VEPCO v. Bowers, 181 Va. 542, 25 S.E.2d 361, 1943 Va. LEXIS 202 (1943). Section applies to criminal cases as well as civil cases.  The Supreme Court held in McCue v. Commonwealth, 103 Va. 870, 49 S.E. 623 (1905), that this section applies to criminal cases as well as civil cases. Trout v. Com monwealth, 167 Va. 511, 188 S.E. 219, 1936 Va.

What constitutes adverse interest defined.  By the use of the words having an adverse interest, in this section, the legislature intended to include, first, a party to the litigation, and, second, a person, though not a party, who had a financial or other personal interest in the outcome.

This section applies to criminal as well as civil cases. Brown v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App . 82, 366 S.E.2d 716, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2297, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 19 (1988). Adverse co nstrued.  This section refers only to a witness who proves adverse, namely, a witness whom the party expected to testify favorably has suddenly turned sour and testified unfavorably. The determination whether a witness has proved to be adverse rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Sluss v. Commonwealth, No. 1252-93-3 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 10, 1995). Testimony of witness did not prove adverse within meaning of this section, but only failed to meet defendants expectations, and defense counsel was th erefore not entitled to impeach witness under this section. Fetty v. Commonwealth, No. 0176-99-2 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 1, 2000). A partys own witness proves adverse if the witness surprises the party by changing stories or becoming hostile on the stand. Wells v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App . 775, 531 S.E.2d 16, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 498 (2000). Error in finding witness hostile.  Trial court abused its discretion in finding a witness to be hostile and adverse solely as a consequence of his desire to be evasive, but the error was harmless; the remaining evidence against defendant was substantial, and declaring the witness hostile or adverse did not affect the verdict or otherwise deprive defendant of a fair trial on the merits. Carter v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 293 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 1, 2016). Prior inconsistent statements are admitted solely to attack credibility of witness who h as told different stories at different times. They are not evidence of the truth of the content of the statements, and the court must so instruct the jury. Hall v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 369, 355 S.E.2d 591, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2484, 1987 Va. LEXIS 202 (1987). Adverse party may be impeached by prior inconsistent statements.  Where driver hit victim in a car accident, and the trial court permitted driver to call victim to the stand as a part of his case in rebuttal, solely to impeach h er credibility, trial court did not err in permitting such impeachment on rebuttal even though it could have been done earlier in the cross-examination of victim, § 8.01-401 A and this section do not preclude impeachment of an adverse party by prior i nconsistent statements. Mastin v. Theirjung, 238 Va. 434, 384 S.E.2d 86, 6 Va. Law Rep. 587, 1989 Va. LEXIS 140 (1989). Defendants convictions for statutory burglary, attempted robbery, unlawful wounding, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony were proper because th e trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that the Commonwealths witness had proven adverse and allowing the Commonwealth to impeach her with her prior inconsistent statement. Although the Commonwealth knew that the witness was reluct ant to testify based on the March 3, 2008, interview, it did not know that she was going to recant her previous statement and testify currently that the assailant was not defendant. Clatterbaugh v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (Va. Ct. App. July 27, 2010). Foundation mus t be laid.  The statute clearly requires that a foundation be laid by confronting the witness with the specific statements he allegedly made. Underwood v. Brown, 1 Va. App. 3 18, 338 S.E.2d 854, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 201 (1986). Impeachment is not allowed if testimony simply fails to meet litigants expectations. Underwood v. Brown, 1 Va. App. 318, 338 S.E.2d 854, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 201 (1986). If testimony is negative in character and of no probative value to the fact finder, ther e is no statutory basis for impeachment. Underwood v. Brown, 1 Va. App. 318, 338 S.E.2d 854, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 201 (1986). Impeachment improper where testimony conformed with affidavit.  Where trial counsel testified at the plenary hearing on the habeas corpus petition in conformance with his affidavit, which was filed over five months prior to th e hearing, the habeas court should not have allowed petitioners counsel at the hearing to impeach trial counsels testimony at the hearing with evidence of alleged prior inconsistent statements, since counsel at the hearing could not reasonably cl aim surprise. The fact that the trial counsel did not recall the alleged inconsistent statements made during an earlier telephone conversation carried no probative value. Underwood v. Brown, 1 Va. App. 318, 338 S.E.2d 854, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 201 (1986). Impeachment not erroneously allowed where questions wer e for purpose of resolving inconsistency.  The court did not erroneously permit the Commonwealth to impeach one of its witnesses, the local medical examiner, whose testimony allegedly proved adverse to the Commonwealth, where the questions put to the local medical examiner were simply to resolve an apparent inconsistency in his testimony and introduce his best recollection. Williams v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 168, 360 S.E.2d 361, 4 Va. Law Rep. 570, 1987 Va . LEXIS 258 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1020, 108 S. Ct. 733, 98 L. Ed. 2d 681, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 90 (1988). Refusal to allow impeachment was harmless under non-constitutional standa rd.  Trial courts error in denying defense counsels motion to impeach his own witness based on her prior inconsistent statement as to the shooters clothing was harmless under the non-constitutional standard as the jury resolved the issue of the shooters clothing by crediting the Commonwealths witnesses, who based their in-court identifications of defendant on face recognition, not clothing. Dupree v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 535 (Dec. 28, 2005), revd, 272 Va. 496, 635 S.E.2d 676 (2006), as to harmless error. Exclusion of impeachment testimony by defendants witness.  Circuit court erred under § 8.01-403 by refusing to allow defendant to question his own witness about a prior inconsistent statement regarding what the shooter was wearing, and the error was not harmless because the question of what the shooter was wearing was a crucial issue of fact as a result of the governments witnesses inconsistent recollections on that subject, and because the jury might have bee n swayed by the witnesss impeachment testimony, it was impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected by its exclusion. Dupree v. Commonwealth, 272 Va. 496, 635 S.E.2d 676, 2006 Va. LEXIS 92 (2006). Impeachment of Commonwealths own witness held improper.  Trial court should not have allowed the Commonwealth to impeach its own witness merely because witnesss testimony regarding her affair with defendant did not live up to the Commonwealths expectations. Smallwood v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. App. 483, 553 S.E.2d 140, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 550 (2001). Impeachment compared to refreshing memory of witness.  Trial court did not allow the Commonwealth to impeach its own witness as prohibited by § 8.01-403, but rather properly allowed the Commonwealth to refresh the memory of the witness after the witness stated that she was unable to recall certain statements she had made to police investigators, and defendant failed to include either the tape played to refresh the witnesss memory or the contents of the tape in the record on appeal as required by Sup. Ct. R. 5A:25. Brockenbrough v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 243 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 22, 2003). Refusal to allow impeachment held proper.  The trial court properly refused to allow the defendant to impeach a defense witness under this section, since the witness had been totally exonerated of the crim es by DNA testing and his testimony was not damaging or injurious to the defendants case, especially as the court allowed the defendant to thoroughly question the witness regarding his conflicting statements to the police. Painter v. Commonwealth, No . 1502-97-1 (Ct. of Appeals April 7, 1998).

Contradiction by prior inconsistent writing (Subdivision (b)(i) of Supreme Court Rule 2:613 derived in part from this section and subdivision (b)(i i) of Supreme Court Rule 2:613 derived from this section). Text A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, relative to the subject matter of the civil action, without su ch writing being shown to him; but if it is intended to contradict such witness by the writing, his attention must, before such contradictory proof can be given, be called to the particular occasion on which the writing is supposed to have been made, and he may be asked if he did not make a writing of the purport of the one to be offered to contradict him, and if he denies making it, or does not admit its execution, it shall then be shown to him, and if he admits its genuineness, he shall be allowed to make his own explanation of it; but it shall be competent for the court at any time during the trial to require the production of the writing for its inspection, and the court may thereupon make such use of it for the purpose of the trial as it may think best. This section is subject to the qualification, that in an action to recover for a personal injury or death by wrongful act or neglect, no ex parte affidavit or statement in writing other than a deposition, after due notice, of a witness and no extr ajudicial recording made at any time other than simultaneously with the wrongful act or negligence at issue of the voice of such witness, or reproduction or transcript thereof, as to the facts or circumstances attending the wrongful act or neglect compla ined of, shall be used to contradict him as a witness in the case. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the use of any such ex parte affidavit or statement in an action on an insurance policy based upon a judgment recovered in a persona l injury or death by wrongful act case.

Exclusionary sentence did not apply to document.  Where investigator for bus company wrote out a statement from plaintiff who was in a car accident, and where investigator testified as to the writing, exclusionar y sentence (second sentence)of this section did not prohibit bus companys use of bus company investigators document to contradict plaintiff, whether in her cross-examination or by its use as part of the bus companys case in chief, as the writ ten document was neither signed by the plaintiff nor in the handwriting of the plaintiff. However, the document should not have been made an exhibit. Scott v. Greater Richmond Transit Co., 241 Va. 300, 402 S.E.2d 214, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1723, 1991 Va. LEXIS 30 (1991). Prior statements admissible as party admissions in plaintiffs case-in -chief.  This section does not preclude the introduction of a witness prior written statement as a party admission in a plaintiffs case-in-chief. A trial court imp roperly extended the reach of this section and, by doing so, prevented an administrator in a wrongful death suit from admitting the statements of various police officers as party admissions in the administrators case-in-chief to prove the events surrounding the shooting death of an arrestee. Gray v. Rhoads, 268 Va. 81, 597 S.E.2d 93, 2004 Va. LEXIS 100 (2004). Use of prior inconsistent statement.  Attorney for a motorist in an auto accident case could have properly cross-examined the accident victim concerning the content of the transcript of a telephone co nversation between the victim and the motorists insurer because § 8.01-404 only prohibited the use of a written statement itself to directly impeach a witness. The fact that the conversation was reduced to writing did not prevent the motorists attorney from attempting to prove the inconsistencies in the victims claims by questioning the victim about the oral statements that the victim made. Ruhlin v. Samaan, 282 Va. 371, 718 S.E.2d 447, 2011 Va. LEXIS 225 (2011). Use of a transcript made from a prior recorded telephone conversation between an accident victim and the insurance company for a motorist to refresh the victim s recollection did not implicate the prohibitions in § 8.01-404 and the circuit court did not err by permitting such use.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Writings not per se admissible under section.  This section does not per se render admissible in evidence a writing which independently of the statute would be inadmissible. The use herein referred to means le gitimate use. Ellison v. Commonwealth, 130 Va. 748, 107 S.E. 697, 1921 Va. LEXIS 190 (1921). This section is confined to the contradiction of a witness by the introduction of a prio r inconsistent statement in writing. Harris v. Harrington, 180 Va. 210, 22 S.E.2d 13, 1942 Va. LEXIS 160 (1942); Alspaugh v. Diggs, 195 Va. 1, 77 S.E.2d 362, 1953 Va. LEXIS 171 (1953). Motion to suppress deposition for violation of this section made too late.  See Ketchmark v. Lindauer, 198 Va. 42, 92 S.E.2d 286, 1956 Va. LEXIS 173 (1956). Contradictory evidence must be introduced by leave of court and after the witness has be en fully put on guard with respect to it. Green v. Commonwealth, 122 Va. 862, 94 S.E. 940, 1918 Va. LEXIS 142 (1918). And proper foundation must be laid.  This section was intended to permit the introduction of a prior inconsistent statement only after a proper foundation is laid. Saunders v. Hall, 176 Va. 526, 11 S .E.2d 592, 1940 Va. LEXIS 272 (1940). Error to force defendant to produce statement when foundation not laid.  In the instant case while a witness was being examined in chief by counsel for the plaintiff, he stated that they claim I heard the whistle blow and the gong was sounded, but I did not hear either one, I didnt see the train even. To this counsel for defendant objected. Thereupon counsel for plaintiff called on defendants counsel to produce any statement they have now, and the court compell ed counsel for defendant, over their objection, to produce a statement in their possession which the witness had previously made to an agent of the company as to the blowing of the whistle and sounding of the gong. The statement of the witness had in no way been mentioned or referred to by counsel for the defendant. It had not been produced in court and made use of in the examination of the witness. This was held error. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Wilkes' Adm'r, 137 Va. 302, 119 S.E. 122, 1923 Va. LEXIS 157 (19 23). Cross-examination as to the contents of paper.  After a witness has been put on his guard and questioned as to the contents of a paper which he said he had rewritten, he may, on cross-examination, be further as ked if he had not on a former occasion (fixing time and place) made statements contradictory of his testimony as to the contents of the paper, for the purpose of testing the witness as to his recollection and credibility, and of contradicting him, if he denies it. Lester v. Simpkins, 117 Va. 55, 83 S.E. 1062, 1915 Va. LEXIS 10 (1915). No necessity of introducing writing when admitted by witness.  Where in a prosecution for larceny, witnesss attention was called to statements made by him in a prior affidavit relating to the same matter which were in con flict with his present testimony, and he was asked to explain the conflict, the defendant was not obliged to show the affidavit to the witness at this stage of his examination, and, as witness admitted making the affidavit, was under no obligation to sho w it to him or offer it in evidence. Ellison v. Commonwealth, 130 Va. 748, 107 S.E. 697, 1921 Va. LEXIS 190 (1921).

A summons m ay be issued, directed as prescribed in § 8.01-292, commanding the officer to summon any person to attend on the day and at the place that such attendance is desired, to give evidence before a court, grand jury, arbitrators, magistrate, notary, or any commissioner or other person appointed by a court or acting under its process or authority in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity. The summons may be issued by the clerk of the court if the attendance is desired at a court or in a proceeding pending i n a court. The clerk shall not impose any time restrictions limiting the right to properly request a summons up to and including the date of the proceeding:If attendance is desired before a commissioner in chancery or other commissioner of a court, the s ummons may be issued by the clerk of the court in which the matter is pending, or by such commissioner in chancery or other commissioner;If attendance is desired before a notary or other officer taking a deposition, the summons may be issued by such nota ry or other officer at the instance of the attorney desiring the attendance of the person sought;If attendance is sought before a grand jury, the summons may be issued by the attorney for the Commonwealth, or the clerk of the court, at the instance of th e attorney for the Commonwealth.Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if attendance is desired in a civil proceeding pending in a court or at a deposition in connection with such proceeding, including medical malpractice review panels, and a c laim before the Workers Compensation Commission, a summons may be issued by an attorney-at-law who is an active member of the Virginia State Bar at the time of issuance, as an officer of the court. An attorney-issued summons shall be on a form approv ed by the Supreme Court, signed by the attorney and shall include the attorneys address. The summons and any transmittal sheet shall be deemed to be a pleading to which the provisions of § 8.01-271.1 shall apply. A copy of the summons and, if serv ed by a sheriff, all service of process fees, shall be mailed or delivered to the clerks office of the court in which the case is pending or the Workers Compensation Commission, as applicable, on the day of issuance by the attorney. The law gover ning summonses issued by a clerk shall apply mutatis mutandis. When an attorney-at-law who is an active member of the Virginia State Bar transmits one or more attorney-issued subpoenas to a sheriff to be served in his jurisdiction, such subpoenas shall b e accompanied by a transmittal sheet. The transmittal sheet, which may be in the form of a letter, shall contain for each subpoena (i) the person to be served, (ii) the name of the city or county in which the subpoena is to be served, in parentheses, (ii i) the style of the case in which the subpoena was issued, (iv) the court in which the case is pending, and (v) the amount of fees tendered or paid to each clerk in whose court the case is pending together with a photocopy of either (a) the payment instr ument and a photocopy of the letter sent to the clerks office that accompanied such payment instrument or (b) the clerks receipt. If copies of the same transmittal sheet are used to send subpoenas to more than one sheriff for service of process, then subpoenas shall be grouped by the jurisdiction in which they are to be served. For each person to be served, an original subpoena and copy thereof shall be included. If the attorney desires a return copy of the transmittal sheet as proof of receipt, he shall also enclose an additional copy of the transmittal sheet together with an envelope addressed to the attorney with sufficient first class postage affixed. Upon receipt of such transmittal, the transmittal sheet shall be date-stamped and, if the extra copy and above-described envelope are provided, the copy shall also be date-stamped and returned to the attorney-at-law in the above-described envelope.However, when such transmittal does not comply with the provisions of this section, the sheriff may promptly return such transmittal if accompanied by a short description of such noncompliance. An attorney may not issue a summons in any of the following civil proceedings: (a) habeas corpus under Article 3 (§ 8.01-654 et seq.) of Chapter 25 of th is title, (b) delinquency or abuse and neglect proceedings under Article 3 (§ 16.1-241 et seq.) of Chapter 11 of Title 16.1, (c) civil forfeiture proceedings, (d) administrative license suspension pursuant to § 46.2-391.2, and (e) petition for writ s of mandamus or prohibition in connection with criminal proceedings. A sheriff shall not be required to serve an attorney-issued subpoena that is not issued at least five business days prior to the date that attendance is desired.In other cases, if atte ndance is desired, the summons may be issued by the clerk of the circuit court of the county or city in which the attendance is desired.A summons shall express on whose behalf, and in what case or about what matter, the witness is to attend. Failure to r espond to any such summons shall be punishable by the court in which the proceeding is pending as for contempt. When any subpoena is served less than five calendar days before appearance is required, the court may, after considering all of the circumstan ces, refuse to enforce the subpoena for lack of adequate notice. If any subpoena is served less than five calendar days before appearance is required upon any judicial officer generally incompetent to testify pursuant to § 19.2-271, such subpoena shal l be without legal force or effect unless the subpoena has been issued by a judge. B. No subpoena shall, without permission of the court first obtained, issue for the attendance of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, or Attorney General of this Commonwealth, a judge of any court thereof; the President or Vice President of the United States; any membe r of the Presidents Cabinet; any ambassador or consul; or any military officer on active duty holding the rank of admiral or general.

CASE NOTES District courts have no authority to order transportation in civil cases.  The authority to issue prisoner transportation orders in civil cases granted by this section is vested solely in the circuit courts. By expressly granting the spe cific authority to issue prisoner transportation orders in civil cases in this statute only to the circuit courts, the general assembly intended to exclude the general district courts from the authority to issue prisoner transportation orders in civil ca ses.

Motion for transportat ion to adoption hearing.  Trial court abused its discretion by denying the biological fathers motion for a transportation order enabling him to attend a hearing on a petition for adopt ion filed by the childs step-father, because the father was prohibited from participating in the adoption hearing that resulted in the termination of his parental rights and irreversibly severed his legal connection to his daughter.

The cases annotated below were decided under former Article 6 (§ 8.01-411 et seq.) of Chapter 14 of Title 8.01. Discovery denied to anonymous pl aintiff.  The circumstances did not present a situation where comity should have been granted to an Indiana courts order permitting a plaintiff to proceed anonymously a nd the plaintiff thus could not pursue discovery in Virginia under the Uniform Foreign Depositions Act where it was uncertain whether personal jurisdiction might be obtained over any of the anonymous defendants and where, although the Indiana court permi tted the plaintiff to proceed anonymously, it was clear that no hearing was held concerning the question, no evidence was received by the court, no reasons for the decision were given, and the order permitting anonymous maintenance of the action was gran ted in a non-adversarial, ex parte proceeding. Significantly, because no evidence was received and no reasons for the decision were given by the Indiana court, it could not be determined whether the procedural and substantive law applied by the Indiana c ourt was reasonably comparable to that of Virginia.

Text A. In any case where the health records of a health care provider for any patient in a hospital or institution for the treatment of physical or mental illness are admissible or would be admissible as evidence, any typewritten copy, photograph, photostatted copy, or mi crophotograph or printout or other hard copy generated from computerized or other electronic storage, microfilm, or other photographic, mechanical, electronic, imaging, or chemical storage process thereof shall be admissible as evidence in any court of t he Commonwealth in like manner as the original, if the printout or hard copy or microphotograph or photograph is properly authenticated by the employees having authority to release or produce the original health records. Any health care provider whose health records relating to any such patient are subpoenaed for production as provided by law may comply with the subpoena by a timely mai ling to the clerk issuing the subpoena or in whose court the action is pending properly authenticated copies, photographs or microphotographs in lieu of the originals. The court whose clerk issued the subpoena or, in the case of an attorney-issued subpoe na, in which the action is pending, may, after notice to such health care provider, enter an order requiring production of the originals, if available, of any stored health records whose copies, photographs or microphotographs are not sufficiently legibl e. Except as provided in subsection G, the party requesting the subpoena duces tecum or on whose behalf an attorney-issued subpoena duces tecum was issued shall be liable for the reasonable charges of the health care provider for the service of maintaining, retrieving, reviewing, preparing, copying, and mailing the items produced pursuant to subsections B2, B3, B4, and B6, as applicable. B. Copies of h ealth records, including an audit trail of any additions, deletions, or revisions to the health record, if specifically requested, shall be furnished within 30 days of receipt of such request to the patient, his attorney, his executor or administrator, o r an authorized insurer upon such patients, attorneys, executors, administrators, or authorized insurers written request, which request shall comply with the requirements of subsection E of § 32.1-127.1:03.

In any such case, if requested by the patient or his attorney or authorized insurer, such health records shall be furnished within 30 days of the date of such request to the patients attorney or authorized insurer, rat her than to the patient. If the health records are not provided to the patient in accordance with this section, then, if requested by the patient, the health care provider denying the request s hall comply with the patients request to either (i) provide a copy of the health records to a physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor of the patients choice whose licensure, training, and exper ience, relative to the patients condition, are at least equivalent to that of the treating physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor upon whose opinion the denial is based, who shall, at the patient s expense, make a judgment as to whether to make the health records available to the patient or (ii) designate a physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor whose licensure, training, and experience, r elative to the patients condition, are at least equivalent to that of the treating physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor upon whose opinion the denial is based and who did not participate in the original decision to deny the patients request for his health records, who shall, at the expense of the provider denying access to the patient, review the health records and make a judgment as to whether to make the health records available to the pa tient. In either such event, the health care provider denying the request shall comply with the judgment of the reviewing physician, clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, or licensed professional counselor. Except as provided in subsection G, a reasonable charge may be made by the health care provider maintaining the health records for the cost of the services relating to the maintenance, retrieval, review, and preparation of the copies of the health records, pursuant to subsections B2, B3, B4, and B6, as applicable. Any health care provider receiving such a request from a patients attorney or authorized insurer shall require a writing signed by the patient confirming the attorneys or authorized insurers authority to make the request, which shall comply with the requirements of subsection G of § 32.1-127.1:03, and shall accept a photocopy, facsimile, or ot her copy of the original signed by the patient as if it were an original. B1. A health c are provider shall produce the health records in either paper, hard copy, or electronic format, as requested by the requester. If the health care provider does not maintain the items being requested in an electronic format and does not have the capabilit y to produce such items in an electronic format, such items shall be produced in paper or other hard copy format. B2.

Any other portion otherwise maintained in electronic storage shall be produced electronically. The total search and handling fee shall not exceed $20 for any production made pursuant to this subsection where the production contains bo th health records in electronic format and health records in paper or other hard copy format. B5. Upon reque st, a patients account balance or itemized listing of charges maintained by a health care provider shall be supplied at no cost up to three times every 12 months to either the patient or the patients attorney.

In a civil action in any court, whether sounding in contract or tort, to recover for damages to a motor vehicle of $2,500 or less, evidence as to such damages may be presented by an itemized estimate or appraisal sworn to by a person who also makes oath (i) that he is a motor vehicle repairman, estimator or appraiser qualified to determine the amount of such damage or diminution in value; (ii) as to the approximate length of time that he has engaged in such work; and (iii) as to the trade name and address of his b usiness and employer. History History. 1977, c. 617; 1980, c. 183; 1990, c. 724; 2010, c. 343. Annotations REVISERS NOTE The admission into evidence of an ex parte estimate of the damages to a motor vehicle, now applicable pursuant to § 16.1-88.1 only to general district courts, is made applicable by this section to all courts. Editors note. Section 16.1-88.1, referred to in the Revisers note, was repealed by Acts 1980, c. 183. The 2010 amendments. The 2010 amendment by c. 343 substituted $2,500 for $1,000 in subsections A and B. CASE NOTES Cost of repair in criminal case could not be established through hearsay testimony.  Defendants § 18.2-137 conviction was reversed as hearsay testimony of the repair costs for damage to the property was improperly admitted as the caretaker did not have personal knowledge of repair costs and testified to what the management company told him regarding the cost, and no exception to the hearsay rule applied; the exception to the hearsay rule in civil cases for affidavits estimating the cost of repairing the damage to motor vehicles would not be necessary if the Virginia legislature thought that an owners testimony as to the value of property meant that the owner could testify to the estimated cost of repairs for property based upon third- party estimates.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Repair estimates not mad e under oath or signed.  Where a customer failed to show that a repairmans alleged negligence caused a vehicles transmission problems, and where the repair estimates were not made under oath or signed, the evidence did not comply with § 8.01-416 on the issues of causation and damages; as a result, judgment was entered for the repairman.

Copies of written statements or transcriptions of verbal statements by injured person to be delivered to him; copies of subpoenaed documents to be provided to other party; disclosure of insurance policy limits. Text A. Any person who takes from a person who has sustained a personal injury a signed written statement or voice recording of any statement relative to such injury shall deliver to such injured person a copy of such written statement forthwith or a verified typed transcr iption of such recording within 30 days from the date such statement was given or recording made, when and if the statement or recording is transcribed or in all cases when requested by the injured person or his attorney. B. Unless othe rwise ordered for good cause shown, when one party to a civil proceeding subpoenas documents, the subpoenaing party, upon receipt of the subpoenaed documents, shall, if requested in writing, provide true and full copies of the same to any other party or to the attorney for any other party, provided the other party or attorney for the other party pays the reasonable cost of copying or reproducing the subpoenaed documents. This provision does not apply where the subpoenaed documents are returnable to and maintained by the clerk of court in which the action is pending. C. After he gi ves written notice that he represents an injured person, an attorney, or an individual injured in a motor vehicle accident if he is not represented by counsel, may, prior to the filing of a civil action for personal injuries sustained as a result of a mo tor vehicle accident, request in writing that the insurer disclose (i) the limits of liability of any motor vehicle liability or any personal injury liability insurance policy that may be applicable to the claim and (ii) the physical address, if known, o f the alleged tortfeasor who is insured by the insurer, if not previously reported to the requesting party. The requesting party shall provide the insurer with the date of the motor vehicle accident, the name and last known address of the alleged tortfea sor if it has been reported to the requesting party, a copy of the accident report, if any, and the claim number, if available. The insurer shall provide the alleged tortfeasors physical address within 30 days of the receipt of the request. When requ esting the limits of liability, the requesting party shall also submit to the insurer the injured persons medical records, medical bills, and wage-loss documentation, if applicable, pertaining to the claimed injury. If (a) the total of the medical bi lls and wage losses submitted equals or exceeds $12,500 or (b) regardless of the amount of losses, the alleged tortfeasor was charged with an offense under § 18.2-51.4, 18.2-266, 18.2-266.1, 18.2-268.3, or 46.2-341.24 and the injured persons injur ies arose from the same incident that resulted in such charge, the insurer shall respond in writing within 30 days of receipt of the request and shall disclose the limits of liability at the time of the accident of all such policies, regardless of whethe r the insurer contests the applicability of the policy to the injured persons claim, and the insureds address. Disclosure of the policy limits under this section shall not constitute an admission that the alleged injury or damage is subject to th e policy. Information concerning the insurance policy is not by reason of disclosure pursuant to this subsection admissible as evidence at trial. D. After he gi ves written notice that he represents the personal representative of the estate of a decedent who died as a result of a motor vehicle accident, an attorney, or the personal representative of the estate of the decedent who died as a result of a motor vehi cle accident if he is not represented by counsel, may, prior to the filing of a civil action for wrongful death as a result of a motor vehicle accident, request in writing that the insurer disclose (i) the limits of liability of any motor vehicle liabili ty insurance policy or any personal injury liability insurance policy that may be applicable to the claim and (ii) the physical address, if known, of the alleged tortfeasor who is insured by the insurer, if not previously reported to the requesting party . The requesting party shall provide the insurer with the date of the motor vehicle accident, the name and last known address of the alleged tortfeasor if it has been reported to the requesting party, a copy of the accident report, if any, and the claim number, if available. The insurer shall provide the alleged tortfeasors physical address within 30 days of the receipt of the request. When requesting the limits of liability, the requesting party shall submit to the insurer the death certificate of the decedent; the certificate of qualification of the personal representative of the decedents estate; the names and relationships of the statutory beneficiaries of the decedent; medical bills, if any, supporting a claim for damages under subdivision 3 of § 8.01-52; and, if at the time the request is made a claim for damages under clause (i) of subdivision 2 of § 8.01-52 is anticipated, a description of the source, amount, and payment history of the claimed income loss for each beneficiary. Th e insurer shall respond in writing within 30 days of receipt of the request and shall disclose the limits of liability at the time of the accident of all such policies, regardless of whether the insurer contests the applicability of the policy to the per sonal representatives claim, and the insureds address. Disclosure of the policy limits under this section shall not constitute an admission that the alleged death or other damage is subject to the policy. Information concerning the insurance poli cy is not by reason of disclosure pursuant to this subsection admissible as evidence at trial. E. For purpose s of subsections C and D, if the alleged tortfeasor has insurance coverage from a self-insured locality for a motor vehicle accident, as described in this section, and the locality is authorized by the alleged tortfeasor to accept service of process on b ehalf of the alleged tortfeasor and agrees to do so, the locality, in its discretion and instead of disclosing the alleged tortfeasors home address, may disclose the insureds work address and the name and address of the person who shall accept se rvice of process on behalf of the alleged tortfeasor. If the locality makes such a disclosure, the locality shall not be required to disclose the alleged tortfeasors home address. F. As used in subsections C and D, insurer does not include the insurance agency or the insurance agent representing the alleged tortfeasor as the authorized representative or agent with respect to the alleged tortfeasors motor vehicle insurance policy.

CASE NOTES Judicial estoppel.  Trial court erred in applying judicial estoppel in the civil suit by plaintiff against defendant based upon the guilty plea to assault and battery that he made in the earlier criminal case prosecuted on behalf of the Commonwealth because, although the guilty plea was admissible under § 8.01-418, the admissibility of a guilty plea did not constitute a preclusive bar to defendants testimony denying that he h ad assaulted or battered plaintiff. Mikhaylov v. Sales, 291 Va. 349, 784 S.E.2d 286, 2016 Va. LEXIS 53 (2016).

Co. v. Dean, 233 Va. 260, 355 S.E.2d 579, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2345, 1987 Va. LEXIS 194 (1987). Guilty plea in district court not admissible in civil proceedin gs once defendant appeals conviction to circuit court.  Since an appeal pursuant to § 16.1-132 annuls or wipes out a former plea of guilty entered in the district court, there no longer exists a guilty plea that oth erwise would be admissible in a subsequent civil proceeding under the provisions of § 8.01-418. Santen v. Tuthill, 265 Va. 492, 578 S.E.2d 788, 2003 Va. LEXIS 48 (2003). Failure to appear in court and pay fines does not constitute forfeiture.  The mere failure to appear in general district court to contest a traffic offense and the subsequent payment of a fine and costs do not constitute a forfeiture wi thin the meaning of this section. Yeager v. Adkins, 250 Va. 1, 458 S.E.2d 467, 1995 Va. LEXIS 71 (1995). Admissibility of defendants statements from testimony before district court.  Defendants statements made while testifying before the district court, unlike a guilty plea, is not wiped out by an appeal to the circuit court pursua nt to § 16.1-132, and is, therefore, admissible in the subsequent trial of the case. Santen v. Tuthill, 265 Va. 492, 578 S.E.2d 788, 2003 Va. LEXIS 48 (2003). Trial court erred in granting motion in limine which precluded the plaintiff from adducing evidence of the defendants guilty plea to a charge of reckless driving stemming from his falling asleep at the wheel and of the chain of events beginning with defendants negligently falling asleep and ending with collision. Koutsounadis v. En gland, 238 Va. 128, 380 S.E.2d 644, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2837, 1989 Va. LEXIS 98 (1989). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Guilty plea of traffic infraction.  Operators motion in limine was granted as under § 8.01-418, a traffic infraction could be admitted into a civil matter where a party had pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or suffered a forfeiture, and the operator had pleaded not guilty.

Evidence of subsequent measures taken not admissible to prove negligence (Supreme Court Rule 2:407 derived from this section). Text When, after the occurrence of an event, measures are taken which, if taken prior to the event would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of such subsequen tly taken measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct as a cause of the occurrence of the event; provided, that evidence of subsequent measures taken shall not be required to be excluded when offered for another purpose for which i t may be admissible, including, but not limited to, proof of ownership, control, feasibility of precautionary measures if controverted, or for impeachment.

For survey of Virginia law on evidence for the year 1977-1978, see 64 Va. L. Rev. 1451 (1978). CASE NOTES Feasibility became controverted in instant case when the plaintiff raised the issue of p recautionary measures with a defense witness and the witness stated there was no place at all to store partitions other than the bathroom in the defendants office. Therefore, on retrial, the trial court should permit the plaintiff to show that, on th e day after the plaintiff was injured, the defendant moved the partitions from the bathroom where they had been stored to an unoccupied office suite used by the defendant to store repossessed furniture.

LEXIS 228 (1971) (decided under prior law). And should be considered w ith other evidence.  It is the duty of the court, when so requested in an action for wrongful death, to tell the jury that a mortality table introduced into evidence is to be consider ed by them, but it is not conclusive or binding. It shall be considered along with all the other evidence relating to the health, habits, and other circumstances of the person which may tend to influence his life expectancy. Edwards v. Syrkes, 211 Va. 60 0, 179 S.E.2d 902, 1971 Va. LEXIS 228 (1971) (decided under prior law). Reading section to jury.  The objection now made to the action of the trial court in permitting counsel for the plaintiff to read to the jury from this section, it being the table of life expectancy, does not appear to have been voiced in the court below. While this method of introducing the life expectancy table in evidence is unusual, and not an approved procedure, it does not here constitute reversible error. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Futrell, 209 Va. 266, 163 S.E.2d 181, 1968 Va. LEXIS 225 (1968) (decided under prior law). Wrongful death action.  The expectancy of continued life of the decedent is relevant and necessary to establish the extent of loss for the decedents society, companionship, comfort, guidance, advice, services, protection, care, and assistance set out in § 8.01-52. The expectancy table in this section therefore, is admissible if such items of loss are supported by the evidence. Graddy v. Hatchett, 233 Va. 65, 353 S.E.2d 741, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1910, 1987 Va. LEXIS 171 (1987). Instruction in wrongful death action.  In a wrongful death action, the jury should be instructed, if requested, substantially as follows: The court instructs the jury that the life expectancy table introduced in evidence is to be considered by you as an aid in determining life expectancy, but it is not in any way conclusive or binding. You should consider it along with all the other evidence relating to the health, constitution, and habits of the decedent in your determination of his life expectancy. Edwards v. Syrkes, 211 Va. 600, 179 S.E.2d 902, 1971 Va. LEXIS 228 (1971) (decided under prior law). Personal injury action.  In an action for damages arising out of an automobile accident, where there was evidence that the injury to the plaintiff was not only permanent in nature, but wa s of a type and character from which the jury could have reasonably inferred the plaintiff would suffer a lessening of his earning capacity, it was proper for the court to have permitted evidence of plaintiffs life expectancy. Exxon Corp. v. Fulgham, 224 Va. 235, 294 S.E.2d 894, 1982 Va. LEXIS 285 (1982). § 8.01-419.1. Motor vehicle value. Text Whenever in any case not otherwise specifically provided for the value of an automobile is in issue, either civilly or criminally, the tabulated retail values set forth in the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) yellow or black books or any vehicle valuation service regularly used and recognized in the automobile industry that is in effect on the relevant date, shall be admissible as evid ence of fair market value on the relevant date. The determination of value shall be subject to such other creditable evidence as any party may offer to demonstrate that the value as set forth in the NADA publication or any vehicle valuation service utilized by another party fails to reflect the actual condition of the vehicle and that therefore the value may be greater or less than that shown by the NADA publication or any vehicle valuation service.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to follow proper statutory procedures is negligence.  Where a body shop failed to follow procedures under §§ 8.01-419.1 and 43-34 in valuing and auctioning an owners car, the body shop failed to utilize the degree of care that a reasonable person in a similar circumstance would have used when seeking to auction a bailed automobile. The body shops failure to follow the standard procedures was both an actual and proximate cause of the owners loss of her car. Therefore, its actions amounted to negligence.

CASE NOTES Reliance on discovery depositions.  Trial court did not err in using the discovery deposition testimony from the patients expert witness to sustain the surgeons motion in limine that ultimat ely allowed for the granting of the surgeons summary judgment motion. Although Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:20 and § 8.01-420 normally kept parties from using discovery deposition testimony to support a summary judgment motion, the patient acquiesced by not objecting and the motion in limine was the functional equivalent of the summary judgment motion because granting the motion in limine allowed for the granting of the summary judgment motion. Lloyd v. Kime, 275 Va. 98, 654 S.E.2d 563, 2008 Va. LEXIS 13 (2 008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  Because a limited liability company could be divested of its right to refile its tax challenge, given the three-year statute of limitations applicable to such pro ceedings, the countys plea in bar was the functional equivalent of a motion for summary judgment, indicating the statute applied.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Voicemail.  Corporations motion to exclude evidence of a conversation left on voicemail was denied because the speakers were fully aware that a third party had not respon ded to their telephone call; this section is clearly directed to recordings by parties to the conversation and not merely the conversation, and voicemail is not a participant in any purposeful activity that would find guidance in the words of the statute but is a mechanical device utilized by callers to communicate when the intended recipient of the call is unavailable to the person placing the call.

The plaintiff may accept such sum either in full satisfaction, and then have judgment for his costs, or in part satisfaction, and reply to the allegations of the defendants pleadings, and, if issue thereon be found for the defendant, judgm ent shall be given for the defendant, and he shall recover his costs.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Former § 8-236 has been rewritten to modernize the language and is subsection A of § 8.01-421. Subsection A is, like the former statute, limited to actions for the recovery of a debt. Former §§ 8-237 and 8-238 are subsection B with minor changes. The clerk is no longer designated to receive payment into court, as this was felt to be unnec essary.

A statutory plea filed pursuant to this section, successor to § 8-241, is not a count erclaim as that term is used in § 8.01-380 C, successor to § 8-244. Therefore, the conditions attaching to a nonsuit under subsection C of § 8.01-380 do not apply. Bremer v. Doctor's Bldg. Partnership, 251 Va. 74, 465 S.E.2d 787, 1996 Va. LEXIS 14 (1996). Defenses asserted in response to a motion for judgment, such as filed under this section seeking affirmative relief, are not barred or otherwise lost. They may be reasserted if the motion for judgment is subsequently refiled. Bremer v. Doctor's Bldg. Partnership, 251 Va. 74, 465 S.E.2d 787, 1996 Va. LEXIS 14 (1996). Lega l defenses inapplicable.  The language of this section is clear and unambiguous and, unlike the language in the predecessor statute, does not contain any provisions subjecting equitable pl eas of statutory recoupment to defenses available in an action at law such as the statute of limitations. Cummings v. Fulghum, 261 Va. 73, 540 S.E.2d 494, 2001 Va. LEXIS 3 (2001). Re coupment defense dismissed.  Appellee did not breach any provision of the agreement, nor did appellee breach any duty it had to appellants in the same transaction; the circuit court did not e rr in implicitly dismissing the defense of recoupment when it granted summary judgment to appellee. Va. Fuel Corp. v. Lambert Coal Co., 291 Va. 89, 781 S.E.2d 162, 2016 Va. LEXIS 1 (2016). Statute of limitations inapplicable to plea of recoupment.  A plea of recoupment under this section is not subject to a statute of limitations defense. Cummings v. Fulghum, 261 Va. 73, 540 S.E.2d 494, 2001 Va. LEXIS 3 (200 1). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. A.General Consider ation. 1.In General. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The object of this section was to remedy the defects of the common law, and to enable a defendant both to make such defenses as fraud, failure of consideration, and the like to a suit at law on specialties, and also to recover against the plaintiff any excess of damages he may have sustained, in order to settle in one suit all the rights of the parties arising under the contract, and to prevent circuity of action and a multiplicity of suits. Hamilton v. Goodridge, 164 Va. 123, 178 S.E. 874, 1935 Va. LEXIS 185 (1935). And to allow certain equitable defenses to be made at law.  This section was enacted for the purpose of allowing certain equitable defenses to be made at law, and the defendant, on the issue tendered by the plea, has the r ight to make the same defense as in equity. Guarantee Co. of N. Am. v. First Nat'l Bank, 95 Va. 480, 28 S.E. 909, 1898 Va. LEXIS 4 (1898). And to dispose of all matters in controversy in one action.  The purpose of this section plainly is to allow all matters in controversy between the plaintiff and the defendant arising out of the same cause of action  i. e., all matters of recoupment  to be disposed of in one action at law, so as to avoid the necessity of the defendants bringing a separate suit, whether at law or in equity, to determine any such matter. Cox v. Hagan, 125 Va. 656, 100 S.E. 666, 19 19 Va. LEXIS 56 (1919) (see Watkins v. West Wytheville Land &amp; Imp. Co., 92 Va. 1, 22 S.E. 554 (1895); Newport News &amp; Old Point Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v. Bickford, 105 Va. 182, 52 S.E. 1011 (1906)). Pl ea under this section is not true plea of setoff.  The plea provided for by this section, often miscalled plea in the nature of a plea of setoff, bears no resemblance whatever to a setoff, but is a mere en largement of the common-law right of recoupment. It arises out of the contract sued on; never out of a transaction dehors the contract, as in the case of setoff. The amount need not be liquidated, and it may not only repel plaintiffs claim, as in com mon-law recoupment, but defendant may recover over against plaintiff for the excess. It must be specially pleaded and cannot be availed of under the general issue, and it may be used though plaintiffs action is on a sealed instrument. It may be based on equitable grounds. Dexter-Portland Cement Co. v. Acme Supply Co., 147 Va. 758, 133 S.E. 788, 1926 Va. LEXIS 287 (1926). The section embodies the law of statutory recoupment.  Neely v. White, 177 Va. 358, 14 S.E.2d 337, 1941 Va. LEXIS 224 (1941). A special plea of setoff in Virginia is in effect a statutory plea of recoupment, and an enlargement of the common-law right of recoupment. Odessky v. Monterey Wi ne Co., 188 Va. 184, 49 S.E.2d 330, 1948 Va. LEXIS 156 (1948). It enl arges the common-law right of recoupment.  The provisions of this section were intended to enlarge the right of recoupment theretofore existing at common law. They were intended, not to impair any previous right or take away any defenses previously allowed by the common law, but, in addition thereto, to permit the defendant to recover any legal damages he can prove in excess of the damages claimed by the plaintiff. Davis v. Baxter, 2 Patton &amp; H. 133 (1856 ); Columbia Accident Ass'n v. Rockey, 93 Va. 678, 25 S.E. 1009, 1896 Va. LEXIS 125 (1896); Leterman v. Charlottesville Lumber Co., 110 Va. 769, 67 S.E. 281, 1910 Va. LEXIS 122 (1910). This section applies to proceedings to recover unpaid stock subscriptions.  Dickens v. Radford-Willis S. Ry., 121 Va. 353, 93 S.E. 625, 1917 Va. LEXIS 40 (1917). 2.Nature of Defendants Demand. Claim may be in tort or for unliquidated damages.  The fact that the defendants claim is in tort or for unliquidated damages is immaterial. If it is based upon matters directly connected with, and injuries gro wing out of, the contract sued on by plaintiff, it can be asserted as a setoff under this section. Newport News &amp; Old Point Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v. Bickford, 105 Va. 182, 52 S.E. 1011, 1906 Va. LEXIS 23 (1906) (see Leterman v. Charlottesville Lumber Co., 110 Va. 769, 67 S.E. 281 (1910)). If damages are not too speculative.  Where plaintiff brought an action to recover for a carload of potatoes and defendant pleaded damages to two other carloads previously brought by way of setoff, th e damages were too speculative, as the claim was based upon such items as: labor account of rots and frosts, loss account frosted and number two potatoes, when num...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-423"><akn:num>§ 8.01-423</akn:num><akn:heading>When plaintiff claims as assignee or transferee</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If the plaintiff claims as assignee or transferee under a person with whom the contract sued on was originally made, and the defendants claim exceeds the plaintiff s demand, the defendant: 1.

In any acti on or suit wherein a person under a disability is a party, the court in which the matter is pending shall have the power to approve and confirm a compromise of the matters in controversy on behalf of such party, including claims under the provisions of a ny liability insurance policy, if such compromise is deemed to be to the interest of the party. Any order or decree approving and confirming the compromise shall be binding upon such party, except that the same may be set aside for fraud. B. In case of damage to the person or property of a person under a disability, caused by the wrongful act, neglect, or default of any person, when death did not ensue therefrom, any person or insurer interested in compromise of any claim for such damages, including an y claim under the provisions of any liability insurance policy, may, upon motion to the court in which the action is pending for the recovery of damages on account of such injury, or if no such action is pending, then to any circuit court, move the court to approve the compromise. The court shall require the movant to give reasonable notice of such motion to all parties and to any person found by the court to be interested in the compromise. C. A compromis e action involving a claim for wrongful death shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 8.01-55. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the provisions of § 8.01-76. D. In any comp romise action, the court shall direct the payment of the proceeds of the compromise agreement, when approved, as follows: 1. Payme nt of the sum into court as provided by § 8.01-600 or to the general receiver of such court; 2. In the case of damage to the person or property of a minor, by investment in a college savings trust account for which the minor is the beneficiary pursuant to a college savings trust agreement with the Virginia College Savings Plan as set forth in subsection B of § 23.1-707, provided that (i) the investment options pursuant to such agreement are restricted to target enrollment portfolios; (ii) the order or decree approving and con firming the compromise requires the minor beneficiarys parent, as that term is defined in § 22.1-1, to act as the custodian of the account; and (iii) except in the case of a distribution from the account to be applied toward the minor beneficiary s qualified higher education expenses, as that term is defined in § 529 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or other applicable federal law, the order or decree approving and confirming the compromise prohibits the minor beneficiary s parent from making any transfer, withdrawal, termination, or other account transaction unless the court provides prior approval pursuant to a written order; 3. To a duly qualified fiduciary of the person under a disability, after due inquiry as to the adequacy of the bond of such fiduciary; 4. As provided in § 8.01-606; or 5. Where the agreement of settlement provides for payments to be made over a period of time in the future, whether such payments are lump sum, periodic, or a combination of both, the cour t shall approve the settlement only if it finds that all payments which are due to be made are (i) secured by a bond issued by an insurance company authorized to write such bonds in this Commonwealth or (ii) to be made or irrevocably guaranteed by an ins urance company or companies authorized to do business in this Commonwealth and rated A plus (A+) or better by Bests Insurance Reports. Payments made under this subdivision totaling not more than $4,000 in any calendar year may be paid in acco rdance with § 8.01-606. Payments made under this subdivision totaling more than $4,000 in any calendar year while the recipient is under a disability shall be paid to a duly qualified fiduciary after due inquiry as to adequacy of the bond of such fidu ciary. E. Payments ma de under this section, in the case of damage to the person or property of a minor, may be made payable in the discretion of the court to the parent or guardian of the minor to be held in trust for the benefit of the minor. Any such trust shall be subject to court approval and the court may provide for the termination of such trust at any time following attainment of majority which the court deems to be in the best interest of the minor. In an order authorizing the trust or additions to an existing trust , the court may order that the trustee thereof be subject to the same duty to qualify in the clerks office and to file an inventory and annual accountings with the commissioner of accounts as would apply to a testamentary trustee. History History. Code 1950, §§ 8-169, 8-170; 1956, c. 575; 1960, cc. 301, 30 2; 1964, c. 500; 1970, c. 10; 1977, c. 617; 1985, c. 499; 1988, c. 409; 1991, cc. 97, 257; 1993, c. 945; 1994, c. 39; 1998, cc. 584, 607, 610; 2009, c. 688; 2022, c. 535. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-424 is a combination of former §§ 8-169 and 8-170. In the revision of former Title 8, the new phrase person under a disability has been adopted in most instances in lieu of such terms as incompetent,  incapacitated, insane, or infant; this term, as defined, includes all persons unable to protect their property or legal rights regardless of the particular impairment. A substantial change in the new statute is the elimination of the right of an infant to attack an order of compromise within six months after reaching his majorit y. With the deletion of that provision, distinctions between infancy and other types of disabilities are no longer relevant. Former § 8-170 has been completely rewritten to simplify the procedure for compromising personal injury and property claims of persons under a disability. The provisions pertaining to the court wherein a motion for such a compromise is to be made have been changed. Section 8.01-424 provides that if an action to recover damages for injury to a person under a disability has been filed, the motion seeking approva l of a compromise must be presented to the court in which that action is pending. However, if no such action has been brought, the motion may be made to any circuit court within the Commonwealth. Former § 8-170 required that such approval be obtained by the court wherein an action might be brought. The change thus reflected in § 8.01-424 is in conformity with the broadened venue provisions of chapter 5, and is premised on the likelihood that parties agreeing to a compromise will be able to agree upon a mutually convenient circuit court for approval of that compromise. In addition to the greater flexibility of the present section, the deletion of the provision making it unnecessary to make any person whose whereabouts are unknow n a party to such proceedings affords increased protection to the interests of such person. The provisions incorporated in former § 8-170 dealing with procedures set forth in other sections of the Code have been retained in § 8.01-424. See §§ 8.01-55 (Wrongful death compromise), 8.01-76 (Disposition of proceeds from sales of lands of persons under disabilities), 8.01-600 (Deposit of money under courts control), 8.01-606 (Payment of small amounts to infants, etc.).

CASE NOTES Power of court.  Explicitly, the statute gives the court power to approve a compromise. Implicitly, the court has the power under the statute to disapprove a compromise. However, neither the statute nor any inherent power the court may possess permits the court to create a settlement and then to impose such a settlement upon a guardian, and the trial court erred in forcing the guardian to accept hospitals offer of set tlement.

Courts duty not ended by settlement and stipulation of dismissal.  An incompetent persons suit cannot be ended upon settlement followed by the filing of a stipulation of dismissal. It is only when a settlement occurs that the courts duty to oversee the settlement arises. If that duty could be aborted by the filing of a stipulation, the role of the court would be effectively avoided. Neither law nor logic sanction such a result. Crawford v. Loving, 84 F.R.D. 80, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9817 (E.D. Va. 1979). The courts duty to oversee the settlement of claims asserted on behalf of incompetent persons cannot be abandoned simply because the parties assert, following a purported settlement, that they no longer wish to litigate the matter further. Crawford v.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-425 is former § 8-171, without substantive change. The cautionary provision that nothing in the statute shall affect the right of indemnity or con tribution is former § 8-173. Because joint stock companies are an enigma under current Virginia law, former § 8-172, the only section in the Code dealing with such organizations, has been deleted. Cross references.

CASE NOTES This section does not require that, to be valid, compromises made by a fiduciary must be approved by a court; rather, the provisions of this section are permissive. Subsequent litigation of a compromise executed by a fiduciary without court approval may void the compromise as to some or all of the affected parties in interest; however, the compromise is not void at its inception, merely voidable under appropriate circumstances.

Text When a claimant or plaintiff executes a release of liability as a condition of settlement in a claim or action for personal injury within thirty days of the incident gi ving rise to such claim, such claimant or plaintiff shall have a right of rescission until midnight of the third business day after the day on which the release was executed, provided that he was not represented by counsel when the release was executed, the rescission was made in writing to the person or persons being released, their representative or insurance carrier, and the claimant returns to the person or persons being released any check or settlement proceeds received by the claimant prior to the rescission. A release of liability executed within thirty days of the incident giving rise to the claim for personal injury by a person who is not represented by counsel shall contain a notice of the claimants or the plaintiffs right to rescind conspicuously and separately stated on the release.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Satisfaction of monetary award granted under § 20-107.3 is governed by this section. B rown v. Brown, 5 Va. App. 238, 361 S.E.2d 364, 4 Va. Law Rep. 948, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 237 (1987). Award of monetary sum under § 20-107.3 D equivalent to money judgment.  To the extent a decree awards a monetary sum pursuant to subsection D of § 20-107.3, it is the equivalent of a money judgment and must be satisfied as such. Th e trial court may provide, however, that a monetary award be payable as a lump sum or in periodic fixed amounts. In either instance, the trial court may exercise its discretion in determining when the lump sum award or the periodic fixed amounts are due and payable. If no due date is specified in the decree, or if the award (or any portion thereof) is not satisfied by the payment date set forth in the decree, that award (or portion thereof) becomes the equivalent of a money judgment. Brown v. Brown, 5 V a. App. 238, 361 S.E.2d 364, 4 Va. Law Rep. 948, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 237 (1987). Order pursuant to § 20-107.3 held to exceed courts authority.  The trial court exceeded its authority in ordering mandatory payment of the monetary award under subsection D of § 20-107.3 within 120 days. While it was autho rized to fix a date upon which the award was due and payable, the trial court lacked authority to order mandatory payment subject to enforcement by its contempt powers. Brown v. Brown, 5 Va. App. 238, 361 S.E.2d 364, 4 Va. Law Rep. 948, 1987 Va. App. LEX IS 237 (1987). Order to pay sums due under separation agreement is judgm ent on which interest must accrue.  To the extent a trial court ordered a former husband to pay obligations imposed by the parties separation agreement, it had no discretion under § 8.01-382 to deny or postpone the accrual of postjudgment interest on those amounts. Whitney v. Whitney, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 203 (Va. Ct. App. May 15, 2007). Collection of past due child support barred.  Finding against the father was inappropriate because the action to collect past due child support obligations, based upon the 1966 decree, was filed more than 20 years after any payments ordered by the decree became judgments by operation of law, and was barred pursuant to subsection A of § 8.01-251. Adcock v. Commonwealth ex rel. Houchens, 282 Va. 383, 719 S.E.2d 304, 2011 Va. LEXIS 223 (2011). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Only by force of our statute law can process of execution be sued out upon decrees in chancery. Windrum v. Parker, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 361, 1830 Va. LEXIS 44 (1830); Shackelford v. Apperson, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 451, 1849 Va. LEXIS 68 (1849); Snavely v. Harkrader, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 487, 1878 Va. LEXIS 76 (1878). Decree in equity and order in mandamus are equally judgments.  A decree in an equity cause ordering the clerk to pay over money, and an order in a mandamus proceeding to compel the clerk to do so, were held to be judgment s against the clerk within this section, and it was the clerks duty to issue execution thereon as required by § 8.01-466. Rinehart &amp; Dennis Co. v. McArthur, 123 Va. 556, 96 S.E. 829, 1918 Va. LEXIS 53 (1918). Person entitled to property or money is judgment creditor.  A decree for specific property, or requiring the payment of money, has the effect of a judgment, and persons entitled thereto are judgment creditors. Hutchison v. Grubbs, 80 Va. 251, 1885 Va. LEXIS 62 (1885). Statute fixing lien of judgment applies to decrees.  Since a decree for money, by express enactment, is embraced by the word judgment, the statute fixing the lien of a judgment applies equally to such decree s. Hockman v. Hockman, 93 Va. 455, 25 S.E. 534, 1896 Va. LEXIS 96 (1896). And decree creates lien on lands.  A decree in chancery, equally with a judgment at law, creates a lien on lands. Haleys v. Williams, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 140, 1829 Va. LEXIS 14 (1829); Withers v. Cart er, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 407, 1848 Va. LEXIS 11 (1848); Burbridge v. Higgins, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 119, 1849 Va. LEXIS 27 (1849); Buchanan v. Clark, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 164 (1853); Lee v. Swepson, 75 Va. 173 (1881). This rule applies to decree for alimony.  A decree for alimony payable in monthly installments during the life of the beneficiary constitutes a lien in her favor upon the husbands real estate from the date of the decree, not only for the installments presently due but for those that shall fall due under such decree in the future. Issacs v. Issacs, 117 Va. 730, 86 S.E. 105, 1915 Va. LEXIS 88 (1915) (see Morris v. Henry, 193 Va. 631, 70 S.E.2d 417 (195 2)). To decree for support of infant child.  See Morris v. Henry, 193 Va. 631, 70 S.E.2d 417, 1952 Va. LEXIS 174 (1952). And to decree directing commissioner to pay money out of funds in his hands.  A commissioner made a sale under a decree, and received one-third of the purchase money, without giving bond as required. The sale was confirmed, and a decree ent ered and docketed, directing the commissioner, out of funds reported in his hands, to pay certain creditors therein. Five days later the commissioner conveyed in trust his own real estate to secure his own creditor. It was held that the decree against th e commissioner had the effect of a judgment, and, the decree being docketed, the commissioners creditor was affected with notice thereof, though the purchaser paid the commissioner in his own wrong. Lee v. Swepson, 76 Va. 173, 1882 Va. LEXIS 15 (1882 ). An alimony decree is not a mere money decree within the meaning of this section and § 8.01-427, under which courts of equity do not have power to enforce decrees for the payment of money by process of contempt, and the same principles apply to an award for counsel fees and suit money. Eddens v. Eddens, 188 Va. 511, 50 S.E.2d 397, 1948 Va . LEXIS 185 (1948). Any execution which may be taken upon a judgment may be taken upon a decree. Tate v. Ligg at, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 84, 1830 Va. LEXIS 13 (1830). This section gives courts of chancery the power to superintend the issuing of executions on their own decrees, and the power to correct irregularities and abuses therein, to the same extent, and by the same means, as courts of law. Windrum v. Parker, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 361, 1830 Va. LEXIS 44 (1830); Snavely v. Harkrader, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 48 7, 1878 Va. LEXIS 76 (1878). And to quash executions irregularly sued out.  Courts of chancery may quash executions irregularly sued out on their decrees. Windrum v. Parker, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 361, 1830 Va. LEXIS 44 (1830). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Collection of unpaid tolls.  A Commonwealths Attorney may collect civil penalties, unpaid tolls, and administrative fees awarded to a private toll facility operator under § 46.2-819.3: 1, but is not obligated to do so. A court is not authorized to compel a Commonwealths Attorney to undertake such a discretionary act, nor to undertake collection of such a monetary judgment on its own initiative.

Default judgments and decrees pro confesso; summary procedure.  Upon motion of the plaintiff or judgment de btor and after reasonable notice to the opposite party, his attorney of record or other agent, the court may set aside a judgment by default or a decree pro confesso upon the following grounds: (i) fraud on the court, (ii) a void judgment, (iii) on proof of an accord and satisfaction, or (iv) on proof that the defendant was, at the time of service of process or entry of judgment, a servicemember as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 3911. Such motion on the ground of fraud on the court shall be made within two y ears from the date of the judgment or decree. B. Clerical mistakes.  Clerical mistakes in all judgments or other parts of the record and errors therein aris ing from oversight or from an inadvertent omission may be corrected by the court at any time on its own initiative or upon the motion of any party and after such notice, as the court may order. During the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may be corre cted before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending such mistakes may be corrected with leave of the appellate court. C. Failure to notify party or counsel of final order.  If counsel, or a party not represented by counsel, who is not in default in a circuit court is not notified by any means of the entry of a final order and the circuit court is satisfied that such lack of notice (i) did not result from a failure to exercise due diligence on the part of that party and (ii) den ied that party an opportunity to pursue post-trial relief in the circuit court or to file an appeal therefrom, the circuit court may, within 60 days of the entry of such order, modify, vacate, or suspend the order or grant the party leave to appeal. Wher e the circuit court grants the party leave to appeal, the computation of time for noting and perfecting an appeal shall run from the entry of such order, and such order shall have no other effect. D. Other ju dgments or proceedings.  This section does not limit the power of the court to entertain at any tim e an independent action to relieve a party from any judgment or proceeding, or to grant relief to a defendant not served with process as provided in § 8.01-322, or to set aside a judgment or decree for fraud upon the court. E. Nothing in this section shall constitute grounds to set aside an otherwise valid default judgment against a defendant who was not, at the time of service of process or entry of judgment, a servicemember as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 3911. History History. 1977, c. 617; 1991, c. 39; 1993, c. 951; 2005, cc. 333, 909. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-428 is an adaptation of FRCP 55 and 60 and replaces former § 8-348, which has been deemed unclear (Federal Realty v. Litterio &amp; Co., 213 Va. 3, 18 9 S.E.2d 314 (1972)). The time limitation for setting aside a default judgment or decree pro confesso on the ground of fraud on the court has been reduced from three to two years. No limitation period is provided when the ground is a void judgment or an accord and satisfaction. (See § 8.01-428 A.) In addition, no time limitation is proposed for the grounds set forth in § 8.01-428 B. and C. A courts inherent equity power to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from any judgment has been preserved. Cross references. As to grant of new trial from judgment of general district court, see § 16.1-97.1. As to complaints to impeach or establish a will, see § 64.2-448. Editors note. At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, a servicemember as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 3911 was substituted for a person in the military servi ce of the United States for purposes of 50 U.S.C. app. § 502 in subsection A and a servicemember as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 3911 was substituted for a servicemember for purposes of 50 U.S.C. app. § 502 in subsection E to confo rm to amendments by Acts 2016, c. 643. The 2005 amendments. The 2005 amendment by c. 333, in subsection C, inserted to pursue post-trial relief in the circuit court or and modify, vacate, or suspend the order o r in clause (ii); and added Where the circuit court grants the party leave to appeal at the beginning of the last sentence; and made a minor stylistic change.

Other Judgments or Proceedings. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. A. General Consideration. B. Procedure. C. Relief. I.Decisions Under Current Law. A.General Cons ideration. Purpose of subsection A.  The object of subsection A., apparent on its face, is to grant a summary procedure for relief from judgments which are subject to one of the three specific defect s mentioned in the statute. McEwen Lumber Co. v. Lipscomb Bros. Lumber Co., 234 Va. 243, 360 S.E.2d 845, 4 Va. Law Rep. 850, 1987 Va. LEXIS 234 (1987). Section narrow ly construed.  This section and its predecessors, which create exceptions to the finality of judgments, is narrowly construed. McEwen Lumber Co. v. Lipscomb Bros. Lumber Co., 23 4 Va. 243, 360 S.E.2d 845, 4 Va. Law Rep. 850, 1987 Va. LEXIS 234 (1987). Section not limited to civil proceedings.  While predecessor statutes may have been intended to apply only in civil proceedings, the language of this section evidences no such restrictive intent. Lamb v. C ommonwealth, 222 Va. 161, 279 S.E.2d 389, 1981 Va. LEXIS 285 (1981). Authority of court.  This section covers more than errors committed by court clerks; it authorizes a court to correct its own errors and omissions. Hunter v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 306, 477 S.E.2d 1, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 658 (1996). Amendment of record only to reflect action actually taken.  The power to amend should not be confounded with the power to create; while the power to amend is inherent in the court, it is restricted to placing upon the reco rd evidence of judicial action that has actually been taken and presupposes action taken at the proper time. Patterson v. Fauquier County Dep't of Social Servs., 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 144 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 20, 2001). Subsection B authorizes a trial judge to correct the judges own errors and omissions. Coleman v. Commonwealth ex rel. Hutcherson, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 291 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 25, 2000). Written order modified to conform to oral statement of sentence.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it entered a nunc pro tunc order correcting a sentencing order it entered three years earlier where the transcript o f the sentencing hearing established that the trial court had stated that a term for a suspension of sentence would be five years but the written order failed to include a specific term for the suspension. Hopkins v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 105 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 2, 2013). Order failing to set forth grounds for changes ineffective.  An order apparently intended to correct an error in a prior order that sets forth no basis for concluding that the changes resulted from previous inadvertence or oversight, as distinguished from a change of mind or a perceived adjudicatory error, is ineffective to modify the prior order. Thompson v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2000). Effect of Rule 1:1.  Supreme Court Rule 1:1 was not intended to limit, and in fact could not limit, the trial courts statutory authority to correct clerical errors in the judgment or errors therein arising from oversight or from an inadvertent omission at any time. Dorn v. Dorn, 222 Va. 288, 279 S.E.2d 393, 1981 Va. LEXIS 303 (1981). The power conferred by this section is not limited by Rule 1:1, but is confined to the rare situation where the evidence clearly supports the conclusion that an error covered by this Code section has been made. Dixon v. Pugh, No. 1647-90-2 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 13, 1991). The order in which the trial judge ruled that the husband was entitled to a credit was entered more than two years after entry of the final decree. In the absence of an exception to Rule 1:1, the trial judge lost jurisdiction over the case twenty-one days after the initial judgment, and he could not issue a valid modification order. Decker v. Decker, 22 Va. App. 486, 471 S.E.2d 775, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 410 (1996) . A nunc pro tunc order correcting a clerical error can be entered after twenty-one days from entry of the final order without violating Rule 1:1. A trial court may enter an order nunc pro tunc to reflect judicial action that was, in fact, taken or to correct defects or omissions in the record so as to make the record conform to actual prior events.

And when the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court hears a case on appeal, if it appears that, e ither before or since the appeal, the judgment or decree has been so amended, the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court shall affirm the judgment or decree, unless there is other error. If it appears that the amendment ought to be, and has not been made, the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court may make such amendment, and affirm in like manner the judgment or decree, unless there is other error. History History. Code 1950, § 8-349; 1977, c. 617; 1984, c. 703. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Former § 8-350 has been transferred to § 8.01-383.1. Michies Jurisprudence.

CASE NOTES Ap peal is not allowed unless relief is sought in trial court.  Pursuant to this section, the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction of an appeal from a decree by default until relief has been sought under § 8.01-428, by motion to the court in which the decree was rendered. When the time allowed by § 8.01-428 has expired, the decree becomes final and irreversible. Smith v. Powell, 98 Va. 431, 36 S.E. 522, 1900 Va. LEXIS 60 (1900) (decided under prior law). Hence supersedeas would be dismissed.  If a party obtains a supersedeas to a judgment by default, before applying to the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the judge thereof, to correct the e rrors of which he complains, his supersedeas will be dismissed as improvidently awarded. Davis v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 134, 1861 Va. LEXIS 1 (1861) (decided under prior law). A mistake of the trial court in rendering judgments for damages after the verdict may be corrected by appellate court under the provisions of this section. Powers v. Hamilton, 117 Va. 810, 86 S.E. 98, 1915 Va. LEXIS 98 (1915) (decided under prior law). Trial court erred in v acating default judgment.  Where defendant had been personally served and plaintiff had strictly complied with all the formalities of rules of pleading and the motion for judgment stated a cause of action, the trial court erred in vacating a default judgment, there being no errors on which an appellate court might reverse and no cognizable mistake.

If necessary to assess damages which have not been assessed, the court may empanel a jury at its bar to make such assessment, and then enter such final judgment.

When New Trial Should Be Granted. F. Effect of Section on Appeal. Criteria for setting ver dict aside.  The power conferred on the trial judge under this section to set aside a jury verdict and enter judgment thereon can only be exercised where the verdict is plainl y wrong or without credible evidence to support it. If there is a conflict in the testimony on a material point, or if reasonable men may differ in their conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence, or if the conclusion is dependent on the weight t o be given the testimony, the trial judge cannot substitute his conclusion for that of the jury merely because he would have voted for a different verdict if he had been on the jury. The weight of a jurys verdict, when there is credible evidence upon which it can be based, it is not overborne by the trial judges disapproval. Lane v. Scott, 220 Va. 578, 260 S.E.2d 238, 1979 Va. LEXIS 300 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 986, 100 S. Ct. 2969, 64 L. Ed. 2d 843, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 1936 (1980); Dutton v. Locker, 224 Va. 535, 297 S.E.2d 814, 1982 Va. LEXIS 326 (1982). Under this section, a verdict may be set aside only where it is contrary to the evidence or without evidence to support it and the trial court may then enter final judgment rather than grant a new trial if there is sufficient evidence to enable the court to decide the case upon its merits. Sampson v. Sampson, 221 Va. 896, 275 S.E.2d 597, 1981 Va. LEXIS 225 (1981). When conflicting inferences have been resolved by a jury and those necessarily underlyin g the conclusion reflected in the verdict are reasonably deducible from the evidence, a trial judge should not set the verdict aside.

Reviewing court must reinstate jury verdict if there is credible evidence to support it.  If there is credible evidence in the record which supports the jurys verdict, the reviewing court must reinstate that verdict and enter judgment thereon. Roge rs v. Marrow ex rel. Marrow, 243 Va. 162, 413 S.E.2d 344, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1868, 1992 Va. LEXIS 142 (1992). Reviewing court accords verdict recipient benefit of all conflict in evidence.  In analyzing the evidence, even where the trial court has set aside the verdict, the reviewing court accords the recipient of the verdict the benefit of all subst antial conflict in the evidence, as well as all inferences which may be reasonably drawn from the evidence. Rogers v. Marrow ex rel. Marrow, 243 Va. 162, 413 S.E.2d 344, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1868, 1992 Va. LEXIS 142 (1992). Trial court erred in setting aside a jurys verdict in favor of plaintiff marketer against defendant producer for conversion of the producers share of mone y from a settlement with the parties joint client, as: (1) the evidence supported the jurys finding of a joint venture; (2) the conversion claim was viable independent of any contract claim; (3) and the jury was entitled to find that the producer wrongfully withheld the marketers share of the settlement proceeds. PGI, Inc. v. Rathe Prods., Inc., 265 Va. 334, 576 S.E.2d 438, 2003 Va. LEXIS 35 (2003). Where the evidence was in conflict regarding whether the injured party was contributorily negligent and the trial court erred in setting aside the verdict, the ap peals court was not permitted to reinstate the jury verdict because the jury returned its verdict in the exact amount of the claimed medical and special damages, warranting a new trial as to the issue of damages only. Jenkins v. Pyles, 269 Va. 383, 611 S .E.2d 404, 2005 Va. LEXIS 50 (2005). Right to a trial by a jury in a civil case is constitutional in origin, and a jurys verdict should be set aside only where it is plainly wrong or there is no credible evidence in the record to support that verdict; since a physicians opinion that a diners illness was caused by food poisoning was based sufficiently on facts known to him and was not speculative, since a timeline discrepancy regarding th e onset of the diners symptoms went to weight given the testimony by the jury, and since the lay testimony coupled with the doctors diagnosis was sufficient to support a jury verdict for diner against a restaurant alleging food poisoning, the tri al court erred in setting aside the jurys verdict. Bussey v. E.S.C. Rests. Inc., 270 Va. 531, 620 S.E.2d 764, 2005 Va. LEXIS 91 (2005). Verdict for a driver was improperly set aside under § 8.01-430. Reasonable persons could differ regarding whether the driver was contributorily negligent in co lliding with a truck that was stopped on the highway since evidence that the highway leading up to the accident scene curved and twisted allowed the finding that driver was unable to see stopped truck. Burroughs v. Keffer, 272 Va. 162, 630 S.E.2d 297, 20 06 Va. LEXIS 62 (2006). Circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support a jurys finding that a pool owners failure to fully secure the gate to her backyard pool, as required by Botetourt County, Va., Code § 22-4, proximately caused a 30-month-old childs death as the child was seen pulling on the chain on the gate shortly before he was found in the pool, and there was no evidence of any alternate means of access to the p ool. McGuire v. Hodges, 273 Va. 199, 639 S.E.2d 284, 2007 Va. LEXIS 2 (2007). Trial court erred when it set aside a jury verdict in a dispute between property owners and the landowners council as to the owners conduct in their on-si te retail sale of wine, as the jury verdict, under the instructions provided, was not plainly wrong and was not without evidence to support it; the trial courts injection of a reasonableness standard with respect to the owners interpretation of t he councils handbook deviated from the jury instructions, which were law of the case. Marterella v. Bellevue Landowners Council, Inc., 2012 Va. LEXIS 231 (Va. May 11, 2012). Trial cour t properly set aside jury verdict.  Where plaintiffs, the co-administrators of an estate, sued defendants, a corporations board member and another corporate representative, for constructive frau d, alleging that, due to defendants false representations about the valuation of stock held by the estate and about restrictions on selling the stock to non-shareholders, the co-administrators did not sell the stock on their own because they thought doing so was not allowed or that a proper value could not be set, the trial court properly set aside the jurys verdict in the co-administrators favor and properly entered judgment in favor of defendants. Eden v. Weight, 265 Va. 398, 578 S.E.2d 76 9, 2003 Va. LEXIS 47 (2003), overruled in part, SuperValu, Inc. v. Johnson, 276 Va. 356, 666 S.E.2d 335, 2008 Va. LEXIS 103 (2008).

Plaintiff must be willing to accept confession.  The plain terms of § 8.01-431 require that a plaintiff be willing to accept the amount of principal and interest for which a defendant is confessing judgment. Where a plaintiff did not accept the amount confessed, the case was not ended and the plaintiff was entitled to take a nonsuit when he was not allowed to increase the amount of damages in his ad damnum clause. AAA Disposal Servs. v. Eckert, 267 Va. 442, 593 S.E.2d 260, 2004 Va. LEXIS 36 (2004).

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Beng, 249 Va. 165, 455 S.E.2d 2, 1995 Va. LEXIS 29 (1995). Section not ap plicable.  Where petitioner, an adult who was adopted as a child, appealed the denial of her petition to set aside the adoption, where the petition contained a signature pur porting to be that of the adoptive father, and where the record also contained an affidavit, received by the trial court, after it had denied the petition, in which the adoptive father purported to consent to annulling the adoptive order, while t his section allows a judgment to be entered upon confession, the provisions were not applicable to this case.

LEXIS 244 (1934). Judgment by confession has all attributes of other judgments.  Although no adjudication is in fact required in entering a judgment of confession without action, yet it has all the qualities, incidents and attributes of other judgments and it cannot be valid unless entered in a court which might lawfully have pronounced the same judgment in a contested action. Beazley v. Sims, 81 Va. 644, 1886 Va. LEXIS 131 (1886). It is valid from the moment of the acceptance. Beazley v. Sims, 81 Va. 644, 1886 Va. LEXI S 131 (1886). Substantial compliance with section is sufficient.  The provisions of this section with reference to judgments confessed in the clerks office are, for the most part, merely declaratory of the common law, and su ch judgments will be declared valid where there has been substantial compliance with this section. Saunders v. Lipscomb, 90 Va. 647, 19 S.E. 450, 1894 Va. LEXIS 37 (1894); Manson v. Rawlings, 112 Va. 384, 71 S.E. 564, 1911 Va. LEXIS 96 (1911) (see Americ an Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

Lipscomb, 90 Va. 647, 19 S.E. 450, 1894 Va. LEXIS 37 (1894). Li en begins at time of confession.  The holding that the lien of a judgment by confession begins on the first moment of the day on which it was confessed is expressly overruled by this section, and the lien begins at the time of confession. Hockman v. Hockman, 93 Va. 455, 25 S.E. 534, 1896 Va. LEXIS 96 (1896). Entry on order book may be made at any time.  If the entry of a judgment confessed in the office upon the order or minute book has not been made at the time of its confession, the clerk may make the entry at any time, and if he fails to do it, the court may at any time direct him to make the entry. Shadrack v. Woolfolk, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 707, 1880 Va. LEXIS 93 (1880). Failure to make entry does not invalidate judgment.  Judgment confessed in the clerks office, though no process appears to have been issued or served, and though the clerk has failed to enter it upon the order b ook or any other book in his office, and the only evidence of it is an unsigned memorandum endorsed on a declaration which seems to have been filed and the bond enclosed in the declaration, is a valid judgment and entitled to rank as such as against othe r creditors of the debtor. Shadrack v. Woolfolk, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 707, 1880 Va. LEXIS 93 (1880); Saunders v. Lipscomb, 90 Va. 647, 19 S.E. 450, 1894 Va. LEXIS 37 (1894). For provision as to entry is directory only.  The provision for entry of the judgment on the order book of the clerk is directory only, and, if in fact confessed, the judgment will be upheld though not entere d on that or any other book in his office, but evidenced merely by authenticated memoranda of the clerk taking the confession. Manson v. Rawlings, 112 Va. 384, 71 S.E. 564, 1911 Va. LEXIS 96 (1911). Clerk may enter his own confession.  In entering a confession of judgment under this section, the clerk acts purely as a ministerial officer, and he may enter his own confession of judgment in favor of his creditor, and it will be valid.

Barley's Adm'r , 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 363, 1863 Va. LEXIS 2 (1863). Power of attorney executed in name of partnership.  In the absence of proof of nonassent on the part of some of the members of a firm, a power of attorney to confess judgment executed by one partner in the firm nam e must be held when assailed collaterally; although the power is under seal, the seal being unnecessary. Alexander v. Alexander, 85 Va. 353, 7 S.E. 335, 1888 Va. LEXIS 42 (1888). Power authorizing confession in any court, at any time, is valid.  Where a power of attorney authorized confession of judgment in any court and at any time, a confession before a clerk under this warrant is valid; and as all the clerks proceedings in vacation are subject to the control of the court at the next term, the obligors are afforded all the protection they could have gotten from a confession in court. Walker v. Temple, 130 Va. 567, 107 S.E. 720, 1921 Va. LEXIS 176 (1921).

Beckner v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., 58 Va. Cir. 544, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 175 (Roanoke June 27, 2002). No evidence of fraud or collusion.  Court could not enter summary judgment for the insurers in an action filed by an administratrix under an assignment of rights obtained in five previous wrongful d eath actions from a property manager, the defendant in the wrongful death actions, for the failure of the insurers to defend, and determine from the settlement documents that collusion existed in the settlement, even though the manager received $3,000 un der the settlement agreement; there was no evidence that the parties to the wrongful death suits did not engage in an arms length negotiation, and there was no indication of actual or constructive fraud.

For 2003/2004 survey of civil practice and procedure, see 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. 87 (2004). CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Confessed judgment subject to finality rules.  Obtaining a judgment by confession pursuant to § 8.01-432 is an extraordinary remedy that permits a creditor to obtain an enforceable judgment against a debtor without the need to file suit or to establish any fact other than the existence of a valid instrument permitting the creditor to direct an attorney-in-fact to confess the judgment; when the creditor obtains a confessed judgment, that judgment is subject to the same rules governing all judgments, including the limitation imposed by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1. Safrin v. Travaini Pumps USA, Inc., 269 Va. 412, 611 S.E.2d 352, 2005 Va. LEXIS 46 (2005). Trial court erred in modifying confessed judgment.  Trial court erred in entering judgment for a creditor for attorneys fees more than 21 days after the creditor confessed a judgment against a debtor under § 8.01-432; the creditor did not assert a claim for liquidated attorneys fees at the time that it confessed the judgment and it became bound by the finality of that judgment under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1. Safrin v. Travaini Pumps USA, Inc., 269 Va. 412, 6 11 S.E.2d 352, 2005 Va. LEXIS 46 (2005). Trial court erred in modifying confessed judgment.  It was error to summarily reduce the amount of a confessed judgment without a creditors consent because once the trial court granted the debtors motion to reduce the judgment, the matter had to be set down for a full trial on the merits of the creditors claim as if the creditor had filed an action at law on the underlying note, as there was no statutory distinction between a motion to reduce a confess ed judgment and a motion to set aside a confessed judgment. Catjen, LLC v. Hunter Mill West, L.C., 295 Va. 625, 817 S.E.2d 139, 2018 Va. LEXIS 96 (2018). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Judgment may be confessed on contingent obligation.  A director of a bank executed a note to create a reserve out of which any loss to the assets of the bank might be made good during a period of three years, and au thorized a confession of judgment upon it. It was held that upon the happening of the contingency anticipated at the time of the execution of the note, that is, when the assets of the bank were found insufficient to cover its total obligation, the direct ors obligation became definite and certain in such form that the holder had a right to maintain an action of debt thereon, and the director was therefore indebted to another within the meaning of this section, and judgment could be confessed upon the note. Spady v. Farmers &amp; Merchants Trust Bank, 168 Va. 143, 190 S.E. 173, 1937 Va. LEXIS 214 (1937). Entry in common law order book is not essential to validity of judgment.  It was contended that the proper order book designated in this section meant the Common Law Order Book, that the duty of the clerk to enter the ju dgment in the Common Law Order Book was mandatory and essential to the validity of the judgment, and that a confessed judgment which was entered by the clerk in a book labeled Common Law Order Book  Confession of Judgment  No. 1, was void. It was held that there was no merit in this contention, since, if the legislature had intended that the failure of the clerk to make the entry should render the confessed judgment void, this section would have said so plainly, in view of prior decisions of the Supreme Court that a similar provision in § 8.01-431 relating to judgments confessed in vacation was merely directory. The failure of this section to invalidate the judgment by reason of the clerks not making the required entry be comes all the more significant when we consider that in § 8.01-441 the legislature has expressly said that a judgment confessed by virtue of a warrant or power of attorney which does not comply with this article shall be invalid. American Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. National Bank, 170 Va. 169, 196 S.E. 693, 1938 Va. LEXIS 175 (1938). A defendant confessing judgment is estopped, in the absence of fraud, to question its validity on account of irregularities to which he did not object, or to dispute any facts set forth in the confession, and if, after the entry of the judgment, he ratifies or accepts it, or acquiesces in it, he is estopped to deny the authority on w hich it was confessed or otherwise to impeach its validity. Johnson v. Alvis, 159 Va. 229, 165 S.E. 489, 1932 Va. LEXIS 185 (1932). And defendants creditor or trustee in bankruptcy may be estopped.  A creditor of the judgment debtor, having recognized the validity of a judgment by confession by seeking, in interpleader proceedings, to obtain the balance of th e proceeds derived from the sale of the debtors property under execution of the judgment, was estopped to attack the judgment on the grounds that it was not obtained in compliance with this section. Likewise, the judgment debtors trustee in bankr uptcy, having been a party to the interpleader proceedings and acquiesced in and agreed to a disbursement of the fund by the court, was estopped to set aside the judgment. Smith v. Litton, 167 Va. 263, 188 S.E. 214, 1936 Va. LEXIS 301 (1936). But decision is not res adjudicata in bankruptcy court.  The decision of the Supreme Court that a trustee in bankruptcy was estopped to attack a judgment confessed by an officer of the bankrupt corporation under this se ction, on the ground that the judgment was irregular and void on its face, was not res adjudicata so as to prevent the federal district court from examining the judgment and disallowing or subordinating it as a claim in bankruptcy proceedings. Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 281, 1939 U.S. LEXIS 971 (1939). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Judgment set aside for failure to strictly comply with terms of power of attorney.  Under the clear language of a guaranty as to the power of the attorney-in-fact to confess judgment, the lender as attorney-in-fact was required to file an affidav it simultaneously with the confession of judgment. Because the attorney-in-fact did not follow the express language of the terms of the power given, the confessed judgment was a nullity. Boothe v. First Va. Cmty. Bank, 82 Va. Cir. 477, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXI S 55 (Fairfax County Apr. 8, 2011). Confessed judgment void ab initio.  Confessed judgment that was entered by the attorney-in-fact for a debtor and in favor of a creditor was void ab initio because the court did not have jurisdiction to accept the confessed judgment as the confessed judgment was erroneous in that it was for an amount that exceeded that provided for in the promissory note between the debtor and the creditor.

Whenever any such judgment is set aside or modified the case shall be placed on the trial docket of the court, and the proceedings thereo n shall thereafter be the same as if an action at law had been instituted upon the bond, note or other evidence of debt upon which judgment was confessed. After such case is so docketed the court shall make such order as to the pleadings, future proceedi ngs and costs as to the court may seem just. History History. Code 1950, § 8-357; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE The language creditor or creditors for whom the judgment was confessed has been inserted in former § 8-357 for clarification.

For survey of Virginia law on practice and pleading for the year 1973-1974, see 60 Va. L. Rev. 1572 (1974). CASE NOTES Reduction of confessed judgments.  It was error to summarily reduce the amount of a confessed judgment without a creditors consent because once the trial court granted the debtors motion to reduce the judgment, the matter had to be set down for a full trial on the merits of the creditors claim as if the creditor had filed an action at law on the underlying note, as there was no statutory distinction between a motion to reduce a confess ed judgment and a motion to set aside a confessed judgment. Catjen, LLC v. Hunter Mill West, L.C., 295 Va. 625, 817 S.E.2d 139, 2018 Va. LEXIS 96 (2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Authority to enter judgment.  The confessed judgment under § 8.01-433, entered against a debtor, was void because the court had no authority to enter it; under § 8.01-433.1, a notice of confession of judgment provision was an absolute requirement for the entry of a confessed judgment based on a confession of judgment provision contained in a note and because the notice was not contained in the note signed by the debtor, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the confessed judgment. Citibank, N.A. v. Aburish, 59 Va. Cir. 58, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 328 (Richmond Apr. 8, 2002). Notice requirements.  There were two prongs to the service and notice requirements for a confession of judgment: (1) service had to be effected by the clerk under § 8.01-438 within 60 days or the judgment was void; and (2) the defendant debtor had 21 days from receipt of the notice to notify the creditor of its intent to exercise its rights under § 8.01-433 and move the court to have the confessed judgment set aside or reduced. Mt. Empire Ventures, L.L.C. v. Bal, 73 Va. Cir. 198, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 60 (Richmond Apr. 3, 2007). Timeliness of motion.  Individuals motion to strike a confession of judgment on a companys claim to recover on a note was granted where their motion was filed within 21 days of receiving notice of the entry of the confessed judgment and thus, the motion was timely under § 8.01-433. Mt. Empire Ventures, L.L.C. v. Bal, 73 Va. Cir. 198, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 60 (Richmond Apr. 3, 2007). Because a confessed judgment that was entered by the attorney-in-fact for a debtor and in favor of a creditor was void ab initio  as the court did not have ju risdiction to accept the confessed judgment in that it was erroneously entered for an amount that exceeded that provided for in the promissory note between the debtor and the creditor  the debtors motion to vacate was not untimely filed after the 21-day time limit. Forge LLC v. Pearson, 101 Va. Cir. 221, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 35 (Fairfax County Feb. 28, 2019). Motion to set aside confessed judgme nt.  General contractors motion for reconsideration of an order granting a motion to set aside a confessed judgment was denied because the promissory note and conf essed judgment agreement the contractor entered into with a subcontractor and its owners specifically stated that the parties settlement agreement was incorporated therein by reference; therefore, any defense to the settlement agreement would be a de fense against the promissory note and confessed judgment agreement, and so long as the subcontractor and owners sufficiently pleaded the elements of fraud, the confessed judgment could be set aside. Fru-Con Constr. Corp. v. Araujo Constr. Co., 78 Va. Cir . 132, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 4 (Fairfax County Feb. 18, 2009). Defendant did not demonstrate that he would have an adequate defense at law sufficient to set aside a confessed judgment against him under § 8.01-433. Because the allonge to the confessed judgment promissory note did not come into existence due to either the failure of a condition precedent or a failure of consideration, the parties were bound by the terms of the original note. MDDC, LLC v. Lawrence, 92 Va. Ci r. 326, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 31 (Fairfax County Feb. 25, 2016). Purchasers motion to set aside confessed judgment was granted where her complaint alleging fraud and fraudulent inducement applied to the overall purchase of the business, including a confessed promissory note that did not explicitly incorporate the stock purchase or security agreements, and thus, the purchaser had met the requirements of this section. Lim v. Venketapathi, 97 Va. Cir. 67, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 296 (Fairfax County Oct. 4, 2017). Judgment set aside for failure to strictly comply with terms of power of attorney.  Under the clear language of a guaranty as to the power of the attorney-in-fact to confess judgment, the lender as attorney-in-fact was required to file an affidav it simultaneously with the confession of judgment. Because the attorney-in-fact did not follow the express language of the terms of the power given, the confessed judgment was a nullity. Boothe v. First Va. Cmty. Bank, 82 Va. Cir. 477, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXI S 55 (Fairfax County Apr. 8, 2011). Motion granted.  Debtors motion to set aside a confession of judgment was granted, where it presented an adequate defense that the meaning of the term proceeds in a se ttlement agreement with the creditor was ambiguous, and did not define what was meant by the same, but the tender of stock as proceeds was just as good as tendering cash to satisfy the obligations under the note. Ali v. TeleScience Int'l, Inc., 64 Va. Ci r. 60, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 16 (Fairfax County Feb. 5, 2004). Because it was not clear whether trier of fact would reject debtors defense of accord and satisfaction as to creditors confessed judgment against him on a promissory note, debtors motion that confessed judgment be set aside was granted. Burdette Smith Group, P.C. v. Elza, 65 Va. Cir. 314, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 215 (Fairfax County Aug. 2, 2004). Motion to set aside a confessed judgment was granted because plaintiffs evidence of debt did not include the statutory language required under § 8.01-433.1 . As such, the court lacked jurisdiction to enter the confessed judgment and the order was void ab initio. Superior Paving Corp. v. Bud &amp; The Boyz Constr., 79 Va. Cir. 372, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 121 (Fairfax County Oct. 5, 2009). § 8.01-433.1. Notice of confession of judgment provision. Text No judgment shall be confessed upon a note, bond, or other evidence of debt pursuant to a confession of judgment provision contained therein which does not contain a st atement typed in boldface print of not less than eight point type on its face: IMPORTANT NOTICE THIS INSTRUMENT CONTAINS A CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT PROVISION WHICH CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF IMPORTANT RIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE AS A DEBTOR AND ALLOWS THE CREDITOR TO OBTAIN A JUDGMENT AGAINST YOU WITHOUT ANY FURTHER NOTICE.

Rev. 679 (1992). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Authority to enter judgment.  The confessed judgment under § 8.01-433, entered against a debtor, was void because the court had no authority to enter it; under § 8.01-433.1, a notice of confession of judgment provision was an absolute requirement for the entry of a confessed judgment based on a confession of judgment provision contained in a note and because the notice was not contained in the note signed by the debtor, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the confessed judgment. Citibank, N.A. v. Aburish, 59 Va. Cir. 58, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 328 (Richmond Apr. 8, 2002).

In the event the judgment debtor files a motion or other pleading within such 21-day period, the judgment shall not be a lien against such real estate or its basis of execution against personal property until an order to that effect is entered by the court.

Authority to confess judgment in the clerks office must be strictly pursued, but in absence of proof to the contrary the presumption is that the agent performed his duty in the authorized manner. Bank of Chatham v. Arendall, 178 Va. 183, 16 S.E.2d 352, 1941 Va. LEXIS 155 (1941) (decided under prior law). Warrant of authority in note evidencing contingent obligation.  Where the obligation of the maker of a note was contingent, the ancient, accepted and regular procedure, by one of the common-law actions or by notice of motion, would have been preferable to the confession of judgment on the note by virtue of a warrant of authority made of part thereof. However, in view of the former version of this section, and the fact that the final result of the litigation on the note in que stion would have been the same regardless of what form of action the holder had instituted against the maker, the confession of judgment did not constitute reversible error. Spady v. Farmers &amp; Merchants Trust Bank, 168 Va. 143, 190 S.E. 173, 1937 Va. LEX IS 214 (1937) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Lost note.  Because plaintiff submitted a copy of the note, plaintiff met the statutory requirements necessary to enforce the provision of a lost note; the affidavit averred that plaintiff was in possession of the original note and was entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred, and plaintiff could not reasonably obtain the note because its whereabouts could not be determined; the statute did not require that th ose facts be proven by affidavit, let alone by an affidavit signed by plaintiff, and a true and accurate copy of the instrument produced in the normal course of business was given the same effect as an original.

The entire procedure for confession of judgment by an attorney-in-fact is predicated upon, and presupposes, a valid authorization in a note or bond containing the cognovit clause. Without such authorization the attorney-in-fact is without authority to act and the court is without jurisdiction to enter judgment. Pate v.

Service requirement waived.  Debtors waived any objection to the service of a confessed judgment by agreeing in a Forbearance Agreement to appoint an attorney-in-fact to confess judgment agai nst them and by ratifying and confirming the acts of the attorney-in-fact as if done by themselves. Agnew v. United Leasing Corp., 680 Fed. Appx. 149, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 3140 (4th Cir. 2017). Void confessed judgment.  Provisions of the statute are clearly intended to afford a debtor a limited opportunity to have a day in court to assert a defense to a creditors claim; those provisions are clearly self-executing. Westlake Legal Grp. v. Flynn, 293 Va. 344, 798 S.E.2d 187, 2017 Va. LEXIS 60 (2017). Record contained evidence of facts clearly sufficient to establish jurisdiction to consider and award sanctions to a client because a confessed judgment became vo id due to a failure to serve a certified copy on the client; thus, the attorney filed a suggestion in garnishment to divert the clients wages in an effort to enforce a judgment that had been void by operation of law, and the circuit courts author ity to impose sanctions did not depend on the validity of the confessed judgment. Westlake Legal Grp. v. Flynn, 293 Va. 344, 798 S.E.2d 187, 2017 Va. LEXIS 60 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Notice requirements.  There were two prongs to the service and notice requirements for a confession of judgment: (1) service had to be effected by the clerk under § 8.01-438 within 60 days or the judgment was void; and (2) the defendant debtor had 21 days from receipt of the notice to notify the creditor of its intent to exercise its rights under § 8.01-433 and move the court to have the confessed judgment set aside or reduced. Mt. Empire Ventures, L.L.C. v. Bal, 73 Va. Cir. 198, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 60 (Richmond Apr. 3, 2007). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Service of copy of order on nonresident debtor.  Service under § 8.01-438 is sufficient if a foreign officer executes the same in accord with the law of the foreign jurisdiction. Thus, service by posting is s ufficient if authorized under the law of the foreign jurisdiction. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable John T.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section modifies the common-law rule that in all actions of contract the plaintiff must prove his contract against as many persons as he alleged it against, and that he must recover against all or none. New York, P. &amp; N.R.R. v. Cromwell, 98 Va. 227, 35 S.E. 444, 1900 Va. LEXIS 30 (1900); Cahoon v. McCullock, 92 Va. 177, 23 S.E. 225, 18 95 Va. LEXIS 101 (1895). It appli es where defense is personal to some defendants.  This section applies to an action on a contract against two or more defendants, when the defense of some is personal to themselves, though the defense is that the y never were parties to the contract sued on, as non est factum. Bush v. Campbell, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 403, 1875 Va. LEXIS 27 (1875); McIntyre v. Smyth, 108 Va. 736, 62 S.E. 930, 1908 Va. LEXIS 93 (1908). But not defense going to right o f recovery.  This section does not apply where one of several joint defendants alone pleads matter which is not merely personal to himself, but which goes to the plaintiff s right of recovery against all the defendants. In such a case, if the plea is good, judgment cannot be rendered against any of the defendants. Schofield v. Palmer, 134 F. 753, 1904 U.S. App. LEXIS 5176 (C.C.D. Va. 1904). Nor where nothing in record shows that defense is personal.  This section has no application in an action against two who file a joint plea of non assumpsit, where the plaintiff has the action dismissed as to one, and asks leave to amend his declaration as to the other, and there is nothing to show that the defense relied on is personal to the former. Hence, it is not error to refuse such leave. Gibson v. Beveridge, 90 Va. 696, 19 S.E. 785, 1894 Va. LEXIS 46 (1894). There may be judgments against different defendants at different times.  Under this section there may be a judgment in favor of some of the defendants at one time, and against others at another. Bush v. Campbell, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 403 , 1875 Va. LEXIS 27 (1875); McIntyre v. Smyth, 108 Va. 736, 62 S.E. 930, 1908 Va. LEXIS 93 (1908). And default judgment against some defendants after discontinuance as to others.  Plaintiff brought an action of debt against F. and M. as late partners and makers of a negotiable note, and against C. and G. as indorsers. The case stood on the office judgment docket at the next term of the court, when F. filed his plea of nil debet, which was sworn to. On the motion of plaintiff, the cause was discontinued as to F. The other parties not appearing, there was a judgment by default against them. It was held that the judgment was a valid judgment against M., C. and G. Muse v. Farmers Bank, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 252, 1876 Va. LEXIS 20 (1876). And judgment barred against principal is not barred against surety.  Under this section and § 8.01-251, where judgment has been recovered against a principal and his surety, no length of time short of the period prescribed by th e act of limitations will bar the right of the creditor to enforce his judgment against the surety, or his estate, even though an action is barred as to the principal.

If there be a judgment against one or more joint wrongdoers, the full satisfaction of such judgment accepted as such by the plaintiff shall be a discharge of all joint wrongdoers, except as to the costs; provided, however, this section shall have no effect on the right of contribution between joint wrongdoers as set out in § 8.01-34. History History. Code 1950, § 8-368; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-443 changes the former law so that discharge of all joint tort-feasors, except as to costs, occurs only when one of multiple judgments has been fully satisfied and has been accepted as such by the plaintiff. Satisfaction is determined by case law and in an appropriate situation would include, besides full payment, an accord and satisfaction or a covenant not to sue supported by consideration. (See Shortt v. Hudson Supply Co., 191 Va. 306, 60 S.E.2d 900 (1950). See also Dickenson v. Tabb, 208 Va. 184, 156 S.E.2d 795 (1967) and Harris v. City of Roanoke, 179 Va. 1, 18 S.E.2d 303 (1942).

Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . Section changes the common law.  In England, and formerly in this jurisdiction, a judgment without satisfaction, against one tortfeasor operated as a release of all other tortfeasors liable for t he same wrong. This rule was strictly applied from 1802, when Wilkes v. Jackson, 12 Va. (2 Hen. &amp; M.) 355 (1808), was decided, until the adoption in 1919 of this section. McLaughlin v. Siegel, 166 Va. 374, 185 S.E. 873, 1936 Va. LEXIS 199 (1936). Plaintiff may elect whether he will prosecute judgment against joint tortfeasor.  Under this section plaintiff has the right to elect whether he will or will not prosecute a judgment against several joint tortfeasors, and has the right to await the trial and result of an action against another joint tortfeasor before deciding whether he will prosecute the first judgment by suing out execution thereon. Fitzgerald v. Campbell, 131 Va. 486, 109 S.E. 308, 1921 Va. LEXIS 40 (1921) (see Town of Wayn esboro v. Wiseman, 163 Va. 778, 177 S.E. 224 (1934)). But release of one j oint tortfeasor releases all.  A release of one jointly liable for a wrong will operate as a release of all other wrongdoers liable for the same injury, and this is true even if the release its elf contains a statement reserving the right of action against other wrongdoers. McLaughlin v. Siegel, 166 Va. 374, 185 S.E. 873, 1936 Va. LEXIS 199 (1936). The legislature di d not intend to change this rule.  The fact that the General Assembly changed the general rule respecting the release of joint obligors, and left unimpaired the rule respecting joint wrongdoers, is persuasive that it was satisfied with and approved the law applicable to the release of joint wrongdoers. First &amp; Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Bank of Waverly, 170 Va. 496, 197 S.E. 462, 1938 Va. LEXIS 205 (1938). Plaintiff may elect which joint tortfeasor he will seek to satisfy judgment against.  The effect of this section is that once a plaintiff in a personal injury action has obtained a judgment against several joint tortfeasors, the plaintiff has the r ight to elect against which tortfeasor he will seek to satisfy his judgment. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 789 F.2d 272, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 24596 (4th Cir. 1986). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Employee and employer cons idered one entity.  Because an employer was vicariously liable for the negligent acts of a doctor under the doctrine of respondeat superior, the doctor and the employer were consider ed as one entity for purposes of contribution under § 8.01-443 when the underlying medical malpractice judgment found them jointly and severally liable with a medical center. Maryview Med. Ctr. v. Chacko, 71 Va. Cir. 438, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 315 (Suff olk Nov. 15, 2005). Default judgment against one party not a bar to proceeding against another.  In a subcontractors claim against a lessee to recover in quantum meruit, the subcontractors default judgment against the contractor for breach of contract had no impact on the quantum meruit claim; under § 8.01-443, the subcontractor could pursue all its claims to judgment, although it could only collect one judgment. R. M. Harrison Mech. Corp. v. Decker Indus., Inc., 75 Va. Cir. 404, 2008 Va. Cir. LEX IS 273 (Hopewell Aug. 28, 2008). Insureds discharge in bankruptcy.  While an insureds discharge in bankruptcy did not operate as a release of the insureds employee or insurer as contemplated in § 8.01-443, entering defa ult judgment against the employee would deny the insurer the rights guaranteed it by subsection F of § 38.2-2206.

Christian name of marr ied woman should be shown.  Docketing and indexing a judgment in the name of Mrs. John Smith is no notice of a judgment against Mary Smith, who is in fact the wife of John Smith.

LEXIS 86 (1901). Same may be used.  Where the name of a judgment debtor is entered in the index of the judgment lien docket, giving reference to a page of the docket, and immediately under his name the word same is written, also giving reference to a page of docket, this is a sufficient compliance with the provisions of this section as to the second-named judgment. Fulkerson v. Taylor, 102 Va. 314, 46 S.E. 309, 1904 Va. LEXIS 72 (1904). Allegation and proof of indexi ng required.  An allegation in a bill that a judgment sought to be enforced was duly docketed is a sufficient allegation of the indexing of the judgment as required by this sec tion, but if the fact of indexing be put in issue it must be proved, and it would seem that this is not sufficiently done by the mere production of an abstract of the judgment which does not certify that it was duly docketed, and makes no reference to th e indexing. Fulkerson v. Taylor, 100 Va. 426, 41 S.E. 863, 1902 Va. LEXIS 41 (1902). Federal law governs the filing of a notice of a federal tax lien, and the states may not prescribe the form or contents of that notice.

Discharge in bankruptcy would not prevent enforcement of lien acquired before bankruptcy proceedings.  A debtors discharge in bankruptcy would not prevent a judgment creditor from a post-discharge enforcement of its lien upon debtors real property interests that were acquired before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. Where the creditors judgment was recorded before the debtor filed his bankruptcy petition, the judgment continued to be a lien on any interest the debtor may have had in land despite debtors bankruptcy discharge from personal liability for payment of the judgement. Therefore, the judgment lien was not paid off or discharged in the debtors bankruptcy proceedings. And the trial court erred in ordering that the l ien be released. Leasing Serv. Corp. v. Justice, 243 Va. 441, 416 S.E.2d 439, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2783, 1992 Va. LEXIS 35 (1992). Discharge in bankruptcy made lien ineffective against real property acquired after commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.  Although lien was imposed on all of debtors real property interests in the county that were acquired after judgment creditors judgment was recorded, debto rs discharge in bankruptcy made the lien ineffective as to any real property interests in the county that debtor acquired after the commencement of his bankruptcy proceedings. Leasing Serv. Corp. v. Justice, 243 Va. 441, 416 S.E.2d 439, 8 Va. Law Rep . 2783, 1992 Va. LEXIS 35 (1992). Incorrect order of satisfied in bankruptcy.  Trial court incorrectly ordered a judgment creditors recorded judgment marked satisfied in bankruptcy; the trial court could only order the release of judgment creditors lien in a proceeding under this section upon proof that the lien had been discharged in bankruptcy; furthermore, debtor had the burden of proof as to his entitlement to relief under this section; thus, the trial court also erred i n imposing the burden on judgment creditor to show that debtor had property in county that was subject to its lien.

Setoff pursuant to § 58.1-535 erroneously denied.  Because § 58.1-535 permitted a claimant agency, in compliance with the provisions of that statute, to set off a monetary judgment debt, and the Setoff Debt Col lection Act, § 58.1-520 et seq., was not limited in application to tax refunds, the circuit court erred in failing to mark a judgment between a university, as the claimant agency, and a judgment debtor as satisfied when it was undisputed that the cred itor owed the university more than the amount of the judgment entered.

Not granting satisfaction of judgment.  Trial court retained jurisdiction to reconsider its order when the trial court had to rule on the public authoritys motion for satisfaction of judgment regard ing the judgment awarded in what otherwise appeared to be the trial courts final order. The trial court could suspend its own order to consider whether the judgment had been satisfied and could conclude that satisfaction had not occurred because the amount of the debt remained at issue.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions.

Section 8.01-268 must be read in conjunction with this section, which states that [e ]very judgment for money rendered in this Commonwealth by any state or federal court . . . shall be a lien on all the real estate of . . . the defendant . . . . Thus, any suit in which the defendant is an individual has the potential to affect the ti tle to real estate. Hart v. United Va. Bank, 24 Bankr. 821, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5421 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). This section must be read in conjunction with § 55-96. Leake v. Finance One Mtg., Inc. (In re Snyder), 57 Bankr. 438, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5057 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1985). Procedure available to any party seeking money judgment.  Under § 8.01-268 and this section, the recording of a memorandum of lis pendens is open to any litigating party seeking a money judgment against an individual property owner in Virginia. Hart v. United Va. Bank, 24 Bankr. 821, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5421 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). A judgment lien is a right given the judgment creditor to have his claim satisfied by th e seizure of the land of his judgment debtor. In re Washington, 6 Bankr. 226, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 4435 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1980). Effe ct of discharge in bankruptcy.  A discharge in bankruptcy does not necessarily affect a specific lien, but only releases the bankrupt from personal liability. Turshen v. Bennett Heating &amp; Air Co nditioning, Inc. (In re Brisbane), 2 Bankr. 636, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5596 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1980). Monetary award in equitable distribution proceedings.  A party who is granted a monetary award in an equitable distribution proceeding is in the same position as any other judgment creditor and has the same enforcemen t remedies available. Booth v. Booth, 7 Va. App. 22, 371 S.E.2d 569, 5 Va. Law Rep. 237, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 86 (1988). The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Section applies to decrees.  Since a decree for money, by express enactment, is embraced by the word judgment, the statute fixing the lien of a judgment applies equally to such decree s. Hockman v. Hockman, 93 Va. 455, 25 S.E. 534, 1896 Va. LEXIS 96 (1896). Lien is a legal one.  The lien of a judgment given by this section is a legal lien, and the judgment creditor can enforce it in a court of equity without pursuing his debtors perso nalty. The lien, being a plain legal one, expressly created by statute, cannot be judicially modified to soften the supposed hardship of secret encumbrances. Gurnee v. Johnson, 77 Va. 712, 1883 Va. LEXIS 108 (1883); Hutchison v. Grubbs, 80 Va. 251, 1885 Va. LEXIS 62 (1885); Blakemore v. Wise, 95 Va. 269, 28 S.E. 332, 1897 Va. LEXIS 35 (1897); Flanary v. Kane, 102 Va. 547, 46 S.E. 312, 1904 Va. LEXIS 101 (1904). It may be enforced immediately.  The debt evidenced by a judgment, unlike many obligations described in mortgages or deeds of trust, is past due. There is nothing to prevent its immediate enforce ment. Jones v. Hall, 177 Va. 658, 15 S.E.2d 108, 1941 Va. LEXIS 250 (1941). Judgment cannot be impaired by any act of the debtor.  When a judgment creditor has obtained his judgment and caused it to be docketed, his lien is perfect and complete, and cannot be defeated or impaired by any act o f his debtor in which he did not participate. Strayer v. Long, 93 Va. 695, 26 S.E. 409, 1896 Va. LEXIS 127 (1896). But it is lost if third person acquires title by adverse possession.  It is true that the lien of a judgment may be indefinitely continued against the land of the judgment debtor in his possession, or of others holding titles derive d from and in privity with him. But obviously the same rule cannot be applied to strangers who have acquired a perfect legal title not in privity with but adversely to the title of the judgment debtor. In other words, the life of a judgment may be indefi nitely prolonged as to any property upon which it can operate, but whenever the right of the judgment debtor to make an entry on or bring an action to recover any land held adversely is tolled by § 8.01-236, the right of his judgment creditor to subje ct land to the satisfaction of his judgment also ceases. The lien is a vested right, but not more so than the title to which the lien attaches, and when the statute of limitations destroys the latter it necessarily destroys the former. McClanahans Ad mr v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 122 Va. 705, 96 S.E. 453 (1918). But see Flanary v. Kane, 102 Va. 547, 46 S.E. 312 (1904), wherein it was held that § 8.01-236 did not apply to a suit to enforce a judgment lien . Judgment creditor has no interest in the land of his debtor. He has neither a jus in re nor a jus ad rem. He has no right to the possession. He has simply a lien upon the land, and the right to subject it to the discharge of that lien. McClanahan's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 122 Va. 705, 96 S.E. 453, 1918 Va. LEXIS 137 (1918). He has no proprietary right, merely a right to levy.  A judgment lien is a right given the judgment creditor to have his claim satisfied by the seizure of the land of his judgment debtor. It is not a proprietary righ t in the lands of the judgment debtor, but merely a right to levy on any such lands for the purpose of satisfying the judgment to the exclusion or destruction of any right which may have accrued to others since the attachment of the lien. Jones v. Hall, 177 Va. 658, 15 S.E.2d 108, 1941 Va. LEXIS 250 (1941). Title of debtor is not divested by entry of judgment.  When levy on real property is actually made by a judgment creditor under a judgment lien, the title of the creditor, for this purpose, relates back to the time of his judgment, so as to cut out intermediate incumbrances. But subject to this, the debtor has full power to sell or otherwise dispose of the land. His title to it is not divested or transferred, by the judgment, to the judgment creditor. Jones v. Hall, 177 Va. 658, 15 S.E.2d 108, 1941 Va. LEXIS 250 (1941). Court may restrain acts tending to lessen value of lien.  If, in a suit to enforce a judgment lien on real property, it is shown that the owner of the land, or his assignee in possession, is doing any act that tends to l essen its value and to jeopardize the full satisfaction of the judgment, the act may be restrained until the land is, in due course, offered for sale. Jones v. Hall, 177 Va. 658, 15 S.E.2d 108, 1941 Va. LEXIS 250 (1941). A decree for alimony constitutes a lien under this section upon all of the husbands real estate from the date of such decree, not only for the installments presently due, but for those that shall fall due under such decree in the future; and where a temporary decree for alimony is subsequently made permanent, the lien for the whole amou nt dates from the date of the temporary decree. Issacs v. Issacs, 117 Va. 730, 86 S.E. 105, 1915 Va. LEXIS 88 (1915); Morris v. Henry, 193 Va. 631, 70 S.E.2d 417, 1952 Va. LEXIS 174 (1952). Lien of decree for support of infant held to continue after fathers death.  Divorce decree directing defendant father to pay a certain sum monthly for alimony and support of his infant daughter, became a lien upon the land he then owned a nd which he conveyed less than two months later to his father, and the lien so created, to the extent that the amount thereof was for the benefit of the infant daughter, was intended to and did by said decree continue in effect after the death of her fat her, and until she became 21 ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-459"><akn:num>§ 8.01-459</akn:num><akn:heading>Priority of judgments</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Judgments against the same person shall, as among themselves, attach to his real estate, and be payable thereout in the order of the priority of the lien of such judgme nts, respectively.

LEXIS 23317 (E.D. Va. 1986). In equity, whole estate must be applied first to elder judgment.  In equity, judgments are liens on the whole of the debtors equitable estate, and the whole is first to be applied to the elder judgment, then the whole of the residue to the junior judgment, and in neither case is only a moiety to be applied to their satisfaction. Haleys v. Williams, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 140, 1829 Va. LEXIS 14 (1829) (see Withers v. Carter, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 407 (1848); Buchanan v. Clark, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 164 (1853).

An order after reasonable notice to the obligor adjudicating that the obligor is delin quent, shall be a lien on the obligors real estate. Liens under this section shall arise when duly docketed in the manner prescribed for the docketing of other judgments for money; however, no such decree, order or judgment for support and maintenanc e or for a monetary award in accordance with § 20-107.3 shall be docketed unless so ordered by the court in such decree, order or judgment. On petition by any interested person and after reasonable notice to the obligee, the court in which the obligor was adjudicated delinquent may order the release or other modification of such lien. The lien may also be released upon agreement of all persons for whom support and maintenance is ordered under the decree, order or judgment, provided all such persons a re sui juris. The clerk shall note the release on the record upon receipt of an affidavit from all the obligees stating that (i) all the obligees are sui juris and (ii) they agreed to the release of the lien on specified real property. Any lien created p ursuant to this section shall expire upon the support obligation being paid in full by the obligor. The clerk may release such liens upon receipt of an affidavit of all the obligees that such support obligation has been paid in full, or upon an order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Annotations REVISERS NOTE A change has been made in former § 8-388 so that the lien for maintenance and support of a spouse or infant children arises only after the order adjudicating t he obligor delinquent and creating the lien has been docketed as other money judgments are docketed.

Booth v. Booth, 7 Va. App. 22, 371 S.E.2d 569, 5 Va. Law Rep. 237, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 86 (1988). Chancell or may provide that payments shall not be a lien.  It is within the sound discretion of the chancellor to provide that alimony and support (now maintenance and support) payments should not be a lien upon the real estate of the party required to make such payments. Canavos v. Canavos, 205 Va. 744, 139 S.E.2d 825, 1965 Va. LEXIS 129 (1965) (decided under prior law). A decree for payments in lieu of alimony (now maintenance and support), approving a cont ract between the parties, is not a lien on the realty of the husband. Durrett v.

Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, may refer to former provisi ons. This section applies only to suits for the enforcement of judgment liens. Neff v. Wooding , 83 Va. 432, 2 S.E. 731, 1887 Va. LEXIS 88 (1887). It does not apply to suits to enforce vendors lien.  The court may decree a sale of land to satisfy a vendors lien, as distinguished from a judgment lien, without ascertaining whether the rents and profits would be sufficient to pay within five years. Neff v. Wooding, 83 Va. 432, 2 S.E. 731, 1887 Va. LEXIS 88 (1887). Or deeds of trust.  In a suit to enforce a trust deed the value of the rents and profits of the land is immaterial, as the deed is not a judgment within the meaning of this section. Kyger v. Sipe, 89 Va. 507, 16 S.E. 627, 1892 Va. LEXIS 127 (1892). Or to suits to subject decedents lands to payment of debts.  This section limits the jurisdiction of the court in the sale of real estate to enforce a judgment lien, and applies to a suit in equity brought to subject the la nds of a living debtor to the lien of a judgment thereon. It has no application to an equity suit to subject the lands of a decedent to the payment of his debts. Morrison v. Morrison, 177 Va. 417, 14 S.E.2d 322, 1941 Va. LEXIS 228 (1941). Suit is not one to recover land.  The suit of a judgment creditor to enforce his lien against land is not a suit to recover the land itself. McClanahan's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 122 Va. 705, 96 S.E. 453, 1918 Va. LEXIS 137 (1918). Jurisdiction extends only as far as is necessary to enforce lien.  Jurisdiction in equity to enforce the lien of a judgment against real estate is conferred by this section, but such jurisdiction extends only so far as may be nec essary to satisfy the judgment lien. Tacklett v. Bolling, 172 Va. 326, 1 S.E.2d 285, 1939 Va. LEXIS 241 (1939). But court may do complete justice between parties.  Equity has jurisdiction of a bill to enforce a judgment lien under this section, and having acquired jurisdiction for this purpose, it will go on and do complete justice between the parties, even to the extent of enforcing purely legal demands of which it would not otherwise have jurisdiction. Steinman v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., 121 Va. 611, 93 S.E. 684, 1917 Va. LEXIS 63 (1917); Moorman v. Board, 121 Va. 112, 92 S.E. 833, 1917 Va. LEXIS 15 (1917). Doctrine of laches has no application.  The equitable doctrine of laches has no application to a suit in equity to enforce against the lands of a defendant the lien of a judgment which has been kept ali ve and is not barred by the statute of limitations. The creditor is seeking to enforce a legal, and not an equitable right, expressly conferred by statute and not subject to terms or conditions. Motley v. Carstairs, McCall &amp; Co., 114 Va. 429, 76 S.E. 948 , 1913 Va. LEXIS 103 (1913); McClanahan's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 118 Va. 388, 87 S.E. 731, 1916 Va. LEXIS 21 (1916). Nor has rule that one seeking equity must do equity.  A judgment creditor who comes into a court of equity to enforce his lien upon the debtors land is not asserting an equitable right or seeking relief which it is in the courts equitable discretion to grant or deny. His judgment is a legal lien created expressly by statute. Hence, while it is an ordinary rule of the courts of chancery that he who seeks equity must do equity, this principle has no applicatio n here because the judgment creditors right to resort to the court of equity to enforce his lien is a legal right, without terms and conditions imposed. Motley v. Carstairs, McCall &amp; Co., 114 Va. 429, 76 S.E. 948, 1913 Va. LEXIS 103 (1913). Remedies available to judgment creditor.  In Morrison v. Morrison, 177 Va. 417, 14 S.E.2d 322 (1941), a suit brought under the predecessor to § 64.2-532, the court merely stated that an instance in whi ch the ancestor to former § 8-391 may be applied is to a suit in equity brought to subject the lands of a living debtor to the lien of a judgment thereon. The Morrison court then recognized the two different remedies with separate rules of law availab le to a judgment creditor, one a general creditors suit, and another the judgment-lien creditors suit brought either while the judgment debtor is living or after such debtor dies. Maness v. Tidewater Sand Co., 220 Va. 1042, 266 S.E.2d 438, 1980 V a. LEXIS 199 (1980). Creditor need not have exhausted remedy at law.  Equity now has jurisdiction to enforce a judgment lien against the land of the debtor, notwithstanding the judgment creditor has not exhausted his remedy at law. Price v. Thrash, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 515, 1878 Va. LEXIS 79 (1878); Gordon v. Rixey, 76 Va. 694, 1882 Va. LEXIS 69 (1882); Stovall v. Border Grange Bank, 78 Va. 188, 1883 Va. LEXIS 27 (1883); Hutchison v. Grubbs, 80 Va. 251, 1885 Va. LEXIS 62 (1885); Moor e v. Bruce, 85 Va. 139, 7 S.E. 195, 1888 Va. LEXIS 20 (1888). He need not proceed first against personalty.  A judgment creditor, if he so elects, may resort to a court of equity to enforce the lien of his judgment against the real estate of his debtor, without first pro ceeding by execution at law to subject the personal estate, or assigning any reason for not doing so. Stovall v. Border Grange Bank, 78 Va. 188, 1883 Va. LEXIS 27 (1883). A judgment creditor having established his debt against the judgment debtor during the debtors lifetime has the right to look to the deceased debtors esta te, real and personal, as equally liable. This is a right the creditor may properly exercise, unless some equitable reason demands he proceed first against the personal estate, and the creditor is not compelled to look to the realty merely as a secondary fund for payment. Maness v. Tidewater Sand Co., 220 Va. 1042, 266 S.E.2d 438, 1980 Va. LEXIS 199 (1980). Or show want of personal assets, or issue of fi. Fa.  A judgment creditor may file a bill to subject real estate of his debtor to the satisfaction of his judgment lien without alleging or proving want of personal ass ets, and without issuing a fi. fa. Moore v. Bruce, 85 Va. 139, 7 S.E. 195, 1888 Va. LEXIS 20 (1888). Judgment need not be revived against personal representative of debtor.  A bill in equity may be maintained against the personal representative of a decedent and his devisees or heirs at law, to subject the real estate of the decedent to the payment of a judgment recovered against him in his lifetime, without first reviving the judgment at law. James v. Life, 92 Va. 702, 24 S.E. 275, 1896 Va. LEXIS 33 (1896). Proceeding by judgment creditor held general creditors suit under former § 64.1-181 [now see § 64.2-532].  See Peatross v.

All other liens on land should be ascertained.  Where there are various liens on the land of a debtor, it is premature and erroneous to decree a sale of the land to satisfy certain liens, without first ascertai ning all the liens existing against the land, and determining and definitely fixing their respective amounts and priorities. Daingerfield v. Smith, 83 Va. 81, 1 S.E. 599, 1887 Va. LEXIS 42 (1887); Adkins v. Edwards, 83 Va. 300, 2 S.E. 435, 1887 Va. LEXIS 68 (1887); Alexander v. Howe, 85 Va. 198, 7 S.E. 248, 1888 Va.

Farmers' Nat'l Bank, 86 Va. 291, 9 S.E. 1122, 1889 Va. L EXIS 37 (1889). Inquiry should be held as to rents and profits.  Where the insufficiency of the rents and profits is not alleged, or is alleged and denied, there must be an inquiry, and the court must ascertain the annual value of the rents and profits with a reasonable certainty before decreeing a sale.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Land retained by d ebtor should be first subjected.  If the judgment debtor retains sufficient lands to pay the judgment, they should be first subjected. Dickerson v. Clement, 87 Va. 41, 12 S.E. 105, 1890 Va. LEXIS 87 (1890); Blakemore v. Wise, 95 Va. 269, 28 S.E. 332, 1897 Va. LEXIS 35 (1897). For aliened land is only sec ondarily liable.  Lands being liable for judgments in the inverse order of alienation, those primarily liable should be first subjected before proceeding against the purchaser, who se land is only secondarily liable. Nelson v. Turner, 97 Va. 54, 33 S.E. 390, 1899 Va. LEXIS 10 (1899). Land is chargeable in inverse order of alienation.  The law is now well settled that where land which is subject to the lien of a judgment or other incumbrance is sold in parcels to different persons by successive alienations, it is chargeable in the hands of the purchaser in the inverse order of such alienations. This rule is not only established by the decisions of courts of equity, but in Virginia it is prescribed by this section. Harman v. Oberdorfer, 74 Va. ( 33 Gratt.) 497, 1880 Va. LEXIS 58 (1880); Whitten v. Saunders, 75 Va. 563, 1881 Va. LEXIS 40 (1881) (see also Schultz v. Hansbrough, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 567 (1880); Miller v. Holland, 84 Va. 652, 5 S.E. 701 (1888)). An d lands sold contemporaneously must contribute pro rata.  But where the different parcels of land are sold contemporaneously they must contribute pro rata to the satisfaction of the judgment. Harman v. Oberdorfer, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 497, 1880 Va. LEXIS 58 (1880). Date of deed is presum ed to be time of alienation.  Without evidence of any preceding executory agreements between the parties, or any evidence of the time of the delivery of deeds, except what may be inferred from their duties, it will be presumed that the dates on the deeds are the dates of their delivery, and the land conveyed by the last dated deed will be first liable. Harman v. Oberdorfer, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 497, 1880 Va. LEXIS 58 (1880). But lands sold under contemporaneous identical contracts are sold contemporaneously.  Where several lots of land are sold on the same day, on the same terms of several parties, all of whom are immediately put in possession under the same agreement as to the deeds conveying the lots, and the trust deed to secure the purchase money, although the deeds conveying them are really delivered and recorded at different times, they will all be regarded as alienations as of the day of sale, and, in s ubjecting them to the payment of a judgment docketed against a vendor at the time of the sale, each lot must bear its proportion, according to their relative values on the day of sale. Alley v. Rogers, 60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 366, 1869 Va. LEXIS 9 (1869); Har man v. Oberdorfer, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 497, 1880 Va. LEXIS 58 (1880). Alienee must allege or prove that land is more than sufficient.  Where it nowhere appears, and it has not been suggested as a fact, that real estate to liens is more than sufficient to satisfy the same, a person intending to re ly upon the lands being more than sufficient should allege the fact by answer or establish it by proof.

Procedures not followed.  Bankruptcy court had both related to and ancillary jurisdiction over debtors motion to approve a settlement where distributions under the Chapter 11 c ame solely from the litigation. However, the court did not approve the settlement because the debtors attempt to collect the judgment failed to follow the procedures in § 8.01-466, and its request for financial and other written documents failed t o follow the procedures in § 8.01-506.1.Wellington Apt., LLC v. Clotworthy, 353 Bankr. 465, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 2906 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2006). Relationship to bankruptcy laws.  Under Virginia law, a creditors lien arose on the date that a writ of fieri facias and garnishment summons were served on a bank and debtors accounts were frozen, but on the date that debtor filed his bankruptcy petition, the funds were still on deposit and had not been delivered to the state court. Thus, the garnished funds did not vest in the creditor, as the automatic stay was in place prior to the tim e when the state court could have ordered payment of the funds to the creditor, and debtor was entitled to avoid the creditors judgment lien as impairing his exemption in those funds. In re Underwood, No. 18-70168, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 1573 (Bankr. W.D. Va. May 30, 2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Partial final judgment.  In a multi-party case, absent an exception, any order that adjudicates fewer than all the claims against all the parties must meet the partial final judgment requ irements of the rule before an execution and garnishment summons will issue properly. PNC Bank, N.A. v. Yen, 92 Va. Cir. 331, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 28 (Fairfax County Feb. 26, 2016). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Certified copy of a final judgment order.  A certified copy of a final judgment order issued by the bankruptcy court constitutes an authenticated abstract of judgment for purposes of § 8.01-446, provided the copy otherwise provides the information required by § 8.01-449, and the clerk of court is therefore required to docket it. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Terry H. Whittle, Clerk of Court, Winchester Circuit Court, 10-08 3, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 57 (9/17/10). Fees collected by sheriff when serving writs.  Writs of fieri facias, debtor interrogatories and garnishments are distinct, but related proceedings, so that, although sheriff or other executing officer may be required to levy on the tangible personal property of a judgment debtor when executing a writ of fieri facias, no such requirement is imposed when serving a Summons for Interrogatories or Garnishment Summons.

In cases of unlawful entry and detainer and of ejectment, the officer to whom a writ of eviction has been delivered to be executed shall, at least 72 hours before execution, serve notice of intent to execute, inc luding the date and time of execution, as well as the rights afforded to tenants in §§ 55.1-1255 and 55.1-1416, together with a copy of the writ attached, on the defendant in person or, if the party to be served is not found at the specific propert y for which a writ of eviction has been issued, then service shall be effected by posting a copy of such process at the front door or at such other door as appears to be the main entrance of such property.

Writs of possession issued only in favor of prevailing plaintiff.  Since a judgment in favor of a plaintiff in an action of ejectment is not self-executing, a prevailing plaintiff needs a writ of possession to enforce his right t o possession. But a prevailing defendant, being already in possession, needs no writ to enforce his right to possession. So former version of this section provided for the issuance of a writ of possession only in favor of a plaintiff who has prevailed. P age v. Luhring, 211 Va. 503, 178 S.E.2d 527, 1971 Va.

The application of this section is limited to attacks on the regularity and validity of a writ of fieri facias. Barbuto v. Southern Bank, 231 Va. 63, 340 S.E.2d 813, 1986 Va. LEXIS 164 (1986). Se cond execution after sufficient execution also grounds.  A second execution will be quashed, if issued after a former execution has been satisfied or levied on property sufficient to satisfy it. Sutton v. Marye, 81 Va. 329, 1886 Va. LEXIS 100 (1886) (decided under prior law). Effect of quashing.  After a voidable execution has been quashed it is as void as if it had been a nullity ab initio. Riely v. Solenberger, 18 Va. L. Reg. 352 (1912) (decided under pr ior law). A motion to quash was improperly used where third parties who claimed ownership of certa in property levied upon, improperly sought to prosecute a common law action of trespass and to simultaneously claim ownership of the property seized in the levy. This was an improper use of the statutory motion to quash. Their remedy was under § 8.01- 365, a statute specifically providing strangers to the underlying judgment a swift, direct, and summary method to determine conflicting ownership of property seized in a levy. Barbuto v. Southern Bank, 231 Va. 63, 340 S.E.2d 813, 1986 Va. LEXIS 164 (1986 ). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Motion to quash denied.  Judgment debtors motion to quash a garnishment summons pursuant to § 8.01-477 was denied because the time expired for it to file a responsive pleading, and papers signed by the debtors chief financial officer and filed with the clerk of court had no legal effect; the papers were not a responsive pleading because the debtor, a business organization, could not file a pleading pro se since it had to be re presented by a lawyer authorized to practice law in Virginia pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1A:4. Modular Wood Sys., Inc. v. World Trade Group, L.L.P., 77 Va. Cir. 403, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 103 (Henrico County Feb. 23, 2009). Because the stay as to defendant one was interlocutory, the execution could only issue if the order rendered a partial final judgment against defendant two, but t he order was not expressly labeled a partial final judgment and did not contain express findings of severability; thus, the stay as to defendant one and the personal judgment against defendant two were both interlocutory, and the interlocutory judgment e ntered against defendant two could not support the execution and garnishment, the motions to quash were granted, and the court retained its jurisdiction over the entire case. PNC Bank, N.A. v. Yen, 92 Va. Cir. 331, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 28 (Fairfax County Feb. 26, 2016). § 8.01-477.1. Claims of exemption from execution.

History History. Code 1950, § 8-411; 1977, c. 617. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-478 is former § 8-411. The time at which the execution lien becomes effective is changed from that of its delivery to the officer to the time of a ctual levy. This change in the common law will prevent the injustice which results when a bona fide purchaser takes tangible property from the judgment debtor and later discovers an officer with a writ in his pocket which he had failed to execute.

General Consideration. B. Lien. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Under Virginia law, the officer is not required to seize the property levied on, but only to have it in his power and note it on the execution. The lien acquired by the levy of the execution is both substantial and enduring, as much so as a mortgage or a pledge. In re Lamm, 47 Bankr. 364, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20373 (E.D. Va. 1984). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. A.General Consider ation. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The second step after the issuance of the execution is to levy the same on specific tang ible property, by which such property is set apart from the general property of the defendant and placed in the custody of the law until it can be sold and applied to the payment of the execution. Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 1867 Va. L EXIS 33 (1867). What constitutes levy.  Under the law of Virginia, actual seizure of the goods levied upon is not necessary. If the officer has the goods in his view and power and notes on the writ the fact of his levy thereon, this will in general suffice. Palais v. DeJarnette, 145 F.2d 953, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 2712 (4th Cir. 1944). By levying an execution is meant the setting aside of specific property from the general property of the defendant and placing the same in the custody of the law until it can be sold and applied to the payment of the execution. Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 1867 Va. LEXIS 33 (1867). To constitute an effectual levy, it is not essential that the officer should make an actual seizure. If he has the goods in his power and view, this may suffice. Dorrier v. Masters, 83 Va. 459, 2 S.E. 927, 1887 Va. LEXIS 92 (1887). Failure to remove property from debtors premises does not, of itself, invalidate the levy. The practice in Virginia has been to permit it to remain on the premises of the debtor until the day of sale, in order to save expenses. Officers are not without power to levy because they are physically incapable of carrying away h ousehold goods levied on. Palais v. DeJarnette, 145 F.2d 953, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 2712 (4th Cir. 1944). No notice ne ed be given debtor.  A valid levy may be made on household goods in the owners absence and where he had no formal notice. As to notice to the debtor, the rule in Virginia is that while notice is advisable, it is not essential. Palais v. DeJarnette, 145 F.2d 953, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 2712 (4th Cir. 1944). Plaintiff has right of control.  In executing a writ of fieri facias the sheriff is the agent of the beneficial plaintiff, and he and his attorney have the right to control the execution of the w rit and to say whether the sheriff shall levy it, or return it without doing so. Rowe v. Hardy, 97 Va. 674, 34 S.E. 625, 1899 Va. LEXIS 84 (1899). A plaintiff may always, with the consent of the defendants, abandon a levy upon the property of all or any of them, retaining the right to sue out a new execution against all the defendants. Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 1867 Va. LEXIS 33 (1867). If the defendants in an execution be a principal and his sureties, and the property levied on be that of the sureties, the plaintiff may, with the consent of the sureties only, abandon the levy, and afterwards sue out executions against all the defendants. Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 1867 Va. LEXIS 33 (1867). Property fraudulently conveyed may be levied on.  If property subject to execution be conveyed and such conveyance be either with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, or be upon consideration deemed volu ntary in law, execution may still be enforced. For where the conveyance is fraudulent it is void as to both existing creditors, and subsequent purchasers, and where the conveyance is voluntary only, it is void as to antecedent creditors, though it may be sustained as against subsequent purchasers. Lucas v. Claffin &amp; Co., 76 Va. 269, 1882 Va. LEXIS 30 (1882); Fishburne v. Ferguson, 84 Va. 87, 4 S.E. 575, 1887 Va. LEXIS 12 (1887); Roanoke Nat'l Bank v. Farmers' Nat'l Bank, 84 Va. 603, 5 S.E. 682, 1888 Va. LEXIS 115 (1888); Rucker v. Moss, 84 Va. 634, 5 S.E. 527, 1888 Va. LEXIS 120 (1888); Beecher v. Wilson, 84 Va. 813, 6 S.E. 209, 1888 Va. LEXIS 149 (1888); Rixey v. Detrick, 85 Va. 42, 6 S.E. 615, 1888 Va. LEXIS 8 (1888). Execution cannot be levied on real estate.  Congress gave judgment creditors in federal causes the remedies provided by the state law. This section does not provide for levy of execution on real estate, and a federal court has no power to order it. Clark v. Allen, 117 F. 699, 1902 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93 (D. Va. 1902); Allen v. Clark, 126 F. 738, 1903 U.S. App. LEXIS 4362 (4th Cir. 1903). Execution cannot be levied on real estate. Davis v. National Grange Ins. Co., 281 F. Supp. 998, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8336 (E.D. Va. 1968), disapproved, Rowe v. U nited States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 421 F.2d 937, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11044 (4th Cir. 1970). A levy was not abandoned though creditors postponed sale at the request of debtor, where no relinquishment of the lien was found. As the court said in Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 98 Am. Dec. 631 (1867): A mere suspension of proceedings on a levied execution does not release the levy. Palais v. DeJarnette, 145 F.2d 953, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 2712 (4th Cir. 1944). B.Lien. Lien exists on things capable of being levied on. Such things are goods and chattels cor poreal, as distinguished from incorporeal personalty, or, in other words, goods and chattels in possession as distinguished from choses in action. For example, horses, household and kitchen furniture, etc., are leviable; bonds, notes, and stocks are not. But while goods and chattels corporeal are in their nature leviable, they will cease to be so while in the hands of a receiver. For to levy execution upon them would be to interfere with the possession and control of the court. Davis v. Bonney, 89 Va. 7 55, 17 S.E. 229, 1893 Va. LEXIS 100 (1893). Nature of the lien.  The lien acquired by placing a writ of execution in the hands of the sheriff is of so imperfect a nature as that the plaintiff may abandon it at pleasure by withd rawing his execution from the hands of the sheriff or by directing him not to levy it, without discharging the judgment or even affecting the liability of a surety who may be one of several defendants. Humphrey v. Hitt, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 509, 1850 Va. LE XIS 3 (1850); Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 1867 Va. LEXIS 33 (1867) (see also Rhea v. Preston, 75 Va. 757 (1881)). The lien which a creditor acquires by a levy of his execution upon personal property is, if not enforced by a sale thereof, only temporary. Carr v. Glasscock, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 343, 1846 Va. LEXIS 65 (1846). The lien acquired by the levying of a fieri facias is substantial and enduring, as much so as a mortgage or a pledge. Humphrey v. Hitt, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 509, 1850 Va. LEXIS 3 (1850). The general lien of a fieri facias was intended as a substitute for the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum by which the judgment creditor could reach the unleviable property of an insolvent debtor. In re Acorn Elec. Supply, Inc., 348 F. Supp. 277, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11938 (E.D. Va. 1972). The remedy afforded by garnishment was designed simply to enforce this lien of execution . The lien itself is as complete and perfect without it as with it. It continues in full force, although the creditor should never resort to that remedy. In re Acorn Elec. Supply, Inc., 348 F. Supp. 277, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11938 (E.D. Va. 1972). And prior execution lien is superior to garnishment attachment.  A prior lien by writ of fieri facias is superior to a garnishment attachment even though the garnishment attachment was served on the garnishee first. In re Acorn Elec. Supply, Inc., 348 F. Supp. 277, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11938 (E.D. Va. 1972). When lien commences.  A fieri facias constitutes a lien from the time it is delivered to the officer to be executed. Charron &amp; Co. v. Boswell, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 216, 1868 Va. LEXIS 1...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-479"><akn:num>§ 8.01-479</akn:num><akn:heading>Time for enforcement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Property levied on, on or before the return day, may be advertised and sold within a reasonable time thereafter, and the lien given by this section may also be enforced after the return day of the writ by proceedings under § 8.01-506 and following of this chapter, if such proceedings be commenced before that day.

For related discussion, see 8A M.J. Executions, §§ 30, 36. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . No levy after return day.  An execution may not be levied after the date upon which it is returnable, and the imperative duty to return does not arise until it is no longer possible to levy it. The life of the execution ends upon the date to which it is returnable, and the duty to return it then arises. That duty should be promptly performed. Moorman v. Board, 121 Va. 112, 92 S.E. 833, 1917 Va. LEXIS 15 (1917). Levy necessary to sale.  Before there can be a sale of corporeal personal property under execution there must be an actual levy of the writ of fieri facias and the mere delivery of the wr it to the sheriff without a levy creates no security for the debt. Humphrey v. Hitt, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 509, 1850 Va. LEXIS 3 (1850); Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 1867 Va. LEXIS 33 (1867); Charron &amp; Co. v. Boswell, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 216 , 1868 Va. LEXIS 10 (1868). Right to levy is source of authority of officer.  The authority of an officer to collect money in discharge of an execution does not result from the lien, but is a consequence of the right to levy and sell the de btors property under the execution. So long as the right to sell continues, the right to receive remains; but no longer. Grandstaff v. Ridgely, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 1, 1878 Va. LEXIS 46 (1878). In the case of a sheriffs sale, the sheriff derives his authority to sell from the writ of a fieri facias. Turnbull v. Clairborne, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 392, 1831 Va. LEXIS 59 (1831). Duration of power to sell.  If the officer levies before the return day of the writ, he continues to have the power to sell, even after the return day has passed, and this power continues fo r a reasonable time. Reasonable time is a question of fact, dependent on the circumstances of each case. The test, of course, is whether an intention to abandon was manifest from the acts of the creditors. Palais v. DeJarnette, 145 F.2d 953, 1944 U.S. Ap p. LEXIS 2712 (4th Cir. 1944). If the officer levies before the return day of the writ he may sell after the return day has passed; but if he fails to levy before the return day his authority t o sell afterward ceases. Grandstaff v. Ridgely, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 1, 1878 Va. LEXIS 46 (1878). Necessity for sale.  The third and last step after the issuance of the execution, is the sale of the property. Then and not until then, the plaintiff may be said to have gotten to the end of his suit, at least as far as the defendant is concerned, and to the extent of the value of the property. Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 1867 Va. LEXIS 33 (1867); Rhea v. Preston, 75 Va. 757, 1881 Va. LEXIS 55 (1881). A mere levy of an execution is not a satisfaction. There must be a sale or some other act divesting the debtor of his title or depriving him of his property. Rhea v. Preston, 75 Va. 757, 1881 Va. LEXIS 55 (1881). Officer may fix details.  Sheriffs, being clothed with the power of the Commonwealth, may fix the time and place of sale. Carter v. Harris, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 199, 1826 Va. LEXIS 26 (1826). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Levy by sheriff against personal property when serving writs of fieri facias.  Writs of fieri facias, debtor interrogatories and garnishments are distinct, but related proceedings, so that, although sheriff or other executing officer may be required to levy on the tangible personal property of a judgment debtor when executing a writ of fieri facias, no such requirement is imposed when serving a Summons for Interrogatories or Garnishment Summons.

In the event the property is to be sold free of such prior security interest, the judgment creditor shall give written notice by certified mail to each secured party of record as herea fter specified, as his name and address shall appear on record, of the proposed sale, or to any secured party of whom the judgment creditor shall have actual knowledge. Such notice shall be given to each secured party who is of record at the State Corpor ation Commission, at the Department of Motor Vehicles, at the Department of Wildlife Resources, or in the clerks office in the city or county in Virginia, where the debtor has resided to the knowledge of the judgment creditor at any time during a one -year period prior to the sale. Certification of such notice shall be delivered to the sheriff or other officer conducting the sale pursuant to execution of the judgment, who shall announce that except as to such person so notified, the sale is subject t o any prior security interest of record, other than one of record at a place where the debtor may have resided more than one year previously. If such prior security interest is not due and payable at the time of sale, such officer shall sell the property levied on subject to such security interest. History History.

For related discussion, see 8A M.J. Executions, § 32. CASE NOTES State law clearly provides that a lien of fieri facias on intangible property extends throughout the Commonwealth. The manner in which the statute is worded indicates that a limitation to the coverage of the lien was not intended but rather that the lien was to be effective over as large a territory as possible. The fact remains, howev er, that the lien would not cover any property of the debtor located outside the Commonwealth. Homeowner's Fin. Corp. v. Pennington, 47 Bankr. 322, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS State law clearly provides that a lien of fieri facias on intangib le property extends throughout the Commonwealth.  Where a Virginia court issued the garnishment summons and a writ of fieri facias pursuant to Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-481, it did not extend outside Virginia to t he judgment debtors bank account located in Kentucky; therefore, the court had no legal basis to hold the funds garnished from the debtors account.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . A return on a writ of process is the short official statement of the officer indorsed th ereon of what he has done in obedience to the mandate of the writ, or why he has done nothing. Rowe v. Hardy, 97 Va. 674, 34 S.E. 625, 1899 Va. LEXIS 84 (1899). A valid return may be made after the day to which the execution is returnable. In the pr esent case, the executions were returned no effects two days after the return day. This was clearly within a reasonable time, and, therefore, the returns were made in the lawful performance of a delayed duty. Moorman v. Board of Supvrs., 121 Va. 112, 92 S.E. 838 (1917). Amendment of return.  A sheriff cannot amend his return upon an execution after it has been filed, except by motion to the court, upon notice to the creditor. Hammen v. Minnick, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 249, 1879 Va. LEXIS 64 (1879). A return on a former execution is, generally, very material evidence on the hearing of a motion to quash an execution and it is often important, in the course of the proceedings, to permit the sheriff to make or amend his return according to the truth of the case, and with a view to its effect upon the decision of the motion. Such permission has always been given by our courts. Walker v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 13, 1867 Va. LEXIS 33 (1867). Where the truth of a return on an execution is not questioned, and no good reason to the contrary is shown, the officer making it should be allowed to amend by si gning it, and thus make valid that which before had no appearance of official authenticity. Courts are liberal in allowing amendments of returns in proper cases, so as to conform to the truth, and the amendment when made has the same effect as though it were the original return, where the rights of third persons have not intervened, and it does not appear that injustice can result to anyone. There is no specific time within which a return must be amended, but, after a great lapse of time, an amendment s hould be permitted with caution, and in no case should it be allowed unless the court can see that it is in furtherance of justice. Slingluff v. Collins, 109 Va. 717, 64 S.E. 1055, 1909 Va. LEXIS 87 (1909). No amendment after decree entered against officer on return.  Having made return on an execution and on that return, in part, a decree having been entered, in subsequent proceedings against him and his sureties, the sheriff will not be permitted to amend his return, so as to explain it away and enable his sureties to escape liability for his default. Carr v. Meade, 77 Va. 142, 1883 Va. LEXIS 45 (1883). But may amend after notice of motion against officer.  A sheriff may have leave to amend his return upon an execution, after notice of a motion against him founded on the original return. And the amended return may be made by a deputy who did not make the first return. Stone v. Wilson, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 211, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 529, 1853 Va. LEXIS 36 (1853). Presumption that officer did his duty.  In the absence of a date, or other evidence showing when the return of an officer on a writ was made, it is presumed to have been made at a time when he had the r ight to make it, and in due time, as the prima facie presumption is that the officer has done his duty. Rowe v. Hardy, 97 Va. 674, 34 S.E. 625, 1899 Va. LEXIS 84 (1899). Sufficiency of return.  It is required that the officer shall return upon a writ of fieri facias, whether the money is or cannot be made. A return of Not levied by reason of the stay law is a return substantially that the money cannot be made, and sufficient. Hamilton v. McConkey, 83 Va. 533, 2 S.E. 724, 1887 Va. LEXIS 97 (1887). A return on an execution no effects known to me is not vitiated by the fact that it is made before the return day of the writ, where, as in the case at ba r, it is an agreed fact that, at the time the writ was placed in the hands of the officer, the defendants were notoriously insolvent. Slingluff v. Collins, 109 Va. 717, 64 S.E. 1055, 1909 Va. LEXIS 87 (1909). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Storage and transportation expenses are deductible from proceeds of sale.  Expenses incurred for movement or storage of the property or other costs of the sale are deductible from the proceeds derived from the public sale. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable John R. Newhart, Sheriff for the City of Chesapeake, 01-005 (5/11/01). Levy by sheriff against personal property when serving writs of fieri facias.  Writs of fieri facias, debtor interrogatories and garnishments are distinct, but related proceedings, so that, although sheriff or other executing officer may be required to levy on the tangible personal property of a judgment debtor when executing a writ of fieri facias, no such requirement is imposed when serving a Summons for Interrogatories or Garnishment Summons.

Demand by attorney sufficient.  Where an execution is delivered to the sheriff of a county other than that in which the creditor resides, and the creditor employs an attorney practicing in the s heriffs county, to collect the money without giving the attorney a written order and the attorney makes a demand on the sheriff, such demand, if no objection be made at the time to the surety of the attorney, is sufficient to justify a judgment again st the sheriff. Chapman v. Chevis, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 297, 1838 Va. LEXIS 16 (1838). A demand by an attorney at law who prosecuted the suit and obtained judgment was sufficient to authorize a motion against the sheriff for nonpayment. Wilson v. St okes, 18 Va. (4 Munf) 455, 1815 Va. LEXIS 33 (1815). Procedure.  In an action by an execution creditor against the sheriff and his sureties upon his official bond for the failure to pay over the money he had collected on the ex ecution, the motion not stating that the plaintiff did not reside in the county of the sheriff, it is not necessary to aver that a demand had been made upon the sheriff, as prescribed by the statute before the action was instituted. But if it appears upo n the trial that the plaintiff did not reside in the same county with the sheriff, the plaintiff must prove the demand in accordance with this section or his action will fail.

Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Execution lien dates from time writ is delivered to the sheriff.  Such lien on intangibles is perfected in that it has priority over all subsequent execution liens. In re Dulaney, 29 Bankr. 79, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5234 (Bankr. W.D . Va. 1982). The execution of a writ of fieri facias establishes a lien on intangibles from the time the writ is delivered to the sheriff. Pischke v. Murray, 11 Bankr. 913, 19 81 Bankr. LEXIS 3534 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981); Hughson v. Dressler Motors, Inc., 74 Bankr. 438, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 923 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1987). The lien is created when execution is delivered to the officer. The lien exists from that date. The issuance and service of the garnishment is the means of enforc ing the lien. In re Lamm, 47 Bankr. 364, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20373 (E.D. Va. 1984). Where plaintiff had no possessory interest in funds retained by VDOT on August 29, 1994, no lien was established and no garnishment of funds could result. Interna tional Fid. Ins. Co. v. Ashland Lumber Co., 250 Va. 507, 463 S.E.2d 664, 1995 Va. LEXIS 144 (1995). Lien of a writ of fieri facias under § 8.01-501 required the law firms holding the client funds of the judgment debtor to cease disbursing funds from their tru st accounts to satisfy legal fees and costs that the judgment debtor owed to them for services rendered and to pay those funds to the judgment creditor effective on the date that the writ of fieri facias was delivered to the sheriff for issuance; the wri t was a lien on the equitable interest that the judgment debtor had in the funds paid as retainers to the law firms and the service of notice requirements of § 8.01-502 did not apply to the law firms because they had not used those funds to pay the ju dgment debtor but, instead, had used the funds to pay themselves. Marcus, Santoro &amp; Kozak, P.C. v. Wu, 274 Va. 743, 652 S.E.2d 777, 2007 Va. LEXIS 135 (2007). Under Virginia law, the officer is not required to seize the property levied on, but only to have it in his power and note it on the execution. The lien acquired by the levy of the execution is both substantial and enduring, as much so as a mortgage or a pledge. In re Lamm, 47 Bankr. 364, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20373 (E.D. Va. 1984). Execution on intangible property.  In Virginia, a creditor who has obtained a money judgment may enforce that judgment against his debtors personal property by execution. Execution on intangibl e personalty, including a chose in action owned by the debtor, is carried out by means of a writ of fieri facias which is issued and placed in the hands of the sheriff. In re Dulaney, 29 Bankr. 79, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5234 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1982). A writ of fieri facias shall be a lien on all the personal estate of the judgment debtor including intangible, unleviable property. Homeowner's Fin. Corp. v. Penn ington, 47 Bankr. 322, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). The lien of fieri facias extends to all the personal estate of the judgment debtor which is not capable of being levied on, which includes bonds, notes, stocks, d ebts of all kinds, including a debt payable in the future and includes all choses in action to which a debtor may be entitled. In re Lamm, 47 Bankr. 364, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20373 (E.D. Va. 1984). When property of a judgment debtor is not capable of being levied on, as in the case of intangible personal property, such property is nevertheless subject to the execution lien upon delivery of the writ to a sheriff or other officer. Network Solutions, Inc. v. Umbro Int'l, Inc., 259 Va. 759, 529 S.E.2d 80, 2000 Va. LEXIS 75 (2000). Circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to the judgment creditors and enforcing liens upon the potential 2015 income tax refunds of the debtors because a ny potential income tax refunds for that tax year were not in possession of or under the control of the debtors so as to be reachable by the lien inasmuch as the debtors had not filed their income tax returns by the return date on the writ of fieri facia s. Shifflett v. Latitude Props., 294 Va. 476, 808 S.E.2d 182, 2017 Va. LEXIS 175 (2017). Types of intangible personal property.  Bank deposit account is a chose in action in favor of the customer against the bank. Accordingly, it is clear that the bank depositors claim against t he bank is a type of intangible personal property which from its nature is not capable of being levied on, and, as such, it is clearly within the scope of the statute. Creasy v. McGarry (In re Abingdon Orthopedic Assocs., P.C.), No. 10-72803, No. 12-0702 1, 2012 Bankr. LEXIS 6282 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Oct. 11, 2012). Execution lien is not effective as against a bona fide assignee or purchaser for value w ho is without notice of such lien. In re Dulaney, 29 Bankr. 79, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 5234 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1982). Under this section, the only person who can defeat the fieri facias lien is a bona fide purchaser or assignee for value without notice, and the satisf action of . . . (the) preexisting execution lien, during the four-month period preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition, was not a preference. This means that the Virginia execution lien on intangibles is perfected for bankruptcy when the writ of fieri facias is delivered to the officer to be executed. In re Lamm, 47 Bankr. 364, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20373 (E.D. Va. 1984). The mere issuance of an execution constitutes no notice to a bona fide assignee for valu able consideration, since this section expressly excepts such an execution from the operation of the section. Virginia Mach. &amp; Well Co. v. Hungerford Coal Co., 182 Va. 550, 29 S.E.2d 359, 1944 Va. LEXIS 203 (1944). Where assignment of lease is valid.  Where it was determined that an assignment of a lease to the note holder was valid, the garnishment of lease payments made by a judgment creditor was improper; th e alleged assignee did not own the right to receive the lease payments, and therefore summary judgment was issued to the note holder because the judgment debtor had no interest in the property held by the suggested garnishee, and the writ did not create a valid lien on the property. Wells Fargo Bank v. Levin Prof'l Servs., 348 F. Supp. 2d 638, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27070 (E.D. Va. 2004), aff'd, 189 Fed. Appx. 239, 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 17439 (4th Cir. 2006). Priority of charging order.  Plaintiff did not cause a writ of execution to issue. Instead, it merely sought the entry of a charging order armed only with what may be best described as a  naked final judgment. Therefore, until a charging order entered, the judgment debtor virtually was free, as against the instant plaintiff, to encumber intangible property, including her interests to discretionary distributions of limited partnerships . A charging order, without more, does not take priority over a security interest perfected after judgment but before the entry date of the charging order. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Craun, 853 F. Supp. 209, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6811 (W.D. Va. 1994). Debts of garnishee subject to this section.  Construing §§ 8.01-511 and 8.01-512.3 together against the background of this section, a garnishment subjects to the execution lien of this section, not onl y those debts already due the judgment debtor when the summons in garnishment is served upon the garnishee, but also any indebtedness of the garnishee to the judgment debtor which arises between the date of service of such summons on the garnishee and th e return date of the summons. Virginia Nat'l Bank v. Blofeld, 234 Va. 395, 362 S.E.2d 692, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1230, 1987 Va. LEXIS 269 (1987).

CASE NOTES Notice requirement.  Lien of a writ of fieri facias under § 8.01-501 required the law firms holding the client funds of the judgment debtor to cease disbursing funds from their tru st accounts to satisfy legal fees and costs that the judgment debtor owed to them for services rendered and to pay those funds to the judgment creditor effective on the date that the writ of fieri facias was delivered to the sheriff for issuance; the wri t was a lien on the equitable interest that the judgment debtor had in the funds paid as retainers to the law firms and the service of notice requirements of § 8.01-502 did not apply to the law firms because they had not used those funds to pay the ju dgment debtor but, instead, had used the funds to pay themselves.

Payment by sub-debtor withou t notice is good.  A payment to the execution debtor by his debtor in good faith without notice is good against the execution creditor. See Evans v. Greenhow, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 153 , 1859 Va. LEXIS 8 (1859) (decided under prior law). § 8.01-502.1. Serving notice of lien on financial institution. Text A. No judgment creditor or attorney for a judgment creditor shall have a notice of lien served on a financial institution under § 8.01-502 unless such judgment creditor or attorney has a reasonable basis for believing that the judgment debtor is entitled to a payme nt from such institution. The fact that a financial institution is doing business in a geographic area where the judgment debtor resides, works or has a place of business is not, by itself, a reasonable basis for believing that the judgment debtor is ent itled to a payment from a financial institution. Any person violating this section shall be liable to a financial institution for the sum of $100 for each notice of lien wrongfully served on such institution. In any action at law to recover an amount due hereunder, the judgment creditor or attorney for the judgment creditor causing the notice of lien to be served on the financial institution shall have the burden of showing a reasonable basis for believing that the judgment debtor was entitled to a paym ent from such institution. B. Any judgmen t creditor serving a notice of lien on a financial institution shall, within five business days of such service, mail to the judgment debtor at his last known address a copy of the notice of lien along with a notice of exemptions and claim for exemption form in accordance with § 8.01-512.4. The judgment creditor or attorney for the judgment creditor shall file a certification with the court affirming that he has mailed the judgment debtor these notices. In the event that the judgment creditor fails t o comply with the requirements of this subsection, he shall be liable to the judgment debtor for no more than $100 in damages, unless he proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure was not willful. C. A financial institution served with a valid notice of lien shall provide a written response to the judgment creditor or attorney for the judgment creditor within twenty-one days after being served with such notice of lien indicating the amount of money held by the financial institution pursuant to the notice of lien.

The lien, once established, only ceases wh en the right of the judgment creditor to enforce the judgment by execution or by action, or to extend the right by motion, ceases. Further, as to intangibles, the lien shall cease one year from the return date of the execution pursuant to which the lien arose, or where the intangible is a debt due from or a claim upon, a third person in favor of the judgment debtor or the estate of such person, one year from the final determination of the amount owed to the judgment debtor. In re Lamm, 47 Bankr. 364, 19 84 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20373 (E.D. Va. 1984). Effect of bankruptcy on one-year period.  One-year perfection of lien under this section held not converted into permanent perfection by bankruptcy of debtor. See Pischke v. Murray, 11 Bankr. 913, 1981 Ba nkr. LEXIS 3534 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1981). If creditors lien is extant under state law prior to commencement of bankruptcy, the lien remains viable even if under the terms of the law creating the lien it would expire absent some action of the creditor. For example, the creditor would not be obliged to seek relief from the stay in order to seek a new writ of fieri facias to kee p the lien in effect. Thus, the lien of fieri facias remains viable during the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings. Homeowner's Fin. Corp. v. Pennington, 47 Bankr. 322, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6508 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The lien of a writ of fieri facias continues so long as the judgment can be enforced. Hic ks v. Roanoke Brick Co., 94 Va. 741, 27 S.E. 596, 1897 Va. LEXIS 134 (1897), overruled, Boisseau v. Bass' Adm'r, 100 Va. 207, 40 S.E. 647, 1902 Va. LEXIS 17 (1902); Boisseau v. Bass, 100 Va. 207, 40 S.E. 647, 1902 Va. LEXIS 17 (1902). Quashing of second execution does not suspend lien of first.  A second execution was quashed on a petition alleging that it was issued contrary to an agreement by the creditor before entry of judgment that no execution shoul d issue until a certain time, and was also in disregard of a payment made on the judgment. The first execution was held to be a lien on legacies left to the debtor, and other creditors objected, claiming that the first execution was suspended by virtue o f the judgment quashing the second. The agreement not to issue execution being a personal one and there being no mention whatever of the first execution in the proceedings to quash the second, the first was held not suspended under this section. Baer v. Ingram, 99 Va. 200, 37 S.E. 905, 1901 Va. LEXIS 29 (1901). Death of either debtor or creditor does not affect lien.  The lien of a writ of fieri facias upon the debtors choses in action, although not asserted in the lifetime of the debtor or creditor is not defeated or impai red by the death of either or both, and this lien may be enforced in a suit for the administration of the assets or by other remedies.

To ascertai n the personal estate of a judgment debtor, and to ascertain any real estate, in or out of this Commonwealth, to which the debtor named in a judgment and fieri facias is entitled, upon the application of the execution creditor, the clerk of the court fro m which such fieri facias issued shall issue a summons against (i) the execution debtor, (ii) any officer of the corporation if such execution debtor is a corporation having an office in this Commonwealth, (iii) any employee of a corporation if such exec ution debtor is a corporation having an office but no officers in the Commonwealth provided that a copy of the summons shall also be served upon the registered agent of the corporation, or (iv) any debtor to, or bailee of, the execution debtor. B. The summons shall require him to appear before the court from which the fieri facias issued or a commissioner of the county or city in which such court is located, or a like court or a commissioner of a county or city contiguous thereto, or upon request of the exec ution creditor, before a like court or a commissioner of the county or city in which the execution debtor resides, or of a county or city contiguous thereto, to answer such interrogatories as may be propounded to him by the execution creditor or his atto rney, or the court, or the commissioner, as the case may be. If the execution creditor requests that the summons require the execution debtor to appear before a like court of the county or city in which the execution debtor resides, or of a county or cit y contiguous thereto, the case may be filed or docketed in accordance with the requirements of § 8.01-506.2 prior to issuance of the summons. C. Provided, h owever, that as a condition precedent to proceeding under this section, the execution creditor has furnished to the court a certificate setting forth that he has not proceeded against the execution debtor under this section within the six months last pre ceding the date of such certificate. Except that for good cause shown, the court may, on motion of the execution creditor, issue an order allowing further proceedings before a commissioner by interrogatories during the six-month period. Any judgment cred itor who knowingly gives false information upon any such certificate made under this article shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The issuance of a summons that is not served shall not constitute the act of proceeding against an execution debtor for purposes of making the certificate required by this subsection. D. The debtor or other person served with such summons shall appear at the time and place mentioned and make answer to such interrogatories. The commissioner shall, at the request of either of the parties, enter in his proceedings and report to the court mentioned in § 8.01-507.1, any and all objections taken by such debtor against answering such interrogatories, or any or either of them, and if the court afterwards sustains any one or more of such objections, the answers given to such interrogatories as to which objections are sustained shall be held for naught in that or any other case. E. Notwithstan ding the foregoing provisions of this section, the court from which a writ of fieri facias issued, upon motion by the execution debtor and for good cause shown, shall transfer debtor interrogatory proceedings to a forum more convenient to the execution d ebtor.

The restriction against commissioners causing process to be served outside or contiguous to the county or city for which they were appointed has been deleted. This change is compatible with the issuance (statewide) of process found in chapter 8, Process. General district courts are also authorized to employ similar procedure to compel a judgment d ebtor to reveal his assets to the judgment creditor. See § 16.1-103. Cross references.

I.Decisions Under Current Law. Construction.  Judgment creditors reasonable or good-faith belief that a third party may be a debtor to or bailee of the judgment debtor is not sufficient to allow the judgm ent creditor to summon the third party for debtors interrogatories. Aufforth v. Aufforth, 72 Va. App. 617, 851 S.E.2d 77, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 303 (2020). Statute limits the individuals to whom a judgment creditor may summon to debtors interrogatories. The language of the statute, any debtor to, or bailee of , the execution debtor, does not contain any modifying language that would suggest that a judgment creditor is permitted to seek debtors interrogatories of a third party who is suspected, but not known, to be a debtor to or bailee of the judgment debtor. Aufforth v. Aufforth, 72 Va. App. 617, 851 S.E.2d 77, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 303 (2020). Third party summons.  Appellants factual allegations failed to establish that appellee was a debtor to or a bailee of the debtor husband; the fact that the debtor husband lived in a Florida residence owned by but not the primary residence of his ex-wife, appellee, did not support the conclusion that appellee had lawful possession of physical goods owned by debtor husband, and appellees motion to dismiss a summons for interroga tories was properly granted. Aufforth v. Aufforth, 72 Va. App. 617, 851 S.E.2d 77, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 303 (2020). Speculative economic relationship between a judgment debtor and a third party does not fall under any of the enumerated categories of individuals who may be summo ned to debtors interrogatories. Aufforth v. Aufforth, 72 Va. App. 617, 851 S.E.2d 77, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 303 (2020). Receiver acknowledged that if the requirements of Aufforth applied, he could not presently show that any of the third parties were bailees or debtors of the judgm ent debtors; having found that the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act made out-of-state subpoenas to Virginia residents subject to Virginia law, that a subpoena duces tecum had to be in aid of debtors interrogatories, and that this stat ute restricted such discovery to known bailees or debtors of the judgment debtor, the trial court erred in failing to grant the third parties motion to quash. Patel v. Rabinowitz ex rel. Lakhani Assocs., LLC, 75 Va. App. 663, 879 S.E.2d 60, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 543 (2022). This section provides statutory authority for trial court to order judgment debtor to deliver stock certificates in his possession or control, including those in a professional legal corporation, so that his interest could be liquidated according to law. Saad El-Amin v. Adams, No. 0282-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals May 16, 1995). Relation to othe r laws.  Creditor who obtained a judgment against two debtors in a Virginia court violated the automatic stay when he appeared in state court for a hearing on a Summons to Answer Interrogatories that was issued pursuant to Va. Code § 8.01-506 after he was informed that the debtors had converted their bankruptcy case to one under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, did not inform the state court that the debtors were in C hapter 7 bankruptcy, and did not ask the court to dismiss the summons, and because the violation was willful, the debtors were allowed under 11 U.S.C.S. § 362 to recover attorneys fees and costs they incurred to defend the summons and wages the fe male debtor lost when she took time off work to attend court hearings. In re Sheets, No. 12-31723-KLP, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 4198 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Sept. 29, 2014). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Object of section.  This section enables the creditor to compel the debtor to surrender his estate and to compel any other person on whom there is a liability by reason of such lien, to discharge such liability. By resorting to these means the creditor is generally able to prevent an evasion of his execution lien. Evans v. Greenhow, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 153, 1859 Va. LEXIS 8 (1859). This section is by its terms limited to questions the object of which is to disclose the property of the debtor which can be made subject to the execution or judg ment by appropriate orders in that proceeding, to which the debtor and creditor are the sole parties, whose rights are directly involved. Thompson v. Commonwealth, 156 Va. 1032, 159 S.E. 98, 1931 Va. LEXIS 256 (1931). Section 8.01-612 inapplicable to proceeding to ascertain assets of judg ment debtor.  Section 8.01-612, providing that a commissioner in chancery could compel attendance of witnesses, was inapplicable to the special proceeding authorized by this se ction to ascertain the assets of a judgment debtor. Early Used Cars, Inc. v. Province, 218 Va. 605, 239 S.E.2d 98, 1977 Va. LEXIS 297 (1977). § 8.01-506.1. Production of book accounts or other writing compelled.

For related discussion, see 2A M.J. Assignments, § 16. CASE NOTES Applicability.  Where a creditor obtained state court orders directing a debtor to turn over future tax refunds to satisfy a judgment debt, the creditor did not have a lien on th e future refunds under § 8.01-507 and thus, the debtors use of the tax refunds was not conversion of the creditors property and did not create a nondischargeable debt under 11 U.S.C.S. § 523(a)(6). Knight v. Eppard, 502 Bankr. 458, 2012 Ban kr. LEXIS 6098 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 2012). Circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to the judgment creditors and enforcing liens upon the potential 2015 income tax refunds of the debtors because a ny potential income tax refunds for that tax year were not in possession of or under the control of the debtors so as to be reachable by the lien inasmuch as the debtors had not filed their income tax returns by the return date on the writ of fieri facia s. Shifflett v. Latitude Props., 294 Va. 476, 808 S.E.2d 182, 2017 Va. LEXIS 175 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  Request for a turnover order under § 8.01-507 was denied because the purchaser was neither a debtor nor bailee of the judgment debtor and therefore, plaintiff was not entitled to a turnover order under § 8.01-507 of the assets that the purchaser bought from the debtor. AdvanceMe, Inc. v. Shaker Corp., 79 Va. Cir. 171, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 55 (Alexandria July 24, 2009). § 8.01-507.1. Interrogatories, answers, etc., to be returned to court. Text The commissioner shall, at the request of either of the parties, return the interrogatories and answers filed with him, and a report of the proceedings under §§ 8 .01-506 and 8.01-507, to the court in which the judgment is rendered.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The language of this section is mandatory. Early Used Cars, Inc. v. Province, 218 Va. 605 , 239 S.E.2d 98, 1977 Va. LEXIS 297 (1977). Section ap plies when defendant merely fails to appear.  While this section is worded in the conjunctive rather than the disjunctive, the contention that the provisions of this section apply only when a judgment debtor fails to appear and answer, and not when he merely fails to appear, is without merit. Early Used Cars, Inc. v. Province, 218 Va. 605, 239 S.E.2d 98, 1977 Va. LEXIS 297 (1977). This section does not require that notice be given to the debtor that his failure to app ear might result in his arrest. Early Used Cars, Inc. v. Province, 218 Va. 605, 239 S.E.2d 98, 1977 Va.

LEXIS 297 (1977). A writ stating, as an alternative not provided in this section, that the debtor could end the proceedings summarily by paying the debt, with interest and costs, in the amount specified, did not make payment a condition for avoiding imprisonment, and although the commissioner had the discretionary power to revise the writ to conform mo re closely to this section, his refusal to issue the writ at all was error.

Service on the judgment debtor and the garnishee shall be made pursuant to subdivision 1 or 2 of § 8.01-296. When making an application for garnishment, the judgment creditor shall set forth on the suggestion for summons in garnishment the last known address of the judgment debtor, and shall furnish the clerk, if service is to be made by the sheriff, or shall furnish any other person making service with an envelope, with first-class postage attached, addressed to such address. A copy of the summons and the notice and claim for exemptions form required under § 8.01-512.4 shall be sent by t he clerk to the sheriff or provided by the judgment creditor to the person making service, with the process to be served. Promptly after service on the garnishee, the person making service shall mail such envelope by first-class mail to the judgment debt or at his last known address. If the person making service is unable to serve the judgment debtor pursuant to subdivision 1 of § 8.01-296, such mailing shall satisfy the mailing requirements of subdivision 2 b of § 8.01-296. The person making servi ce shall note on his return the date of such mailing which, with the notation copy mailed to judgment debtor, shall be sufficient proof of the mailing of such envelope with the required copy of the summons and the notice and claim for exemption f orm with no examination of such contents being required nor separate certification by the clerk or judgment creditor that the appropriate documents have been so inserted. If the person making service is unable to serve the judgment debtor pursuant to sub division 1 or 2 of § 8.01-296, such mailing shall constitute service of process on the judgment debtor. The judgment creditor shall furnish the social security number of the judgment debtor to the clerk, except as hereinafter provided. B. The judgmen t creditor may require the judgment debtor to furnish his correct social security number by the use of interrogatories. However, use of such interrogatories shall not be a required condition of a judgment creditors diligent good faith effort to secur e the judgment debtors social security number. Such remedy shall be in addition to all other lawful remedies available to the judgment creditor. Upon a representation by the judgment creditor, or his agent or attorney, that he has made a diligent goo d faith effort to secure the social security number of the judgment debtor and has been unable to do so, the garnishment shall be issued without the necessity for such number. C. Except as p rovided herein, no summons shall be issued pursuant to this section for the garnishment of wages, salaries, commissions, or other earnings unless it: (i) is in the form prescribed by § 8.01-512.3; (ii) is directed to only one garnishee for the garnish ment of only one judgment debtor; (iii) contains both the TOTAL BALANCE DUE and the social security number of the judgment debtor in the proper places as provided on the summons; and (iv) specifies that it is a garnishment against (a) the judgmen t debtors wages, salary, or other compensation or (b) some other debt due or property of the judgment debtor. The garnishee shall not be liable to the judgment creditor for any property not specified in the summons as provided in (iv) above. Upon rec eipt of a summons not in compliance with this provision, the garnishee shall file a written answer to that effect and shall have no liability to the judgment creditor, such summons being void upon transmission of the answer. D. The judgmen t creditor shall, in the suggestion, specify the amount of interest, if any, that is claimed to be due upon the judgment, calculated to the return day of the summons. He shall also set out such credits as may have been made upon the judgment.All costs in curred by the judgment creditor after entry of the judgment, in aid of execution of the judgment and paid to a clerk of court, sheriff, or process server are chargeable against the judgment debtor, unless such costs are chargeable against the judgment cr editor pursuant to § 8.01-475. Regardless of the actual amount of the fee paid by the judgment creditor, the fee for a process server chargeable against the judgment debtor shall not exceed the fee authorized for service by the sheriff. All such previ ous costs chargeable against the judgment debtor may be included by the judgment creditor as judgment costs in the garnishment summons form prescribed in § 8.01-512.3. This paragraph shall not be construed to limit any cost assessed by a court as part of the judgment. E. In addition , the suggestion shall contain an allegation that: 1. The s ummons is based upon a judgment upon which a prior summons has been issued but not fully satisfied; or 2. No summons has been issued upon his suggestion against the same judgment debtor within a period of 18 months, other than under the provisions of subdivision 1; or 3. The summons is based upon a judgment granted against a debtor upon a debt due or made for necessary food, rent or shelter, public utilities including telephone service, drugs, or medic al care supplied the debtor by the judgment creditor or to one of his lawful dependents, and that it was not for luxuries or nonessentials; or 4. The summons is based upon a judgment for a debt due the judgment creditor to refinance a lawful loan made by an authorized lending institution; or 5. The summons is based upon a judgment on an obligation incurred as an endorser or comaker upon a lawful note; or 6. The summons is based upon a judgment for a debt or debts reaffirmed after bankruptcy. F. Any judgmen t creditor who knowingly gives false information upon any such suggestion or certificate made under this chapter shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. History History.

TO THE GARNISHEE: You are hereby commanded to (1) File a written answer with this court, or (2) Deliver payment to this court, or (3) Appear before this court on the return date and time shown on this summons to answer the Suggestion for Summons in Garnishment of the judgment creditor that, by reason of the lien o f writ of fieri facias, there is a liability as shown in the statement upon the garnishee. As garnishee, you shall withhold from the judgment debtor any sums of money to which the judgment debtor is or may be entitled from you during the period between the da te of service of this summons on you and the date for your appearance in court, subject to the following limitations: (1) The maximum amount which may be garnished is the TOTAL BALANCE DUE as shown on this summons. (2) If the sums of money being garnished are earnings of the judgment debtor, then the provision of MAXIMUM PORTION OF DISPOSABLE EARNINGS SUBJECT TO GARNISHMENT shall apply. If a garnishment summons is served on an employer having 1,000 or more employees, then money to which the judgment debtor is or may be entitled from his or her employer shall be considered those wages, salaries, commissions, or other earnings which, following service on the garnishee-employer, are determined and are payable to the judgment debtor under the garnishee-employers normal payroll procedure with a reasona ble time allowance for making a timely return by mail to this court.

(b) A pl ain language interpretation of § 34-29 shall appear on the reverse side of the summons as follows:The following statement is not the law but is an interpretation of the law which is intended to assist those who must respond to this garnishment. Yo u may rely on this only for general guidance because the law itself is the final word. (Read the law, § 34-29 of the Code of Virginia, for a full explanation. A copy of § 34-29 is available at the clerks office. If you do not understand the law , call a lawyer for help.)An employer may take as much as 25 percent of an employees disposable earnings to satisfy this garnishment. But if an employee makes the minimum wage or less for his weeks earnings, the employee will ordinarily get to ke ep 40 times the minimum hourly wage.But an employer may withhold a different amount of money from that above if: (1) The employee must pay child support or spousal support and was ordered to do so by a court procedure or other legal procedure. No more than 65 percent of an employees earnings may be withheld for support; (2) Money is withheld by order of a bankruptcy court; or (3) Money is withheld for a tax debt.Disposable earnings means the money an employee makes after taxes and after other amounts required by law to be withheld are satisfied. E arnings can be salary, hourly wages, commissions, bonuses, or otherwise, whether paid directly to the employee or not. After those earnings are in the bank for 30 days, they are not considered earnings any more.If an employee tries to transfer, assign, o r in any way give his earnings to another person to avoid the garnishment, it will not be legal; earnings are still earnings.An employee cannot be fired because he is garnished for one debt.Financial institutions that receive an employees paycheck by direct deposit do not have to determine what part of a persons earnings can be garnished.

That act inserted payments to an independent contractor in the definition of earnings, and deleted provided, that in no event shall funds that have been deposited by or for an individual for more than thirty d ays be considered earnings from that definition. While Acts 1996, c. 330 eliminated language which excepted funds that have been deposited by or for an individual for more than thirty days from the term earnings under the plain langua ge interpretation in § 34-29, the term disposable earnings as used in the form provided for in this section and as defined in subsection (b) thereof does not reflect the change made by Acts 1996, c. 330 to the substantive law in § 34-29.

CASE NOTES Debts of garnishee subject to § 8 .01-501.  Construing § 8.01-511 and this section together against the background of § 8.01-501, a garnishment subjects to the execution lien of § 8.01-501, not onl y those debts already due the judgment debtor when the summons in garnishment is served upon the garnishee, but also any indebtedness of the garnishee to the judgment debtor which arises between the date of service of such summons on the garnishee and th e return date of the summons.

Information on possible exemptions required by due process.  Due process requires that the garnishment summons include some information on possible exemptions as well as the process for contesting the garnishment. Harris v. Bailey, 574 F. Supp. 966, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11710 (W.D. Va. 1983), disapproved, Reigh v. Schleigh, 784 F.2d 1191, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 22689 (4th Cir. 1986). But all possible exempti ons need not be listed.  Actual notice of all available exemptions is not likely to increase the probability of the debtors correcting an erroneous deprivation. Such a potentially con fusing laundry list is not required by due process. The complex myriad of state and federal exemptions therefore is not required to be set out on the summons. Rather, what is required is that the summons served on the debtor contain a list of those essen tial federal and state exemptions that provide the basic necessities of life for someone in the position of a widow whose social security benefits are her sole source of income. The social security exemption certainly should be included; such benefits pr ovide the bare necessities for many in the society. Beyond this list of absolutely essential exemptions such as social security benefits, the debtor should be informed simply that other possible exemptions from garnishment exist under the law. Harris v. Bailey, 574 F. Supp. 966, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11710 (W.D. Va. 1983), disapproved, Reigh v. Schleigh, 784 F.2d 1191, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 22689 (4th Cir. 1986).

If the pers on upon whom there is a suggestion of liability as provided in § 8.01-511 is a corporation, the summons shall be served upon an officer, an employee designated by the corporation other than an officer of the corporation, or, if there is no designated employee or the designated employee cannot be found, upon a managing employee of the corporation other than an officer of the corporation. If the judgment creditor or his attorney files with the court a certificate that he has used due diligence and that (i) no such officer or employee or other person authorized to accept such service can be found within the Commonwealth or (ii) such designated or managing employee found is also the judgment debtor, then such summons shall be served on the registered ag ent of the corporation or upon the clerk of the State Corporation Commission as provided in §§ 13.1-637, 13.1-766, 13.1-836 and 13.1-928. However, service on the corporation shall not be made upon a designated or managing employee who is also the j udgment debtor. If the corporation intends to designate an employee for service, the corporation shall file a designation with the State Corporation Commission. B. If the pers on upon whom there is a suggestion of liability as provided in § 8.01-511 is a limited liability company, the summons shall be served upon a member, manager, or employee designated by the limited liability company for the purpose of such service or, i f there is no designated member, manager, or employee, or the designated member, manager, or employee cannot be found, upon a managing employee of the limited liability company. If the judgment creditor or his attorney files with the court a certificate that he has used due diligence and that (i) no such member, manager, or employee or other person authorized to accept such service can be found within the Commonwealth or (ii) such designated member, manager, employee, or managing employee found is also the judgment debtor, then such summons shall be served on the registered agent of the limited liability company or upon the clerk of the State Corporation Commission as provided in § 13.1-1018. However, service on the limited liability company shall n ot be made upon a designated member, manager, employee, or managing employee who is also the judgment debtor. If the limited liability company intends to designate a member, manager, or employee for service, the limited liability company shall file a des ignation with the State Corporation Commission. C.

The first sentence was rewritten so that the summons in garnishment is returnable to the general district court not more th an sixty days after the date thereof and to the circuit court not more than ninety days from the date thereof. This change comports with the return date of executions found in § 16.1-99 and the return period for writs specified in Rule 3:2. Editors note. Acts 1977, c. 454, amended former § 8-442, corresponding to this section. Pursuant to § 30-152 and Acts 1977, c. 617, cl. 4, that amendment was deemed to ha ve amended this section. The Revisers note under this section accompanied the original enactment of Title 8.01 in 1977. The reference therein to a 60-day period for return of the summ ons in garnishment to the general district court does not reflect the subsequent amendment of this section in 1979. The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 234 substituted 90 for ninety throughout the section, and inserted except that in the instance of a wage garnishment, the summons shall be returnable not more than 180 days after the date of issuance at the end of the first sentence.

For note, Untangling the Safety Net: Protecting Federal Benefits from Freezes, Fees, and Garnishment, see 66 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 371 (2009). CASE NOTES The life of the garnishment summons is 90 days under Virginia law. Thus, if funds are de posited into the debtors bank account subsequent to the service of the garnishment summons but prior to the return date of the writ, such funds would be subject to the reach of the creditor in garnishment. Canfield v. Simpson (In re Jones), 47 Bankr. 786, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6476 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). Return dat e represents the end of a garnishment period.  Return date represents the end of a garnishment period and compels a garnishee to appear in court or file an answer prior to the return date. Becker v. Commonweal th, 64 Va. App. 481, 769 S.E.2d 683, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 88 (2015). A garnishment lien of the type acquired by creditors in Virginia is a transfer by virtue of being an involuntary disposing or parting with an interest in property. Canfield v. Simpson (In re Jones), 47 Bankr. 786, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6476 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1985). A transfer under a garnishment lien on a bank account cannot occur until funds are actually deposited into the debtors account. Consequently, only those funds present in the debtors bank account on the date the garnishment summons was served coupled with all other funds likewise deposited more than 90 days prior to the dat e of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy constitute valid transfers not avoidable by the trustee in bankruptcy as a preference pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 547(b). To the extent that funds were deposited into the debtors garnished bank account wit hin 90 days prior to bankruptcy, those funds would be a preference and may be recovered by the trustee for the benefit of the creditors of the estate.

CASE NOTES Statute contemplates personal judgment against garnishee.  Under our statutes garnishment is simply the process by which a creditor enforces the lien of his execution against the effects of his debtor in the hands of the garnishee, and the statute plainly contemplates only a personal judgment in such case based upon proof or rather upon the confession of the garnishee that he has effects in his hands belonging to the debtor. Bickle v. Chrisman, 76 Va. 678, 1882 Va. LEXIS 68 (1882) (decided under prior law). When order can be made.  On a summons on suggestion the court can make no order against the garnishee unless he owes a debt to the defendant in the execution or has in his hands personal estate of such defendant for which debt or estate the defendant could maintain an action at law.

If the amou nt of liability is not disputed and the garnishee admits liability to the court either by (i) examination on the return date of the summons, or (ii) written statement as provided by § 8.01-515 on or before the return date of the summons, the court sha ll order the delivery of such estate or payment of the value of such estate into court without entering judgment against the garnishee. Should a garnishee fail to comply with the order within thirty days after service of such order on the garnishee, the n judgment may be entered against the garnishee. B. Upon certif ication by the judgment creditor, its bona fide employee, or its attorney that its claim has been satisfied or that it desires its action against the garnishee to be dismissed for any other reason, the court, or clerk thereof, where the action has been f iled, shall, by written order, which may be served by the sheriff, notify the garnishee to cease withholding assets of the judgment debtor, and to treat any funds previously withheld as if the original garnishment action had not been filed.

CASE NOTES Bankruptcy debtor s right to avoid judgment lien.  Under Virginia law, a creditors lien arose on the date that a writ of fieri facias and garnishment summons were served on a bank and debtors accounts were frozen, but on the date that debtor filed his bankruptcy petition, the funds were still on deposit and had not been delivered to the state court. Thus, the garnished funds did not vest in the creditor, as the automatic stay was in place prior to the tim e when the state court could have ordered payment of the funds to the creditor, and debtor was entitled to avoid the creditors judgment lien as impairing his exemption in those funds.

Failure to inquire into total su m of funds.  Because the circuit court failed to conduct the requisite inquiry into the total sum of the funds deposited into a judgment debtors bank account during the ga rnishment period, the record was insufficient on appeal to resolve the amount of indebtedness of the garnishee to the debtor, and therefore, the judgment creditor, during the garnishment period; the alleged unreliability of the account statement does not exempt the account from review.

It was held that if the language of the deed of assignment were susceptible of the construction contended for by the bank it would have resulted in a preference to it and to other lien creditors expressly prohibited by this section.

Where an insolvent debtor conveyed all or practically all of his property to a trustee to be disposed of and the proceeds to be distributed among his creditors, a nd within two days after the four months fixed by federal statute for the setting aside of preferences voluntarily filed a petition in bankruptcy, such conveyance was a general assignment and the preferences created were forbidden by this section.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The law relating to forthcoming bonds was passed for the benefit of the owner of the goods taken, to enable him, at his risk, to retain the possession and use of the goods, and to avoid the expense of their safekeeping until the day of sale. Garland v. Lynch, 40 Va. (1 Rob.) 545, 1843 Va. LEXIS 7 (1843). Bonds not conforming to statute may be good as common-law bonds.  To be good as to a statutory bond, bonds must substantially conform to the statutes authorizing their execution. Unless they do so conform, while they may be good as common-law bonds, they are not valid as statutory bonds. Kiser v. Hensley, 123 Va. 536, 96 S.E. 777, 1918 Va. LEXIS 50 (1918). A forthcoming bond taken under this section and made payable to the sheriff, instead of the execution creditor, as required by that section, does not have the for ce of a judgment against the obligors herein, under § 8.01-527. The lien given by § 8.01-527 being statutory, the steps which lead up to it must be substantially in accordance with the provisions of the statute which create it. The bond is inoperat ive as a statutory bond and creates no lien, though it may be a good common-law bond and the sheriff may sue upon it. In the absence of a statute to that effect, a bond payable to one person cannot operate as a lien in favor of another. Lynchburg Trust &amp; Sav. Bank v.

The only substantial change is the requirement that the return of the bond be made forthwith instead of the former provision that it be made within thirty days.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Principal may forfeit bond.  It is well settled that the principal in a delivery bond has the legal right of forfeiting his bond by failing to have the property forthcoming on the day appoint ed for its delivery and sale, which right no court can obstruct. Lusk v. Ramsay, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 417, 1814 Va. LEXIS 10 (1814). Equity will treat as a nullity a forfeited forthcoming bond on the execution issued on t he judgment whereon there has been a return of nulla bona, and regard the lien of the original judgment as still subsisting for the benefit of the creditor. Cooper v. Daugherty, 85 Va. 343, 7 S.E. 387, 1888 Va. LEXIS 41 (1888). Bond not according to § 8.01-526 creates no lien.  A forthcoming bond taken under § 8.01-526 and made payable to the sheriff, instead of to the creditor as required by that section, does not have the force of a judgment against the obligors therein under this section.

LEXIS 32 (1868). When action on bond accrues.  No right of action accrues upon a forthcoming bond until the forfeiture thereon has been incurred. Lusk v. Ramsay, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 417, 1814 Va. LEXIS 10 (1814). Necessity for filing bond on motion.  On a motion on a forthcoming bond, it is not essential that the bond shall have been filed in the clerks office previous to the motion, but the bond must be s o filed when the judgment is given. Lipscomb v. Davis, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 303, 1833 Va. LEXIS 19 (1833). No formal issue need be joined on a motion on a forthcoming bond, as the pleadings may b e ore tenus, and the court may pronounce judgment on the evidence. M'Kinster v. Garrott, 24 Va.

Constitutionality.  Fuller v. Hurley, 559 F. Supp. 313, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18889 (W.D. Va. 1983). Constitutional requirements of due process apply to garnishment and prejudgment attachment procedures whenever officers of the State act jointly with a creditor in securing the property in dispute. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 102 S. Ct. 2744, 73 L. Ed. 2d 482, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 140 (1982). Procedural scheme created by statute is product of state action.  While private misuse of a state statute does not describe conduct that can be attributed to the State, the procedural scheme created by the statute is the product of state action. This is subject to constitutional restraints and properly may be addressed in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, if the private parties may be characterized as state actors. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 102 S. Ct. 2744, 73 L. Ed. 2d 482, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 140 (1982). A person acts under color of state law in using attachment procedure set forth in this section. Fuller v. Hurley, 559 F. Supp. 313, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18889 (W.D. Va. 1983). When private party is state actor under Fourteenth Amendment.  A private partys joint participation with state officials in the seizure of disputed property is sufficient to characterize that party as a state actor  for purposes of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 102 S. Ct. 2744, 73 L. Ed. 2d 482, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 140 (1982). Attachment statute is not ambiguous.  Virginia attachment statute is as firm and unambiguous as it is constitutionally required to be, given the extensive protection it offers against the prospect of erroneous deprivation. Keystone Bldrs., Inc. v. Floor Fashions of Va., Inc., 829 F. Supp. 181, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11276 (W.D. Va. 1993). Requirements for 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action based on this section.  Where the invoking of this section without the grounds to do so could in no way be attributed to a state rule or a state decision, a cause of action under 42 U.S. C. § 1983 is not stated. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 102 S. Ct. 2744, 73 L. Ed. 2d 482, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 140 (1982). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this article and this section, as used below, refer to former provisions. The chief purpose of attachment proceedings is to secure a contingent lien on the defend ants property until the plaintiff can, by appropriate proceedings, obtain a judgment and have such property applied to its satisfaction. Ross v. Peck Iron &amp; Metal Co., 264 F.2d 262, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 4263 (4th Cir. 1959). The procedure under this article is a hybrid. It is neither a formal action at law nor a bill in equity, but a new statutory procedure. It is in the nature of a proceeding at law, but with equity powers where necessary to attain the ends of justice. Winfree v. Mann, 154 Va. 683, 153 S.E. 837, 1930 Va. LEXIS 241 (1930). Compliance with requirements must be shown.  The remedy by attachment against the estate of a nonresident is wholly statutory, and is harsh in its operation towards the debtor and his creditors, and the proc eeding must show on its face that the requirements of this article have been substantially complied with. McAllister v. Guggenheimer, 91 Va. 317, 21 S.E. 475, 1895 Va. LEXIS 28 (1895). And debt on which action based must be within statute.  In a suit by foreign attachment to subject property of a nonresident, it must be shown that the debt on which the proceeding is based is such a one as comes withi n the meaning of this section, and not merely such a one as might be established, by a suit for the specific performance of a contract, out of which, if enforced, the debt would arise. Barksdale v. Hendree, 2 Patton &amp; H. 43 (1856). Under this section it is only necessary for the attaching party to have a legal or equitable claim to specific personal property, based upon a debt which is due, as well as one or more of the grounds for an attachment provided in § 8.01-534. Ross v. Peck Iron &amp; Metal Co., 264 F.2d 262, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 4263 (4th Cir. 1959). Attachment may be had to set aside fraudulent conveyance.  A creditor at large may maintain an attachment suit to set aside as fraudulent a deed conveying real estate, made by his debtor, where both the debtor and his gra ntee are living out of the State. Peay v. Morrison, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 149, 1853 Va. LEXIS 31 (1853). Attachment lies for claim on contract made out of State.  A claim against a nonresident arising out of a contract of bailment made in the District of Columbia is a claim for a debt for which attachment lies. Peter v. But ler, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 285, 1829 Va. LEXIS 24 (1829). Nonresident creditor may maintain attachment suit.  A creditor residing in another state may sue out an attachment in Virginia against his debtor, also residing in the other state, and others residing in Virginia, indebted to, or having in their hands effects of, the debtor. Williamson v. Bowie, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 176, 1818 Va. LEXIS 34 (1818). Partner may sue out attachment for partnership debt.  One member of a mercantile house to which a debt has been contracted but has not yet fallen due is competent to make complaint on oath and to sue out an attachmen t against the debtor. Kyle &amp; Co. v. Connelly, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 719, 1832 Va. LEXIS 23 (1832). A guarantor of a debt may maintain a foreign attachment against his principal, before he has paid the debt. Moore v. Holt, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 284, 1853 Va. LEXIS 50 (1853). Claim must be due to support foreign attachment.  A suit in the nature of a foreign attachment cannot be maintained unless the claim asserted is actually due. Unless the bill avers that a debt is due the plaintif f from one who is nonresident of this State, and who has estate and effects in this State, it is demurrable. Cirode v. Buchanan, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 205, 1872 Va. LEXIS 14 (1872); Batchelder v. White, 80 Va. 103, 1885 Va. LEXIS 44 (1885). Unless debtor has made, or is about to make, fraudulent conveyance.  Attachments cannot be maintained on undue debts, on ground that the debtors are nonresidents, unless they have disposed or are about to dispose, fraudulently, of their effects. Wingo v. Purdy &amp; Co., 87 Va. 472, 12 S.E. 970, 1891 Va. LEXIS 96 (1891). Effect of personal decree on right to attachment.  An attachment was sued out under this section by plaintiff in error, and it was insisted by defendant in error that as the party suing out the attachment had a de cree for the amount of his debt upon which he could issue an execution at any time, the trial court had no jurisdiction of the attachment. The affidavit for the attachment stated that the amount of affiants debt was as shown by a decree in a certain chancery suit pending in the circuit court. The decree was simply referred to as showing the amount due, and no copy of the decree was filed, and no evidence was offered to show that the plaintiff in error could subject the property in any way save by th e attachment. It was held that it could not be presumed from this mere reference that the plaintiff in error had a personal decree against the debtor for the amount of his debt. Deitz v. Whyte, 131 Va. 19, 109 S.E. 212, 1921 Va. LEXIS 3 (1921). Effect of removal to federal court.  Where a judgment at law, rendered by a federal court in another state, was released as a result of fraudulent misrepresentations, and suit was brought in a State court of Virginia, to cancel the release and attach real estate of the debtor to satisfy the judgment, removal of the suit to the federal court by the defendant could not deprive plaintiff ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-534"><akn:num>§ 8.01-534</akn:num><akn:heading>Grounds of action for pretrial levy or seizure of attachment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. It shall be sufficient ground for an action for pretrial levy or seizure or an attachment that the principal defendant or one of the principal defendants: 1. Is a foreign corporation, or is not a resident of this Commonwealth, and has estate or has debts owing to such defendant within the county or city in which the attachment is, or that such defendant being a nonresident of this Commonwealth, is entitled to the benefit of any lien, legal or equitable, on property, real or personal, within the county or city in which the attachment is. The word estate, as herein used, includes all rights or interests of a pecuniary nature which can be protected, enforced , or proceeded against in courts of law or equity; 2. Is removing or is about to remove himself out of this Commonwealth with intent to change his domicile; 3. Intends to remove, or is removing, or has removed the specific property sued for, or his own estate, or the proceeds of the sale of his property, or a material part of such estate or p roceeds, out of this Commonwealth so that there will probably not be therein effects of such debtor sufficient to satisfy the claim when judgment is obtained therefor should only the ordinary process of law be used to obtain the judgment; 4. Is converting, is about to convert or has converted his property of whatever kind, or some part thereof, into money, securities or evidences of debt with intent to hinder, delay, or de fraud his creditors; 5. Has assigned or disposed of or is about to assign or dispose of his estate, or some part thereof, with intent to hinder, delay or defraud his creditors; 6. Has absconded or is about to abscond or has concealed or is about to conceal himself or his property to the injury of his creditors, or is a fugitive from justice; 7. Has conducted, financed, managed, supervised, directed, sold, or owned a gambling device that is located in an unregulated location pursuant to § 18.2-331.1; 8. Has violated any provision of law related to charitable gaming pursuant to Article 1.1:1 (§ 18.2-340.15 et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 18.2. The intent mentioned in subdivisions 4 and 5 may be stated either in the alternative or conjunctive. B. It shall be sufficient ground for an action for pretrial levy or seizure or an attachment if the specific personal property sought to be levied or seized: 1. Will be sold, removed, secreted or otherwise disposed of by the defendant, in violation of an obligation to the plaintiff, so as not to be forthcoming to answer the final judgment of the court respecting the same; or 2. Will be destroyed, or materially damaged or injured if permitted to remain in the possession of the principal defendant or one of the principal defendants or other person or persons cl aiming under them. C. In an actio n for rent, it also shall be a sufficient ground if there is an immediate danger that the property subject to the landlords lien for rent will be destroyed or concealed.

Removal of Property. E. Fraudulent Assignment or Disposition of Property. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Severability.  Were court to find the provision which permits attachment on basis that defendant is a foreign corporation or not being a resident of Virginia is unconstitutional , such provision stands independent of the remaining provisions and severing it would in no way thwart the overall intent of the Virginia legislature in enacting the legislation; all other grounds upon which an attachment could issue in Virginia clearly call for exigent circumstances. Keystone Bldrs., Inc. v. Floor Fashions of Va., Inc., 829 F. Supp. 181, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11276 (W.D. Va. 1993). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. A.General Consider ation. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Attachment must be regular on its face.  An attachment against an absconding debtor must be regular on its face, and a defect appearing thereon cannot be supplied by averment. Jones v. Anderson, 34 Va. ( 7 Leigh) 308, 1836 Va. LEXIS 39 (1836). Grounds must be stated conjunctively.  Where separate and distinct grounds of attachment are stated, and all are relied on, they must be stated conjunctively. They cannot be stated in the alternative. An affidavit which states that either one or another of three separate and distinct grounds of attachment exists does not state the existence of any one of them, and hence is not sufficient basis for an attachment. Northern Neck State Bank, Inc. v. Gilbe rt Packing Co., 114 Va. 658, 77 S.E. 451, 1913 Va. LEXIS 127 (1913). B.Foreign Corporations and Nonresident Debtors. 1.Foreign Corporations. Foreign insurance company doing business in State is liable to attachment.  An insurance company, incorporated by the laws of another state and having its principal place of business in that state, which has complied with the laws of Virg inia in relation to foreign insurance companies doing business in this State, is not a resident of this State, within the meaning of the foreign attachment laws, and its property is liable to attachment as a nonresident. Cowardin v. Universal Life Ins. C o., 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 445, 1879 Va. LEXIS 79 (1879). Lessee of railroad in State does not become domestic corporation.  A Maryland corporation, by leasing a railroad in Virginia from a Virginia corporation with the assent of this State did not thereby make itself a corporation of V irginia. Railroad Co. v. Koontz, 104 U.S. 5, 26 L. Ed. 643, 1881 U.S. LEXIS 1962 (1881). Nor does foreign corporation appointing local agent.  A corporation chartered and organized under the laws of another state, and holding no charter from this State, is a foreign corporation, although it has an agent, appointed under the statutes of this State, upon whom process may be served, and the fact that it is a foreign corporation is all that is required by this section to justify the issuing of an attachment against its property. Cook &amp; Son Mining Co. v. Tho mpson, 110 Va. 369, 66 S.E. 79, 1909 Va. LEXIS 152 (1909). 2.Nonresident Debtors. Se ction should be strictly construed.  This section, allowing attachments against absent debtors, is an innovation on the common law, and should be carefully watched and strictly confined to the ground covered by it. Kelso v. Blackburn, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 299, 1831 Va. LEXIS 53 (1831); Bank of United States, Inc. v. Merchants Bank, 40 Va. (1 Rob.) 573, 1843 Va. LEXIS 8 (1843). Debtor m ust be actual nonresident.  A party cannot be proceeded against by foreign attachment unless he is actually a nonresident of the State at the time the attachment is sued out. Kelso v. Blackb urn, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 299, 1831 Va. LEXIS 53 (1831); Long v. Ryan, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 718, 1878 Va. LEXIS 91 (1878). And must have debts or estate where attachment is issued.  The words in which the attachment is mean in which the attachment proceeding is instituted, and not in which the writ of attachment is levied.  Therefore, attachment against a nonresident will not lie where the nonresident has neither debts nor estate within the city or county in which the attachment is issued. Winfree v. Mann, 154 Va. 683, 153 S.E. 837, 1930 Va. LEXIS 241 (1930). Residence defined.  The word residence as used in this section is to be construed as meaning the act of abiding or dwelling in a place for some continuance of time. Long v. R yan, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 718, 1878 Va. LEXIS 91 (1878). There is a wide distinction between domicile and residence. To constitute a domicile two things must concur: first, residence; second, the intention to remain for an unlimited time. Residence is to have a permanent abode for the time being, as contradistinguished from a mere temporary locality of existence. Long v. Ryan, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 718, 1878 Va. LEXIS 91 (1878). Intention to remain permanently is not essential to residence.  While on the one hand the casual or temporary sojourn of a person in the State, whether on business or pleasure, does not make him a resident of the State within the meaning of this section, especially if his personal domicile is elsewhere, so, on the other hand, it is not essential that he should come into the State with the intention to remain here permanently, to constitute him a resident. Long v. Ryan, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 718, 1878 Va. LEXIS 91 (1878). Dwelling in State for indefinite period is sufficient.  One who is dwelling in Virginia with no intention of leaving, being engaged in constructing public improvements under a contract that will occupy him for an indef inite period, is not a nonresident within the attachment laws, although his family lives out of the State. Didier v. Patterson, 93 Va. 534, 25 S.E. 661, 1896 Va. LEXIS 108 (1896). One who was domiciled in Washington obtained a contract to construct three sections of a railroad in Virginia. He rented out his house in Washington, removed his family to a place on the route of the road, and kept house. Before the work was finished or the time for completing it had arrived, an attachment was sued out again...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-535"><akn:num>§ 8.01-535</akn:num><akn:heading>Jurisdiction of attachments; trial or hearing of issues</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Except as provided in § 16.1-77 the jurisdiction of attachments under this chapter shall be in the circuit courts.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. By this section the legislature undertook to simplify the procedure and practice in atta chment, and § 8.01-549 shows that it never intended to exclude the equity practice from the proceedings. The plain purpose was to simplify the form of procedure, and allow the courts to use their equitable or legal modes of practice as would best prom ote a fair trial and justice. Rust v. Indiana Flooring Co., 151 Va. 845, 145 S.E. 321, 1928 Va. LEXIS 277 (1928). Courts jurisdiction is limited and special.  An attachment is purely a statutory remedy. The jurisdiction thereof is a special and limited jurisdiction, and a court, even of general jurisdiction, cannot proc eed by attachment unless the power rests upon express statutory authority. In order that a court may have jurisdiction to issue any particular attachment, it is not enough that it be a court upon which the statute has conferred the power to use the proce ss of attachment, but, conceding its power to use the process of attachment, the court must have before it a case in which the use of such process is authorized by the statute.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. Decisions Under Current Law. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.Decisions Under Current Law. Constitutionality.  Fuller v. Hurley, 559 F. Supp. 313, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18889 (W.D. Va. 1983). Petition dismissed where debtor was not owner or transferred pro perty before debt arose.  The allegation that the debtor transferred the property to a purchaser with intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditor was groundless where the debto r did not own the property, since the debtor could not transfer that which it never owned. Moreover, even if there had been a transfer from the debtor to the purchaser concerning the property, where it occurred before any indebtedness to the creditor, th ere could not exist any intent to defraud the creditor. Thus, there was no error in the trial courts dismissal of the petition to attach the property. Allsbrook v. Azalea Radiator Serv., Inc., 227 Va. 600, 316 S.E.2d 743, 1984 Va. LEXIS 229 (1984). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note.  The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The requirements of this section and § 8.01-539 are plain and unambiguous, and until it appears that its mandatory provisions have been met the court is without jurisdiction to exercise any power over the property sought to be attached. Fauquier Nat'l Bank v. Hazelwood Sav. &amp; Trust Co., 165 Va. 259, 182 S.E. 566, 1935 Va. LEXIS 293 (1935 ). And they are mandato ry.  This section and § 8.01-539 recognize certain rights of the debtor and enjoin upon the creditor certain procedural requirements which are essentially mandatory for the purpose of safeguarding these rights. Unless it affirmatively appears that such steps were taken, a valid lien cannot be acquired. Fauquier Nat'l Bank v. Hazelwood Sav. &amp; Trust Co., 165 Va. 259, 182 S.E. 566, 1935 Va.

Purpose of subsection B is to insure payment of tax.  The purpose of subsection B is to insure promptly and certainly the payment of the tax, and it has no relation to the right or procedure of the action. Jenkins v. Faulkner, 174 Va. 43, 4 S.E.2d 788, 1939 Va. LEXIS 139 (1939). Subsection B is not intended to penalize a litigant. Jenkins v. Faulkner, 174 Va. 43, 4 S .E.2d 788, 1939 Va. LEXIS 139 (1939). Di smissal is in nature of nonsuit.  When an attachment is dismissed ipso facto for failure to pay the writ tax as required by subsection B, the dismissal is in the nature of a nonsuit. Jenkins v. Fa ulkner, 174 Va. 43, 4 S.E.2d 788, 1939 Va. LEXIS 139 (1939). It does not extinguish right of action.  The dismissal of an attachment under this section for failure to pay the writ tax within the time prescribed only bars proceedings on that attachment, and does no t extinguish the right of action. Senter v. Lively, 160 Va. 417, 168 S.E. 328, 1933 Va. LEXIS 222 (1933). The word thereon can only refer to the attachment, not to the right of action. T he latter remains as if no proceedings of any kind had been instituted. Senter v. Lively, 160 Va. 417, 168 S.E. 328, 1933 Va. LEXIS 222 (1933). Court may allow payment to clerk in open court.  Upon a motion to dismiss an attachment proceeding for the failure of the plaintiff to comply with the provisions of subsection B, it was not error for the court t o allow the plaintiff to pay the writ tax to the clerk in open court and to overrule the motion to dismiss. Jenkins v. Faulkner, 174 Va. 43, 4 S.E.2d 788, 1939 Va. LEXIS 139 (1939). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Advance legal fees may be garnished.  As advance legal fees remain the property of a judgment debtor, a judgment creditor may garnish unearned advance fees paid by a judgment debtor to his or her atto rney.

If the plai ntiff seeks only pretrial levy on property and a bond with approved surety or cash bond is posted, the amount of the bond shall be at least the estimated fair market value of the property to be levied. If a property bond is posted, the amount of the bon d shall be at least double the estimated fair market value of the property to be levied. C. If the plai ntiff seeks pretrial seizure of property, the amount of the bond shall be at least double the estimated fair market value of the property to be seized. D.

But it does not destroy effect of §§ 8.01-537 and 8.01-539.  The General Assembly, by the provisions of this section, did not intend to wipe away and destroy the mandatory procedural requirements of §§ 8.01-537 and 8. 01-539. If it had been the legislative intent to abrogate the requirements of those sections, and especially the requirement in § 8.01-539 that a party in possession of real estate must be made a party defendant, then surely the legislature would have done so by some express language free from doubt as to its meaning.

CASE NOTES Effect of de fendants appearance where not summoned.  The only purpose of the command to the officer to summon a defendant is to bring the defendant into court and allow and require him to make his defense, if he has any. By voluntarily coming into the cause, contesting the plaintiffs claim and pleading counterclaim and setoff, without reservation, the defendant does for himself all that this section requires that the plaintiff do for him. Montague Mfg. Co. v. T en Weeges, 297 F. 221, 1924 U.S. App. LEXIS 2810 (4th Cir. 1924) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Effect of attachment claim combined with legal claims.  Where plaintiffs complaint sought legal remedies against some defendants and pre-judgment attachment of another defendants property, defendants that were not subject to the attachment count were not entitled to the benefit of the heightened service of process requirements provided by § 8.01-546. Brin v. A Home Come True, Inc., 74 Va. Cir. 45, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 36 (Fairfax County Mar. 23, 2007). Service held proper.  As the sheriffs return of service indicated that a petition for attachment and a claim of exemption form was served on defendants, and the court took judicial notice that those defendants received a summons from the sheriff to appear and answer the petition for attachment, because every request for service issued to and served by the sheriff included such a summons, defendants were properly served with proces s pursuant to § 8.01-546.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Attachment may be levied on any visible and tangible effects of a nonresident debtor in his actual or constructive possession, in the common-law mode, as in the case of an execution. Dorrier v. Masters, 83 Va. 459, 2 S.E. 927, 1887 Va. LEXIS 92 (1887). But only property within State may be attached.  An attachment against a nonresident can be levied only upon his estate and effects within this State. Batchelder v. White, 80 Va. 103, 1885 Va.

Money on special deposit may be at tached.  Money was left with a person who was a member of a firm, on a special deposit, and in his absence it was entered on the books of the firm to the credit of the dep ositor, and paid out by the firm for their own uses, they paying the depositors checks upon it, by checks in their name upon the bank. An attachment was served upon the firm as garnishees in a suit against the depositor, the summons being served on t he other member of the firm. It was held that the attachment bound the money in the hands of the firm. Pulliam v. Aler, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 54, 1859 Va. LEXIS 2 (1859). As may debts due by open account.  Debts due a nonresident debtor by an open account may be attached in the hands of resident garnishees. Porter v. Young, 85 Va. 49, 6 S.E. 803, 1888 Va.

Shares in joint stock company are liable to attachment.  The shares of a stockholder in a joint stock company, incorporated by and conducting its operations, in whole or in part, in the State, are such estate as is liab le to be attached.

Buckeye Nat'l Bank v. Huff, 114 Va. 1, 75 S.E. 769, 1912 Va. LEXIS 105 (1912).

It was held that there could be no surplus in the hands of the trustees until the debts secured by the deed were paid, and consequently there was nothing in their hands liable to the attachment. Clark v. Ward, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 440, 1855 Va. LEXIS 33 (1855 ). Funds in hands of public officer are not liable to attachment.  Funds in the hands of the State Treasurer, which he holds by law in pursuance of a trust, are not liable to attachment at the suit of an individual.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The levy of the attachment is the foundation of the suit. If the property attached is no t the defendants property, the court is without jurisdiction. Culbertson v. Stevens, 82 Va. 406, 4 S.E. 607, 1886 Va. LEXIS 51 (1886). Actual seizure is not essential.  To constitute an effectual levy, it is not essential that the officer make an actual seizure. If he have the goods in his view and power, and note on the writ the fact of his levy thereon, this will in general suffice. Bullitt v. Winstons, 15 Va. (1 Munf) 269, 1810 Va.

Robertson v. Hoge, 83 Va. 124, 1 S.E. 667, 1887 Va. LEXIS 45 (1887). And must contain general d escription of land.  The levy of an attachment on real estate must contain such general description of the land, and describe it with such substantial accuracy, that it may be easily identified when conveyed, by looking alone to the levy without the aid of extrinsic evidence. Raub v. Otterback, 92 Va. 517, 23 S.E. 883, 1896 Va. LEXIS 10 (1896). Description held adequate.  A return on an attachment that it was levied on a tract of land of the defendant company containing about three hundred and sixty acres, located in the county of M., in the magisterial district of P., of said county, being the same land conveyed to said company by L. C. Garnett, Esq., special commissioner of Mathews county circuit court, by deed recorded in deed book No. 15, pp. 58-59, is a substantial, i f not a literal, compliance with this section.

Property cannot be seized and taken possession of unless the creditor has given a bond. D orrier v. Masters, 83 Va. 459, 2 S.E. 927, 1887 Va. LEXIS 92 (1887). Under the attachment statutes, the officer is not required to take possession of the property unless the plaintiff in the attachment suit gives bond as required b y this section. First Nat'l Bank v. Johnson, 183 Va. 227, 31 S.E.2d 581, 1944 Va. LEXIS 145 (1944). Partner may give bond in attac hment by firm.  The bond of a partner suing out an attachment, with surety, conditioned that that partner should pay all costs, in case the house should be cast in the suit, and all damages that should be adjudged against him for suing out the attachment, was a good bond. Kyle &amp; Co. v. Connelly, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 719, 1832 Va. LEXIS 23 (1832). But bond should show partnership as plaintiff in attachment.  An attachment being sued out by one member of a firm, for a debt due to the firm, and in the name of the firm, it was proper that the bond executed by the partner who sued out the attachment and his surety should bind the obligors to be answerable for the failure of the firm to prosecute their attachment with success. M'Clung &amp; Co. v. Jackson, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 96, 1849 Va. LEXIS 25 (1849). An attachment against an absconding debtor was sued out in the name of a partnership, for a debt due the partnership; the bond taken was the bond of F., one of th e partners, with surety, reciting that F. had obtained the attachment, and conditioned that if he should be cast in the suit, he should pay all costs and damages which should be recovered against him. It was held that the bond was void, and the attachmen t was therefore illegal and void. Jones v. Anderson, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 308, 1836 Va. LEXIS 39 (1836). No action lies if attachment sued out with good cause.  The sureties in the attachment bond, when the attachment has been sued out with good cause, are not responsible for the failure of the officer to discharge his du ty, or for a trespass committed by him. Offtendinger v. Ford, 92 Va. 636, 24 S.E. 246, 1896 Va. LEXIS 26 (1896). What is probable cause.  Probable cause for suing out an attachment is a belief by the attaching creditor in the existence of the facts essential to the prosecution of his attachment, fou nded upon facts which might induce such a belief on the part of a man of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment. Spengler v. Davy, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 381, 1859 Va. LEXIS 23 (1859). Only defendant or owner of specific property attached may sue.  Where the attachment issues against the effects of the defendant generally, he alone can sue upon the bond, and where the attachment is issued against specific pr operty, only the defendant or the owner of the specific property can sue. Davis v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 139, 1856 Va. LEXIS 5 (1856). If property belonging to a third person is seized under an attachment issued against the general estate of a debtor, the remedy of the owner of the property is an action of trespass against the sheriff who made the levy, or an action on the sheriffs bond. Davis v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 139, 1856 Va. LEXIS 5 (1856) (see also James v. MCubbin, 6 Va. (2 Call) 273 (1800); Mosby v. Mosby, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 584 (1853); Sangster v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 124 (1866)). Damages need not be assessed in some prior action.  If any damages have been sustained, it is not necessary that they should be previously assessed in some other action to justify an action on an attachment bond. D ickinson v. M'Craw, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 158, 1826 Va. LEXIS 16 (1826); Offtendinger v. Ford, 92 Va. 636, 24 S.E. 246, 1896 Va. LEXIS 26 (1896). Costs and damages must be alleged.  In an action on an attachment bond, it is not sufficient to allege in the declaration, that the defendant did not pay all such costs and damages as have accru ed, etc., but it must be expressly averred that costs and damages had been actually sustained. Dickinson v. M'Craw, 25 Va. (4 Rand.) 158, 1826 Va. LEXIS 16 (1826). Variance between attachment and bond.  If the claim of the plaintiff in an attachment against an absconding debtor is stated as for a certain sum, due by negotiable note, with interest from the day whe n the note should have been paid, and the bond for prosecuting the attachment describes it as sued out for the sum of money mentioned therein, saying nothing of interest, the variance is not material.

Text Any property levied on or seized as aforesaid, under any attachment, may be retained by or returned to the defendant or other person in whose possession it was on his g iving bond, with condition to have the same forthcoming at such time and place as the court may require. In the alternative, the principal defendant may, by giving bond with condition to perform the judgment of the court, release from any attachment the whole of any estate attached. The bond in either case shall be taken by the officer serving the attachment, with surety, payable to the plaintiff, and in a penalty in the latter case either double the amount or value for which the attachment issued or do uble the value of the property on which the attachment was levied, at the option of the person giving it, and in the former, either double the amount of value for which the attachment issued or double the value of the property retained or returned, at th e option of the person giving it. However, in the event the court shall consider that the amount of any bond required by this section or § 8.01-551 is excessive or inadequate, such court may, upon motion of any party in interest after reasonable notic e to the opposite party if he can be found in the jurisdiction of the court or to his attorney of record, if any, fix the amount of such bond to conform to the equities of the case.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Forthcoming bond is not necessary where no attachment bond given.  Under the terms of § 8.01-551 the officer levying an attachment is not required to take possession of the property unless the plaintiff has given bond, and whe re no such attachment bond is given there is no necessity for the defendant in the attachment to execute a forthcoming bond in order that the possession of the property may be retained by or returned to him. Foster v. Wilson, 139 Va. 82, 123 S.E. 527, 1924 Va. LEXIS 86 (1924). Bond is security in lieu o f property attached.  Where an attachment is sustained, the bond stands as a security in lieu of the property on which the attachment was levied. Hilton &amp; Allen v. Consumers' Can Co., 103 Va. 255, 48 S.E. 899, 1904 Va. LEXIS 32 (1904). Giving of bond does not ba r other attachments.  The giving of a bond under this section does not debar the plaintiff from suing out other attachments for the same debt and having them levied on other property o f the defendant. Kaylor v. Davy Pocahontas Coal Co., 118 Va. 369, 87 S.E. 551, 1916 Va. LEXIS 18 (1916). Nor does it give court personal jurisdiction of defendant.  The execution of a forthcoming bond does not give the court in which the attachment was sued out jurisdiction to enter a personal decree against the defendant. Hi lton &amp; Allen v. Consumers' Can Co., 103 Va. 255, 48 S.E. 899, 1904 Va. LEXIS 32 (1904). And bond loses v itality when attachment dismissed.  If a bond is given by the defendant in attachment in pursuance of this section, conditioned to have the property forthcoming at such time and place as the court m ay require, or to perform the judgment of the court, there is no question but that the bond loses its vitality when the attachment is dismissed. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Parrish, 150 Va. 473, 143 S.E. 750, 1928 Va. LEXIS 329 (1928). Bond with condition to perform judgment releases whole estate attached.  The effect of a bond given by the defendant under this section with condition to perform the judgment of the court is to release from any attachment the whole of the estate attached. Kaylor v. Davy Pocahontas Coal Co., 118 Va. 369, 87 S.E. 551, 1916 Va. LEXIS 18 (1916). The words perform the judgment of the court have acquired a definite legal meaning, to wit, to pay such money judgment as may be rendered against the defendant in attachment. Foster v. Wilson, 139 Va. 82, 123 S.E. 527, 1924 Va. LEXIS 86 (1924). Bo nd not complying with this section may yet be enforceable.  A bond which recited attachment proceedings and the desire of the debtor to retain the property attached, conditioned to produce the property attached at such tim e and place as the court might require and to perform the judgment of the court, taken by the clerk of court without the knowledge or consent of the sheriff or the attaching creditor, and filed with the papers in the attachment proceeding, did not comply with the provisions of this section, but was a valid common-law obligation, enforceable according to its terms. Foster v. Wilson, 139 Va. 82, 123 S.E. 527, 1924 Va. LEXIS 86 (1924). Thus sheriff may sue on bond made payable to him.  If a forthcoming bond be made payable to the sheriff instead of to the creditor, the sheriff may maintain an action thereon. Beale v. Downman, 5 Va. (1 Call) 249, 1798 Va. LEXIS 16 (1798). Bond prepared without notice to obligee construed against obligors.  Where a release bond in attachment proceedings was prepared by counsel for the obligors without notice to opposing counsel or opportunity on their part to suggest its form or object to its terms, if there is doubt or ambiguity the words of the instrument should be construed most strongly against the obligors.

If such exception be sustained, the court shall order the officer to file a good bond, with sufficient surety, to be approved by it, on or before a certain day to be fixed by the court.

I.General Consideration. Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . Court has no inherent jurisdiction over property to be attached.  Under this section a lien is not acquired by virtue of the inherent jurisdiction of the court over the property; on the contrary, the courts power over the pr operty does not exist and cannot be exercised until a substantial compliance with the statutory prerequisites appears. These, and only these, procedural prerequisites give the creditor the right to a lien, and when this right is established the court is clothed with jurisdiction over the attached property. Fauquier Nat'l Bank v. Hazelwood Sav. &amp; Trust Co., 165 Va. 259, 182 S.E. 566, 1935 Va. LEXIS 293 (1935). It must acquire jurisdiction through statutory proceedings.  The court must acquire jurisdiction over the property to be attached through the proceedings prescribed by this and the preceding sections before there can exist a valid lien on such property. Fauquier Nat'l Bank v. Hazelwood Sav. &amp; Trust Co., 165 Va. 259, 182 S.E. 566, 1935 Va. LEXIS 293 (1935). Lien commenc es at time of levy.  The lien of the attachment in Virginia commences from the time of its levy or service. Williamson v. Bowie, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 176, 1818 Va. LEXIS 34 (1818); Allan v . Hoffman, 83 Va. 129, 2 S.E. 602, 1887 Va. LEXIS 46 (1887); First Nat'l Bank v. Johnson, 183 Va. 227, 31 S.E.2d 581, 1944 Va. LEXIS 145 (1944). It is perfected by levy.  The lien of the attachment is perfected by the levy thereof, and the subsequent judgment or decree is simply the enforcement of a valid preexisting lien. It is th e creation of the lien, and not its enforcement, that is denounced by the Bankruptcy Act. Jackson v. Valley Tie &amp; Lumber Co., 108 Va. 714, 62 S.E. 964, 1908 Va. LEXIS 90 (1908). And fina l judgment relates back.  The levy of an attachment creates an inchoate lien upon the property attached, and when final judgment is rendered for the plaintiff it relates back to the levy, but it cannot by relation render a transaction unlawful which was not unlawful at the time it took place. Trimble v. Covington Grocery Co., 112 Va. 826, 72 S.E. 724, 1911 Va. LEXIS 156 (1911). Lien of an attachment is perfected by the levy of the officer. S.W. Rawls, Inc. v. Forres t, 224 Va. 264, 295 S.E.2d 791, 1982 Va. LEXIS 290 (1982). Fieri facias lien and attachment lien take effect at different times.  The two Code chapters dealing with garnishment in aid of the fieri facias lien on unleviable property and garnishment by attachment lien provide for their taking effect at different times. In re Acorn Elec. Supply, Inc., 348 F. Supp. 277, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11938 (E.D. Va. 1972). A judgment or decree in enforcement of a valid preexisting lien is not the judgment or d ecree denounced by the Bankruptcy Act, which was plainly confined to judgments creating liens. In re Acorn Elec. Supply, Inc., 348 F. Supp. 277, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11938 (E.D. Va. 1972). The service of the attachment operates to inhibit a transfer of the debtors property from the defendants to any other person. M'Kim v. Fulton, 10 Va. (6 Call) 106, 1806 Va. LEXIS 23 (1806); Smith v. Henny, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 440, 1809 Va. LEXIS 78 (1809); Williamson v. Bowie, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 176, 1818 Va. LEXIS 34 (1818). II.Property Subject to Lien. Lien affects only debts owed and property held by person served.  The attachment operates as a lien only upon the debts and effects of the absent debtor, in the hands of the home defendants against whom, and upon whom, it is ser ved. Farmers Bank v. Day, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 360, 1849 Va. LEXIS 56 (1849). And only debts due and property held at time of service.  Where a codefendant in an attachment is named as a person who is indebted to or has in his possession property belonging to the principal defendant, by the servic e of a copy of the attachment upon the codefendant the plaintiff acquires an inchoate lien upon any debt then owed to the principal defendant by the codefendant, and upon any property of the principal defendant then in the possession of the codefendant. But he acquires no lien whatever upon any indebtedness of the codefendant to the principal defendant which accrues after the service of the attachment, or upon any property of the principal defendant which comes into the possession of the codefendant aft er the service of the attachment. Deeds v. Gilmer, 162 Va. 157, 174 S.E. 37, 1934 Va. LEXIS 244 (1934). Creditor acquires no right superior to that of debtor.  By attachment, a creditor acquires in the proceeds of property claimed by his debtor no right or interest superior to that possessed by the latter therein at the time of the levy or service of the writ. Seward &amp; Co. v. Miller, 106 Va. 309, 55 S.E. 681, 1906 Va. LEXIS 135 (1906). Lien does not attach to funds subject to forfeiture.  The estimates of work done by a contractor for a railroad company are made up to the 20th of each month, when they are considered due, though not paid for some da ys afterwards. As the price of the work done by the contractor after the 20th may be forfeited to the company for several causes before the 20th of the next month, no debt is due from the company to the contractor until the 20th arrives, and therefore an attachment served on the company on the 14th of the month creates no lien, as there is nothing then in his hands due to the contractor which may be attached, though in fact no forfeiture occurs. B &amp; O R.R. v. Gallahue's Adm'rs, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 563, 1 858 Va. LEXIS 31 (1858). Service on lessee binds only rents due at time of service.  Where, in a foreign attachment, the home defendant holds lands of the absent debtor upon a lease, the service of the attachment upon the lessee binds only the ren ts due to the absent defendant at the time the attachment was served, and does not bind the rents accruing subsequently. Haffey v. Miller, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 454, 1849 Va. LEXIS 69 (1849). Service on executor creates lien on legacy.  Service of process of foreign attachment on an executor before qualification creates a lien in favor of the attaching creditor on a legacy to an absent debtor. Sa ndridge v. Graves, 1 Patton &amp; H. 101 (1855). No lien is acquired on realty not described in endorsement on process.  If the endorsement on the process of attachment does not mention or describe real estate, the attachment does not operate upon any real estate. Clark v. Ward, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 440, 1855 Va. LEXIS 33 (1855). III.Priorities. Lien of attachment is subject to bona fide earlier lien.  If property, when attached, is subject to a lien placed thereon by the defendant in good faith, that lien must be respected and the attachment postponed to it. Se ward &amp; Co. v. Miller, 106 Va. 309, 55 S.E. 681, 1906 Va. LEXIS 135 (1906). And to prior assignment to chose in action.  Since the Virginia recording acts do not embrace choses in action, an assignment of a chose in action to a trustee to pay the debts of the assignor is valid again st a subsequent attaching creditor of the assignor. Kirkland v. Brune, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 126, 1878 Va. LEXIS 33 (1878); Gregg v. Sloan, 76 Va. 497, 1882 Va. LEXIS 54 (1882) (see also Tazewells Exr v. Barrett &amp; Co., 14 Va.

And prior deed of trust.  A subpoena was sued out against an absent debtor and home defendants. The subpoena was returned executed on the home defendants, but the date of its service upon them was not stated. After the issue of the subpoena, but before the return day thereof, the debtor executed a deed to secure certain creditors, which was duly filed. It was held that the attachment was postponed to the deed. Richeson v. Richeson, 43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 497, 1846 Va. LEXIS 10 (1846).

CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Consideration. II. Who May Be Garnished. III. What May Be Garnished. IV. Practice and Procedure. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . Service of notice of attachment gives plaintiff a lien upon a debt owing by the garnishe e to defendant. Trimble v. Covington Grocery Co., 112 Va. 826, 72 S.E. 724, 1911 Va. LEXIS 156 (1911). Contingent debt cannot be collected.  The contract between a railroad company and one of the contractors on its line of improvement provided that the contractor should not receive the amount of final estimate of his work until he should release, under seal, all claims or demands upon the company arising out of the contract. The contractor could not recover the amount of the final estimate until he had executed the release, and an attaching creditor a t law had no greater rights against the company in respect to this final estimate than the contractor had, and therefore could not recover the amount unless the contractor had executed the release. B &amp; O R.R. v. McCullough &amp; Co., 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 595, 1855 Va. LEXIS 45 (1855). Plaintiff cannot acquire greater right than principal defendant.  Garnishment is substantially a suit by the principal defendant in the attachment, in the name of the plaintiff against the garnishee. The plaintiff stands upon no higher ground than the defendant, and can acquire no greater right than the defendant himself possesses. Rollo v. Andes Ins. Co., 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 509, 1873 Va. LEXIS 50 (1873). Lien is enforced by judgment against garnishee.  The lien of the attachment cannot be enforced without rendering a judgment against the garnishee. B &amp; O R.R. v. McCullough &amp; Co., 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 595, 1855 Va. LEXIS 45 (1855). Plaintiff must first establish his debt against principal defendant.  As the whole object of garnishment is to reach effects or credits in the garnishees hands so as to subject them to the payment of such judgment as the plainti ff may recover against the principal defendant, it follows necessarily that there can be no judgment against the garnishee until judgment against the principal defendant has been recovered. And the judgment against the defendant must be a final one. If i t is appealed from by the defendant there can be no judgment against the garnishee while the appeal is pending. George v. Blue, 7 Va. (3 Call) 455, 1803 Va. LEXIS 23 (1803); Withers v. Fuller, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 547, 1878 Va. LEXIS 81 (1878) (see Gibson v. White &amp; Co., 17 Va. (3 Munf.) 94 (1812)). Garnishee is liable only for consuming or appropriating property.  If the defendant appears not to be a debtor of the absentee, but holds effects belonging to him, by a title not effectual against creditors, or without any title at all, he should be considered personally responsible only for so much as he may have consumed, or appropriated to his own use so that it is not forthcoming, or for the profits he may have received. Gibson v. White &amp; Co., 17 Va. (3 Munf) 94, 1812 Va. LE XIS 18 (1812). Garnishees claim for keeping property should be satisfied.  In a proceeding by foreign attachment, a home defendant having property of the absent defendant in his possession, for the keeping of which the absent defendant i s indebted to him, is entitled, as against the attaching creditor, to have his claim first satisfied out of the property. Williamson v. Gayle, 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 152, 1850 Va. LEXIS 27 (1850). Judgment should be only for amount of plaintiffs demand.  An attaching creditor should be decreed only so much of the debt garnished as is equal to his demand. Watts Ex'rs v. Robertson, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 442, 1809 Va. LEXIS 80 (1809). For the attaching creditor has no interest in the subject beyond his demand.  If the garnishee admits funds to that amount, or the jury finds them, he looks no further but takes his judgment accordingly. He is not concerned to contest wheth er his debtor has no further demands against the garnishee, and the judgment against the latter ascertains that there is so much at least in his hands, but not, as against the debtor, that there may not be more. B &amp; O R.R. v. McCullough &amp; Co., 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 595, 1855 Va. LEXIS 45 (1855). Judgment for residue may be given in favor of principal defendant.  Where a foreign attachment is sued out against an absent debtor and a resident garnishee, in a case equitable in its nature, it is competent to the court to decre e between the debtor and the garnishee what may be due from the latter to the former, after satisfying the claims of the plaintiff. But the evidence, in such a case, must arise from the pleadings and proofs between the plaintiff and defendant. Templeman v. Fauntleroy, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 434, 1825 Va. LEXIS 27 (1825). II.Who May Be Garnished. A corporation may be summoned and proceeded against as a garnishee, upon proceedings und er this section. B &amp; O R.R. v. Gallahue's Adm'rs, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 655, 1855 Va. LEXIS 51 (1855). A municipal corporation may be garnished or attached for a debt due to one of its credit ors just as a natural person may be. Such a proceeding is not contrary to the public policy of this State. Portsmouth Gas Co. v. Sanford, 97 Va. 124, 33 S.E. 516, 1899 Va. LEXIS 19 (1899). State Treasurer cannot be garnished in attachment against foreign insuran ce company.  The treasurer of the State, who holds bonds of a foreign insurance company doing business in the State, is not liable to be summoned as garnishee by a foreign cre ditor of the insurance company. Rollo v. Andes Ins. Co., 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 509, 1873 Va. LEXIS 50 (1873). III.What May Be Garnished. Money on deposit is subject to garnishment.  Money was left with a person who was a member of a firm, on a special deposit, and in his absence it was entered on the books of the firm to the credit of the dep ositor, and paid out by the firm for their own uses, they paying the depositors checks upon it, by checks in their own name upon the bank. An attachment was served upon the firm as garnishees in a suit against the depositor, the summons being served on the other member of the firm. It was held that the attachment bound the money in the hands of the firm. Pulliam v. Aler, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 54, 1859 Va. LEXIS 2 (1859). Trust funds in hands of public officer are not.  No lien can be obtained by attachment upon funds charged with a trust in the hands of a public officer. Rollo v. Andes Ins. Co., 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 509, 1873 Va. LEXIS 50 (1873); Foley v. Shriver, 81 Va. 568, 1886 Va. LEXIS 124 (1886); Buck v. Guarantors' Liab. Indem. Co., 97 Va. 719, 34 S.E. 950, 1900 Va. LEXIS 126 (1900). Land in poss ession of garnishee.  In a proceeding by foreign attachment, the home defendant denied that he had any effects of the absent debtor in his hands. He said that a tract of land which had belonged to the absent debtor, had been purchased by himself and paid for, and he in fact held the receipt of the absent debtor for the amount of the purchase money. As, however, he did not pretend he had paid the amount in money, and as the accounts wh ich he endeavored to establish were not proved to the satisfaction of the commissioner and the court, the land was held liable. Kelly v. Linkenhoger, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 104, 1851 Va. LEXIS 47 (1851). The shares of a stockholder in a joint stock company may properly be considered, for the purpose of attachment proceedings, as in the possession of the corporation in which the shares are held and the corporation may properly be summoned as garnishee in the case. C &amp; O R.R. v. Paine &amp; Co., 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 502, 1877 Va. LEXIS 39 (1877). IV.Practice and Procedure. Garnishee may be compelled to pay interest.  A home defendant decreed to pay money to a creditor of an absent defendant will be compelled to pay interest, unless he makes a legal tender, or brings the money into court.

If the judgment of the court or verdict of the jury be in favor of such codefendant, he shall have judgment for his costs against the plaintiff. History History. Code 1950, § 8-553; 1977, c. 617. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2A M.J. Attachment and Garnishment, § 111. CASE NOTES Failure to inquire into total su m of funds.  Because the circuit court failed to conduct the requisite inquiry into the total sum of the funds deposited into a judgment debtors bank account during the ga rnishment period, the record was insufficient on appeal to resolve the amount of indebtedness of the garnishee to the debtor, and therefore, the judgment creditor, during the garnishment period; the alleged unreliability of the account statement does not exempt the account from review.

The principal defendant may also file counterclaims or defenses available under § 8.01-422 as in an action at law.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . If an affidavit (now petition) is defective, the remedy is by motion to quash the attachment. Anderson v. Johnson, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 558, 1879 Va. LEXIS 87 (1879). Appearance o n motion to quash is not waiver of defects.  An appearance on a motion to quash an attachment because of irregular execution is not an appearance to the action whereby alleged defects are waived. Petty v. Fr ick Co., 86 Va. 501, 10 S.E. 886, 1890 Va. LEXIS 11 (1890). Atta chment may be abated at any time before final judgment.  The authority given the court under this section to enter judgment abating the attachment may be exercised at any time before a final judgment has been entered di sposing of the property attached. Northern Neck State Bank, Inc. v. Gilbert Packing Co., 114 Va. 658, 77 S.E. 451, 1913 Va. LEXIS 127 (1913). Former order ove rruling motion does not bind court.  The court is not precluded from abating the attachment because at a former stage of the proceeding a motion to abate was overruled, if upon further consideration it is satisfied that the writ was issued upon an insufficient affidavit. Northern Neck State Bank, Inc. v. Gilbert Packing Co., 114 Va. 658, 77 S.E. 451, 1913 Va. LEXIS 127 (1913). An attachment irregularly issued ought to be quashed ex officio by the court to which it is returned, though bail is not given, nor any plea filed by the defendant. Mantz v. Hendley, 12 Va. (2 Hen. &amp; M.) 308, 1808 Va. LEXIS 41 (1808). Irregular attachment may be dismissed on appeal.  Objections to the regularity of attachment proceedings may be taken advantage of, not only in the trial court, but in an appellate court, although not raised in t he trial court, and the court may, of its own motion, dismiss an irregular attachment, and ought to do so when there has been no appearance by the nonresident debtor, and no personal service upon him. McAllister v. Guggenheimer, 91 Va. 317, 21 S.E. 475, 1895 Va. LEXIS 28 (1895). But see Sims v. Tyrer, 96 Va. 5, 26 S.E. 508, 1897 Va. LEXIS 144 (1897). Validity of plaintiff s demand is not involved.  The question of the validity of the debt or demand of the plaintiff, i.e., whether it is or is not established, does not arise upon a preliminary motion to quash the attachment, but only when the case is heard upon its merits. Consequently, the question of the liability of a partnership for torts of one of the partners is not within the scope of a motion to quash an attachment, but must be determined when the cas e comes up for trial on its merits. Henry Myers &amp; Co. v. Lewis, 121 Va. 50, 92 S.E. 988, 1917 Va. LEXIS 9 (1917). But actual existence of sufficient cause must be shown.  The question is whether, upon all the evidence, there was probable cause to believe the defendant was doing the act which would authorize the attachment, and not whether the facts as they appeared to the affiant, though only a small part perhaps of the facts of the case, afforded him reasonable grounds for such a belief. Claflin &amp; Co. v. Steenbock &amp; Co., 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 842, 1868 Va. LEXIS 39 (1868). And mere belief of plainti ff is insufficient.  The remedy is justified, not by the belief of the affiant, however honestly entertained upon reasonable grounds that the fact sworn to in the petition exists, but by the existence of that fact. Sublett v. Wood, 76 Va. 318, 1882 Va. LEXIS 35 (1882). Proceeding must be good on its face.  The remedy by attachment against the estate of a nonresident is wholly statutory, harsh in its operation towards the debtor and his creditors, and the proceeding must show on its face that the requirements of this section have been substantially complied with. McAllister v. Guggenheimer, 91 Va. 317, 21 S.E. 475, 1895 Va. LEXIS 28 (1895). The return must show that the attachment was levied on the property of the defendant in order to make it valid. Robertson v. Hoge, 83 Va. 124, 1 S.E. 667, 1887 Va. LEXIS 45 (1887); Offtendinger v. Ford, 86 Va. 917, 12 S.E. 1, 1890 Va. LEXIS 60 (1890). Burden of provin g sufficient cause is on plaintiff.  Upon a motion to abate an attachment, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the attachment was issued on sufficient cause, and he may therefore be required to introduce his evidence first.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. If defendant appears generally, court may enter personal judgment.  Under this section, where the defendant in attachment was properly before the court, the court undoubtedly had jurisdiction to enter a personal judgment against t he defendant, even though the attachment was dismissed. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Parrish, 150 Va. 473, 143 S.E. 750, 1928 Va. LEXIS 329 (1928). Jury may be impaneled to try issue.  It is not error for the trial court to impanel a jury in an attachment case to try the issue, as § 8.01-336 provides that where an issue of fact is joined on m otion, a jury may be impaneled, when in the opinion of the court it is proper. Jayne v. Kane, 140 Va. 27, 124 S.E. 247, 1924 Va. LEXIS 154 (1924). Failure to dismiss attachm ent held not error.  Where the principal defendant assigned as error the failure to dismiss the attachment because the executor of an estate who was indebted to, and had in his posses sion property belonging to the principal defendant, was made a party defendant before there had been an ascertainment of whether there were any prior liens on the principal defendants share of the estate, as there had been a general appearance by the principal defendant under this section, there was no issue before the Supreme Court with regard to the attachment.

CASE NOTES Attachment proceedings include both establishment of a lien on the property attached and execution of the lien through a judicial sale, after adjudication of the petitioners right thereto. Hence, the attachment proceeding in effect incorporates an action to foreclose on the lien that is created by the attachment. Eastern Indem. Co. v . J.D. Conti Elec. Co., 573 F. Supp. 1036, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12133 (E.D. Va. 1983). Plaintiff is entitled to per sonal judgment.  The attaching creditor, having established his debt, is entitled to a personal decree against the absent debtor though the whole property attached is exhausted in paying the debt of the home defendant. Williamson v. Gayle, 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 152, 1850 Va. LEXIS 27 (1850) (see also Hairston v. Medley, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 96 (1844); Schofield v. Cox, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 533 (1852). The cases cited above were decided und er prior law). Order of sale is not personal judgment .  An order in an attachment case which recites that it appears to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in a stated sum, and directs a sale of the attached effects, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay the sum so stated, is not a personal judgment against the defendant, but reaches only the goods attached.

Most of the cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions . This section was intended for the protection of the rights of third parties, and not of the plaintiff in the attachment. Littell v. Lansburg Furn. &amp; Carpet Co., 96 Va. 540, 32 S.E. 63, 1899 Va. LEXIS 98 (1899). It protects equitable as w ell as legal rights.  The evident purpose of this section was to protect the equitable as well as the legal rights and interests of third persons in the attachment proceedings, and tha t the lien of the attaching creditor should be subordinated to all such rights and interests as exist at the time the attachment is levied. Barnes v. American Fertilizer Co., 144 Va. 692, 130 S.E. 902, 1925 Va. LEXIS 228 (1925). Wife s interest in divorce settlement will be protected.  A decree in a divorce suit approving an agreement between the parties to transfer the husbands real estate to the wife and children, in the absence of fraud o r collusion, under this section vests the wife and children with an equitable interest which is superior to a subsequent attachment against the husband and which will be protected under this section. Barnes v. American Fertilizer Co., 144 Va. 692, 130 S. E. 902, 1925 Va. LEXIS 228 (1925). Plaintiff in attachment cannot unite with trustees in deed of trust.  A plaintiff in attachment, who has a deed of trust on the property attached, cannot unite with the trustees in the deed and come into the attachment suit by petit ion under this section and ask to have the attached property delivered to the trustees. Littell v. Lansburg Furn. &amp; Carpet Co., 96 Va. 540, 32 S.E. 63, 1899 Va. LEXIS 98 (1899). Proper issue.  Where a petitioner claims the attached property under this section, the proper issue to be tried is whether or not petitioner has any title to, lien on or int erest in the attached property or its proceeds. Starke v. Scott, 78 Va. 180, 1883 Va. LEXIS 26 (1883). Hearing by consent.  Where, in attachment against property of nonresident debtors, who had not been served with process personally or by publication, complainants consented to the hea ring of a motion by a claimant of the property to abate the attachment, a decree abating the attachment, and declaring the estate not to belong to the debtors, was not premature or erroneous.

Former Article 4, which consisted of one section, § 8-564, dealing with attachment for a claim not exceeding twenty dollars, has been deleted since such a clai m is de minimis and would not likely merit the attachment remedy. Former Article 5, dealing with the attachment of rent and consisting of §§ 8-566 through 8-568, has been deleted as rent is no longer to be accorded separat e treatment for attachment purposes. Former Article 6, comprised of §§ 8-569 through 8-577, dealing with capias ad respondendum, has been deleted as obsolete and unnecessary. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2A M.J.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Section limits rights of nonresident s.  Nonresidents labor under no disability with respect to the right to institute or prosecute suit at any time to assert or preserve any right of action they may hav e, and no such right is reserved to them by statute. On the contrary when proceeded against by order of publication, etc., their rights in this respect are restricted and limited by this section and § 8.01-322. Baber v. Baber, 121 Va. 740, 94 S.E. 209 , 1917 Va. LEXIS 72 (1917). Absent defendant m ay appear while suit is pending.  Under this section a defendant in a foreign attachment may appear at any time pending the suit, and have the cause reheard, tendering security for costs. Anderson v. Johnson, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 558, 1879 Va. LEXIS 87 (1879). After judgment, so le remedy is under this section.  An absent defendant, against whom a decree (now judgment) has been made, cannot appeal from the decree. His only remedy is that provided by this section. Platt v. Howland, 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 507, 1839 Va. LEXIS 55 (1839); Barbee &amp; Co. v. Pannill, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 442, 1849 Va. LEXIS 66 (1849). Effect on judgment upon filing pet ition.  Where nonresident defendants filed a petition in strict conformity with this section, and were never at any time prior to filing their petition served with proces s or a copy of the attachment, nor did they appear or make any defense, the judgment granted by the court against the defendants fixing a personal liability upon them lost that effect upon the filing of defendants petition, for this section allowed t hem to make defense against the judgment as if they had appeared in the case before the same was rendered. This could only mean that they were to be in no wise prejudiced by the judgment, but should occupy the same position as if no such judgment had bee n rendered. Wessel, Duval &amp; Co. v. Winborn &amp; Co., 125 Va. 502, 99 S.E. 719, 1919 Va. LEXIS 40 (1919). Service ou t of State does not affect right to rehearing.  Under this section, defendants in foreign attachment may appear pending the suit, tender security for costs and have it reheard. The exception of a defendant serv ed with a copy of the attachment, or with process in the suit, does not refer to a service thereof outside the proceedings in the suit or outside the State; such service can have no greater effect than an order of publication duly posted and published.

Referral of disputes to dispute resolution proceedings. Text While protecting the right to trial by jury, a court, on its own motion or on motion of one of the parties, may refer any contested civil matter, or selected issues in a civil matter, to an orientation session in order to encourage the early resolution of disputes through the use of procedures that facilitate (i) open communication between the parties about the issues in the dispute, (ii) full exploration of the range of options to resolve the dispute, (iii) improvement in the relationship between the parties, and (iv) control by the parties over the outcome of the dispute. The neutral or intake specialist conducting the orientation session shall provide information regarding dispute resolution options available to the parties, screen for factors that would make the case inappropriate for a dispute resolution proceeding, and assist the parties in determining whether their case is suitable for a dispute resolution pr ocess such as mediation. The court shall set a date for the parties to return to court in accordance with its regular docket and procedure, irrespective of the referral to an orientation session. The parties shall notify the court, in writing, if the dis pute is resolved prior to the return date.

Applicabilit y of federal law.  Though state law might in some cases be applied in a diversity action to determine whether a right to arbitrate exists, federal law will preempt state law if the contract underlying a potentially arbitrable dispute evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Maxum Founds., Inc. v. Salus Corp., 779 F.2d 974, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 25715 (4th Cir. 1985). Where owner confessed error on issue of whether arbitration agreement with contractor was mandatory and irrevocable, but nevertheless, the owner argued waiver on appeal, a proposition never decided by the trial court and never preserved for appellate review by an assignment of cross-error, judgment below was reversed and the case was rema nded with direction that the trial court stay the proceedings in the civil action to permit the controversy to be submitted to arbitration, according to the provisions of the contract and the provisions of this section. Maynard Constr. Co. v. Driver, 230 Va. 79, 334 S.E.2d 567, 1985 Va. LEXIS 253 (1985). The Commonwealth is not estopped to deny the validity of an ultra vires contract containing an arbitration clause because its agents executed the document nor is it estopped to deny the validity of the arbitrators award because its agents performed the contract by participating in the arbitration proceedings. An ultra vires contract is void ab initio  not voidable only, but wholly void, and of no legal effect, and no performance on either side can give the unlawful contract any validity, or be the foundation of any right of action upon it. When the contract is once declared ultra v ires, the fact that it is executed does not validate it, nor can it be ratified so as to make it the basis of suit or action, nor does the doctrine of estoppel apply. Richard L. Deal &amp; Assocs. v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 618, 299 S.E.2d 346, 1983 Va. LEXIS 169 (1983). Waiver.  A judgment creditor did not waive its rights by failing to intervene in arbitration, when the garnishee refused the judgment creditors request to be allowed t o participate; once the garnishee withheld consent, the judgment creditor was not obligated to seek intervention through the defaulting judgment debtor or to seek a court order allowing intervention; nothing in the garnishment statutes, or in the statute s dealing with arbitration, requires such action by a judgment creditor. Virginia Bldrs' Supply, Inc. v. Brooks &amp; Co., 250 Va. 209, 462 S.E.2d 85, 12 Va. Law Rep. 230, 1995 Va. LEXIS 98 (1995). B.Submission. The Commonwealth is not a person or party authorized by this section to enter into a written agreement to arbitrate which will be as binding as any other agreement. Richard L. Deal &amp; Assocs. v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 618, 299 S.E.2d 346, 1983 Va. LEXIS 169 (1983). The General Assembly did not intend to include the Commonwealth as a person or party within the contemplation of the arbitration statutes, and its agents have no authority to bind it to an arbitration agreement. Richard L. Deal &amp; Assocs. v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 618, 299 S.E.2d 346, 1983 Va. LEXIS 169 (1983). While the word person may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate as well as individuals, and the word may apply to counties and cities unde r certain circumstances, the sovereign is a person or party within the intendment of a statute only when the General Assembly names it expressly or by necessary implication. Nothing in the legislative history of the arbitration statutes supports the impl ication that the Commonwealth is a person or party within the meaning of this section. Richard L. Deal &amp; Assocs. v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 618, 299 S.E.2d 346, 1983 Va. LEXIS 169 (1983). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. A.General Consider ation. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Section enlarges common-law arbitration.  At common law two kinds of submission and award were known. The first was upon a submission in pais, or in the country, and was where, in the absence of any pendi ng suit, parties agreed to submit their then existing controversies to arbitration. The second was a submission made in a pending suit, in which case the award was returnable to the court, and was enforced by a rule after notice to show cause against it. There is in Virginia, by virtue of this section, an additional or statutory submission or award, which arises when parties to an actual controversy then existing agree to submit their differences to arbitration, with the provision that the award so made may be returned to and entered as a judgment of the court. Edge Hill Stock Farm, Inc. v. Morris, 155 Va. 103, 154 S.E. 473, 1930 Va. LEXIS 149 (1930) (see Glovier v. Dingus, 173 Va. 268, 4 S.E.2d 551 (1939); John W. Daniel &amp; Co. v. Janaf, Inc., 169 F. S upp. 219 (E.D. Va. 1958), affd, 262 F.2d 958 (4th Cir. 1959)). This section, wherever applicable, must be applied in light of the terms of the arbitration agreement sought to be enforced. Doyle &amp; Russell, Inc. v. Roanoke Hosp. Ass'n, 213 Va. 489, 193 S.E.2d 662, 1973 Va. LEXIS 172 (1973). This section may prohibit revocation of an arbitration agreement. Doyle &amp; Russell, Inc. v . Roanoke Hosp. Ass'n, 213 Va. 489, 193 S.E.2d 662, 1973 Va. LEXIS 172 (1973). A party cannot be compelled to submit to arbitration unless he has first agreed to arbitrate. Doyle &amp; Russell, Inc. v. Roanoke Hosp. Ass'n, 213 Va. 489, 193 S.E.2d 662, 1973 Va. LEXIS 172 (1973). By the same token, he cannot be compelled to arbitrate a question which, under his agreement, is not arbitrable. And the resisting party is entitled to a presubmission judicial determination of arbitrability. Doyle &amp; Russell, Inc. v. Roanoke Hosp. Ass'n, 213 Va. 489, 193 S.E.2d 662, 1973 Va. LEXIS 172 (1973). It is the province of the courts to determine the threshold question of arbitrability, g iven the terms of the contract between the parties. This is so because the extent of the duty to arbitrate, just as the initial duty to arbitrate at all, arises from contractual undertakings. Doyle &amp; Russell, Inc. v. Roanoke Hosp. Ass'n, 213 Va. 489, 193 S.E.2d 662, 1973 Va. LEXIS 172 (1973). Provision for arbitration in contract is no bar to action.  It cannot be doubted that a mere provision in a contract that all differences arising under it shall be submitted to arbitrators, thereafter to be chosen, will no t prevent a party from maintaining a suit in the first instance in a court to enforce his rights under the contract. Condon v. South Side R.R., 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 302, 1858 Va. LEXIS 48 (1858); Corbin v. Adams, 76 Va. 58, 1881 Va. LEXIS 73 (1881); Rison v. Moon, 91 Va. 384, 22 S.E. 165, 1895 Va. LEXIS 36 (1895). An agreement to arbitrate not consummated by an award is held to be no bar to a suit at law or equity; nor can it be the foundation of a decree for specific execu tion. Parties litigant cannot by such agreements oust the jurisdiction of the courts or deprive themselves of the right to resort to the legal tribunals for the settlement of their controversi...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-578"><akn:num>§ 8.01-578</akn:num><akn:heading>8</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>01-578 through 8.01-580.

(23 Gratt.) 160, 1873 Va. LEXIS 28 (1873) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Nonsignatories.  Timber companys motion to compel arbitration was granted because a nonsignatory to a timber sale agreement was ordered to arbitrate a dispute under the princi ple of de facto merger as the nonsignatory and a signatory to the agreement shared an identity of interests. However, a title company, which was the legal title holder of the land where the timber was located, was dismissed from the case because it was n ot a necessary party as only the equitable title holders of the land where the timber was located were subject to the provisions of the agreement. Augusta Lumber Co. v. Broad Run Holdings, LLC, 71 Va. Cir. 326, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 126 (Fairfax County Aug . 2, 2006). Stay pending appeal.  Since public policy favored arbitration, a stay pending appeal of the issue about whether arbitration could be compelled was proper, as the trial court could not say that the Virginia Supreme Court would look unfavorably on the argument that arbitration could be compelled, where the arbitration provision was incorporated into the sales agreement by reference, especially since if the Virginia Supreme Court found a rbitration could be compelled, much time and money would be wasted by the litigants who had already gone to trial.

CASE NOTES Applicability to trust. For purpose of Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-581.01, a trust was not an agreement that could be enforced against a beneficiary because the beneficiary was not a party to a written agreement. Because a trust was not a contract or an agreement, the Virginia Uniform Arbitration Act, Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-581.01 et seq., did not apply. Boyle v. Anderson, 301 Va. 52, 871 S.E.2d 226, 2022 Va. LEXIS 22 (2022). Duty to arbitrate and scope of arbitration determined by contract.  A party cannot be compelled to arbitrate a question that is not arbitrable under the agreement between the parties, and the extent of the duty to arbitrate, just as the initial duty to arbitrate at all, arises from contractual undertakings. Weitz v. Hudson, 262 Va. 224, 546 S.E.2d 732, 2001 Va. LEXIS 81 (2001). No mutual assent.  There was no binding arbitration agreement under § 8.01-581.01 in a personal injury case due to a lack of mutual assent; an insurance carrier did not intend to be bound since certain terms were not included, it did not agree to certain dates, and an injured partys attorney failed to return the signed documents; therefore, a trial court erred by ordering arbitration instead of a trial on the merits. Phillip s v. Mazyck, 273 Va. 630, 643 S.E.2d 172, 2007 Va. LEXIS 53 (2007). Standard o f review involving arbitration agreements.  Nowhere in the Uniform Arbitration Act, as adopted by Virginia, are courts required to review an arbitration agreement in a domestic relations context with more s crutiny than other disputes; the standard of review involving arbitration agreements in domestic relations should conform to the standard set forth in this section. Bandas v. Bandas, 16 Va. App. 427, 430 S.E.2d 706, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1369, 1993 Va. App. LEX IS 159 (1993). Failure to hold hearing held reversible error.  Circuit court erred in affirming the arbitrators award that resulted from an arbitration proceeding that did not comply with the provisions of the Virginia Un iform Arbitration Act, § 8.01-581.01 et seq., as said failure, absent an agreement by the parties to waive a hearing, was tantamount to no arbitration; because the arbitration award was vacated, the circuit court was authorized to order a hearing befo re the original arbitrators or their successors in accordance with § 8.01-581.03.Bates v. McQueen, 270 Va. 95, 613 S.E.2d 566, 2005 Va. LEXIS 60 (2005). Arbitration provision held mandatory .  In light of public policy and the plain language of the agreement between the parties, power company and corporation constructing a power plant, disputed arbitrat ion provision was held to provide for mandatory arbitration once arbitration was requested by either party. TM Delmarva Power, L.L.C. v. NCP of Va., L.L.C., 263 Va. 116, 557 S.E.2d 199, 2002 Va. LEXIS 14 (2002). No appeal from order compe lling arbitration.  Order that compelled arbitration of an employees claim against her employer pursuant to the Virginia Uniform Arbitration Act, § 8.01-581.01 et seq., was no t a final judgment order for purposes of appeal as contemplated by subdivision A 3 of § 8.01-670; pursuant to § 8.01-581.010, the trial court retained jurisdiction to vacate an arbitration award, and, pursuant to § 8.01-581.011, the trial court retained jurisdiction to modify or correct an arbitration award. Seguin v. Northrop Grumman Sys. Corp., 277 Va. 244, 672 S.E.2d 877, 2009 Va. LEXIS 30 (2009). No error in confirming arbitrati on award.  Circuit court did not err by refusing to vacate the portions of an arbitration award that upheld the forfeiture and appointment provisions of an operating agreeme nt because the purpose of Va. Sup. Ct. R. pt. 6, § II, R. 1.8(a) was satisfied; thus, an attorneys failure to obtain the signature of a holding company founders did not constitute a violation of any public policy, much less render the agreemen t void ab initio.

Moneys held pursua nt to this section shall be deemed public deposits as set forth in Chapter 44 (§ 2.2-4400 et seq.) of Title 2.2 and shall be invested in certificates of deposit or time deposits, and in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 45 (§ 2.2-4500 et se q.) of Title 2.2, as ordered by the court. Prior to or at the time of entry of any judgment, order or decree placing moneys under the control of the general receiver for the benefit of any specifically identified beneficiary, the general receiver shall f ile an affidavit with the court providing the beneficiarys name, date of birth, and social security number, as well as the proposed dates of final and periodic disbursements. Such affidavit shall be maintained under seal by the clerk unless otherwise ordered by the court, and the information therein shall be used solely for the purposes of financial management and reporting.

Cash or other money deposits in lieu of surety on any bond posted in the clerks office which is not posted in connection with any civil or criminal case, including bonds posted by executors or administrators.To this end, the general receiver is authorized to verify, receive, and give acquittances for all such moneys, as the court may direct. Any interest which accrues on the funds, minus allowable fees and bond costs, shall be cre dited and payable to the person or persons entitled to receive such funds.All moneys received under this section are subject to audit by the Auditor of Public Accounts.

Whenever th ere is due to any person, any sum of money from any source, not exceeding $50,000, the fund may be paid into the circuit court of the county or city in which the fund became due or such person resides. The court may, by an order entered of record, (i) pa y the fund to the person to whom it is due, if the person is considered by the court competent to expend and use the same in his behalf, or (ii) pay the fund to some other person who is considered competent to administer it, for the benefit of the person entitled to the fund, without the intervention of a fiduciary, whether the other person resides within or without this Commonwealth. The clerk of the court shall take a receipt from the person to whom the money is paid, which shall show the source from which it was derived, the amount, to whom it belongs, and when and to whom it was paid. The receipt shall be signed and acknowledged by the person receiving the money, and entered of record in the book in the clerks office in which the current fiduci ary accounts are entered and indexed. Upon the payment into court the person owing the money shall be discharged of such obligation. No bond shall be required of the party to whom the money is paid by the court. B. Whenever (i ) it appears to the court having control of a fund, tangible personal property or intangible personal property or supervision of its administration, whether a suit is pending therefor or not, that a person under a disability who has no fiduciary, is enti tled to a fund arising from the sale of lands for a division or otherwise, or a fund, tangible personal property or intangible personal property as distributee of any estate, or from any other source, (ii) a judgment, decree, or order for the payment of a sum of money or for delivery of tangible personal property or intangible personal property to a person under a disability who has no fiduciary is rendered by any court, and the amount to which such person is entitled or the value of the tangible person al property or intangible personal property is not more than $50,000, or (iii) a person under a disability is entitled to receive payments of income, tangible personal property or intangible personal property and the amount of the income payments is not more than $50,000 in any one year, or the value of the tangible personal property is not more than $50,000, or the current market value of the intangible personal property is not more than $50,000, the court may, without the intervention of a fiduciary, cause such fund, property or income to be paid or delivered to any person deemed by the court capable of properly handling it, to be used solely for the education, maintenance and support of the person under a disability. In any case in which an infant i s entitled to such fund, property or income, the court may, upon its being made to appear that the infant is of sufficient age and discretion to use the fund, property or income judiciously, cause the fund to be paid or delivered directly to the infant. C. Where judgm ent is taken in the general district court, upon motion of a party for good cause shown, the general district court judge may enter an order directing the clerk of the general district court to hold such funds in escrow for a period not to exceed 180 day s to enable such party to file a petition pursuant to § 8.01-600 requesting that such funds be received and held by the clerk of the circuit court upon payment of fees in accordance with § 17.1-275. The party petitioning the circuit court shall pro vide the clerk of the general district court a certified copy of any order entered by the circuit court directing that such funds held by the clerk of the general district court be transferred to the clerk of the circuit court. If no such order is receiv ed by the clerk of the general district court within the 180-day period, the clerk of the general district court shall give notice to the parties that such funds shall be disbursed to the plaintiff for which judgment was entered in the general district c ourt within 30 days after such notice. D. Whenever a person is entitled to a fund or such property distributable by a fiduciary settling his accounts before the commissioner of accounts of the court in which the fiduciary qualified, and the amount or value of the fund or property, or the value of any combi nation thereof, is not more than $50,000, the commissioner of accounts may approve distribution thereof in the same manner and to the extent of the authority herein conferred upon a court including exemption from filing further accounts where the value o f the fund being administered is less than $50,000. E. Whenever an incapacitated person or infant is entitled to a fund or such property distributable by a fiduciary settling accounts before the commissioner of accounts of the court in which the fiduciary qualified and the will or trust instrument under which the fiduc iary serves, authorizes the fiduciary to distribute the property or fund to the incapacitated person or infant without the intervention of a guardian, conservator or committee, and the amount or value of such fund or property, or the value of any combina tion thereof, is not more than $50,000, the commissioner of accounts may approve distribution thereof in the same manner and to the extent of the authority hereinabove conferred upon a court or judge thereof. F. Whenever a fiduciary is administering funds not exceeding $50,000, the circuit court of the county or city in which the fund is being administered by order entered of record may authorize the fiduciary, when considered competent to administer the funds, to continue to administer the funds for the benefit of the person entitled to the fund without the necessity of filing any further accounts, whether such person resides within or without this Commonwealth. The clerk of the court shall take a receipt from the fiduci ary, which shall show the amount of the fund remaining, to whom it belongs, and the date the court entered the order exempting the filing of further accounts. The receipt shall be signed and acknowledged by the fiduciary, and entered of record in the boo k in the clerks office in which the current fiduciary accounts are entered and indexed. No surety shall be required on the bond of a fiduciary granted an exemption from filing any further accounts. G. Whenever a fiduciary qualifies pursuant to § 64.2-454 for the sole purpose of prosecuting or defending an action, the court in which the fiduciary qualifies or the commissioner of accounts for such court may exempt the fiduciary from filing further accounts wher e the fiduciary is not administering any funds and has no power of sale over any real estate the decedent owned.

A commissioner shall not be compelled to make out or return a report until his fees therefor are paid or security given him to pay so much as may be adjudged appropriat e by the court to which the report is to be returned or by the judge thereof in vacation, unless the court finds cause to order it to be made out and returned without such payment or security.

I.Decisions Under Current Law. Weight of commissioners report.  While the report of a commissioner in chancery does not carry the weight of a jurys verdict, it should be sustained unless the trial court concludes that the commissioners findings are not supported by the evidence. This rule applies with particular force to a commissioners findings of fact based upon evidence taken in his presence, but is not applicable to pure conclusions of law contained in the rep ort. Jamison v. Jamison, 3 Va. App. 644, 352 S.E.2d 719, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1775, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 151 (1987). The trial court had the authority to overturn a commissioners decision, and the evidence indicated that the wife was only interested in a meal ticket, as she refused to move into the marital residence even after the husband paid her substantial sums of money. Ghods v. Musick, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 103 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 15, 2005). Where the commissioner in chancery recommended that a wifes grounds for divorce be granted because the husband had not met the burden of proving a credit card forgery allegation, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in hearing the forgery evidence for purposes of equitable distribution because (1) under subsection E of § 20-107.3, the trial court had the authority to examine evidence regarding the effect of the forgery allegations on the marital property and equitable distribution award, and (2) the commissioners scope of referral was limited to answering whether the grounds of divorce alleged in the pleadings were proven. Morrill v. Morrill, 45 Va. App. 709, 613 S.E.2d 821, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (2005). Appellate review where chancellor approves commissioners findings.  A commissioners findings of fact that have been accepted by the trial court are presumed to be correct when reviewed on appeal and are to be given great weigh t by the appellate court; the findings will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong. Gilman v. Gilman, 32 Va. App. 104, 526 S.E.2d 763, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 251 (2000). This section clearly gives the trial court substantial discretion in the manner in which it reviews the report of a commissioner; however, it does not allow the trial judge simply to ignore the report or portions thereof. Gulfstream Bldg. Ass'n v. Britt, 239 Va. 178, 387 S.E.2d 488, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1140, 1990 Va. LEXIS 18 (1990). The court erred in placing the burden upon the claimant to justify the commissioners report and in rejecting the commissioners factual findings where the chancellor made no finding that the commissioners report was unsupported by the evidence since the commissioners report came to the court armed with a presumption of correctness which the additional evidence heard in court did nothing to overcome. Morris v. United Va. Bank, 237 Va. 331, 377 S.E.2d 611, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1873, 1989 Va. LEXIS 38 (1989). Commissioners ability to see, hear and evaluate witnesses.  Although the report of a commissioner in chancery does not carry the weight of a jurys verdict, an appellate court must give due regard to the commissioner s ability, not shared by the chancellor, to see, hear and evaluate the witnesses at first hand. Gilman v. Gilman, 32 Va. App. 104, 526 S.E.2d 763, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 251 (2000). Report should be sustained where findings are supported by evidence.  While the report of a commissioner in chancery does not carry the weight of a jurys verdict, it should be sustained unless the trial court concludes that the commissioners findings are not supported by the evidence. This rule applies with particular force to a commissioners findings of fact based upon evidence taken in his presence, but is not applicable to pure conclusions of law contained in the rep ort. Hill v. Hill, 227 Va. 569, 318 S.E.2d 292, 1984 Va. LEXIS 227 (1984); Dodge v. Dodge, 2 Va. App. 238, 343 S.E.2d 363, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 264 (1986). Appellate review where chancellor disapproves commissioners findings.  On appeal, a decree which approves a commissioners report will be affirmed unless plainly wrong, but where the chancellor has disapproved the commissioner s findings, the Supreme Court must review the evidence and ascertain whether, under a correct application of the law, the evidence supports the findings of the commissioner or the conclusions of the trial court. Hill v. Hill, 227 Va. 569, 318 S.E.2d 292, 1984 Va. LEXIS 227 (1984). On appeal when the chancellor has disapproved the commissioners findings, the appellate court must review the evidence and ascertain whether, under a correct application of law, the evidence supports the findings of the commissioner or the conclusions of the trial court. Hodges v. Hodges, 2 Va. App. 508, 347 S.E.2d 134, 3 Va. Law Rep. 54, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (1986). Where the trial judge disagreed with the commissioner not upon the facts but upon the conclusions of law, the Court of Appeals must review the evidence and ascert ain whether, under the correct application of the law, the evidence supports the findings of the commissioner or the conclusions of the trial court. Jamison v. Jamison, 3 Va. App. 644, 352 S.E.2d 719, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1775, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 151 (1987). Where report of a commissioner in chancery recommended that a deed be set aside based upon the commissioners finding that clear and convincing evidence establ ished that the deed had been procured by fraud, where a final order overruling the report of the commissioner was entered, where the chancellors basis for disapproving the commissioners finding depended upon facts not in the record of thi s case, where even if evidence of mothers mental condition from the separate and unrelated hearing was a permissible subject of judicial notice, the chancellors opinion letter clearly indicated that she was not judicially declared incompetent  until more than eight months after the commissioners hearing, and where the evidence before the commissioner was entirely unrebutted, upon the record, the commissioners findings were supported by the evidence, and the supreme court reversed the judgment of the circuit court. Branham v. Branham, 254 Va. 320, 491 S.E.2d 715, 1997 Va. LEXIS 83 (1997). Trial court improperly modified chancery commissioners ruling in custody case where there was nothing in the record showing that it found insufficient evidence to support the commissioners recommendation for joint custody and payment by husband of $2500 attorneys fees. Jones v. Jones, 26 Va. App. 689, 496 S.E.2d 150, 1998 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 126 (1998). Chancellor abused his discretion in rejecting commissioner in chancerys recommendation that property be publicly marketed and instead ordering sale at public action, in the absence of any evidence that the parties interests would be promoted by this method of sale or that the parties were unable to agree on terms for listing the pro perty through a licensed real estate broker. Orgain v. Butler, 255 Va. 129, 496 S.E.2d 433, 1998 Va. LEXIS 3 (1998). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Commissioner appointed to assist, not replace court.  When a cause is referred to a commissioner in chancery, the chancellor does not delegate his judicial function to him. He is appointed for the purpose of assistin g the chancellor and not to supplant or replace him. It is the duty of the chancellor to weigh the evidence according to correct principles of law and arrive at his own conclusions. Hoffecker v. Hoffecker, 200 Va. 119, 104 S.E.2d 771, 1958 Va. LEXIS 167 (1958); Plattner v. Plattner, 202 Va. 263, 117 S.E.2d 128, 1960 Va. LEXIS 216 (1960); Kullgren v. Sletter, 202 Va. 507, 118 S.E.2d 514, 1961 Va. LEXIS 135 (1961); Higgins v. Higgins, 205 Va. 324, 136 S.E.2d 793, 1964 Va. LEXIS 184 (1964). Report entit led to respect.  While the report of a commissioner does not have the weight given to the verdict of a jury on conflicting evidence, it is entitled to respect, if his judgment is supported by the testimony, and unless it is clear that he has erred. Parksley Nat'l Bank v. Parks, 172 Va. 169, 200 S.E. 629, 1939 Va. LEXIS 228 (1939). Report has great weight when evidence taken in his presence.  The report of a commissioner, when the evidence has been taken in his presence, is entitled to great weight, and should not be disturbed unless its conclusions ar e clearly unsupported by the evidence, and such report on the value of property, based upon conflicting testimony, and sustained by the trial court, will not be overruled on appeal. Ingram v. Ingram, 130 Va. 329, 107 S.E. 653, 1921 Va. LEXIS 158 (1921) ( see Kraker v. Shields, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 377 (1871); Bowers v. Bowers, 70 Va.

CASE NOTES The purpose of this provision is to prevent vexatious delays and to facilitate the placi ng and decision of chancery causes. Hughes v. Harvey, 75 Va. 200, 1881 Va. LEXIS 5 (1881) (decided under prior law). Report o f commissioner in chancery prima facie correct.  Except as to error which appears on the face of the report of the commissioner or on the face of the decree of the trial court, a report of a commissioner in chan cery is prima facie correct. Dodge v. Dodge, 2 Va. App. 238, 343 S.E.2d 363, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 264 (1986). The trial courts decree is presumed correct; however, where the evidence is heard by a commissioner and not ore tenus by the trial court, the decree is not given the same weight as a jury verdict. If such decrees are supported by substantial, competent and credible evidence in depositions, they will not be overturned on appeal. Dodge v. Dodge, 2 Va. App. 238, 343 S.E.2d 363, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 264 (1986). Failure to timely object.  Chancellor did not abuse his discretion by refusing to consider a wifes objection to a commissioners report stating that as wife had not requested an orde r of permanent spousal support before the commissioner, so none should issue, because wife did not file an exception to the commissioners report within the time allowed by the trial court. Heath v. Heath, 38 Va. App. 727, 568 S.E.2d 408, 2002 Va. App . LEXIS 493 (2002). As a wife filed no pleadings nor timely exceptions to the commissioners report, she made no cognizable claim for spousal support or equitable distribution, an d the trial court thus erred in reserving these issues on her oral motion. Bowden v. Bowden, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 546 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 28, 2003). Notice.  Where wife was provided with five days notice of the date of the hearing on the exceptions the wife filed in the trial court to the commissioners report i n the wifes divorce case, she had reasonable notice of the exceptions hearing; the wifes counsel, thus, could not argue that the wife was given inadequate notice of the hearing that the wife and the wifes counsel did not attend as they had ch osen to ignore communications from the husbands counsel and the trial court, and the wifes counsel did not file any motion to continue the hearing even though they were aware of it. Wilson v. Wilson, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 234 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 16, 2002). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Failure to timely object.  Even though both parties objections were filed after § 8.01-615s 10-day file period for objections, the court decided the case on the merits for good c ause shown as neither party objected to the court deciding the exceptions on the merits.

The court may at any time appoint any of its other commissioners in chancery to perform the duties herein required in any case in which the regular commissioner in chan cery appointed hereunder is himself the special receiver or special commissioner whose accounts are to be settled.

CASE NOTES This section gives the judge jurisdiction only to award the injunction, not to hear and determine the cause. Randolph v. Tucker, 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 655, 1840 Va. LEXIS 11 (1840) (decided under prior law). Ripeness required.  Where a suit attempted to mount a collateral attack on state court judgments, which the federal district court lacked jurisdiction to hear, and, further, assumed that the Virginia courts would not follow the Constitution, an assumption that raised issues not yet ripe for decision, such claims would be dismissed for lack of subject matter and supplemental jurisdiction, respectively. Jordahl v. Democratic Party, 94 7 F. Supp. 236, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16956 (W.D. Va. 1996), aff'd, 122 F.3d 192, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 19245 (4th Cir. 1997). Claims in fe deral district court properly dismissed.  Claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for alleged injuries caused by state court injunctions enjoining plaintiffs from distributing voters guides were properly dismiss ed by the federal district court under the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which prohibits United States district courts from sitting in direct review of state court decisions, except for habeas corpus actions. Jordahl v. Democratic Party, 122 F.3d 192, 1997 U. S. App. LEXIS 19245 (4th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1077, 118 S. Ct. 856, 139 L. Ed. 2d 756, 1998 U.S. LEXIS 508 (1998). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Irreparable harm.  Where any potential injury that a police officer might suffer pending reinstatement could be compensated by monetary damages, the officer did not show that the of ficer would suffer irreparable harm without a preliminary injunction. Villalobos v. City of Norfolk, 62 Va. Cir. 158, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 297 (Norfolk June 13, 2003). Injunction granted where irreparable harm and success on the merits likely.  Defendants were enjoined from operating the machine where the court found a likelihood of irreparable harm to plaintiff as, inter alia, the machine would deprecia te quickly while used in the manufacturing process of defendants and plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits as the documents indicated that the appropriate financing statements were filed to secure the lien of plaintiff to the machine. Hardinge, I nc. v. Buhler, 72 Va. Cir. 39, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 190 (Amherst County May 30, 2006). Committee of a political party was entitled  due to the COVID-19 health crisis  to a temporary injunction enjoining the Virginia Department of Elections a nd the Virginia State Board of Elections from enforcing statutory provisions against the committee so that the political party could then select its candidate for a Congressional district because the committee was likely to prevail on the merits and the harm of the partys candidate not appearing on the general election ballot was irreparable. Seventh Cong. Dist. Republican Comm. v. Va. Dep't of Elections, 105 Va. Cir. 61, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 56 (Richmond Apr. 14, 2020). Injunctive relief denied.  State senators motion for a temporary injunction under § 8.01-620 et seq. to enjoin the lieutenant governor from casting any tie-breaking vote was denied b ecause the senator was unlikely to be unsuccessful on the merits of his declaratory judgment action due to separation of powers under Va. Const. art. III, § 1; the circuit court cannot intervene in the normal operating procedures of the senate and enj oin one of the highest officials of the Commonwealth from performing his or her constitutional duties, and the power of an injunction or a declaratory judgment action cannot be used to force parties in disagreement to negotiate a compromise. McEachin v. Bolling, 84 Va. Cir. 76, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 189 (Richmond Dec. 16, 2011). Buyer did not state any special basis for an injunction; one contract provisions purpose was to allow the prevailing non-defaulting party and the brokers to r ecover in an action under the contract, in addition to fees and damages, but the provision did not provide for injunctions like the claim made, and the buyer failed, for purposes of § 8.01-620 et seq., to allege irreparable injury and lack of an adequ ate remedy, among other things, and the adequate remedies at law asserted in other counts disqualified injunctive relief. Langmaid v. Lee V, 86 Va. Cir. 118, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1 (Northumberland County Jan. 9, 2013). Doctor was not entitled to a temporary injunction under §§ 8.01-620 and 8.01-628 to enjoin his employer from enforcing a restrictive covenant in the parties  employment agreement until the enforceability and applicability of said covenant was determined because the doctor could not establish the likelihood of success on the merits where, while he might ultimately prevail on the issue of the enforceabilit y of the non-compete clause at a hearing on the permanent injunction, the issue was presently in equipoise as between the parties. Fame v. Allergy &amp; Immunology, PLC, 91 Va. Cir. 66, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 107 (Roanoke July 28, 2015). Circuit court could not find that the employer was likely to succeed on the Virginia Uniform Trade Secret Act claim where the status of the customer and pricing i nformation needed to be examined in light of the facts of the instant case. SanAir Techs. Lab., Inc. v. Burrington, 91 Va. Cir. 206, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 192 (Chesterfield County Sept. 25, 2015). Former employers motion for a temporary injunction was denied where the covenant not to compete was subject to interpretation and needed to be examined in lig ht of the facts of the instant case, and in light of the facts already presented the court could not find that the employer was likely to succeed on the merits of a breach of contract claim. SanAir Techs. Lab., Inc. v. Burrington, 91 Va. Cir. 206, 2015 V a. Cir. LEXIS 192 (Chesterfield County Sept. 25, 2015). Request for injunctive relief was denied as the treasurer failed to allege irreparable harm caused by the city council and city officials and failed to demonstrat e that no adequate remedy at law was available. Pritchett v. City of Petersburg City Council, 103 Va. Cir. 270, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 623 (Petersburg Oct. 22, 2019). Ripeness required.  State senators motion for a temporary injunction under § 8.01-620 et seq. to enjoin the lieutenant governor from casting any tie-breaking vote was denied b ecause the senator was unlikely to be unsuccessful on the merits of his declaratory judgment action due to ripeness; no action had been taken by the lieutenant governor or the General Assembly, there was no showing of irreparable harm, both sides could p otentially be injured, and the public interest would not be served by having a deadlocked Senate that was unable to agree on organization. McEachin v. Bolling, 84 Va. Cir. 76, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 189 (Richmond Dec. 16, 2011). Injunctive relief granted.  Circuit court granted injunctive relief sought by a landowner against his neighbor, where the neighbor intentionally built a garage, with knowledge of the landown ers objection, in violation of a restrictive covenant, despite the fact that he had adequate space on his property to conform to the covenants space limitations as to where said building could have been built. Wallace v. Hoggard, 66 Va. Cir. 369, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1 (Portsmouth Jan. 21, 2005). Buyer of grapes, under a grape purchase agreement, was entitled to a temporary injunction requiring that the seller deliver grapes to the buyer who would maintain them pending the outcome of the case on the merits because the buyer did not have an adequate remedy at law and the balance of equities tipped in the buyers favor. Ducard Vineyards, Inc. v. Lazy Creek Vineyards &amp; Winery, 99 Va. Cir. 449, 2018 Va. Ci r. LEXIS 133 (Madison County Aug. 12, 2018). Parents of gifted public school students were entitled to an injunction against a school board because they sufficiently alleged that they and their child were im mediately or imminently affected by a school board decision to remove standardized testing as a prerequisite for admission to a Governors School since Governors Schools were, by definition, programs developed solely for gifted students, the elimi nation of the standardized tests, and the failure to replace those tests with other equivalent testing, allowed a cause of action for invoking judicial review since such actions might, in addition to violating promulgated regulations, violate the statuto ry prohibition against adopting policies in contravention of promulgated regulations. KC v. Fairfax Cty. Sch. Bd., 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 13 (Fairfax County Jan. 21, 2021). Demurrer was overruled.  Citys cross-bill stated three causes of action and plaintiffs demurrer was overruled where the City sought the following relief: (1) a determination that Alexandria, Va., Ordinance No. 4328 ap...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-621"><akn:num>§ 8.01-621</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1987, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>567.

For related discussion, see 10A M.J. Injunctions, § 61. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Bank account.  When the executor of the decedents estate alleged that a relative of the decedent became co-owner and payable on death beneficiary of the decedents checki ng account at a bank through undue influence shortly before the decedents death the issuance of a temporary injunction was appropriate because the executor was likely to succeed on the merits, the executor would have suffered irreparable injury in th e absence of injunctive relief, the balance of equities tipped in the executors favor, and injunctive relief was in the public interest. Fontaine v. Watson, 106 Va. Cir. 430, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 496 (Henry County Dec. 23, 2020). § 8.01-622.1. Injunction against assisted suicide; damages; professional sanctions. Text A. Any person who knowingly and intentionally, with the purpose of assisting another person to commit or attempt to commit suicide, (i) provides the physical means by which another person commits or attempts to commit suicide or (ii) participates in a physical act by which another person commits or attempts to commit suicide shall be liable for damages as provided in this section and may be enjoined from such acts. B. A cause of action for injunctive relief against any person who is reasonably expected to assist or attempt to assist a suicide may be maintained by any person who is the spouse, parent, child, sibling or guardian of, or a current or former licensed health care prov ider of, the person who would commit suicide; by an attorney for the Commonwealth with appropriate jurisdiction; or by the Attorney General. The injunction shall prevent the person from assisting any suicide in the Commonwealth. C. A spouse, p arent, child or sibling of a person who commits or attempts to commit suicide may recover compensatory and punitive damages in a civil action from any person who provided the physical means for the suicide or attempted suicide or who participated in a ph ysical act by which the other person committed or attempted to commit suicide. D. A licensed health care provider who assists or attempts to assist a suicide shall be considered to have engaged in unprofessional conduct for which his certificate or license to provide health care services in the Commonwealth shall be suspended or revoked by the l icensing authority. E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or conflict with § 54.1-2971.01 or the Health Care Decisions Act (§ 54.1-2981 et seq.). This section shall not apply to a licensed health care provider who (i) administers, prescribes or dispenses medication s or procedures to relieve another persons pain or discomfort and without intent to cause death, even if the medication or procedure may hasten or increase the risk of death, or (ii) withholds or withdraws life-prolonging procedures as defined in § 54.1-2982. This section shall not apply to any person who properly administers a legally prescribed medication without intent to cause death, even if the medication may hasten or increase the risk of death. F. For purpose s of this section:Licensed health care provider means a physician, surgeon, podiatrist, osteopath , osteopathic physician and surgeon, physician assistant, nurse, dentist or pharmacist licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth.Suicide  means the act or instance of taking ones own life voluntarily and intentionally.

Injunction against disclosure of criminal investigative file materials under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Text Except with respect to the disclosure of records under clause (iv) of subsection D or clause (v) (a) of subsection D of § 2.2-3706.1, an injunction may be awarded to prevent the disclosure of records related to criminal investigative files requested under § 2.2-3706.1 of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.). In making its determination, a court shall consider the following and shall enter its findings on the record: 1. Wheth er disclosure of the public records would constitute an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy; 2. Whether disclosure of the public records would endanger the life or physical safety of any individual; 3. Whether disclosure of the public records would subject (i) the victim; (ii) the victims immediate family members as set forth in § 2.2-3706.1, if the victim is deceased and the immediate family member is not a person of interest or a suspect in the criminal investigation or proceeding; or (iii) the parent or guardian of the victim, if the victim is a minor and the parent or guardian is not a person of interest or a suspect in t he criminal investigation or proceeding, to severe mental or emotional distress; and 4.

Bill in equity.  Circuit court erred in finding that a bill of review was inappropriate where a church sought to challenge a citys action to sell the churchs property to c ollect delinquent real estate taxes. The citys action was brought by a bill in equity, so the circuit court erred in holding that the underlying action was a matter at law. Emmanuel Worship Ctr. v. City of Petersburg, 300 Va. 393, 867 S.E.2d 291, 202 2 Va. LEXIS 1 (2022). A bill of review is limited in scope and is rarely utilized in Virginia procedure. Inde ed, in modern appellate practice wherein most litigants have a statutory right to appeal from judgments of trial courts, use of a bill of review is discouraged. Nonetheless, it remains an available procedural device until abolished by the General Assemb ly. Blunt v. Lentz, 241 Va. 547, 404 S.E.2d 62, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2413, 1991 Va. LEXIS 62 (1991). Trial court was required to examine both record and decree.  Where bill of review identified, with the requisite degree of accuracy and definiteness, errors of law which allegedly were in the record and in the decree, the t rial court was required to examine both the record and the decree to determine whether errors of law existed. By limiting its examination to whether errors of law existed upon face of the decree, the trial court erred because it failed to examine both th e decree and the record. Blunt v. Lentz, 241 Va. 547, 404 S.E.2d 62, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2413, 1991 Va. LEXIS 62 (1991). Mental capacity.  Husband failed to show by clear and convincing evidence under § 8.01-623 that a property settlement agreement was invalid based on his lack of mental capacity because the conclusions of his neurologist that the husband had short-term memory problems did not compel a conclusion that he did not comprehend the nature and character of the agreement and the consequences of executing the agreement. Coloccia v. Coloc cia, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 6, 2007). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms the statute and this section, as used below, refer to f ormer provisions. Bill of revi ew defined.  A bill of review is a bill filed to reverse or modify a decree that has been signed and enrolled for error in law apparent upon the face of such decree or on acco unt of new facts discovered since publication was passed in the original cause, and which could not by the exercise of due diligence have been discovered or used before the decree was made. Phipps v. Wise Hotel Co., 116 Va. 739, 82 S.E. 681, 1913 Va. LEX IS 1 (1913). The office of a bill of review is to have the trial court reexamine a previous final dec ree in the cause and to accomplish a reversal, modification or nullification of the decree. Rice v. Standard Prods. Co., 199 Va. 380, 99 S.E.2d 529, 1957 Va. LEXIS 201 (1957). Courts are reluctant to reverse decrees on such bills.  Unless parties can be placed in status quo, courts are properly reluctant to reverse decrees on bill of review unless the errors complained of are clear and have been specifically excepted to and pointed out in the original proceedings. Powers v. Howard, 131 Va. 275, 108 S.E. 687, 1921 Va. LEXIS 22 (1921). A bill of review lies only to a final decree. Roanoke Nat'l Bank v. Farmers' Nat'l Bank, 84 Va. 603, 5 S.E. 682, 1888 Va. LEXIS 115 (1888); Diffendal v. Virginia Midland R.R., 86 Va. 459, 10 S.E. 536, 1890 Va. LEXIS 4 (1890); Epes v. Williams, 89 Va. 794, 17 S.E. 235, 1893 Va. LEXIS 106 (1893); Diamond State Iron Co. v.

What is a final decree .  A decree which disposes of the whole subject and gives all the relief that was contemplated, so that nothing remains to be done in the cause, is a final decree. V anmeter v. Vanmeter, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 148, 1846 Va. LEXIS 38 (1846); Jones v. Turner, 81 Va. 709, 1886 Va. LEXIS 134 (1886); Parker v. Logan Bros. &amp; Co., 82 Va. 376, 4 S.E. 613, 1886 Va. LEXIS 46 (1886); Yates v. Wilson, 86 Va. 625, 10 S.E. 976, 1890 Va . LEXIS 22 (1890). Exception when there is clerical error in consent decree.  A decree or order made by consent of the counsel for the parties cannot be set aside by bill of review, unless by clerical error something was inserted in the ord er to which the party had not consented, in which case a bill of review might lie. Prince v. McLemore, 108 Va. 269, 61 S.E. 802, 1908 Va. LEXIS 31 (1908). A bill of review must be filed within the time prescribed by this section and the limita tion there prescribed is not subject to any exceptions not contained in the statute. No inherent equity can create an exception where the statute makes none, and a mere want of knowledge of a creditor is insufficient to suspend the operation of the statu te. Matthews &amp; Co. v. Progress Distilling Co., 108 Va. 777, 62 S.E. 924, 1908 Va. LEXIS 96 (1908); Searles v. Gordon, 156 Va. 289, 157 S.E. 759, 1931 Va. LEXIS 192 (1931). It is not necessary to plead the statutory limitations against a bill of review. It ough t to appear in the bill itself that it is exhibited within the time prescribed by law, or that the complainant is protected by some of the savings in the statute. Otherwise it ought not to be received. And if the fact alleged to prevent the operation of the decree be not true, it may be denied by the answer of the other party. On the proofs, if it is shown not to be true, the bill of review should be rejected. Shepherd v. Larue, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 529, 1820 Va. LEXIS 49 (1820). Who may file.  A bill of review can only be filed by a person who was a party or privy to the former suit. Even persons having an interest in the cause, if not aggrieved by the particular errors assigned in the decree, cannot maintain a bill of review, however injuriously the decree may affect the rights of third parties. Armstead v. Bailey, 83 Va. 242, 2 S.E. 38, 1887 Va. LEXIS 58 (1887); Heermans v. Montague, 20 S.E. 899, 189 0 Va. LEXIS 120 (Va. 1890); Gibson v. Green, 89 Va. 524, 16 S.E. 661, 1893 Va. LEXIS 68 (1893). A bill of review does not lie for assignees. Armstead v. Bailey, 83 Va. 242, 2 S.E. 38, 1 887 Va. LEXIS 58 (1887); Gibson v. Green, 89 Va. 524, 16 S.E. 661, 1893 Va. LEXIS 68 (1893). On a bill of review by an infant, the infant is entitled to show any good cause existing , at date of rendition, against the original decree against him. Pracht &amp; Co. v.

This section extends the time in which infants may file a bill of review, but it does not authorize them to attack decrees as a general rule upon any grounds exce pt those which would be available to other parties. Powers v. Howard, 131 Va. 275, 108 S.E. 687, 1921 Va. LEXIS 22 (1921). Grounds for review in general.  In Virginia, as elsewhere, the general rule is that a final decree cannot be reheard except upon two grounds: (1) error apparent on the face of the record, or (2) after-discovered evidence. Gills v. Gills, 126 Va. 526, 101 S.E. 900, 1920 Va. LEXIS 7 (1920). Only two grounds are available for a bill of review, viz.: (1) for error of law apparent on the face of the record, or (2) newly discovered evidence. Rice v. Stan dard Prods. Co., 199 Va. 380, 99 S.E.2d 529, 1957 Va. LEXIS 201 (1957). Error apparent on record as ground.  Error apparent upon the face of the record is not restricted to error in the decree. To determine on bill of review whether or not error of law exists, the court will examine the bill and answer filed in the cause, all orders and decrees made and entered therein, and all other proceedings, to ascertain whether upon the whole case error of law has been committed. Hancock v. Hutcherson, 76 Va. 609, 1882 Va. LEXIS 6 3 (1882); Pracht &amp; Co. v. Lange, 81 Va. 711, 1886 Va. LEXIS 135 (1886); Valz v. Coiner, 110 Va. 467, 66 S.E. 730, 1909 Va.

If error of law be apparent from an inspection of the record in the cause, and a final decree has been entered, a proper case for a bill of review is presented. P owers v.

CASE NOTES Dissolution by circuit court judge when issued by appellate justice.  While an injunction awarded by one of the judges (now justices) of the Supreme Court, after due hearing upon notice, will not be precipitately dissolved under the authority granted by this section, the circuit court, or the judge thereof in vacation, after reasonable notice, has the unquestioned power to dissolve an injunction granted by one of the judges (now justices) of the Supreme Court, who acts, not in an a ppellate capacity, but as a judge of another court of coordinate jurisdiction.

I.Decisions Under Current Law. Editors note.  The case notes under this section predating amendments by Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 489, effective January 1, 2022, should be reviewed carefully in light of thos e changes. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms this statute and this section, as used below, refer to former provisions. Applicability.  Appellate court had subject-matter jurisdiction because petitioners were seeking review of an order of a circuit court that refused an injunction; while the parti es disputed whether an injunction was an available remedy that question went to the merits of the relief petitioners sought, not whether the appellate court had appellate jurisdiction to consider the question. NAACP (Hanover Cnty. Chapter) v. Commonweal th ex rel. Va. State Water Control Bd., 74 Va. App. 702, 871 S.E.2d 662, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 116 (2022). Section not substitute for appeal under § 8.01-670.  The summary procedure for review of orders regarding injunctions under this section may not be employed as a substitute for an appeal under § 8.01-670 when a f inal judgment within the meaning of § 8.01-670 has been entered in the circuit court. Omega Corp. v. Cobb, 222 Va. 875, 292 S.E.2d 44, 1981 Va. LEXIS 386 (1981). Transfer of appeal.  Court of Appeals of Virginia had jurisdiction to review the punishment resulting from a finding of contempt by violation of an order of injunction, pursuant to § 8.01-626. Chakri, LLC v. STD, Inc., 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 235 (Va. Ct. App. May 13, 2008). Peti tion for review untimely. To the extent that a pendente lite order awarding exclusive use and possession of the former martial residence to the wife could be construed as an injunction, th e court lacked jurisdiction to address the issue because the husband failed to comply with Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-626, which required that a party seek review within 15 days of the trial courts order. Summers v. Summers, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 537 (V a. Ct. App. Oct. 25, 2022). Pe tition for review dismissed.  Wifes petition for review of a temporary injunction granted to a husband was dismissed because the husband had not yet posted a required bond, nor had the tri al court determined the appropriate bond amount, so the injunction was not yet effective, and the wife was not yet an aggrieved party. Guan v. Ran, 70 Va. App. 153, 825 S.E.2d 306, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 75 (2019). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Original jurisdiction only when injunction refused by lower court.  This statute confers no original jurisdiction upon one of the judges (now justices) of the Supreme Court to award an injunction, except in the case where the appl ication has been made, first to a judge of an inferior court and has been refused. Mayo v. Haines, 16 Va. (2 Munf) 423, 1811 Va. LEXIS 86 (1811); Gilliam v. Allen, 22 Va. (1 Rand.) 414, 1823 Va. LEXIS 22 (1823); Randolph v. Randolph, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 194 , 1828 Va.

CASE NOTES Federal standard compared.  There is no great difference between federal and Virginia standards for preliminary injunctions. Both draw upon the same equitable principles. Capital Tool &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Maschinenfabrik Herkules, 837 F.2d 171, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 434 (4th Cir. 1988). Affidavit held sufficient.  The affidavit of the president of a corporation that the allegations of the bill of which he has knowledge are true, and that he believes that all other matters s tated therein are true, is a sufficient compliance with this section. Southern Ry. v. Washington, A. &amp; M.V. Ry., 102 Va. 483, 46 S.E. 784, 1904 Va. LEXIS 95 (1904) (decided under prior law). Er ror for perpetual injunction to be granted on affidavits.  It is sometimes necessary, from force of circumstances, for preliminary applications for injunctions to be heard upon affidavits only, but the general rule is tha t, where a case made on a bill for injunction is heard upon the merits, the hearing should be had on depositions regularly taken. It is error for the issues in an injunction suit to be heard and determined upon affidavits and a perpetual injunction grant ed thereon. Virginian Ry. v. Echols, 117 Va. 182, 83 S.E. 1082, 1915 Va. LEXIS 22 (1915) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Likelihood of success.  Doctor was not entitled to a temporary injunction under §§ 8.01-620 and 8.01-628 to enjoin his employer from enforcing a restrictive covenant in the parties  employment agreement until the enforceability and applicability of said covenant was determined because the doctor could not establish the likelihood of success on the merits where, while he might ultimately prevail on the issue of the enforceabilit y of the non-compete clause at a hearing on the permanent injunction, the issue was presently in equipoise as between the parties. Fame v. Allergy &amp; Immunology, PLC, 91 Va. Cir. 66, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 107 (Roanoke July 28, 2015). Winery was not entitled to a temporary injunction from enforcement of an executive order requiring face coverings to be worn by individuals in certain settings, b ecause the Governor of Virginia and the Virginia State Health Commissioner validly enacted the order to limit the spread of COVID-19 and expressly waived the application of the criminal prohibition on the wearing of a mask to conceal ones identity. T he winery could not demonstrate a likely success as to the merits, irreparable harm, the balance of equities, and the public interest. Strother v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 233, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 106 (Fauquier County June 29, 2020). Plaintiff was granted a preliminary injunction given that, in part, plaintiff was likely to prevail in its arbitration claim against defendant, as defendants two submissions to the zoning department were attempts to amend, modify, or interpret proffers and breached the parties proffer and cooperation agreement. Comstock Loudoun Station v. Au Loudoun Station, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 672 (Loudoun County Sept. 1 8, 2020). Motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the city council from enforcing revocation of petitioners conditional use permit that allowed its establis hment to, inter alia, operate as a nightclub until the trial on its Petition for Appeal was denied because petitioner failed to establish that it was likely to succeed on the merits of its claims that the city council violated Virginia law or that its pr ocedural due process, substantive due process, or equal protection rights had been violated. Legacy Invs., LLC v. Norfolk City Council, 2022 Va. Cir. LEXIS 189 (Norfolk Oct. 20, 2022). Balance of equities.  For purposes of a request for a temporary injunction enjoining enforcement of executive and public health orders, a restaurant and its president failed to show th at the balance of equities tipped in their favor given the urgent need to protect public health and safety from COVID-19. Dillon v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 402, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 105 (Norfolk July 30, 2020), writ denied, No. CL20-3812, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXI S 109 (Virginia Beach July 30, 2020), dismissed, 108 Va. Cir. 367, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 169 (Norfolk Aug. 13, 2021). Plaintiff was granted a preliminary injunction; it was irrelevant what losses defendant might suffer by an injunction that required it to do what the parties agre ed to do in their agreement, and the added time of two months to defendants zoning application if paused did not represent an appreciable burden on defendant. Comstock Loudoun Station v. Au Loudoun Station, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 672 (Loudoun County Sep t. 18, 2020). Adequate remedy at law.  Citizens met the element of lacking an adequate remedy at law for a temporary injunction concerning an executive order because it was extremely difficult, if not impossible, to calculate the monetary damages that would ensue from a loss of first amendment rights; the ability to worship as one chose was sacrosanct in the United States of America, and any restriction on that right potentially caused irreparable har m. Young v. Northam, 107 Va. Cir. 281, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 35 (Culpeper County Feb. 27, 2021). Public interest.  For purposes of a request for a temporary injunction enjoining enforcement of executive and public health orders, a restaurant and its president failed to show th at the requested relief was in the public interest given that the orders were based on the substantial public health risk posed by the unmitigated spread of COVID-19. Dillon v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 402, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 105 (Norfolk July 30, 2020), w rit denied, No. CL20-3812, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 109 (Virginia Beach July 30, 2020), dismissed, 108 Va. Cir. 367, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 169 (Norfolk Aug. 13, 2021). Plaintiff was granted a preliminary injunction; the injunction was not excising public comment from the zoning process, but rather pausing defendants pursuit of the process. This would not stop defendant from continuing to develop its portion of property, but would require it to continue to do so pursuant to the parties agreement. The court did not find that plaintiff committed a first material breach of the parties agreement. Comstock Loudoun Station v. Au Loudoun Station, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 672 (Loudoun County Sept. 18, 2020). Citizens satisfied the public interest element of the four-part test for a temporary injunction concerning an executive order because there was no evidence that a ny activity at specific churches, including, without limitation, physical distancing and gathering had or would result in an increase of the spread of Covid-19; the protection of constitutional rights is always in the public interest, and conversely, the protection of the public health and safety is also of great concern. Young v. Northam, 107 Va. Cir. 281, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 35 (Culpeper County Feb. 27, 2021). Irreparable injury.  Restaurant and its president had not shown irreparable injury without a temporary injunction enjoining enforcement of executive and public health orders as they d id no more that make a general averment that they would incur difficult-to-calculate damages because their expenses changed annually. Moreover, neither the risk of criminal prosecution if they failed to comply with a mask mandate, their inchoate apprehen sion related to the temporal uncertainty, nor the risk of business closings constituted an irreparable injury. Dillon v. Northam, 105 Va. Cir. 402, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 105 (Norfolk July 30, 2020), writ denied, No. CL20-3812, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 109 (Virg inia Beach July 30, 2020), dismissed, 108 Va. Cir. 367, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 169 (Norfolk Aug. 13, 2021). Plaintiff was granted a preliminary injunction given that, in part, plaintiff was likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction; maintaining the status quo during the parties arbitration process would prevent a scenario where plaintiff could be left with a paper victory while defendant effectively was required by the county to develop its parcel pursuant to the zoning amendments. Comstock Loudoun Station v. Au Loudoun Station, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 672 (Loudoun County Sept. 18, 2020). Good cause not shown.  Where a historic association would not be harmed by an amended zoning ordinance and a preliminary injunction would defeat or diminish the property owners inte rests, the association did not show good cause for relief under § 8.01-628. Danville Historic Neighborhood Ass'n v. City of Danville, 64 Va. Cir. 83, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 172 (Danville Feb. 20, 2004). Former employer, moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin defendant, former employee, from continuing his employment with his new employer, alleging, in part, that defendants employment was in contravention with his non-compete and non-disclosure agreement and that defendants new employer was a direct competitor in the same industry as plaintiff. However, in denying an injunction, the circuit court fo und no evidence before it, other than hearsay allegations, that defendant was harming plaintiff in any way, that personal service contracts were not assignable in Virginia, that the potential harm to defendant was great, and that plaintiffs likelihoo d of success on the merits was tenuous; finally, public policy was clear, that in Virginia, enjoining the ability of one to earn a livelihood was to be done only in rare circumstances. SmartMail Servs. v. Ellis, 66 Va. Cir. 507, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 371 ( Chesterfield County Dec. 5, 2003).

Rev. 1 (2019). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 10A M.J. Injunctions, § 89. CASE NOTES Discretion of court as to notice.  It is obvious from this section that the requirement for notice to defendant before the award of a preliminary injunction rests largely in the discretion of the t rial court, and this has always been the approved practice. The cases are rare indeed which justify the awarding of a preliminary injunction without notice to those affected thereby. The ex parte statement of the bill and affidavits usually presented for the complainant in such cases, should not be accepted as justifying the issuance of a preliminary injunction unless necessary to prevent threatened and irreparable damage. Frequently the application is so delayed by the complainant that there is little time for notice, but this delay should impel the judge to whom application is made to scrutinize the alleged reasons therefor with greater care, so as to avoid abuse of the power. Cohen v. Rosen, 157 Va. 71, 160 S.E. 36, 1931 Va. LEXIS 303 (1931) (decide d under prior law). Notice should usually be given.  Notice of an application for an injunction should always be given to the adverse party except in case of most obvious necessity for prompt action. Bristow v.

Injunctions, §§ 93, 94, 95. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The terms the statute and this section, as used below, refer to f ormer provisions. Injunction granted without board only in exceptional cases.  It is a very exceptional case in which a court can, without abusing its discretion, grant an injunction to a person, other than a personal representative or some other person suing in a similar representative capacity, without requiring bond. Deeds v. Gilmer, 162 Va. 157, 174 S.E. 37, 1934 Va. LEXIS 244 (1934). Executors and administrators usually need not give security.  Executors and administrators having given security for their administration are not generally required to give security upon obtaining injunctions. Wilson v. Wils on, 11 Va. (1 Hen. &amp; M.) 16 (1806); Shearman v. Christian, 22 Va. (1 Rand.) 393, 1823 Va. LEXIS 17 (1823); Lomax v. Picot, 23 Va. (2 Rand.) 247, 1824 Va. LEXIS 6 (1824). Form and conditions of bonds.  An injunction order requiring an injunction bond to be given with condition according to law is sufficient authority to the clerk to make the condition to answer all costs and damages that may be incurred by reason of the suing out the injunction in case the same shall be dissolved, and is a substantial compliance with the provisions of this section directing the court to prescribe the condition of the bond. It is the usual, if not almost the universal, practice of the courts of original jurisdiction to prescribe the conditions of such bonds in this manner when the circumstances are not such as to render special conditions necessary. Columbia A musement Co. v. Pine Beach Inv. Corp., 109 Va. 325, 63 S.E. 1002, 1909 Va. LEXIS 38 (1909). Although the condition of an injunction bond is not so extensive, as the statute requires, yet if it contains a material part of the conditions required, the bond is not void, but binds the obligors to the extent of such condition or conditions. When the bond contains some conditions or provisions not required by the statute, and some of those which are required, it is valid and binding to the extent of the latte r. Fox v. Mountjoy, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 36, 1817 Va. LEXIS 58 (1817); White v. Clay, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 68, 1836 Va. LEXIS 13 (1836); Gillespie v. Thompson, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 132, 1848 Va. LEXIS 31 (1848); Pratt v. Wright, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 175, 1856 Va. LEXI S 7 (1856); Gibson v. Beckham, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 321, 1862 Va. LEXIS 4 (1862). Wifes petition for review of a temporary injunction granted to a husband was dismissed because the husband had not yet posted a required bond, nor had the tri al court determined the appropriate bond amount, so the injunction was not yet effective, and the wife was not yet an aggrieved party. Guan v. Ran, 70 Va. App. 153, 825 S.E.2d 306, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 75 (2019). Estoppel to deny effective bond.  Where an injunction bond has been signed, sealed and acknowledged by the obligors in the presence of the court and has been accepted and acted on as their bond, t he obligors are estopped to deny that the penalty of the bond conforms to the direction of the judge who awarded the injunction. Harman v. Howe, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 676, 1876 Va. LEXIS 59 (1876) (see Wray v. Davenport, 79 Va. 19 (1884)). It is error to order an increase of an injunction bond where the claim of the adverse party is fully protected by collateral security. Ruffin v. Commercial Bank, 90 Va. 708, 19 S.E. 790, 1894 Va. LEXIS 50 (1894). If an injunction be dissolved, the debt should be collected by suit on the injunction bond. Fauber v. Gentry, 89 Va. 312, 15 S.E. 899, 1892 Va. LEXIS 101 (1892). Extent of liability.  The liability of the obligors in an injunction bond is determined by the bond alone. Damages recoverable in an action for breach thereof must be such as are the n atural and proximate result of the issuance of the writ. Virginia Beach Dev. Co. v. Commonwealth, 115 Va. 280, 78 S.E. 617, 1913 Va. LEXIS 32 (1913). § 8.01-631.1. Environmental injunction; financial capacity. Text A court awarding a temporary or permanent injunction to the Commonwealth, or any of its officers or agencies, requiring any party to (i) abate, control, prevent, remove , or contain any substantial or imminent threat to public health or the environment, or (ii) develop a closure plan to address any substantial or imminent threat to public health or the environment that may result when a business ceases operation, shall require the defendant to demonstrate its financial capability to comply with the injunction. Financial capability may be demonstrated, at the courts discretion, by the establishment of an escrow account, the creation of a trust fund, the submission o f a bond, or such other instruments as the court may deem appropriate. For the purposes of this section ceases operation means to cease conducting the normal operation of a business in the Commonwealth where it would be reasonable to expect that such operation will not be resumed by the owner. The term shall not include the ord inary sale or transfer of a business. History History. 1991, c. 236. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 10A M.J.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term the statute, as used below, refers to former provisions. The condition of an injunction bond is broken by a dissolution of the injunction in part, as well as by a total dissolution. An action lies on the bond whether the injunction be partly or wholly dissolved. White v. Clay, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 68, 1836 Va. LEXIS 13 (1836). Who is liable for damages.  If a person, not a party to a judgment, enjoins it, and the injunction is dissolved, he is liable to pay the ten percent damages prescribed by the statute. Clayto r v. Anthony, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 518, 1860 Va. LEXIS 17 (1860). Computation of damages.  Upon the dissolution of an injunction on a judgment, the damages for retarding execution by the injunction should be computed on the aggregate of principal, inter est and costs, appearing due on the judgment at the date of the injunction. And the damages should be ascertained, and the precept to levy them inserted, in the body of the execution. Washington v. Parks, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 581, 1835 Va. LEXIS 55 (1835). The damages are to be computed not upon the amount of judgment at the time it was first granted on the original bill but on the amount of the judgment at the time it was granted on the bill of review. Claytor v. Anthony, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 518, 1860 Va. LEXIS 17 (1860). An injunction was dissolved, and on appeal the decree was affirmed. Ten percent damages was to be computed from the time when the injunction was granted to the da te of the dissolution thereof in the court below, but not for the time it was pending in the appellate court. Jeter v. Langhorne, 46 Va. (5 Gratt.) 193, 1848 Va. LEXIS 41 (1848). Statutory rate of interest implied unless remitted.  Where an injunction bond provides in terms for the payment of such damages on dissolution as may be awarded by the court, the ten percent damages given by statute are to be deemed awarded unless expressly remitted by the court. Claytor v. Anthony, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 518, 1860 Va. LEXIS 17 (1860) (see also Fox v. Mountjoy, 20 Va. (6 Munf.) 36 (1817)). Damages part of judgment lien.  The damages on the dissolution of an injunction to a judgment become, as to the party obtaining it, a part of the judgment, and are embraced in the lien of the ju dgment upon the equity of redemption. Michaux v. Brown, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 612, 1854 Va. LEXIS 68 (1854). Damage s may be recovered under bond after principal paid.  If the judgment, principal, interest, costs and damages on an injunction amount to more than the penalty of the injunction bond, and the plaintiff in the judgment sued out execution on the judgment and made the money, principal, interest and costs, he may also recover the damages by suit upon the bond. Claytor v. Anthony, 56 Va. (15 Gratt.) 518, 1860 Va. LEXIS 17 (1860). Suit on injunction bond.  Where an administrator recovered judgment for a debt due the estate, but was enjoined by the judgment debtor from collecting the same, if the injunction should be dissolved, and the administrator permitted to collect the debt, it should be done by a suit on the injunction bond.

Costs, § 7; 6A M.J. Dismissal, Discontinuance and Nonsuit, § 13; 10A M.J. Injunctions, § 135. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. After an injunction has been wholly dissolved, if the cause be set for hearing on motion of the defendant in equity, he cannot take advantage of the circumstance that the bill should have been dismissed under this section. Franklin v. Wilkinson, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 112, 1812 Va. LEXIS 21 (1812). This section applies only to a pure bill of injunction, and not to a case where the bill prays for other relief besides the injunction. Pending the litigation for the subjection of the land to sale for the purchase money, it is not error to appoint a receiver to rent the land, and, if necessary, to collect the bond given by the vendee for t he rent, as was done in the case at bar. Adkins v. Edwards, 83 Va. 300, 2 S.E. 435, 1887 Va. LEXIS 68 (1887). This section does not apply to a bill which is not merely a bill of injunction, but has the further object in view of obtaining a decree for a conveyance. Hough v . Shreeve, 18 Va.

For related discussion, see 15 M.J. Quo Warranto, § 3. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section is broad enough to embrace all corporations other than municipal corporatio ns. South &amp; W. Ry. v. Commonwealth, 104 Va. 314, 51 S.E. 824, 1905 Va. LEXIS 101 (1905). Quo warranto lies to try title to a public office. Sinclair v. Young, 100 Va. 284, 40 S.E . 907 (1902), cited in City of Roanoke v. Elliott, 123 Va. 393, 96 S.E. 819 (1918) (see Dotson v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 565, 66 S.E.2d 490 (1951)). But such remedy is not exclusive, and is not the usual remedy resorted to by a successor in office to try the title of his predecessor and to recover the property belonging to the office. Sinclair v. Young, 100 Va. 284, 40 S.E. 907, 1902 Va. LEXIS 26 (1902). And mandamus also lies.  This article does not abolish by implication the established procedure of trying title to office by mandamus. Sinclair v. Young, 100 Va. 284, 40 S.E. 907, 1902 Va . LEXIS 26 (1902). Mandamus is an appropriate remedy to compel one not entitled to public office to refrain from exercising its functions, and to deliver the rightful claimant prope rty belonging to the office. Neither detinue nor quo warranto is an adequate remedy, even if detinue would lie in such a case to recover the property. Sinclair v. Young, 100 Va. 284, 40 S.E. 907, 1902 Va. LEXIS 26 (1902). Common law as to trying title to public office compared.  Chapter 145 of the Code of 1887, similar to this chapter, did not narrow the writ of quo warranto, or make it less comprehensive in trying the title to an office than it was at common law, where title to an office could be tested if the incumbent were not in possession de jure, although he might be a full de facto officer. The provisions of that chapter were not restricted to cases in which the incumbent was a me re intruder or usurper without color or pretense of title. Watkins v. Venable, 99 Va. 440, 39 S.E. 147, 1901 Va. LEXIS 63 (1901) (see Dotson v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 565, 66 S.E.2d 490 (1951)). Where the term of an officer expires pending a quo warranto proceeding to test his right to hold it, the proceeding will be dismissed. Commonwealth v. Gleason, 111 Va. 383, 69 S.E. 448, 1910 Va. LEXIS 56 (1910). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Writ denied.  Treasurers application to issue a writ of quo warranto was denied as § 8.01-636 excluded municipal corporations, such as the city council.

History History. Code 1950, §§ 8-858, 8-859, 8-860; 1977, c. 617; 1980, c. 7 05. Annotations REVISERS NOTE Section 8.01-637 is a consolidation of former §§ 8-858 to 8-860. Subsection A adopts the substance of former §§ 8-859 and 8-860 regarding who may file the writ. Subsection B also adopts the substance of these two sections granting to the court the discretion to decide the sufficiency/insufficiency of the matters stated in the petition. However, instead of making the summons returnable to the next term of court, subsection B requires the defendant to appear at a date set forth in the writ. Subsection C has combined and rewritten the last sentences of former §§ 8-859 and 8-860; however, no change in substance is intended. Cross references.

The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section is substantially the same as the old practice developed under common-law ru les. Hammer v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 355, 193 S.E. 496, 1937 Va. LEXIS 182 (1937). Private persons may institut e proceedings.  Under this section a quo warranto proceeding may be instituted in the name of the Commonwealth against a corporation, for a nonuse or misuse of its corporate fran chise, not only by the attorney for the Commonwealth for the proper county, but also by private persons under certain conditions. South &amp; W. Ry. v. Commonwealth, 104 Va. 314, 51 S.E. 824, 1905 Va. LEXIS 101 (1905). A person interested.  A court should be satisfied that the person seeking its permission to file the information is a person interested before such permission is granted. Hamme r v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 355, 193 S.E. 496, 1937 Va. LEXIS 182 (1937). A relator, having shown himself to be a bona fide claimant to a public office and having made out a prima facie case, is a person interested within this s ection. Hammer v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 355, 193 S.E. 496, 1937 Va. LEXIS 182 (1937). Need not request Attorney General or Commonwealths attorney to apply for writ.  This section does not require any person interested to request the Attorney General or the Commonwealths attorney to apply for the writ as a condition precedent for such a person to institute proceedings under this section. Hammer v. Commonwealth, 169 Va. 355, 193 S.E. 496, 1937 Va. LEXIS 182 (1937). An applicant is not entitled to the writ as a matter of absolute right, but whether it s hall be awarded or not is within the exercise of judicial discretion. Watkins v. Venable, 99 Va. 440, 39 S.E. 147 (1901), cited in Albemarle Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Morris, 138 Va. 1, 121 S.E. 60 (1924). However fundamental may be the irregularities in the organization of a municipal government, the writ of quo warranto does not issue as a matter of course. The court, in determining the question, will consider the public interest involved, and the extent of the injury complained of, and, where little practical benefit would result to the relator, and injury and inconvenience would result to the public, will deny the writ. Albemarle Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Morris, 138 Va. 1, 121 S.E. 60, 1924 Va. LEXIS 5 (1924). The first notice to the defendant of a quo warranto proceeding is the writ itself. Watki ns v. Venable, 99 Va. 440, 39 S.E. 147, 1901 Va. LEXIS 63 (1901). Defendant as party.  The defendant does not become a party to a quo warranto proceeding until the writ is awarded. If a circuit court refuses to award the writ the defendant is no par ty to the proceeding in that court, and cannot be made a party on a writ of error from the Supreme Court, and process against him in the appellate court, if awarded, will be quashed. Watkins v. Venable, 99 Va. 440, 39 S.E. 147, 1901 Va. LEXIS 63 (1901). The Supreme Court has no original jurisdiction in cases of quo warranto, nor has any jud ge (now justice) thereof jurisdiction to issue the writ and send the case to the circuit court to be proceeded with, as in cases of injunction. Watkins v. Venable, 99 Va. 440, 39 S.E. 147, 1901 Va. LEXIS 63 (1901). A writ of error lies from the Supreme Court to a judgment of a circuit court refusing to entertain a petition for writ of quo warranto tendered by a bona fide claimant of an office to test the title thereto. Watkins v. Venable, 99 Va. 440, 39 S.E. 147, 1901 Va. LEXIS 63 (1901). In a proceeding to determine the validity of a city government, the interests of the rel ator were slight and the interest of the public was great. The granting and successful prosecution of the writ would have resulted in the suspension of all municipal government. It was held that the lower court did not err in vacating the writ and dismis sing the petition. Albemarle Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Morris, 138 Va. 1, 121 S.E. 60, 1924 Va.

Decisions Under Prior Law. A. General Consideration. B. Mandamus. C. Prohibition. B.Mandamus. Compelling p erformance of ministerial act.  Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy employed to compel a public official to perform a purely ministerial duty imposed upon him by law. A ministerial act is one wh ich a person performs in a given state of facts and prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority without regard to, or the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety of the act being done. Richlands Medical Ass'n v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Health Comm'r, 230 Va. 384, 337 S.E.2d 737, 1985 Va. LEXIS 291 (1985). Public officials discretion not subject to review by mandamus.  When a public official is vested with discretion or judgment, his actions are not subject to review by mandamus. Richlands Medical Ass'n v. Commonwealth ex rel. S tate Health Comm'r, 230 Va. 384, 337 S.E.2d 737, 1985 Va. LEXIS 291 (1985). And trial co urt exceeds function in so doing.  A trial court exceeds its function and usurps the authority granted to a public official when it undertakes in a mandamus proceeding to review the discretion of t he official. Richlands Medical Ass'n v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Health Comm'r, 230 Va. 384, 337 S.E.2d 737, 1985 Va. LEXIS 291 (1985). Function of a trial court in a mandamus proceeding is to command and execute, and not to inquire and adjudicate. Richlands Medical Ass'n v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Health Comm'r, 230 Va. 384, 337 S.E.2d 737, 1985 Va. LEXIS 291 (1985). Writ does not lie to prohibit erroneous adjudication.  Circuit court erred by issuing a writ of prohibition against a general district court judge in connection with action taken by the judge in the course of adjudica ting civil cases, because a writ of prohibition does not lie to prevent a lower court from adjudicating erroneously. Elliott v. Greater Atl. Mgt. Co., 236 Va. 334, 374 S.E.2d 27, 5 Va. Law Rep. 942, 1988 Va. LEXIS 162 (1988). Mandamus is applied prospectively only; it will not be granted to undo an act already do ne. Richlands Medical Ass'n v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Health Comm'r, 230 Va. 384, 337 S.E.2d 737, 1985 Va. LEXIS 291 (1985). Mandamus not a substitut e for appeal.  The extraordinary remedy of mandamus may not be used as a substitute for an appeal. Mandamus lies to compel, not to revise or correct action, however erroneous it may have been and is not like a writ of error or appeal, which is a remedy for erroneous decisions. Richlands Medical Ass'n v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Health Comm'r, 230 Va. 384, 337 S.E.2d 737, 1985 Va. LEXIS 291 (1985). Where the controversy was over the legal correctness of judges supervision of attorneys fees collected from tenants, issuance of a writ of prohibition was error. Elliott v. Greater Atl. Mgt. Co., 236 Va. 334, 374 S.E.2d 27, 5 Va. Law Rep. 942, 1988 Va. LEXIS 162 (1988). Untimely application.  Because an owners cause of action for injury to property accrued upon a towns enactment of an ordinance in 1985, the circuit court properly determined tha t the statute of limitations in subsection B of § 8.01-243 had run; therefore, based on clear judicial precedent, the owners petition for a writ of mandamus was untimely. C. Givens Bros., L.L.C. v. Town of Blacksburg, 273 Va. 281, 641 S.E.2d 113, 2007 Va. LEXIS 41 (2007). Notice requirement.  Petitioners failure to comply with the notice requirement in § 8.01-644 did not render his mandamus petition improperly filed for purposes of 28 U.S.C.S. § 2244(d)(2) because the notice requirement constituted a condition to obtaining relief rather than a condition to filing. Harris v. Va. Dep't of Corr., 282 Fed. Appx. 239, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 13510 (4th Cir. 2008), dismissed, 327 Fed . Appx. 409, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 13708 (4th Cir. 2009). When a judge ordered the disqualification of a Commonwealth Attorney and the Attorneys Office from representing the Commonwealth of Virginia in the prosecutio n of a defendant, dismissal of the Commonwealth Attorneys petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition was not appropriate because, even if the Commonwealth Attorney did not provide the judge and the chief judge of the circuit court with adequate p re-filing warning, dismissal was not mandated, nor did the judges identify any circumstance indicating dismissal was a proper remedy. In re Biberaj, 2022 Va. LEXIS 85 (Va. Dec. 8, 2022). When a judge ordered the disqualification of a Commonwealth Attorney and the Attorneys Office from representing the Commonwealth of Virginia in the prosecutio n of a defendant, dismissal of the Commonwealth Attorneys petition for writs of mandamus and prohibition was not appropriate because, even if the Commonwealth Attorney did not provide the judge and the chief judge of the circuit court with adequate p re-filing warning, dismissal was not mandated, nor did the judges identify any circumstance indicating dismissal was a proper remedy. In re Biberaj, 2022 Va. LEXIS 85 (Va. Dec. 8, 2022). C.Prohibition. Function of the Court of Appeals in considering the application for a writ of prohibitio n is not to pass judgment upon individual evidentiary rulings as it would do on direct appeal. In re Fox, No. 0116-85 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 19, 1985). Discretion of court.  The issuance of the writ of prohibition is a matter that is within the sound discretion of the Court of Appeals, to be granted or denied considering the particula r circumstances of this case. In re Fox, No. 0116-85 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 19, 1985). Writ of prohibition is to be issued with great caution and forbearance. In re Fox, No. 0 116-85 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 19, 1985). Writ of prohibition may not be used as a substitute for appeal. It is not a vehicle for simply correcting errors of the trial court. In re Fox, No. 0116-85 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 19, 1985). Prohibition lies where error would deprive court of jurisdiction.  If the ruling complained of is mere error (e.g., evidentiary ruling), then appeal is the proper route for the aggrieved party to pursue; however, if it is alleged that the ruling of the trial court is erroneous and would deprive it of jurisdiction to retry the defendant, then prohibition lies where the facts are not in dispute. In re Fox, No. 0116-85 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 19, 1985). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. A.General Consider ation. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. B.Mandamus. Mandamus was a common-law writ, but the proceedings are now largely statutory. State Bd. of Educ. v. Carwile, 169 Va. 663, 194 S.E. 855, 1938 Va. LEXIS 241 (1938). A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedial process. It lies to compel performance o f a ministerial act by a public official only when there is a clear and unequivocal duty imposed by law upon the officer to perform the act. The absence of another adequate remedy at law is essential to its application. May v. Whitlow, 201 Va. 533, 111 S .E.2d 804, 1960 Va. LEXIS 126 (1960). The function of a writ of mandamus is to enforce the performance of duties growing out o f the discharge of public functions, or imposed by statute, or in some respect involving a trust or official duty. Richmond Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v. Brown, 97 Va. 26, 32 S.E. 775, 1899 Va. LEXIS 7 (1899); Carolina, C &amp; O Ry. v. Board of Supvrs., 109 Va. 34, 63 S.E. 412, 1909 Va. LEXIS 1 (1909). It should be issued only where there is a clear and specific legal right.  The writ of mandamus should be issued only where there is a clear and specific legal right to be enforced or a duty which ought to be and can be performed, and wh ere there is no other specific and adequate legal remedy, and it is never granted in doubtful cases. Gilliam v. Harris, 203 Va. 316, 124 S.E.2d 188, 1962 Va. LEXIS 145 (1962). Mandamus will never issue in doubtful cases and therefore was denied where petitioner failed to prove his allegations. Legum v. Harris, 205 Va. 99, 135 S.E.2d 125 , 1964 Va. LEXIS 150 (1964). Mandamus should be reserved to discharge its principal purpose, i.e., to enforce a clearly established right and to enforce a corresponding imperative duty create d or imposed by law. Stroobants v. Fugate, 209 Va. 275, 163 S.E.2d 192, 1968 Va. LEXIS 226 (1968). Mandamus will never be allowed to usurp the functions of a writ of error, appeal or certiorari. Thus the writ was refused where it was sought to compel a judge to allow a certain person to become a party to a suit, appeal being the proper remedy. Moon v. Wellford, 84 Va. 34, 4 S.E. 572, 1887 Va. LEXIS 5 (1887). It will not issue to require exercise of discretionary legislative function.  Mandamus will not issue to ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-645"><akn:num>§ 8.01-645</akn:num><akn:heading>What petition to state; where presented</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The petition shall state plainly and concisely the grounds of the application, concluding with a prayer for the writ, and shall be presented to the court having jurisdi ction, unless the application is to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.

The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Allegations in petition for mandamus are not admitted as true by failure of the answer to traverse them. Board of Supvrs. v. Randolph, 89 Va. 614, 16 S.E. 722, 1893 Va. LEXIS 79 (1893). What defenses may be made.  In a mandamus proceeding, under this chapter, it would seem that any defense may be made which shows that the petitioner is not entitled to the writ prayed for. R inehart &amp; Dennis Co. v. McArthur, 123 Va. 556, 96 S.E. 829, 1918 Va. LEXIS 53 (1918). Admission of third-party claimants as parties.  If the defendant is the mere custodian of a fund, in which he claims no interest, but which is in good faith claimed by another, there is no good reason, under th e liberal provisions of the new procedure, why the claimant should not be admitted as a party, and the rights of the parties thus speedily determined in the mandamus proceeding. Rinehart &amp; Dennis Co. v. McArthur, 123 Va. 556, 96 S.E. 829, 1918 Va. LEXIS 53 (1918). Waiver of objection to procedure.  Defendant waived his objection to mandamus procedure when he answered the petition without filing objections to the procedure, or to the jurisdiction, and joined in the issue, thereby submitting himself to the jurisdiction of the court, permitting it to promptly determine the merits of the principal question in controversy. May v. Whitlow, 201 Va. 533, 111 S.E.2d 804, 1960 Va. LEXIS 126 (1960).

CASE NOTES This section does not permit the Attorney General to challenge the constitutionality of an act by adding parties in the role of petitioners whom he expects will defend that act and seek payment under it. Earley v. Landsidle, 257 Va. 365, 514 S.E.2d 153, 1999 Va. LEXIS 46 (1999). Subject matter jurisdiction exceeded .  Where the Attorney General assumed the role of party defendant by asking the court to direct the Comptroller not to pay money under challenged items until the nex t session of the Virginia General Assembly, the petition exceeded the subject matter jurisdiction granted to the Virginia Supreme Court under this section, as the statute only permits the Attorney General to petition the court to seek payment of money th at he believes the Comptroller is improperly withholding. Earley v. Landsidle, 257 Va. 365, 514 S.E.2d 153, 1999 Va. LEXIS 46 (1999). The Supreme Court is not limited to the questions raised by the Attorney Generals petition for mandamus, but may consider all constitutional questions presented. Almond v. Day, 197 Va. 419, 89 S.E.2d 851, 1955 Va. LEXIS 237 (1955) (decided under prior law). § 8.01-653.1. Mandamus to secure construction of act granting power to incur certain obligations for transportation needs. Text Whenever the Comptroller notifies the Attorney General in writing that he entertains doubt respecting the constitutionality of any act of the General Assembly granting an agency of the Commonwealth or other governmental board or entity of the Commonwealth general powers to incur obligations for transportation needs where such obligations are subject to authorization by the General Assembly, the Attorney General shall f ile in the Supreme Court a petition for a writ of mandamus directing or requiring the Comptroller to pay the money as provided by any such act at such time in the future as may be proper. In order to expedite long-term planning by such an agency of the C ommonwealth or other governmental board or entity of the Commonwealth and expedite its advice to the Governor and the General Assembly on possible alternative means of financing Virginias transportation needs, the petition may be filed after the enac tment date of any such act, although (i) the General Assembly may not have enacted legislation specifically authorizing such an agency of the Commonwealth or other governmental board or entity of the Commonwealth to enter into specific obligations under its general authority or (ii) if such specific obligations have been authorized, the time for making payments has not arrived and no demand for payment has been made. The court shall consider and determine all questions raised by the Attorney General s petition pertaining to the constitutionality or interpretation of any such act, even though some of the questions may not be necessary to the decision regarding the duty of the Comptroller to make payment of the moneys appropriated or directed to be pa id. The Comptroller shall be made a party defendant to the petition. The court may, in its discretion, cause other officers or persons to be made parties defendant as it ma y deem proper, and may make such order respecting the employment of an attorney or attorneys for any officer of the Commonwealth who is a party defendant as may be appropriate. The compensation of any attorney so employed shall be fixed by the court and upon its order paid out of the appropriation to the office or department of the public officer represented by the attorney in the proceeding.

A petition for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum may be filed in the Supreme C ourt or any circuit court showing by affidavits or other evidence that the petitioner is detained without lawful authority. 2. A petition for writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, other than a petition challenging a criminal conviction or sentence, shall be brought within one year after the cause of action ac crues. A habeas corpus petition attacking a criminal conviction or sentence shall be filed within two years from the date of final judgment in the trial court or within one year from either final disposition of the direct appeal in state court or the tim e for filing such appeal has expired, whichever is later. B. 1. With respect to any such petition filed by a petitioner whose detention originated u nder criminal process, and subject to the provisions of § 17.1-310, only the circuit court that entered the original judgment or order resulting in the detention complained of in the petition shall have authority to issue writs of habeas corpus. If a district court entered the original judgment or order resulting in the detention complained of in the petition, only the circuit court for the city or county wherein the district court sits shall have authority to issue writs of habeas corpus. Hearings o n such petition, where granted in the circuit court, may be held at any circuit court within the same circuit as the circuit court in which the petition was filed, as designated by the judge thereof. 2. Such petition shall contain all allegations the facts of which are known to petitioner at the time of filing and such petition shall enumerate all previous applications and their dispo sition. No writ shall be granted on the basis of any allegation the facts of which petitioner had knowledge at the time of filing any previous petition. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a petitioners first petition for a writ of habe as corpus when the sole allegation of such petition is that the petitioner was deprived of the right to pursue an appeal from a final judgment of conviction or probation revocation, except that such petition shall contain all facts pertinent to the denia l of appeal that are known to the petitioner at the time of the filing, and such petition shall certify that the petitioner has filed no prior habeas corpus petitions attacking the conviction or probation revocation. 3. Such petition may allege detention without lawful authority through challenge to a conviction, although the sentence imposed for such conviction is suspended or is to be served subsequ ently to the sentence currently being served by petitioner. 4. In the event the allegations of illegality of the petitioners detention can be fully determined on the basis of recorded matters, the court may make its determination whether such writ should issue on the basis of the record. 5. The court shall give findings of fact and conclusions of law following a determination on the record or after hearing, to be made a part of the record and transcribed. 6. If petitioner alleges as a ground for illegality of his detention the inadequacy of counsel, he shall be deemed to waive his privilege with respect to communications between such couns el and himself to the extent necessary to permit a full and fair hearing for the alleged ground.

Scope of jurisdiction of Court of Appeals.  The Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus. However, only the circuit court which entered the original judgment order of convi ction may issue a writ for one held under criminal process.

To have the federal court scan the information contained in prisoners form for further facts that conceiva bly might make out other federal claims would send a strong signal to state courts that their procedures will not be respected by their federal counterparts and would also signal litigants that they may ignore state procedures and still expect the federa l courts to hear claims that state courts would have had to stitch together from stray references in order to review. Mallory v. Smith, 27 F.3d 991, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 16356 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1047, 115 S. Ct. 644, 130 L. Ed. 2d 549, 19 94 U.S. LEXIS 8716 (1994). Express language of the subsection B of § 8.01-655 filing provision does not contain any terms open for interpretation, and to the extent that Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3:2, 3:3, 3A:25 and 5:5 could be construed as conflicting with § 8.01-655, the statute will prevail over them. Lahey v. Johnson, 283 Va. 225, 720 S.E.2d 534, 2012 Va. LEXIS 22 (2012). Untimely filing of habeas application.  Petitioners application for a writ of habeas corpus was time-barred under subdivision A 2 of § 8.01-654 because the filing of the petition was conditioned upon proper payment of the filing fee under subsection B of § 8.01-655, and petitioner did not complete payment of the filing fee until after the limitations period for filing the petition under subdivision A 2 of § 8.01-654 had expired; the filing provision at issue under subsection B of § 8.01-655 is unequivocal in providing, through plain and unambiguous language, that the petition will not be filed without payment of court costs where the petitioner is not seeking in forma pauperis status. Lahey v. Johnson, 283 Va. 225, 720 S.E.2d 534, 2012 Va. LEXIS 22 (2012). Interpretation.  Reading §§ 8.01-654 and 8.01-655 in pari materia, the legislature was addressing the same action when it used the term filed in each of these relate d statutes; thus, if a habeas petition does not qualify for filing due to a lack of full payment under subsection B of § 8.01-655, then, as a matter of law, it is not filed for purposes of subdivision A 2 of § 8.01-654. Lahey v. Johnson, 28 3 Va. 225, 720 S.E.2d 534, 2012 Va. LEXIS 22 (2012). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The case cited below was decided under corresponding provisions of former law.

Except as m ay be provided in the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia, no response to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus shall be required except upon an order of the court, directed to the person in whose custody the petitioner is detained or on the person havin g the immediate or potential custody of him, and made returnable as soon as may be before the court ordering the same. B. When the pe tition challenges a criminal conviction or sentence: 1. If th e petitioner is in jail, prison, or other actual physical restraint due to the conviction or sentence he is attacking, the named respondent shall be (i) the Director of the Department of Corrections or the warden or superintendent of the state correction al facility where the petitioner is detained if the petitioner has been committed to, or is subject to transfer to, the Department of Corrections or (ii) the sheriff or superintendent of a local or regional jail facility if the petitioners sentence w ill be served in such local or regional jail facility. 2. If the petitioner is on probation or parole due to the conviction or sentence he is attacking, the named respondent shall be the probation or parole officer responsible for supervising the applicant or the official in charge of the parole or probation agency. 3. If a petitioner has a suspended sentence and is not under supervision by a probation or parole officer, the respondent shall be (i) the local sheriff if the judgment of conviction the petitioner challenges has a suspended sentence of less than one year or (ii) the Director of the Department of Corrections if the judgment of conviction the petitioner challenges has a suspended sentence of one year or more. C. The petitio ner shall name a proper party respondent, and if he fails to do so, the court may allow amendment of the petition. If the petitioner fails to amend the petition by naming a proper party respondent in the time provided by the court, the court in which the petition is filed shall dismiss the habeas petition without prejudice. D. If the cour t in which the petition was filed determines that the petitioners allegations present a case for the determination of unrecorded matters of fact relating to a previous judicial proceeding in any circuit court, the court may transfer the petition to t he circuit court in which such judicial proceeding occurred, or if the petition was filed in the Supreme Court, the Court may require the circuit court in which such judicial proceeding occurred to conduct an evidentiary hearing, in accordance with such procedures as may be set forth in the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia.

The 2015 amendment by c. 554 added the subsection A designation, subdivisions A 1 through A 3, and subsection B; and inserted or potential preceding c ustody of him at the end of the first paragraph of subsection A.

CASE NOTES Where the person alleged to be unlawfully detained labors under disabilities, the petiti oner is the person from whom the bond provided for by this section may be required, and who is liable for the costs, whether the writ is issued upon the petition of the person asserting the claim to the custody or upon the petition of the person detained by his next friend. Armstrong v. Stone, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 102, 1852 Va. LEXIS 52 (1852) (decided under prior law). Applicability of second paragraph.  The second paragraph applies only to cases involving petitioners held under criminal process. Walker v. Brooks, 203 Va. 417, 124 S.E.2d 195, 1962 Va. LEXIS 161 (1 962) (decided under prior law). The second paragraph of this section was applicable to a petition alleging an inconsistency between indictment and sentence, incompetency of court-appointed couns el, and improper inducement of a guilty plea, since these allegations presented a case for the determination of unrecorded matters of fact relating to petitioners trial. Cunningham v. Frye, 203 Va. 539, 125 S.E.2d 846, 1962 Va. LEXIS 182 (1962) (deci ded under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Proper responding parties.  Habeas petitioner, who was not a state-responsible offender, named the wrong parties  the Director of the Virginia Department of Corrections and a countys chief probation officer  because the Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program was neither a statutory probation agency, nor were its employees probation officers for purposes of habeas corpus litigation. Therefore, the only jurisdictionally proper par ty respondent to the suit was the county sheriff. Nino v. Clarke, 102 Va. Cir. 380, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 356 (Fairfax County Aug. 21, 2019). Motion to dismiss.  Where an inmate was not in the custody of the correctional officers, their demurrer was sustained; however, where the correction departments motion to dismiss did not reach all the merits of the inmates § 8.01-657 habeas corpus claims, it was denied.

Affidavits to show illegality.  The affidavits referred to in this section are such as are introduced to show illegality, not the mere irregularity, of the prisoners detention, and do not au thorize a review of the judgment under which he is detained. Ex parte Marx, 86 Va. 40, 9 S.E. 475, 1889 Va. LEXIS 6 (1889) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Factors considered in determining whether to conduct hearing.  If, after full consideration of: (1) The factual allegations set out in petition for writ of habeas corpus and all reasonable inferences which flow therefrom, (2) The record of the underlying criminal proceedings, and (3) Any affidavits submitted by the parties, the court determines that reasonable minds could differ as to whether the habeas petitioner is entitled to relief, the court should conduct an evidentiar y hearing; if reasonable minds could not differ, then no plenary hearing should be held. Bonhom v. Angelone, 58 Va. Cir. 358, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 44 (Fairfax County Mar. 19, 2002). Consideration of affidavits.  Inmates petition for a writ of habeas corpus failed as trial counsel averred that trial counsel discussed the inmates appeal rights with the inmate, and § 8.01-660 allowed the habeas court to consider trial counsels affidavit when considering a motion to dismiss; the habeas court credited trial counsel.

CASE NOTES Judgment on habeas corpus held not final disposition of case.  A judgment on habeas corpus that the order under which petitioner was committed to the penitentiary was defective, directing that the prisoner be released from th e penitentiary and remanded to the sheriff for further action, was not a final disposition of the case. Teasley v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 376, 49 S.E.2d 604, 1948 Va. LEXIS 172 (1948) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Petition not moot upon petitioners release from confinement.  Petitioners habeas petition was not moot, even though the petitioner no longer was under any legal restraint or subject to any further confinement, because th ere was a sufficient collateral consequence from the suspension of the petitioners nursing license and the loss of the petitioners job as a result of the petitioners conviction such that a justiciable controversy existed for the case to go fo rward.

Hawks v. Cox, 211 Va. 91, 175 S.E.2d 271, 1970 Va. LEXIS 216 (1970) (decided under prior law). If a court has determined that a petition for habeas corpus is repetitious then, without appointing counsel, it may deny the writ under this section. Inevitably, there will be instances when the court receiving a petition which appears meritorious on its face will issue a show cause order before finding that all the allegations have previously been resolved against the petitioner. In such cases the Attorney Gener al can only move to dismiss under the same statutory authority. Hawks v. Cox, 211 Va. 91, 175 S.E.2d 271, 1970 Va. LEXIS 216 (1970) (decided under prior law).

Commonwealth, 233 Va. 460, 357 S.E.2d 500, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2720, 1987 Va. LEXIS 215, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 933, 108 S. Ct. 308, 98 L. Ed. 2d 267, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 4520 (1987). The statutes which limit review of a death penalty case to the Supreme Court do not violate equal protection rights, as it is rational for the General Assembly, g iven the gravity of cases involving a sentence to death, to provide death-penalty defendants an automatic, plenary review in the Commonwealths highest court. Payne v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 460, 357 S.E.2d 500, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2720, 1987 Va. LEXIS 215, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 933, 108 S. Ct. 308, 98 L. Ed. 2d 267, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 4520 (1987). Section controls over § 8.01-626 in final judgments.  The summary procedure for review of orders regarding injunctions under § 8.01-626 may not be employed as a substitute for an appeal under this section when a f inal judgment within the meaning of this section has been entered in the circuit court. Omega Corp. v. Cobb, 222 Va. 875, 292 S.E.2d 44, 1981 Va. LEXIS 386 (1981). Appellate jurisdiction in child guardian matters.  Subdivision 3 e of former § 17-166.05 gives jurisdiction to the Court of Appeals in [a]ny final judgment, order, or decree of a circuit court involving . . . [t]he control or disposition of a child. Because this section clearly contemplates the Court of Appeals having initial appellate jurisdiction over at least some of the judgments listed in that section, and because guardianship is a matter commonly involving the control or disposition of a child, these two jurisdictional statutes when read together evince a legislative intent to grant the Court of Appeals initial appellate jurisdiction in matters involving the appointment or qualification of guard ians for a minor child. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). The Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction of final decisions of circuit courts on appeal from decisions of boards of zoning appeals. Appellate jurisdiction of such cases lies in the Supreme Court under subdivision A 3, assuming, but not deciding, that a petition for certiorari under former § 15.1-497 (see now § 15.2-2314) is an appeal from a decision of a board of zoning appeals within the meaning of former § 17-116.05(1). Virginia Beach Beautification Comm'n v. Board of Zoning Appeals, 231 Va. 415, 344 S.E.2d 899, 1986 Va. LEXIS 207 (1986). Supreme Court had jurisdiction in refusal to submit to alcohol test case.  Although former § 18.2-268 V (now § 18.2-268.4) regulated the procedure on appeal, a defendants substantive right of appeal is regulated by this section , which authorizes an appeal to the Supreme Court by any person aggrieved by a final judgment in any other civil case. Thus, the Supreme Court had jurisdiction in a refusal to submit to a blood or breath alcohol test case. Commonwealth v. Rafferty, 241 V a. 319, 402 S.E.2d 17, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1744, 1991 Va. LEXIS 44 (1991). For an action protesting the decision to award a contract brought under § 11-70 of the Virginia Public Procurement Act and not under the administrative appeals procedure authorized by § 11-71, appellate jurisdiction lies with the Supreme Court and not the Court of Appeals.

B. No appeal t o the Supreme Court from a decision of the Court of Appeals shall be granted unless a petition for appeal is filed within 30 days after the date of the decision appealed from.

Pursuant to § 30-152 and Acts 1977, c. 617, cl. 4, the amendment by Acts 1977, c. 2, to former § 8-643, corresponding to this section, was deemed to have a mended this section. Acts 2021, Sp. Sess.

Co., 235 Va. 424, 368 S.E.2d 699, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2626, 1988 Va. LEXIS 54 (1988). The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. This section conforms to the Va. Const., Art. IV, § 1, relating to the jurisdiction o f the Supreme Court. The 1928 amendment to that section of the Constitution, which eliminated the limitations on the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, in no way impaired the provision of this section providing certain limitations on such jurisdiction. U nemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Harvey, 179 Va. 202, 18 S.E.2d 390, 1942 Va. LEXIS 212 (1942). A limitation on appeal is not unconstitutional.  A statute placing a limitation on the right of appeal even from existing judgments is not unconstitutional. Gaskins v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. (1 Call) 194, 1797 Va. LEXIS 22 (1797). This section does not regulate the time in which the record shall be completed in the tr ial court. Nethers v. Nethers, 160 Va. 335, 168 S.E. 428, 1933 Va. LEXIS 213 (1933); Avery v. County Sch. Bd., 192 Va. 329, 64 S.E.2d 767, 1951 Va. LEXIS 179 (1951). It has no bearing on proceedings in trial court.  This section prohibits litigants from presenting to the Supreme Court an appeal from a final decree after the lapse of six (now four) months from the time it is r endered, but this section has no bearing whatever on what constitutes the record, or the time in which the record must be completed in the trial court. Usually all the proceedings in a chancery cause are in writing and the record is complete on the rendi tion of the final decree. Owen v. Owen, 157 Va. 580, 162 S.E. 46, 1932 Va. LEXIS 313 (1932). The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in relation to appeals is purely statutory. Francis v. Francis, 181 Va. 373, 25 S.E.2d 253, 1943 Va. LEXIS 189 (1943). The time limit set by this section is jurisdictional. If that time is permitted to elaps e before a petition for appeal is presented, the petitioner is without remedy. The situation is not different where a remedy is barred by a statute of limitation. Johnson v. Merrit, 125 Va. 162, 99 S.E. 785, 1919 Va. LEXIS 16 (1919); Cousins v. Commonwea lth, 187 Va. 506, 47 S.E.2d 391, 1948 Va. LEXIS 241 (1948) (see Avery v. County School Bd., 192 Va. 329, 64 S.E.2d 767 (1951)). The time limit fixed by this section is jurisdictional, and writs of error improvidently awarded by the Supreme Court will be dismissed. Tharp v. Commonwealth, 21 1 Va. 1, 175 S.E.2d 277, 1970 Va. LEXIS 199 (1970). This rule is jurisdictional. Vaughn v. Vaughn, 215 Va. 328, 210 S.E.2d 140, 1974 Va. LEXIS 284 (1974). Statutes of limitation are deemed statutes of repose, and this conception of such statut es applies with peculiar force to limitations upon the right of appeal. Tyson v. Scott, 116 Va. 243, 81 S.E. 57, 1914 Va. LEXIS 27 (1914). The law in force at the time an appeal is allowed governs. Sexton v. Crocket, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 857, 1873 Va. LEXIS 73 (1873); Allison v. Wood, 104 Va. 765, 52 S.E. 559, 1906 Va. LEXIS 143 (1906). A petition presented two days before an amendment became effective was governed by the prior law as to the time. New York P. &amp; N.R.R. v.

Mason v. Mason, 97 Va. 108, 33 S.E. 1015, 1899 Va. LEXIS 16 (1899). Filing or granting prayer of bill makes no difference.  Under this section it matters not whether decree of refusal is to filing of, or to granting prayer of bill of review to, final decree rendered more than twelve mo nths (now four months) before, petitions from such decree of refusal must be presented within six months (now three months) from the date of refusal. Jordan v. Cunningham, 85 Va. 418, 7 S.E. 540, 1888 Va. LEXIS 49 (1888). 2.Interlocutory Decrees.

The party may appeal at any time within a year (now four months) after a final decree has been rendered in the cause, if all other requisites for appeal exist. Hess v. Hess, 108 Va. 483, 62 S.E. 273, 1908 Va. LEXIS 57 (1908). Limitation inapplicable to interlocutory decrees.  To a decree that adjudicates the principles of the case, though interlocutory because it leaves something in the cause to be done by the court, an appeal lies und er this section, and to such decree the statutory period of limitation is inapplicable. Jameson v. Jameson, 86 Va. 51, 9 S.E. 480, 1889 Va. LEXIS 7 (1889). But limitation applies after final decree allowed.  The right given by this section to appeal from certain interlocutory decrees must be exercised within one year (now four months) from the rendition of a final dec ree in the cause, and all other requisites of an appeal must exist.

CASE NOTES Appeal from Industrial Commission (now Workers Compensation Commission) decision.  Where plaintiffs petition for appeal from a decision of the Commission was timely forwarded by certified mail, postage prepaid, to the clerk of the court, the petition was deemed timely filed since there is no reason for a distinction in the manner in which petitions for appeal from the Commission are physically filed as compared to those in civil and criminal litigation.

The cases cited below was decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. Dismissal serves to affirm judgment.  By virtue of this section, the dismissal of a writ of error or appeal has the effect of affirming the judgment or decree appealed from. While the dismissal of a w rit of error is in a sense an affirmance of the judgment appealed from, it is an affirmance in a limited sense only. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Board of Supvrs., 160 Va. 11, 168 S.E. 617, 1933 Va. LEXIS 188 (1933). An order dismissing an appeal or writ of error for failure to print the record effects the same purpose as an affirmance. Cobbs v. Gilchrist, 80 Va. 503, 1885 Va. LEXIS 88 (1885); Woodson v. Leyburn, 83 Va. 843, 3 S.E. 873, 1887 Va. LEXIS 130 (1887); Beecher v. Lewis, 84 Va. 630, 6 S.E. 367, 1888 Va. LEXIS 119 (1888). Under this section the dismissal of an appeal for failure to give the appeal bond operates an affirmance of the decree of the lower court, without any considerati on of it by this court. Hicks v. Roanoke Brick Co., 94 Va. 741, 27 S.E. 596, 1897 Va. LEXIS 134 (1897), overruled, Boisseau v. Bass' Adm'r, 100 Va. 207, 40 S.E. 647, 1902 Va. LEXIS 17 (1902). But dismissal does not impart validity to void judgment, when dismissal is upon a ground which does not bring into issue whether judgment void or not. The dismissal does not give to the judgment any validity which it would not have had before the appeal. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Board of Supvrs., 160 Va. 11, 168 S.E. 617, 1933 Va. LEXIS 188 (1933). Finality of decree.  The case made for the Supreme Court by an appeal from a decree of the court below, whether final or interlocutory, is as to the Supreme Court a complete case in i tself, and the decree of that court therein is final and conclusive between the parties, as well upon the court itself as upon the court below. The Supreme Court can do nothing more in the course of the same litigation, until a new and different appeal i s brought up to it from some decree of the court below, rendered in the cause upon subsequent proceedings in that court, and the Supreme Court can only review and revise the decree without interfering with its own former decree. Campbell v. Campbell, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 649, 1872 Va. LEXIS 55 (1872); Cobbs v. Gilchrist, 80 Va. 503, 1885 Va. LEXIS 88 (1885). The Supreme Court affirmed an interlocutory decree of a circuit court. Afterwards in the circuit court a petition was filed to rehear said decree, and was dismiss ed, and the petitioners appealed. It was held that such a decree, under the circumstances cannot be reheard. Woodson v. Leyburn, 83 Va. 843, 3 S.E. 873, 1887 Va. LEXIS 130 (1887). Only matters i nvolved in appeal can be inquired into.  Where three successive decrees are allowed from three decrees in a cause and the first two are dismissed, it seems that on the last appeal which relates only to t he last decree, matters involved in the former appeals can not be inquired into, under the spirit of this section. Barksdale v. Fitzgerald, 76 Va. 892, 1881 Va. LEXIS 77 (1881). § 8.01-675.2. Rehearing. Text The Supreme Court, on the petition of a party, shall rehear and review any case decided by such court if one of the justices who decides the case adversely to the petit ioner certifies that in his opinion there is good cause for such rehearing. However, a notice of a petition for rehearing shall be filed as provided by the Rules of Court and the petition for rehearing shall be filed within thirty days after the entry of the judgment with the clerk, who shall note the date of such filing on the order book. The judgment resulting from any such rehearing shall be entered forthwith by the clerk who shall transmit a certified copy thereof to the clerk of the court below, to be entered by him as provided by § 8.01-685.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 1B M.J. Appeal and Error, § 236. CASE NOTES Rehearing not granted where party failed to file additional briefs.  Where a cause has been submitted with leave to file additional briefs before a certain day, and such briefs are not filed, the court will decide the case upon the arguments made. The failure of counsel to file additional briefs within the time given by the court was not occasioned by the fault of the court, and a petition to rehear will not be granted where the case was decided after the briefs should have been f iled.

When an appeal from an interlocutory decree or order is p ermitted, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days from the date of such decree or order, except for pretrial appeals pursuant to § 19.2-398. However, an extension may be granted, in the discretion of the Court of Appeals, on motion for good cause shown. For purposes of this section, § 17.1-408, and an appeal pursuant to § 19.2-398, a petition for appeal in a criminal case or a notice of appeal to the Court of App eals, shall be deemed to be timely filed if (i) it is mailed postage prepaid by registered or certified mail and (ii) the official postal receipt, showing mailing within the prescribed time limits, is exhibited upon demand of the clerk or any party.

Security for appeal. Text A. Security for costs of appeal of right to Court of Appeals in civil cases.  A party filing a notice of an appeal of right to the Court of Appeals in a civil case shall simultaneously file an appeal bond or irrevocable letter of credit in the penalty of $500, or such sum as the trial court may require, subject to subsection E, conditioned upon paying all costs and fees incurred in the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court if it takes cogn izance of the claim. If the appellant wishes suspension of execution in a civil appeal, the security shall also be conditioned and shall be in such sum as the trial court may require as provided in subsection C. A1. Security fo r costs or suspension in criminal cases.  An appeal bond or letter of credit is not required in criminal appeals as security for costs. A suspension bond is not required in cr iminal appeals. B. Security for costs on petition for appeal to Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.  An appellant whose petition for appeal is granted by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court shall (if h e has not done so) within 15 days from the date of the Certificate of Appeal file an appeal bond or irrevocable letter of credit in the same penalty as provided in subsection A, conditioned on the payment of all damages, costs, and fees incurred in the C ourt of Appeals and in the Supreme Court. C. Security for suspension of execution.  An appellant who wishes execution of the judgment or award from which an appeal is sought to be suspended during the appeal shall, subject to the pr ovisions of subsection J, file a suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit conditioned upon the performance or satisfaction of the judgment and payment of all damages incurred in consequence of such suspension, and except as provided in subsection D, execution shall be suspended upon the filing of such security and the timely prosecution of such appeal. Such security shall be continuing and additional security shall not be necessary except as to any additional amount that may be added or to any ad ditional requirement that may be imposed by the courts. D. Suspension o f execution in decrees for support and custody; injunctions.  The court from which an appeal is sought may refuse to suspend the execution of decrees for support and custody, and may also refuse suspension when a judgment refuses, grants, modifies, or dissolves an injunction. E. Increase or decrease in penalty or other modification of security. 1. The t rial court or commission may, upon the motion of any party (i) for good cause shown, modify the terms of the security for the appeal or of the security for the suspension of execution of a judgment and (ii) resolve any objection to the form or issuer of a bond or letter of credit at any time until the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court acts upon any similar motion. Any party aggrieved by the decision of the trial court or commission may request a review of such decision by the appellate court before which the case is pending. 2. The Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court may order that the penalty or any other terms or requirements of the security for the appeal or of the security for the suspension of executio n of a judgment be modified for good cause shown (i) upon the motion of any party or (ii) if such request is made in the brief of any party filed in the Court of Appeals, or in the Petition for Appeal or the appellees Brief in Opposition filed in the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals. 3. Affidavits and counter-affidavits may be filed by the parties containing facts pertinent to such request. Any increase or decrease in the amount of or other modification of the securit y so ordered shall be effected in the clerks office of the trial court within 15 days of the order of the trial court, the Court of Appeals, or the Supreme Court. 4. If an increase so ordered is not effected within 15 days, the appeal shall be dismissed, in the case of the security required under subsection A or B, or the suspension of execution of a judgment shall be discontinued, in the case of the security required under subsection C. F. By whom exec uted.  Each bond filed shall be executed by a party or another on his behalf, and by surety approved by the clerk of the court from which appeal is sought, or by the clerk of the Supreme Court or the clerk of the Court of Appeals if the bond is ordered by such Court. Any letter of credit posted as security for an appeal shall be in a form acceptable to the clerk of the court from which appeal is sought, or by the clerk of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals if the security is ordered by such court. The letter of credit shall be from a bank incorporated or authorized to conduct banking business under the laws of this Commonwealth or authorized to do business in this Com monwealth under the banking laws of the United States, or a federally insured savings institution located in this Commonwealth. G. Appeal from State Corporation Commission; security for costs.  When an appeal of right is entered from the State Corporation Commission to the Supreme Court, and no suspension of the orde r, judgment, or decree appealed from is requested, such appeal bond or letter of credit shall be filed when and in the amount required by the clerk of the Supreme Court, whose action shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court. H. Appeal from State Corporation Commission; suspension.  Any judgment, order, or decree of the State Corporation Commission subject to appeal to the Supreme Court may be suspended by the Co mmission or by the Supreme Court pending decision of the appeal if the Commission or the Supreme Court deems such suspension necessary for the proper administration of justice but only upon the written application of an appellant after reasonable notice to all other parties in interest and the filing of a suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit with such conditions, in such penalty, and with such surety thereon as the Commission or the Supreme Court may deem sufficient. But no surety shall be re quired if the appellant is any county, city or town of this Commonwealth, or the Commonwealth. I. Forms of bon ds; letters of credit; where filed.  The Clerk of the Supreme Court shall prescribe separate forms for bonds, one for costs alone, one for suspension of execution, and one for both and a form for irrevocable letters of credit, to which the bond or bonds or irrevocable letters of credit given shall substantially conform. The forms for each bond and the letter of credit shall be published in the Rules of Court. It shall be suff icient if the bond or letter of credit, when executed as required, is filed with the trial court, clerk of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, or the clerk of the State Corporation Commission, whichever is applicable, and no personal appear ance in the trial court, Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, or State Corporation Commission by the principal, the surety on the bond or the bank issuing the letter of credit shall be required as a condition precedent to its filing. J. In any civi l litigation under any legal theory, the amount of the suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit to be furnished during the pendency of all appeals or discretionary reviews of any judgment granting legal, equitable, or any other form of relief in o rder to stay the execution thereon during the entire course of appellate review by any courts shall be set in accordance with applicable laws or court rules, and the amount of the suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit shall include an amount eq uivalent to one years interest calculated from the date of the notice of appeal in accordance with § 8.01-682. However, the total suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit that is required of an appellant and all of its affiliates shall not exceed $25 million, regardless of the value of the judgment. K. Dissipation of assets.  If the appellee proves by a preponderance of the evidence that a party bringing an appeal, for whom the suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit requirement has been limited or waived, is purposefully dissipating its assets or diverting assets outside the jurisdiction of the United States courts for the purpose of evading the judgment, the limitation or waiver shall be rescinded and a court may require the appellant to post a suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount up to the full amount of the judgment. Dissipation of assets shall not include those ongoing expenditures made from assets of the kind that the appellant made in the regular course of business prior to the judgment being appealed, such as the payment of stock dividends and other financial incentives to the shareholders of publicly owned companies, continued participation in charitable and civic activities, and other expendi tures consistent with the exercise of good business judgment. L. For good ca use shown, a court may otherwise waive the filing of a suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit as to the damages in excess of, or other than, the compensatory damages. Subject to the provisions of subsection K, the parties may agree to waive the requirement of a suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit or agree to a suspending bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount less than the compensatory damages. M. Exemption.  When an appeal is proper to protect the estate of a decedent or person under disability, or to protect the interest of the Commonwealth or any county, city, or town of this Co mmonwealth, no security for appeal shall be required. N. Indigents.  No person who is an indigent shall be required to post security for an appeal bond. O. Virginia Wor kers Compensation Commission.  No claimant who files an appeal from a final decision of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission with the Court of Appeals shall be required...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-677"><akn:num>§ 8.01-677</akn:num><akn:heading>Errors corrected on motion instead of writ of error coram vobis</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text For any clerical error or error in fact for which a judgment may be reversed or corrected on writ of error coram vobis, the same may be reversed or corrected on motion, after reasonable notice, by the court.

Ineffective assistance of counsel does not constitute error in fact.  While defendants may have suffered ineffective assistance of counsel and may have been successful had they timely filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus pursu ant to § 8.01-654, neither did so, and ineffective assistance of counsel did not constitute an error of fact for the purposes of coram vobis under § 8.01-677; therefore, the errors of fact alleged by defendants did not constitute errors of fact  for the purposes of coram vobis, as contemplated by § 8.01-677. The court further held that the writ of audita querela may not be used to seek post-conviction relief from criminal sentences in Virginia; accordingly, the trial courts erred in thei r reliance upon the writs of error coram vobis and audita querela to modify the criminal sentences imposed in the cases, and the judgments of the trial courts were reversed and the petitions for writs of audita querela and coram vobis were dismissed. Com monwealth v. Morris, 281 Va. 70, 705 S.E.2d 503, 2011 Va. LEXIS 19, cert. denied, 565 U.S. 825, 132 S. Ct. 115, 181 L. Ed. 2d 39, 2011 U.S. LEXIS 5486 (2011). Nunc pro tunc order invalid.  Where case had been continued by agreement but no court entry upon the record reflected such a continuance, because trial court never considered a motion for a co ntinuance and never ordered a continuance, there was no defect or omission in the record. Therefore, the trial court lacked authority to issue an order nunc pro tunc reciting that a continuance had been granted when in fact the court had not granted a mo tion for a continuance on the motion of or with the concurrence of the defendant. The nunc pro tunc order was thus invalid and could not bar appellants speedy trial claim. Blevins v. Commonwealth, No. 1264-96-3 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 30, 1997). Coram nobis did not lie to collaterally challenge guilty plea.  Circuit court finding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear appellants appeal from the denial of a petition for a writ of error coram nobis in a criminal convic tion was error because § 16.1-106 was not restricted to only monetary cases; however, coram nobis did not lie as a means by which appellant was allowed to collaterally challenge his guilty plea. Appellants allegation that he suffered from some und efined lack of capacity due to medication at the time of his guilty plea was not a clerical error nor a claim of an error in fact. Neighbors v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 503, 650 S.E.2d 514, 2007 Va. LEXIS 108 (2007). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. For a full general discussion of the purpose and use of the writ of coram vobis, see Dob ie v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 762, 96 S.E.2d 747, 1957 Va. LEXIS 137 (1957). This section is in simple, clear and unambiguous language, and the Supreme Court reads i t to mean what it says. It does not provide that it may be used to obtain a writ of error, or an appeal, or for any purpose other than to correct a clerical error or error in fact. It does not supplant the writ of habeas corpus. If its provisions should be widened, the enlargement should be effected by the legislature. Blowe v. Peyton, 208 Va. 68, 155 S.E.2d 351, 1967 Va. LEXIS 185 (1967). The writ of coram vobis is analogous to a motion for a new trial but on a ground not known in the original trial and hence not reviewable by appeal or motion to set aside the verdict. Dobie v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 762, 96 S.E.2d 747, 1957 Va. LEXIS 137 (1957). It does not have function of writ of error.  Defendants assignment of error that there was a reasonable doubt of his guilt on the original trial, was one not properly to be considered under a motion unde r this section, for the writ of coram vobis does not have the function of a writ of error to bring that judgment under review. Dobie v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 762, 96 S.E.2d 747, 1957 Va. LEXIS 137 (1957). When writ lies for error of fact not apparent on record.  The writ of coram vobis lies for an error of fact not apparent on the record, not attributable to the applicants negligence, and which if known by the court w ould have prevented rendition of the judgment. It does not lie for newly-discovered evidence or for facts newly arising or adjudicated at the trial. Dobie v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 762, 96 S.E.2d 747, 1957 Va. LEXIS 137 (1957). Conviction on plea of guilty.  Writ of error coram vobis or motion under this section cannot serve to gain a new trial for a defendant after a conviction on a plea of guilty merely because he m ight have fared better on a plea of not guilty. Dobie v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 762, 96 S.E.2d 747, 1957 Va. LEXIS 137 (1957). Ch ange of plea not clerical error.  The change of a plea of not guilty of robbery to a plea of guilty of grand larceny was a matter of judgment, and not a clerical error or error in fact. Bl owe v. Peyton, 208 Va. 68, 155 S.E.2d 351, 1967 Va. LEXIS 185 (1967). A writ of error coram vobis did not lie in the Supreme Court. Reid v. Strider, 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 76, 1850 Va. LEXIS 20 (1850). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Motion to correct clerical err or set aside.  Where the victim filed an action naming the sons father as a defendant, but where the victims motion to correct a clerical error in order to change the na me of the defendant to the son was granted, the sons motion to set aside the order was granted, as the facts did not constitute a clerical error correctable under § 8.01-6; the conditions for relation back had not been satisfied. Shadid v. Estabro oks, 61 Va. Cir. 724, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 315 (Fairfax County Dec. 12, 2002). Coram vobis relief available to remedy ineffective as sistance of counsel concerning immigration consequences of criminal sentence.  Defendants coram vobis petition pursuant to § 8.01-677 was granted and his sentence on a conviction of grand larceny was reduced from two years to 360 days , as defendant received ineffective counsel based on his attorneys incorrect advice on the immigration consequences of the sentence. Commonwealth v. Mohamed, 71 Va. Cir. 383, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 244 (Arlington County Aug. 18, 2006). Counsels failure to advise petitioner of the potential immigration consequences of his guilty pleas was not a clerical error or an error in fact because the w rit of error coram vobis was not available to seek relief on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Because more than 21 days had passed since entry of petitioners conviction, the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Sylvain v. Common wealth, 85 Va. Cir. 400, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 156 (Hanover County Oct. 2, 2012). No authority to va cate judgment of nolle prosequi.  District court lacked the authority to vacate its judgment of nolle prosequi under the mantle of correcting error either inherently or pursuant to the authority c onferred by the statute because its action was not the mere correction of a fact but a change in judgment, which was not contemplated to be within the ambit of the authority conferred by the statute. Commonwealth v. Darab, 99 Va. Cir. 138, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 68 (Fairfax County May 2, 2018). Writ denied.  Inmates petition for a writ of coram vobis was denied, as such relief did not lie where his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel could have been c orrected by other statutory proceedings, including habeas corpus. Smith v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. Cir. 68, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 81 (Fairfax County May 9, 2003). A judgment of conviction that is more than twenty-one days old that has not been appealed cannot be set aside under this section, but a clerical error or error of fact can be corrected. Commonwealth v. Pryor, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 645 (Amherst County Feb. 16, 2000). Trial court denied petitioners request for a writ of error coram vobis in a case where petitioner was arrested by federal authorities after they realized that petitioners earlier conviction for possession of more than five pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute left petitioner, who was not a United States citizen, subject to deportation; petitioners claim that petitioners attorney in petiti oners criminal case had not made petitioner aware of the consequences of a conviction on petitioners immigration status was not the required error of fact, but, instead, was a misapprehension about the law. Commonwealth v. Cole, 73 Va. Cir. 170, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 76 (Norfolk Apr. 2, 2007). In an attempt by defendant to vacate her 18-year-old petit larceny plea, no relief could be granted pursuant to a writ of error coram vobis because the fact that defendant was not asked whether she waived her constitutional rights was a fact that was clear on the record at the time of defendants plea and a writ was only appropriate for an error of fact not apparent on the record; the writ was only available f or a vital fact that was not known at the time the judgm...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_8.01-678"><akn:num>§ 8.01-678</akn:num><akn:heading>For what a judgment not to be reversed</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reache d, no judgment shall be arrested or reversed: 1.

Law Rep. 384, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 203 (19 91). The defendant may not seek to relitigate the truth of a fact on appeal he chose not to contest at trial. Ferguson v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 9, 427 S.E.2d 442, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1023, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 42 (1993). Judgment reversed only if merits of case affected.  Where the trial court has committed error, an appellate court will not reverse the judgment on the ground of error unless it affirmatively appears that the error affected the merits of the case. Sargent v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 143, 360 S.E.2d 895, 4 Va. Law Rep. 762, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (1987). B.Substantial Just ice. Only error that substantially influenced jury reversible.  In a criminal case, it is implicit that, in order to determine whether there has been a fair trial on the merits and whether substantial justice has b een reached, a reviewing court must decide whether the alleged error substantially influenced the jury; if it did not, the error is harmless. Clay v. Commonwealth, 262 Va. 253, 546 S.E.2d 728, 2001 Va. LEXIS 77 (2001). Where: (1) there was no basis to believe that the testimony from one of the victims relatives regarding prior violence between defendant and that victim sever al years earlier affected the jurys determination of whether defendant was the person witnesses testified to having seen leaving the scene of the victims murder; (2) defendant admitted to the same; (3) the physical evidence recovered from defenda nts home established a connection to the bullets used in the offense; and (4) assuming that the jury followed the courts instructions, it plainly appeared from the record that defendant had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice was r eached. Townsend v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 420 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 7, 2004), aff'd, 270 Va. 325, 619 S.E.2d 71, 2005 Va. LEXIS 81 (2005). In light of the § 8.01-678 test, a jury instruction as to defendants character could not have substantially swayed the jury, as the only facts possibly con sidered by the jury as character evidence were that defendant was intoxicated, used a sex toy, and had sex with a sixteen-year-old girl, even if consensual. Yet, even if the jury considered these facts to be character evidence, this was testimonial evide nce about the facts and circumstances of the case that the jury had to weigh in considering the credibility of the witnesses; the judges error in giving the instruction was harmless. Wrede v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 323 (Va. Ct. App. July 1 8, 2006). Reviewing courts pursuant to § 8.01-678 could only reverse a judgment on a jurys verdict if a party did not receive substantial justice as the result of a fair trial. Accordingly, the state supreme court would not overturn the jurys verdict for the administrators on their medical malpractice claim against the health care providers, as the jurys verdict showed that the jury understood that it could award monetary damages only on either the administrators survival action claim or wrongful death claim, not both, and the record showed that the jury was very diligent in making sure it did exactly that in only awarding survival action damages. Centr a Health, Inc. v. Mullins, 277 Va. 59, 670 S.E.2d 708, 2009 Va. LEXIS 3 (2009). A fair trial on the merits and substantial justice are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict. An error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jurys fact-finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same. Taylor v. Commonwealth, No. 056 6-93-2 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 17, 1995). If error at trial has affected the verdict, then a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice have not been reached. Shaw v. Commonwealth, No. 0357- 98-2 (Ct. of Appeals July 20, 1999). A criminal conviction shall not be reversed for an error committed at trial when it plai nly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached. Taylor v. Commonwealth, No. 0566-93-2 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 17, 1995). In Virginia, non-constitutional error is harmless when it plainly appears from the recor d and the evidence given at trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached. A fair trial on the merits and substantial justice are reached if an error at trial has not affected the verdict. Benson v. C ommonwealth, No. 1937-93-3 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 13, 1994). Substantial ju stice achieved.  Substantial evidence supported the agency decision to retract payments for the identified error codes, including that the hours billed did not match the documenta tion in the recipient record, the documentation did not contain the required quarterly review of the individual service plan, and there was inadequate documentation for the number of units billed for specialized supervision. Cmty. Alts. Va. v. Jones, 201 8 Va. App. LEXIS 215 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 7, 2018). C.Doctri ne of Harmless Error. Error presumed prejudicial and burden shifts to Commonwealth.  While an error committed in the trial of a criminal case does not automatically require reversal, once error is established it is presumed to be prejudicial; the burden then shifts to the Commonwealth to show that it was non-prejudicial, and the case will be reversed if it is not shown that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Pavlick v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 538, 489 S.E.2d 720, 1997 Va. App. LEX IS 567 (1997), different results reached on reh'g, 27 Va. App. 219, 497 S.E.2d 920, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (1998). Prejudice mitigated.  Trial court did not err in denying an employers motion for a retrial on the basis that the trial was tainted by the husbands dishonest conduct and his att orneys unethical conduct as the record demonstrated that the employer received a fair trial on the merits and that the trial court mitigated any prejudice the employer may have suffered as a result of the misconduct of the husband and his attorney in destroying evidence related to the husbands Facebook page and in providing false testimony related to his prior use of anti-depressants and his medical history. Further, the record showed that the trial court carefully considered this misconduct in denying the employers motion for a new trial. Allied Concrete Co. v. Lester, 285 Va. 295, 736 S.E.2d 699, 2013 Va. LEXIS 8 (2013). Biased witness.  In a prosecution of defendant for trespass, the trial court erred in excluding a video recording, which was relevant to the fact finders determination of whet her the Commonwealths witnesses were biased against defendant. The erroneous exclusion of the video recording was not harmless. Artis v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 323 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 23, 2014). Prosecutorial misconduct was not harmless error.  Trial court abused its discretion by denying defendants motion for a mistrial due to the Commonwealth Attorneys prejudicial comments made during closing a rgument, which referenced prior charges against defendant that involved defendants spouse. The error was not harmless because the improper comment was so impressive as to remain in the minds of the jurors and influence their verdict so that it could not be said that the error did not influence the jury, or had little effect. Hawkins v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 360 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2016). Ef fect of curative instruction.  Although an error is generally presumed to have been prejudicial unless it plainly appears that it could not have affected the result, if a curative instruction i s given to the jury, the usual presumption of prejudice is replaced by a presumption that the jury followed the instruction and disregarded the improper evidence; in such a case, a conviction is not subject to reversal unless the error suggests a manifes t probability that it was prejudicial to the defendant. Newton v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 602 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 15, 2000).

But since mandamus had been issued pursuant to which the record had been transmitted and the case had been reviewed, there had been no denial of due process and defendants imprisonment was not illegal. Carter v. Commonwealth, 199 Va. 466, 100 S.E.2d 681, 1957 Va. LEXIS 212 (1957) (decided under prior law). § 8.01-679.1. Arguments made on brief not waived by oral argument.

A court may not base its findings on a suspicion which is contrary to the undisputed positive testimony. Hankerson v. Moody, 229 Va. 270, 329 S.E.2d 791, 1985 Va. LEXIS 203 (1985). The burden is on the party alleging trial court error to show by the record that the jud gment was erroneous or that the finding was plainly wrong and without evidence to support it by a preponderance of the evidence. Carter v. Thornhill, 19 Va. App. 501, 453 S.E.2d 295, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 53 (1995). Conviction plainly wrong.  Circuit courts finding of guilt and the judgment affirming that conviction, were contrary to the law and evidence and, therefore, plainly wrong because no rat ional trier of fact could have found the essential elements of defrauding a hotel restaurant beyond a reasonable doubt; the circuit court had reasonable doubt as to defendants intent to defraud at the time she gained possession of the food because it found that maybe she did not understand that she could not just be invited by a guest. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 298 Va. 517, 840 S.E.2d 343, 2020 Va. LEXIS 36 (2020). On the issue of compensatory damages in libel cases when New York Times malice need not be proven, Virginia will continue to follow the established standard of review mandated by this section, that is, the judgment of the trial court shall not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or withou t evidence to support it. Gazette, Inc. v. Harris, 229 Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, 1985 Va. LEXIS 171, cert. denied, 472 U.S. 1032, 105 S. Ct. 3513, 87 L. Ed. 2d 643, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2356 (1985), cert. denied, 473 U.S. 905, 105 S. Ct. 3528, 87 L. Ed. 2d 6 53, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 2499 (1985). B.When Judgmen t Set Aside. Where the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged after conviction, it is the duty of the trial court to consider it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. Black v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 838, 284 S.E.2d 608, 1981 Va. LEXIS 381 (1981). Where the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, that evidence must be construed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it all reas onable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. Norman v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 518, 346 S.E.2d 44, 3 Va. Law Rep. 74, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (1986). When conflicting inferences flow from the undisputed evidence, principles of appellate p rocedure require the Supreme Court to adopt those conclusions most favorable to the Commonwealth if fairly deducible from the proven facts. Pugh v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 663, 292 S.E.2d 339, 1982 Va. LEXIS 251 (1982). Fi ndings not supported by evidence.  The findings of the commissioner and affirmed by the chancellor that wife deserted husband were not supported by substantial, competent and credible evidence. Dex ter v. Dexter, 7 Va. App. 36, 371 S.E.2d 816, 5 Va. Law Rep. 175, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (1988). Because the evidence was clearly sufficient to make a jury issue of whether the surgery that a doctor performed on a patients toe departed from the standard o f care and was a proximate cause of the subsequent amputation of the toe, pursuant to § 8.01-680, the trial court erred in setting aside the jurys verdict. Doherty v. Aleck, 273 Va. 421, 641 S.E.2d 93, 2007 Va. LEXIS 38 (2007). Appellate courts judgment that affirmed the trial courts judgment finding defendant guilty of concealing a weapon about his person as a second off ense was plainly wrong and had to be reversed; once defendant exited defendants car and closed the door to the car in which defendant had concealed a pistol in the cars center console compartment, defendant no longer had the pistol about his person, as was required for a conviction on the charged offense because the pistol was no longer accessible to defendant so as to afford prompt and immediate use. Pruitt v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 382, 650 S.E.2d 684, 2007 Va. LEXIS 109 (2007). Evidence was insufficient to establish grand larceny where the owner of a store, following a break-in of the store, testified that the total amount of the cigaret te packs found on the floor of the store, on the ground outside of the entrance to the store, and dropped from a bag carried by defendant, as defendant fled from a police officer, was $410.59. The evidence failed to prove that: (1) defendant and defendan ts accomplice exercised dominion or absolute control over the cigarette packs found on the floor; (2) there was an asportation of the items found on the floor, i.e. movement of the seized items accompanied by the intent to steal; and (3) the amount o f the cigarette packs dropped by defendant from the bag was at least $200. Britt v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 569, 667 S.E.2d 763, 2008 Va. LEXIS 115 (2008). Trial courts conclusion that there was not a corporate intent to gift shares in a corporation held by a husbands mother to the husband and his brother was plainly wrong and unsupported by the evidence under § 8.01-680. Notwithstanding the label of a sale in the corporate minutes and the existence of token consideration, a variety of factors indelibly marked its true nature as a gift: (1) The corporate minutes, signed by all three directors, reflected that when the corporation redeemed the stock of the mother, it sold two hundred shares to husband and his brother not at fair market value, but at par value of one dollar per share; (2) All three director s testified they understood the transaction to represent a gift; (3) The trial court specifically found that the mother, as the sole shareholder, intended to make a gift, and the mothers testimony supported this finding. Sfreddo v. Sfreddo, 59 Va. Ap p. 471, 720 S.E.2d 145, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (2012). Since no valuable consideration existed and the husbands family company intended to make a gift to the husband, the two hundred shares of the companys sto ck the husband received represented his separate property from a gift under subdivision A 1 of § 20-107.3. The trial courts decision to the contrary was plainly wrong and unsupported by the evidence under § 8.01-680. Sfreddo v. Sfreddo, 59 Va. App. 471, 720 S.E.2d 145, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (2012). Defendants conviction for misdemeanor destruction of property in violation of subsection B of § 18.2-137 was reversed because pursuant to § 8.01-680, th e trial court was plainly wrong in finding that defendant had the specific intent to break an officers watch; the record was devoid of any actions or statements by defendant before, during, or after the incident from which the trial court could have inferred his specific intent to damage the officers watch. Hyman v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 144 (Va. Ct. App. May 8, 2012). Insurance policy issued to a law firm did not cover a law firm partners use of a motor vehicle at the time of a motor vehicle accident because a morning commu te by the law firm partner from home to work did not constitute use of the partners vehicle in the law firms business or personal affairs. Because the jurys finding was contrary to the evidence, the trial court properly set aside the jury fin ding and entered final judgment in favor of the insurance company. Bartolomucci v. Fed. Ins. Co., 289 Va. 361, 770 S.E.2d 451, 2015 Va. LEXIS 50 (2015). DNA evidence was insufficient to prove defendant was the person who perpetrated the robbery since the DNA was from multiple people, and there was no evidence esta blishing whether defendants DNA was deposited on the items at the time of the robbery; defendants conviction was plainly wrong because a reasonable factfinder could not have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty of the crime with out resorting to sheer speculation outside the evidence presented by the Commonwealth.

Powell v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 231 Va. 464, 344 S.E.2d 916, 1986 Va. LEXIS 215 (1986). When Court of Appeals should render final judgment on merits in reversing case.  Where the error requires reversal, it does not follow that the Court of Appeals must remand the case in order for further litigation. This section requires the Co urt of Appeals when reversing a case on appeal, to render final judgment upon the merits whenever, in the opinion of the court, the facts before it are such as to enable the court to attain the ends of justice.

Modification of damages where evidence did not support amount awarded.  The amount of damages supported by the evidence was well below the amount of the verdict returned by the jury and was attributable to another count, under which t here was a failure of proof. Therefore, the court modified the judgment to reflect the amount of damages supported by the evidence advanced under count II. Lee Bldrs. Supply Corp. v. Cohen, 229 Va. 621, 331 S.E.2d 803, 1985 Va.

LEXIS 154 (1988). B.Remand. Determining damages.  Where decree was required to be reversed for failure to award a judgment for proved damages, but the facts before the Supreme Court did not enable the court to en ter a final decree that would attain the ends of justice, the cause was remanded to the trial court for a new trial limited to the issue of damages, and with directions to order an issue out of chancery and impanel a jury to determine the questio n of damages. Sampson v. Sampson, 221 Va. 896, 275 S.E.2d 597, 1981 Va. LEXIS 225 (1981). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. A.General Consider ation. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The policy and purpose of § 8.01-430 and this section is a speedy determination of li tigation, and the rendition of a final judgment where it is clear that, upon the facts before it, the court can by such order attain the ends of justice. Morris &amp; Co. v. Alvis, 130 Va. 434, 107 S.E. 664, 1921 Va. LEXIS 164 (1921); Gable v. Bingler, 177 V a. 641, 15 S.E.2d 33, 1941 Va. LEXIS 249 (1941). Not ap plicable to criminal cases.  Section 8.01-430, with reference to the order to be entered by a trial court upon setting aside a verdict, and this section in reference to the order of reversal to be entered in the Supreme Court, do not apply to criminal cases. As to such cases the practice remains unchanged and is controlled by § 19.2-324. Henderson v. Commonwealth, 130 Va. 761, 107 S.E. 700, 1921 Va. LEXIS 192 (1921). This section and § 8.01-678 are closely related. Kearns v. Hall, 197 Va. 736, 91 S.E.2 d 648, 1956 Va. LEXIS 147 (1956). This section relates entirely to appellate procedure in the Supreme Court. It does not c onfer any original jurisdiction upon the court, and none was exercised by the court in the instant case. Its enactment was clearly within the legislative power. Duncan v. Carson, 127 Va. 306, 103 S.E. 665, 1920 Va. LEXIS 52 (1920). This relates to procedure in the appellate court, and does not confer original jurisdiction on the court in violation of Va. Const., Art. VI, § 1. Duncan v. Ca rson, 127 Va. 306, 103 S.E. 665, 1920 Va. LEXIS 52 (1920); Harriss, Magill &amp; Co. v. Rodgers &amp; Co., 143 Va. 815, 129 S.E. 513, 1925 Va. LEXIS 307 (1925). It requires the appellate court to pass upon the weight of the evidence in appropriate c ases, in order to attain the ends of justice. Lough v. Price, 161 Va. 811, 172 S.E. 269, 1934 Va. LEXIS 305 (1934). The Supreme Court does not consider the evidence as on demurrer. On the other hand, the Supreme Court should not undertake to pass upon matters which clearly and properly fall within the province of the jury. Where it is plain that the ends of justice can be attained, however, the Supreme Court should act. In such a case the court should re nder final judgment upon the merits. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Hart, 162 Va. 88, 173 S.E. 769, 1934 Va. LEXIS 236 (1934). The section does not authorize the appellate court to make a case different from the plaintiffs pleadings, and then try and decide the same upon an issue never suggested or considered by the trial court and jury. Harriss, Magill &amp; Co. v. Rodgers &amp; Co., 143 Va. 815, 129 S.E. 513, 1925 Va. LEXIS 307 (1925). How case to be stated.  Formerly a plaintiff in error stood in the Supreme Court in the position of a demurrant to the evidence, but this has been changed. Now, under this section, in st ating a case in that court which has been tried by a jury, it must be stated as the jury may have viewed it, remembering always that the jury are the sole judges of the weight to be given to the testimony of the witnesses, and also bearing in mind the we ight attached to the verdict of a jury which has received the approval of the trial judge. Lorillard Co. v. Clay, 127 Va. 734, 104 S.E. 384, 1920 Va. LEXIS 82 (1920); Queen Ins. Co. v. Perkinson, 129 Va. 216, 105 S.E. 580, 1921 Va. LEXIS 88 (1921). Cause remanded by United States Supreme Court for return to lower court.  The Supreme Court of the United States vacated the decree of the court of appeals which affirmed a decision of a lower court annulling a miscegenetic marriage, an d remanded the cause for return to the lower court so that the record might be made to show more fully the relationship of the parties to Virginia at the time of the marriage. The court of appeals, being without power under the statutes or rules of pract ice of Virginia to return the cause to the lower court for the purpose directed, and being of opinion that the record was adequate for decision of the issues presented, adhered to its prior decision. Naim v. Naim, 197 Va. 734, 90 S.E.2d 849, 1956 Va. LEX IS 146 (1956). Attorneys fee allo wed.  Under this provision, the Supreme Court has, in cases where it was not necessary to remand the case for the trial court to determine any other issue, allowed coun sel an attorneys fee for appearance in the Supreme Court. Hughes v. Hughes, 173 Va. 293, 4 S.E.2d 402, 1939 Va. LEXIS 195 (1939). Counsel is entitled to compensation to be paid by the husband for his appearance both in the trial court, and in the Supreme Court. Hughes v. Hughes, 173 Va. 293, 4 S.E.2d 402, 1939 Va. LEXIS 195 (1939). B.Affirmance. 1.In General. When is judgment affirmed.  A judgment is affirmed within a supersedeas bond conditioned to satisfy it in such event to the extent that it remains unchanged by an amended judgment on appeal, authorized by this section. National Sur. Co. v. Commonwealth, 125 Va. 223, 99 S.E. 657, 1919 Va. LEXIS 18, cert. denied, 250 U.S. 665, 40 S. Ct. 13, 63 L. Ed. 1197, 1919 U.S. LEXIS 1904 (1919). Affirmance by equal division of court.  The affirmance of the judgment of a trial court by an equal division of the judges of this court results from necessity, and independently of statute. The former statute in this State on that subject was simply declaratory of a well settled pre-existing rule of necessity which is not changed by the omission from the present statute of anything on the subject. Charlottesville &amp; A. Ry. v. Rubin, 107 Va. 751, 60 S.E . 101, 1908 Va. LEXIS 135 (1908).

Interest to be paid on original award of sum that includes attorneys fees.  Because attorneys fees are not court costs, the trial courts original award of a sum that included attorneys fees was, in fact, a judgment for the payment of money and not merely an order to pay costs; thus, the trial court did not err in ordering that interest be paid on the original award of attorneys fees in accordance with the second sentence of this section. Jacob v. Jacob, No . 1502-90-4 (Ct. of Appeals, March 17, 1992). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Editors note. The cases cited below were decided under corresponding provisions of former law. The term this section, as used below, refers to former provisions. The words appellant and appellee as used in this section and § 8.01-6 76 are not used in a technical sense, but in a broader sense by which they include the plaintiffs and defendants in a writ of error as well as in an appeal.

Damages included in lien.  There was an appeal from a judgment for money which was a lien on land, and the judgment was affirmed. It was held that the lien, after such affirmance was not on ly for the damages, interest and costs recovered by the original judgment, but also for the damages and costs to which the creditor became entitled by the judgment of affirmance.

Puckett, 159 Va. 297, 165 S.E. 496, 1932 Va. LEXIS 197 (1932) (decided under prior law). Execution on appeal bond.  Subsection C of § 8.01-676.1 and § 8.01-685 allow execution on an appeal bond for the amount of a judgment, including the interest, cost, and damages awarde d by the appellate court, and do not require any proof that  but for the bond  the party could have collected the judgment.
