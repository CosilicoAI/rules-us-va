History History. 1975, c. 495. Annotations Editors note. At its special session of 1971 the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to make a thorough study of the criminal laws of the State and make recommendatio ns for the review and recodification of all statutes of the State relating to crime and criminal procedure. In December of 1974 the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 19.2, which was pu blished as House Document 20 of the 1975 session. This report contains revisors notes and other explanatory matter, which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The Commissions draft of the revision of Title 19.2, as amended by the General Assembly, became Chapter 495 of the Acts of 1975. Effective October 1, 1975, it repeals Title 19.1 of the Code and enacts in lieu thereof a new Title 19.2. In addition to its revision by Chapter 495, former Title 19.1 was also amended by certain other acts passed at the 1975 session. As required by former statute (see § 30-152), the Code Commission has incorporated these amendments into new Title 19.2. The cases prior to 1975 cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 19.1. Law Review.

CASE NOTES An nual assessment hearing for sexually violent predators.  Conducting an annual assessment hearing under § 37.2-910 of the Virginia Sexually Violent Predator Act, § 37.2-900 et seq., by video conference did not viol ate respondents rights to counsel and to due process; as he was able to participate in the hearing and confer with his counsel, he was not prejudiced by the trial courts denial of his request to attend the hearing in person.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statutory and constituti onal safeguards met.  Petitioners objection to the conduct of a hearing, wherein he appeared by closed circuit audio-video link, was overruled as the statutory and constitutional s afeguards were amply met, if not exceeded, by the manner in which the proceeding was conducted; the important public policy of protecting the safety of counsel and others in the courtroom, as well as petitioner himself, justified having him appear remote ly, and petitioners counsel were in the courtroom to represent his interests.

Upon the su bmission of an application, which shall include the results of the background investigation conducted pursuant to subsection C, from (i) any sheriff or chief of police of any county, city, or town; (ii) any corporation authorized to do business in the Co mmonwealth; (iii) the owner, proprietor, or authorized custodian of any place within the Commonwealth; or (iv) any museum owned and managed by the Commonwealth, a circuit court judge of any county or city shall appoint special conservators of the peace w ho shall serve as such for such length of time as the court may designate, but not exceeding four years under any one appointment, during which time the court shall retain jurisdiction over the appointment order, upon a showing by the applicant of a nece ssity for the security of property or the peace and presentation of evidence that the person or persons to be appointed as a special conservator of the peace possess a valid registration issued by the Department of Criminal Justice Services in accordance with the provisions of subsection C. Upon an application made pursuant to clause (ii), (iii), or (iv), the court shall, prior to entering the order of appointment, transmit a copy of the application to the local attorney for the Commonwealth and the loc al sheriff or chief of police who may submit to the court a sworn, written statement indicating whether the order of appointment should be granted. However, a judge may deny the appointment for good cause, and shall state the specific reasons for the den ial in writing in the order denying the appointment. A judge also may revoke the appointment order for good cause shown, upon the filing of a sworn petition by the attorney for the Commonwealth, sheriff, or chief of police for any locality in which the s pecial conservator of the peace is authorized to serve or by the Department of Criminal Justice Services. Prior to revocation, a hearing shall be set and the special conservator of the peace shall be given notice and the opportunity to be heard. The judg e may temporarily suspend the appointment pending the hearing for good cause shown. A hearing on the petition shall be heard by the court as soon as practicable. If the appointment order is suspended or revoked, the clerk of court shall notify the Depart ment of Criminal Justice Services, the Department of State Police, the applicable local law-enforcement agencies in all cities and counties where the special conservator of the peace is authorized to serve, and the employer of the special conservator of the peace.The order of appointment shall provide that a special conservator of the peace may perform only the duties for which he is qualified by training as established by the Criminal Justice Services Board. The order of appointment shall provide that such duties shall be exercised only within geographical limitations specified by the court, which shall be within the confines of the county, city or town that makes application or on the real property where the corporate applicant is located, or any rea l property contiguous to such real property, limited, except as provided in subsection F, to the city or county wherein application has been made, and only when such special conservator of the peace is engaged in the performance of his duties as such; ho wever, a court may, in its discretion, specify in the order of appointment additional jurisdictions in which a special conservator of the peace employed by the Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport Commission or the Richmond Metropolitan Transportation Auth ority may exercise his duties. The order may provide that the special conservator of the peace shall have the authority to make an arrest outside of such geographical limitations if the arrest results from a close pursuit that was initiated when the spec ial conservator of the peace was within the confines of the area wherein he has been authorized to have the powers and authority of a special conservator of the peace; the order shall further delineate a geographical limitation or distance beyond which t he special conservator of the peace may not effectuate such an arrest that follows from a close pursuit. The order shall require the special conservator of the peace to comply with the provisions of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Virginia. The order shall not identify the special conservator of the peace as a law-enforcement officer pursuant to § 9.1-101. The order may provide, however, that the special conservator of the peace is a law-enforcement officer for the purp oses of Article 4 (§ 37.2-808 et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 37.2 or Article 16 (§ 16.1-335 et seq.) of Chapter 11 of Title 16.1, but such designation shall not qualify the special conservator of the peace as a qualified law-enforcement officer  or qualified retired law-enforcement officer within the meaning of the federal Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act, 18 U.S.C. § 926(B) et seq., and the order of appointment shall specifically state this. The order may also provide that a s pecial conservator of the peace who has completed the minimum training standards established by the Criminal Justice Services Board, has the authority to affect arrests, using up to the same amount of force as would be allowed to a law-enforcement office r employed by the Commonwealth or any of its political subdivisions when making a lawful arrest. The order shall prohibit blue flashing lights, but upon request and for good cause shown may provide that the special conservator of the peace may use flashi ng lights and sirens on any vehicle used by the special conservator of the peace when he is in the performance of his duties. Prior to granting an application for appointment, the circuit court shall ensure that the applicant has met the registration req uirements established by the Criminal Justice Services Board. B. All applica tions and orders for appointments of special conservators of the peace shall be submitted on forms developed by the Office of the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia in consultation with the Department of Criminal Justice Services and sh all specify the duties for which the applicant is qualified. The applications and orders shall specify the geographic limitations consistent with subsection A. C.

CASE NOTES Conservato rs of the peace may carry concealed weapons.  By § 19.2-12, commissioners in chancery are conservators of the peace, and as such may carry concealed weapons, although not at the time acting in the discharg e of official duty. Withers v. Commonwealth, 109 Va. 837, 65 S.E. 16, 1909 Va. LEXIS 104 (1909). Warrantless arrest of defe ndant was invalid.  Warrantless arrest of defendant in the hospital at 4:35 p.m. was invalid, where the motor vehicle accident occurred at 3:00 p.m. The officer had no authority with out a warrant to arrest the accused except at the scene of the motor vehicle accident for driving under the influence and after his drivers license had been revoked, offenses which were committed not in his presence.

Annotations CASE NOTES The power of conservators of the peace to require security from persons for their good b ehavior and to require a recognizance to keep the peace originated in the common law of England and was crystallized in two ancient English statutes [1 Edw. 3, Stat. 2, c. 16 (1327); 34 Edw. 3, c. 1 (1360)]. Fedele v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 551, 138 S.E.2 d 256, 1964 Va. LEXIS 217 (1964). A proceeding under this section is a quasi-criminal case. Fedele v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 551, 138 S.E.2d 256, 1964 Va. LEXIS 217 (1964). A proceeding in which security is required to be given for good behavior and to keep the peace is more in the nature of criminal or quasi-criminal, rather than ci vil, procedure. Fedele v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 551, 138 S.E.2d 256, 1964 Va. LEXIS 217 (1964). The requirement to give security is in the nature of a conditional fine, and if an accus ed is unable to provide it he shall be committed to jail. Fedele v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 551, 138 S.E.2d 256, 1964 Va. LEXIS 217 (1964). Peace bond is moneys belonging to State until payor entitled to reimbursement.  A peace bond is in the nature of a conditional fine. As such, and until the condition is satisfied and the payor becomes entitled to reimbursement, the cash is mo neys belonging to the State and its embezzlement by a public officer is a violation of § 18.2-112.

Warrant ag ainst associates of persons named is void.  A warrant, directing the associates of persons named to be arrested, without mentioning the names of such associates, is illegal and void as to them. Well s v. Jackson, 17 Va. 458 (1814). Warrant held illegal.  A warrant to arrest a person of whom surety for the peace is demanded, being executed neither by a sworn officer, nor the person to whom it was directed by the ma gistrate, but by an individual selected by the prosecutor, who erased the name of the person appointed by the magistrate, and substituted that of the person selected by himself, is thereby rendered altogether illegal and void as a justification for arres t.

LEXIS 217 (1964). Security as punishment.  The plight of the impecunious defendant who is committed to jail for failure to give the security required of him is apparently not considered in arriving at the conclusion that the requirement to give security is not punishment. Fedele v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 551, 138 S.E.2d 256, 1964 Va. LEXIS 217 (1964). Even though the commendable procedure adopted to prevent crime was not intended to be punishment for a past offense, nevertheless the result is punishment for tho se persons who are unable to give security and must bear the stigma arising from commitment to jail. Fedele v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 551, 138 S.E.2d 256, 1964 Va. LEXIS 217 (1964). Supreme Court has jurisdiction to consider an appeal under the provisions of § 19.2-3 17. Fedele v.

CASE NOTES Immunity for acts in judicial capaci ty.  As judicial officers, magistrates are entitled to absolute immunity for acts performed in their judicial capacity. That immunity is vitiated only when the judicia l officer acts in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. Pressly v. Gregory, 831 F.2d 514, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 13977 (4th Cir. 1987). Warrant issued after arrest irrelevant in false arrest action.  In an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that defendant officer denied plaintiff due process by subjecting him to a false arrest for being drunk in public, the arrest warrant issued by the magistrate subsequent to the arrest did not establish as a matter of law that probable cause existed for the defendant to arrest the plaintiff. Robinson v. Goff, 517 F. Supp. 350, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12804 (W.D. Va. 19 81). When a defendant officer in a civil action relies upon probable cause as a defense to a charge of illegal arrest under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, he must establish that probable cause existed at the time the arrest was made. A warrant, subsequently issued by a magistrate, is irrelevant to the determination of whether the officer arresting an individual without a warrant had probable cause to arrest. Robinson v. Goff, 5 17 F. Supp. 350, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12804 (W.D. Va. 1981). No-knock entry.  Under Virginia law, the authority to effect a no-knock entry stems from exigent circumstances reasonably appearing to the officers to be in existence at the time the entry is made, and not at the time the warrant is obtained; thus, under Virginia law a magistrate lacks authority to command a no-knock entry in advance of the entry.

For survey of Virginia law on pleading and practice for the year 1972-1973, see 59 Va. L. Rev. 1559 (1973). § 19.2-46.1. Salaries to be fixed by the Executive Secretary; limitations; mileage allowance. Text Salaries of magistrates and any other personnel in the office of the magistrate shall be fixed by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court. Such salaries shall be f ixed by the Executive Secretary at least annually at such time as he deems proper and as soon as practicable thereafter certified to the Comptroller. In determining the salary of any magistrate, the Executive Secretary shall consider the work load of and territory and population served by the magistrate and such othe r factors he deems relevant. The governing body of any county or city may add to the fixed compensation of magistrates such amount as the governing body may appropriate with the total amount not to exceed 50 percent of the amount paid by the Commonwealth to magistrates provided such additional compensation was in effect on June 30, 2008, for such magistrates and any magistrate receiving such additional compensation continues in office without a br eak in service. However, the total amount of additional compensation may not be increased after June 30, 2008. No additional amount paid by a local governing body shall be chargeable to the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court, nor shall it remove or supersede any authority, control or supervision of the Executive Secretary or Committee on District Courts.

Such affidavit shall be certified by the officer who issues such w arrant and delivered in person; mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested; or delivered by electronically transmitted facsimile process or by use of filing and security procedures as defined in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (§ 59.1- 479 et seq.) for transmitting signed documents, by such officer or his designee or agent, to the clerk of the circuit court of the county or city wherein the search is made, within seven days after the issuance of such warrant and shall by such clerk be preserved as a record and shall at all times be subject to inspection by the public after the warrant that is the subject of the affidavit has been executed or 15 days after issuance of the warrant, whichever is earlier; however, such affidavit, any warr ant issued pursuant thereto, any return made thereon, and any order sealing the affidavit, warrant, or return may be temporarily sealed for a specific period of time by the appropriate court upon application of the attorney for the Commonwealth for good cause shown in an ex parte hearing. Any individual arrested and claiming to be aggrieved by such search and seizure or any person who claims to be entitled to lawful possession of such property seized may move the appropriate court for the unsealing of s uch affidavit, warrant, and return. The burden of proof with respect to continued sealing shall be upon the Commonwealth. Each such clerk shall maintain an index of all such affidavits filed in his office in order to facilitate inspection. No such warran t shall be issued on an affidavit omitting such essentials, and no general warrant for the search of a house, place, compartment, vehicle or baggage shall be issued. The term affidavit as used in this section, means statements made under oath or affirmation and preserved verbatim. Failure of the officer issuing such warrant to file the required affidavit shall not invalidate any search made under the warrant unless such failure shall continue for a period of 30 days. If the affidavit is filed prior to the expiration of the 30-day period, nevertheless, evidence obtained in any such search shall not be admissible until a reasonable time after the filing of the required affidavit.

The requirements of this section are the same as those of the Fourth Amendment to the fe deral Constitution. Wiles v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 282, 163 S.E.2d 595, 1968 Va. LEXIS 228 (1968). The requirements of the Virginia statutes controlling the issuance of search warrants and forbidding searches without a warrant (§§ 19.2-54 and 19.2-56) are in substance the same as those contained in the Fourth Amendment. Kirby v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 806, 167 S.E.2d 411, 1969 Va. LEXIS 182 (1969). General warrants are proscribed by both the Fourth Amendment and this section. The requirements of state law controlling the issuance of search warrants have bee n interpreted to impose the same search warrant requirements as the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment requires neither that a search warrant be elaborately detailed nor that authorities minutely identify every item for which they are searching. So long as the search warrant describes the objects of the search with reasonable specificity, it complies with the dictates of the Fourth Amendment. Morke v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 496, 419 S.E.2d 410, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3053, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (1992) . The purpose of this and the following sections of this chapter is to protect and enforce the rights of citizens guaranteed to them by Va. Const., Art. I, § 10. Hall v. Commonwealth ex rel. Town of South Boston, 138 Va. 727, 121 S.E. 154, 1924 Va. LEXIS 65 (1924). The purpose of this section is to give the defendant reasonable opportunity to determine that the affidavit on file is the same one upon which the determination o f probable cause was based. Robertson v. Rogers, 2 Va. App. 503, 346 S.E.2d 41, 3 Va. Law Rep. 49, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (1986), aff'd, 360 S.E.2d 715 (Va. 1987). Purpose of sta tute achieved.  Although the affidavit was delivered to the circuit court by the officer who executed the search warrant rather than by the magistrate who issued it, the notice-b ased purpose of the statute was achieved; furthermore, defendant did not point to any prejudice he suffered as a result of the affidavit not having been filed by the magistrate, and thus the circuit court did not err in denying defendants motion to s uppress evidence. Daniels v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 422, 819 S.E.2d 870, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 304 (2018). This section and § 19.2-250 must also be read together and harmonized. Robertson v. Ro gers, 2 Va. App. 503, 346 S.E.2d 41, 3 Va. Law Rep. 49, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (1986), aff'd, 360 S.E.2d 715 (Va. 1987). General warr ants proscribed.  Plain view doctrine may not be used only as a pretext to extend a general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emer ges as general warrants are proscribed by § 19.2-54. Commonwealth v. Marek, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 46 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 5, 2003). This section does not preclude the introduction of an affidavit in support of a search warrant. Lane v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 713, 292 S.E.2d 358, 1982 Va. LEXIS 258 (1982). An affidavit submitted for a warrant may be supplemented with additiona l affidavits.  An affidavit submitted for a warrant under this section may be supplemented or rehabilitated with additional affidavits which contain collective facts relevant to the same offenses when those affidavits are presented, simultaneously, to the issuing magistrate by the same officer. Derr v. Commonwealth, 410 Va. 662, 410 S.E.2d 662 (1991). Constitutional requirements as to affidavit.  The required affidavit means the affidavit required to support issuance of a search warrant. Under the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, the content o f that affidavit must be sufficient to support a finding of probable cause by a neutral and detached magistrate. The Constitution does not require the magistrate to certify an affidavit.

The judge, magistrate, or other official authorized to issue criminal warrants shall issue a search warrant only if he finds from the facts or circumstances recited in the affidavit that there is probable cause for the issuance thereof. Every search warrant shall be directed (i) to the sheriff, sergeant, or any policeman of the county, city, or town in which the place to be searched is located; (ii) to any law-enforcement officer or agent employed by the Commonwealth and vested with the powers of sheriffs and police; or (iii) jointly to any such sheriff, sergeant, policeman, or law-enforcement officer or agent and an agent, special agent, or officer o f the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the United States Treasury, the United States Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the United States Department of Homeland Security, any inspector, law-enforcement of ficial, or police personnel of the United States Postal Service, or the Drug Enforcement Administration. The warrant shall (a) name the affiant, (b) recite the offense or the identity of the person to be arrested for whom a warrant or process for arrest has been issued in relation to which the search is to be made, (c) name or describe the place to be searched, (d) describe the property or person to be searched for, and (e) recite that the magistrate has found probable cause to believe that the property or person constitutes evidence of a crime (identified in the warrant) or tends to show that a person (named or described therein) has committed or is committing a crime or that the person to be arrested for whom a warrant or process for arrest has been issued is located at the place to be searched. The warrant shall command that the place be forthwith searched and that the objects or persons described in the warrant, if found there, be seized. An inventory shall b e produced before a court having jurisdiction of the offense or over the person to be arrested for whom a warrant or process for arrest has been issued in relation to which the warrant was issued as provided in § 19.2-57. Any such warrant as provided in this section shall be executed by the policeman or other law-enforcement officer or agent into whose hands it shall come or be delivered . If the warrant is directed jointly to a sheriff, sergeant, policeman, or law-enforcement officer or agent of the Commonwealth and a federal agent or officer as otherwise provided in this section, the warrant may be executed jointly or by the policeman, law-enforcement officer, or agent into whose hands it is delivered. No other person may be permitted to be present during or participate in the execution of a warrant to search a place except (1) the owners and occupants of the place to be searched when permitted to be present by the officer in charge of the conduct of the search and (2) persons designated by the officer in charge of the conduct of the search to assist or provide expertise in the conduct of the search. Any search warrant for records or other information pertaining to a subscriber to, or customer of, an electronic communication service or remote computing service, whet her a domestic corporation or foreign corporation, that is transacting or has transacted any business in the Commonwealth, to be executed upon such service provider may be executed within or outside the Commonwealth by hand, United States mail, commercia l delivery service, facsimile, or other electronic means upon the service provider. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 19.2-57, the officer executing a warrant pursuant to this paragraph shall endorse the date of execution thereon and shall file the warrant, with the inventory attached (or a notation that no property was seized) and the accompanying affidavit, unless such affidavit was made by voice or videotape recording, within three days after the materials ordered to be produced are received by the officer from the service provider. The return shall be made in the circuit court clerks office for the jurisdiction wherein the warrant was (A) executed, if executed within the Commonwealth, and a copy of the return shall also be delivered to the clerk of the circuit court of the county or city where the warrant was issued or (B) issued, if executed outside the Commonwealth. Saturdays, Sundays, or any federal or state legal holiday shall not be used in computing the three-day filing period. Electronic communication service or remote computing service providers, whether a foreign or domestic corporation, shall also provide the contents of electronic communi cations pursuant to a search warrant issued under this section and § 19.2-70.3 using the same process described in the preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 19.2-57, any search warrant for records or other information pertaining to a customer of a financial institution as defined in § 6.2-604, money transmitter as defined in § 6.2-1900, commercial business providing credit history or credit reports, or issuer as defined in § 6.2-424 may be executed within the Commonwealth by hand, United States mail, commercial delivery ser vice, facsimile, or other electronic means upon the financial institution, money transmitter, commercial business providing credit history or credit reports, or issuer. The officer executing such warrant shall endorse the date of execution thereon and sh all file the warrant, with the inventory attached (or a notation that no property was seized) and the accompanying affidavit, unless such affidavit was made by voice or videotape recording, within three days after the materials ordered to be produced are received by the officer from the financial institution, money transmitter, commercial business providing credit history or credit reports, or issuer. The return shall be made in the circuit court clerks office for the jurisdiction wherein the warran t was executed. Saturdays, Sundays, or any federal or state legal holiday shall not be used in computing the three-day filing period. For the purposes of this section, the warrant will be considered executed in the jurisdiction where the entity on which the warrant is served is located. Every search warrant shall contain the date and time it was issued. However, the failure of any such search warrant to contain the date and time it was issued shall not render the warrant void, provided that the date and time of issuing of said warrant is established by competent evidence. The judge, magistrate, or other official authorized to issue criminal warrants shall attach a copy of the affidavit required by § 19.2-54, which shall become a part of the search warrant and served therewith. However, this provision shall not be applicable in any case in which the affidavit is made by means of a voice or videotape recording or where the affidavit has been sealed pursuant to § 19.2-54. Any search warrant not executed within 15 days after issuance thereof shall be returned to, and voided by, the officer who issued such search warrant. B. No law-enfo rcement officer shall seek, execute, or participate in the execution of a no-knock search warrant. A search warrant for any place of abode authorized under this section shall require that a law-enforcement officer be recognizable and identifiable as a un iformed law-enforcement officer and provide audible notice of his authority and purpose reasonably designed to be heard by the occupants of such place to be searched prior to the execution of such search warrant. After entering and securing the place to be searched and prior to undertaking any search or seizure pursuant to the search warrant, the executing law-enforcement office r shall give a copy of the search warrant and affidavit to the person to be searched or the owner of the place to be searched or, if the owner is not present, to at least one adult occupant of the place to be searched. If the place to be searched is unoc cupied by an adult, the executing law-enforcement officer shall leave a copy of the search warrant and affidavit in a conspicuous place within or affixed to the place to be searched. Search warrants authorized under this section for the search of any place of abode shall be executed by initial entry of the abode only in the daytime hours between 8:0 0 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. unless (i) a judge or a magistrate, if a judge is not available, authorizes the execution of such search warrant at another time for good cause shown by particularized facts in an affidavit or (ii) prior to the issuance of the search warrant, law-enforcement officers lawfully entered and secured the place to be searched and remained at such place continuously. A law-enforcement officer shall make reasonable efforts to locate a judge before seeking authorization to execute the warrant at another time, unless circumstances requ ire the issuance of the warrant after 5:00 p.m., pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, in which case the law-enforcement officer may seek such authorization from a magistrate without first making reasonable efforts to locate a judge. Such reason able efforts shall be documented in an affidavit and submitted to a magistrate when seeking such authorization. Any evidence obtained from a search warrant executed in violation of this subsection shall not be admitted into evidence for the Commonwealth in any prosecution. C. For the pur poses of this section: Foreign corporation means any corporation or other entity, whose primary place of busi ness is located outside of the boundaries of the Commonwealth, that makes a contract or engages in a terms of service agreement with a resident of the Commonwealth to be performed in whole or in part by either party in the Commonwealth, or a corporation that has been issued a certificate of authority pursuant to § 13.1-759 to transact business in the Commonwealth.

The officer who seizes any property shall prepare an inventory thereof, under oath. An inventory of any seized property shall be produced before the circuit court of the county or city where the search was conducted. The officer executing the warrant shall endorse the date of execution thereon and the officer or his designee shall file the warrant, with the inventory attached (or a notation that no property was seized) and the accompanying affidavit, unless such affidavit was made by voice or videot ape recording, within three days after the execution of such search warrant in the circuit court clerks office, wherein the search was made, as provided in § 19.2-54. Saturdays, Sundays, or any federal or state legal holiday shall not be used in c omputing the three-day filing period. The officer, or his designee or agent, may file the warrant, inventory, and accompanying affidavit by delivering them in person, or by mailing them certified mail, return receipt requested, or delivering them by elec tronically transmitted facsimile process.

The 2008 amendments by cc. 147 and 183 are identical, and substituted is found for be found in the first sentence and the circuit court of the county or city where the search was conducted for the court designated in the warrant in the third sentence; inserted the officer or his designee in the fourth sentence; and added the last sentence. CASE NOTES Addendum to inventory filed satisfied requirements of this section.  Although deputy sheriff had to supplement, original inventory and return were filed within three days after execution of the search warrant, as required by the te rms of this section, thus defendants contention in requiring property seized in the inventory that was filed with the return had no basis, for this section does not prohibit filing of an addendum to inventory where filing of the original inventory be en satisfied.

Defendant not en titled to suppression of evidence.  Even if the filing of the inventory and return was not in compliance with this section, defendant was not entitled to suppression of evidence seized from his home , for this section regarding the filing of inventory after execution of warrant did not expressly command the suppression or exclusion of evidence for a violation of this section; and moreover, the defendant did not allege that his constitutional rights were violated.

Although two seized documents were omitted from the inventory prepared and filed by police officer, noncompliance with this section did not require suppression of the remaining documents. Spivey v.

CASE NOTES Transfer of evidence to fe deral authorities.  Defendants motion to suppress evidence was properly denied; although defendants property was transferred to federal authorities, it never lost its status as evidence, and defendant failed to formally move for the return of his property as required by §§ 19.2-58 and 19.2-60, so defendants prostitution-related convictions were appropriate.

CASE NOTES Section affords Fourth A mendment protection.  This section affords in substance only the same protection as that afforded by the Fourth Amendment. Carter v.

Supp. 352, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11498 (W.D. Va. 1971). This section was originally enacted during prohibition in response to widespread complaints concerning unreasonable searches. The statute protects against unreaso nable searches and seizures, which are forbidden by the common law, and by the Fourth Amendment which is but declaratory of the common law on the subject. Burnham v. West, 681 F. Supp. 1169, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18638 (E.D. Va. 1988). This section provides the same protection as the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.Amato v. City of Richmond, 875 F. Supp. 1124, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18242 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd, 78 F.3d 578, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 10635 (4th Cir. 1996). Trial court erred in denying defendants motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the lawful arrest of defendant on an outstanding warrant, as the s earch of defendant at a lockup violated defendants Fourth Amendment rights in a case where defendant was later convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; contrary to the Commonwealths argument, the search of defendant was not a less intrusive strip search, but was a more intrusive visual body cavity search where police officers had defendant bend over and spread defendants buttock cheeks, and the search was unreasonable because police did not have a clear indication  that evidence was located within defendants body and the police officers did not show that they faced exigent circumstances that required such an invasive search be performed. King v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 717, 644 S.E.2d 391, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (2007). Town officer was entitled to qualified immunity in a homeowners action that alleged civil rights and illegal search claims under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 and § 19.2-59 because the homeowners Fourth Amendment rights were not clearly established under the law since courts were divided on the question of whether a drunk driving offense justified a warrantless home arrest; the town was properly granted sum mary judgment because the homeowner did not set forth sufficient facts to establish that the supervising officials had knowledge, actual or constructive, that town police officers were engaged in conduct that posed a pervasive and unreasonable risk of co nstitutional injury to citizens like the homeowner. Cilman v. Reeves, 452 Fed. Appx. 263, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 22483 (4th Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 988, 132 S. Ct. 2385, 182 L. Ed. 2d 1020, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 3441 (2012). This section does not afford greater protection than that provided under the Fourth Amen dment. Gordon v. Commonwealth, No. 1717-88-1 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 10, 1990). Evidence obtained in violation of United States Constitution is inadmissible.  Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. Ct. 23, 7 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1961), holds that all evidence obtained by search and seizure in violation of the Uni ted States Constitution is, by that same authority inadmissible in a state court. Rees v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 850, 127 S.E.2d 406, 1962 Va. LEXIS 228 (1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 964, 83 S. Ct. 1088, 10 L. Ed. 2d 128, 1963 U.S. LEXIS 1830 (1963). Construction of sect ion prior to 1976 amendment.  This section, as in force in 1975 with its provision for search incident to arrest, provided no greater restriction on warrantless searches than the Fourth Amendm ent, the provision for warrantless search incident to arrest having been added in 1975 to bring the statute in line with Carter v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 317, 163 S.E.2d 589 (1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 991, 89 S. Ct. 1479, 22 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1969), and subsequent removal of the provision in 1976 showing merely that statute should be broadly worded to avoid necessity for frequent amendments. Thims v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 85, 235 S.E.2d 443, 1977 Va. LEXIS 308 (1977). It may be conceded that the language of this section is perhaps too broad in its scope. But this fault, if fault it be, is not to be corrected by the court, as correction lies within the exclusive province of the legislature. Durham Bros. &amp; Co. v. Woodson, 155 Va. 93, 154 S.E. 485, 1930 Va. LEXIS 148 (1930). It was ena cted to prevent searches upon mere suspicion.  It is a matter of common knowledge that for some years prior to 1920 there were complaints that many citizens were being harassed and humiliated by having their h ouses, vehicles and baggage searched, upon mere suspicion, by officers and other persons seeking to discover infractions of certain laws. It was primarily in response to these complaints that the Legislature enacted this section. Durham Bros. &amp; Co. v. Wo odson, 155 Va. 93, 154 S.E. 485, 1930 Va. LEXIS 148 (1930). And to protect personal libe rty and privacy.  The prime object of the statute is the protection of the personal liberty and privacy of the citizen and the prevention of the unreasonable invasion of personal r ights in the course of the administration of the law. The protection which is given by the statute to property is purely incidental. McClannan v. Chaplain, 136 Va. 1, 116 S.E. 495, 1923 Va. LEXIS 63 (1923). The statute has a wider scope than the common-law rule on the subject, in that it design ates other places and things for the search of which search warrants are required, for which the common law does not require search warrants. McClannan v. Chaplain, 136 Va. 1, 116 S.E. 495, 1923 Va. LEXIS 63 (1923). And it was the legislative intent to extend the right of search to vehicles, baggage and things. This provision is found for the first time in the Acts of 1920 and clearly indicates the intention to depart from the general rule at common law and also to enlarge the right of search conferred by the Code of 1919, as well as to impose upo n one who violates its provisions both a penal and a civil liability. Durham Bros. &amp; Co. v. Woodson, 155 Va. 93, 154 S.E. 485, 1930 Va. LEXIS 148 (1930). No creation of action against private entity or individual.  This section does not create a cause of action against a private entity or an individual. Buonocore v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., 254 Va. 469, 492 S.E.2d 439, 1997 Va. LEXIS 106 (1997). Police officer not protected by sovereign immunity.  Circuit court erred by granting a police officers motion to strike based on sovereign immunity for an arrestee claim for unlawful search because the offic ers search exceeded simple negligence since it was performed contrary to well-established law and violated the arrestees Fourth Amendment rights; while the arrestee was seated, secured with handcuffs and leg shackles, and in the physical custody of a backup officer, the officer entered her car, retrieved her purse, and searched it. Cromartie v. Billings, 298 Va. 284, 837 S.E.2d 247, 2020 Va. LEXIS 2 (2020). This section makes a warrant the prerequisite of a search. Carter v. Commonwealth, 209 Va . 317, 163 S.E.2d 589, 1968 Va. LEXIS 233 (1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 991, 89 S. Ct. 1479, 22 L. Ed. 2d 766, 1969 U.S. LEXIS 1937 (1969). Not applicable to mine inspections.  Because subsection B of § 45.1-161.292:54 informed appellant mine operator that inspections to which he was subject were not discretionary acts but were conduc ted pursuant to statute, it satisfied the Burger test requiring a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant, and, if § 19.2-59 applied to surface mine inspections, much of the Virginia Mineral Mine Safety Act would be rendered meaningless...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-60"><akn:num>§ 19.2-60</akn:num><akn:heading>Motion for return of seized property and to suppress</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A person aggrieved by an allegedly unlawful search or seizure may move the court to return any seized property and to suppress it for use as evidence.

Suppression of Statements, DNA, etc. I.In General. This section is a procedural statute. Troncoso v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 942, 407 S.E. 2d 349, 8 Va. Law Rep. 294, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (1991). Rules governing suppression.  A motion under this section must be decided according to the established rules governing the suppression of evidence. Accordingly, suppression is properly denied absent a showing that the evidence was seized pursuant to a constitutional violation or pursuant to the violation of a statute which expressly provides suppression as a remedy for its breach. Troncoso v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 942, 407 S.E.2d 349, 8 V a. Law Rep. 294, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (1991). Commonwealth s limited right of appeal.  The legislature has narrowly limited the Commonwealths right to appeal suppression orders of the trial courts to orders which are based on constitutional viol ations; therefore, where the Commonwealth appealed an order suppressing certain evidence solely on the grounds that the evidence was obtained in violation of § 19.2-59 and this section, the court of appeals would not entertain the Commonwealths ap peal. Commonwealth v. Ragland, 7 Va. App. 452, 374 S.E.2d 183, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 139 (1988). Commonwealths interlocutory appeal not allowed based on former § 19.2-83.  Where the trial courts suppressing order was not based on a violation of a provision of the Virginia or federal Constitutions, but was based on former § 19 .2-83, which limited the authority of a police officer to stop, question and search a suspicious person, the interlocutory appeal by the Commonwealth from the order suppressing evidence of cocaine found on the defendant when law-enforcement officers sear ched him was not one which the Commonwealth was permitted to appeal. Commonwealth v. Brown, 8 Va. App. 41, 378 S.E.2d 623, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2091, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 22 (1989). Entry of a knowing and voluntary, but non-conditional plea waived appeal from denial of motion to suppress.  Because defendant did not enter a conditional guilty plea pursuant to § 19.2-254, to a charge of possession of Oxycodone, but he entered said plea voluntarily and intelligently, he waived his right to appeal from the judgment denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized against him. Hill v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 667, 626 S.E.2d 459, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 63 (2006). Where entry reasonable pursuant to emergency doctrine.  Officers entry of appellants home was reasonable under the emergency doctrine and appellants motion to suppress was properly denied because evidence o f appellant brandishing and using guns in the home permitted a reasonable officer to conclude that appellants young daughter might be threatened with serious injury and in need of immediate aid; any error regarding the warrant was harmless because th e shotguns and ammunition found pursuant to the warrant were merely cumulative of the weapons found in plain view pursuant to the lawful entry. Stallings v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 451 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2007). II.Motion to Suppress. A.Search and Seizure. Consent to search.  Although no warrant exception justified police entry into the mothers apartment where defendant lived, the consent obtained thereafter from the mother was suf ficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint and thus, the trial court properly denied defendants motion to suppress inculpatory evidence found in defendants bedroom. Kyer v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 473, 612 S.E.2d 213, 2005 Va. App . LEXIS 193 (2005). Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to suppress, as there was no evidence that the police coerced defendant into consenting to the search; de fendant never testified he heard any threats, saw any brandished firearms, observed an overwhelming number of officers, experienced any overt or implicit coercion, or felt he had no choice but to consent. Elliott v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 48, 733 S.E. 2d 146, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 335 (2012). Since a police officer conducting a traffic stop of defendants vehicle had already given defendant her documentation back and had informed her that he was onl y going to give her a warning for her speeding violation while advising her to slow down before he continued questioning her, the traffic stop had concluded, and the ensuing encounter between the officer and defendant needed to proceed on a consensual ba sis in order for it to be lawful. The continued encounter was not consensual as, when the officer questioned defendant about the possession of illegal drugs, he had not informed defendant that she was free to leave, nor would a reasonable person have fel t free to leave since the circumstances did not change from when the officer originally had seized her based on probable cause for the traffic stop; thus, defendants motion to suppress was properly granted. Commonwealth v. Crooks, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 364 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2012). Consensual encounter.  Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to suppress a firearm seized from defendants person. Since defendant did not submit to the officer s assertion of authority when he instructed defendant to take his hands out of his pockets after officers approached him on the streets while investigating a report of drug activity, the encounter remained consensual. Blanchard v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 10, 2012). Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to suppress evidence a police officer obtained from his person after conducting a traffic stop because de fendant was not illegally detained, and the search was consensual; when the officer sought permission to search defendants vehicle the encounter was consensual, and defendant was not seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, and a reasonable perso n would have recognized that the traffic investigation was concluded and that he or she was free to leave and to refuse the officers request to search. Mayo v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 57 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2013). Third party consent.  As the peremptory manner in which a homeowner gained access to defendants rented bedroom, unannounced and without knocking despite knowing defendant was prese nt, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the room was under the homeowners control as well, an officers presence in the room was lawful and did not violate defendants Fourth Amendment rights. Thus, defendants motion to suppress was properly denied. Sourdiff v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 534 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 9, 2008). Abandoned proper ty admissible.  Trial court erred in granting defendants motion to suppress, because defendant was unable to meet defendants burden of proving that defendant retained a r easonable expectation of privacy in the item after defendant tossed it out the window of the moving vehicle, where the evidence did not establish that defendant was subject to a seizure of defendants person when defendant discarded plastic bag out th e window. Commonwealth v. Kennedy, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 26 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2009). No rea sonable expectation of privacy.  Trial court properly denied defendants suppression motion as defendant surrendered his expectation of privacy in a tissue and its contents by voluntarily and intentionally dropping them to the ground in a quasi-public place during a consensual encounter with the police; notwithstanding any subjective intention to step on the tissue and to retain or regain control of it, the officers recovery of the tissue was not an unreasonable search or seizure. Mayfield v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2005). Defendants motion to suppress was properly denied as he failed to show a reasonable expectation of privacy in a motel room where no evidence beyond his presen ce in the room tended to show that he was in the room with the registered owners consent. Sharpe v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 448, 605 S.E.2d 346, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 594 (2004). Defendant was not entitled to have DNA evidence suppressed because the use of a buccal swab to obtain defendants DNA profile for comparison with DNA evidence recovered from the victim did not violate defendants rights under the Fourth Amendment; defendants reasonable expectation of privacy in the DNA sample ended when defendant voluntarily provided it to police for DNA testing and comparison in anothe r case, without limiting its subsequent use for the same purpose in other investigations. Pharr v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 89, 646 S.E.2d 453, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 246 (2007). Trial court properly denied defendants motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of a hotel room as he failed to establish a legitimate expectation of privacy. Although defendant claimed his girlfriend was the registered guest, no evidence established the specific identity of t...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-61"><akn:num>§ 19.2-61</akn:num><akn:heading>Definitions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text As used in this chapter: Aggrieved person means a person who was a party to any intercepted wire, electronic or oral communication or a person against whom the interception was directed; Aural transfer means a transfer containing the human voice at any point between and in cluding the point of origin and the point of reception; Communications common carrier means any person engaged as a common carrier for hire in communication by wire or radio or in radio transmission of energy; Contents when used with respect to any wire, electronic or oral communication, include s any information concerning the substance, purport or meaning of that communication; Electronic, mechanical or other device means any device or apparatus that can be used to intercept a wire, electronic or oral communication other than: (a) Any telephone or telegraph instrument, equipment or facility, or any component thereof, (i) furnished to the subscriber or user by a provider of wire or electronic communication service in the ordinary course of its business and being used by the subscriber or user in the ordinary course of its business or furnished by the subscriber or user for connection to the facilities of such service and used in the ordinary course of the subscribers or users business; or (ii) being used by a communications co mmon carrier in the ordinary course of its business, or by an investigative or law-enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties; (b) A hearing aid or similar device being used to correct subnormal hearing to not better than normal;Elect ronic communication means any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electr omagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system.

CASE NOTES Definitions of intercept in this section and § 19.2-68 B 5 compared.  Prior to the 1980 amendment of § 19.2-68, adding subdivision B 5 thereof, intercept was defined in former subsection (3) of this section and meant an aural acquisition. Under that definition, a wiretap order could only be entered by a judge sitting in the jurisdiction where the conversation would be heard. Thus, a wiretap order could be entered, for example, in Richmond, where the listening po st would be located, while the actual conversation might occur in Franklin County. This would deprive the local authorities of knowledge of the investigation involving their jurisdiction. To avoid this result, the General Assembly enacted § 19.2-68 B 5, defining intercept as the physical act of acquiring the means to intercept the conversation. Smith v. Commonwealth, 3 Va.

Inten tionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, electronic or oral communication; 2. Intentionally uses, endeavors to use, or procures any other person to use or endeavor to use any electronic, mechanical or other device to intercept any oral communication; 3.

B. 1. It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for an operator of a switchboard, or an officer, employee or agent of a provider of wire or electronic communications service, whose facilities are used in the transmission of a wire communication, to intercept, disclose or use that communication in the normal course of his employment while en gaged in any activity which is a necessary incident to the rendition of his service or to the protection of the rights or property of the provider of that service. However, a provider of wire communication service to the public shall not utilize service observing or random monitoring except for mechanical or service quality control checks. It shall not be a criminal offense under this chapter for providers of wire or electronic communications service, their officers, employees and agents, landlords, cus todians, or other persons pursuant to a court order under this chapter, to provide information facilities or technical assistance to an investigative or law-enforcement officer, who, pursuant to this chapter, is authorized to intercept a wire, electronic or oral communication. 2. It shall not be a criminal offense under this chapter for a person to intercept a wire, electronic or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of th e parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception. 3.

Application for and issuance of order authorizing interception; contents of order; recording and retention of intercepted communications, applications and orders; notice to parties; introduction in evidence of information obtained. Text A. Each applic ation for an order authorizing the interception of a wire, electronic or oral communication shall be made in writing upon oath or affirmation to the appropriate judge of competent jurisdiction and shall state the applicants authority to make such app lication. Each application shall be verified by the Attorney General to the best of his knowledge and belief and shall include the following information: 1. The i dentity of the attorney for the Commonwealth and law-enforcement officer who requested the Attorney General to apply for such order; 2. A full and complete statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the applicant to justify his belief that an order should be issued, including (i) details as to the particul ar offense that has been, is being or is about to be committed, (ii) except as provided in subsection I, a particular description of the nature and location of the facilities from which or the place where the communication is to be intercepted, (iii) a p articular description of the type of communications sought to be intercepted, (iv) the identity of the person, if known, committing the offense and whose communications are to be intercepted; 3. A full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be t oo dangerous; 4. A statement of the period of time for which the interception is required to be maintained.

A full and complete statement of the facts concerning all previous applications known to the individual authorizing and making the application, made to any judge for authorization to i ntercept wire, electronic or oral communications involving any of the same persons, facilities or places specified in the application, and the action taken by the judge on each such application; 6. Where the application is for the extension of an order, a statement setting forth the results thus far obtained from the interception, or a reasonable explanation of the failure to obt ain such results; and 7. If authorization is requested for observation or monitoring by a police department of a county or city, by a sheriffs office, or by law-enforcement officers of the United States, a statement containing the name of the police department, sheriffs office, or United States agency and an explanation of the reasons such observation or monitoring is necessary.The judge may require the applicant to furnish additional testimony or doc umentary evidence in support of the application. B. Upon such a pplication the judge may enter an ex parte order, as requested or as modified, authorizing interception of wire, electronic or oral communications if the judge determines on the basis of the facts submitted by the applicant that: 1. There is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed or is about to commit an offense enumerated in § 19.2-66 of this chapter; 2. There is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception; 3. Normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried, or to be too dangerous; and interception under this chapter is the only alternative investigative procedure available; 4. Except as provided in subsection I, there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where, the wire, electronic or oral communications are to be interce pted are being used, or are about to be used, in connection with the commission of such offense, or are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person; 5. A wire, electronic or oral communication authorized to be intercepted pursuant to this section may be monitored at any location within the Commonwealth of Virginia. C. Each order authorizing the interception of any wire, electronic or oral communication shall specify: 1. The i dentity of the person, if known, whose communications are to be intercepted; 2. The nature and location of the communications facilities as to which, or the place where, authority to intercept is granted; 3. A particular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted, and a statement of the particular offense enumerated in § 19.2-66 to which it relates; 4. That such interception is to be conducted only by the Department of State Police; 5. If observation or monitoring by the police department of a county or city, by a sheriffs office, or by law-enforcement officers of the United States is authorized, only that police department, sheriffs office, or agency or the officers from any police department of a town which originated the investigation leading to the application shall observe or monitor the interception; and 6. The period of time during which such interception is authorized, including a statement as to whether or not the interception shall automatically terminate when the described communicat ion has been first obtained.An order authorizing the interception of a wire, electronic or oral communication shall, upon request of the applicant, direct that a provider of wire or electronic communications service, landlord, custodian or other person s hall furnish the Department of State Police forthwith all information, facilities and technical assistance necessary to accomplish the interception unobtrusively and with a minimum of interference with the services that such service provider, landlord, c ustodian or person is providing the person whose communications are to be intercepted. Any provider of wire or electronic communications service, landlord, custodian or other person furnishing such facilities or technical assistance shall be compensated therefor by the Commonwealth for reasonable and actual expenses incurred in providing such facilities or assistance, to be paid out of the criminal fund. D. No order en tered under this section may authorize the interception of any wire, electronic or oral communication for any period longer than is necessary to achieve the objective of the authorization, nor in any event longer than 30 days which period begins to run o n the earlier of the day on which the investigative or law-enforcement officer begins to conduct an interception under the order or 10 days after the date of entry of the order. Extensions of an order may be granted, but only upon application for an exte nsion made in accordance with subsection A of this section and the courts making the findings required by subsection B of this section. The period of extension shall be no longer than the authorizing judge deems necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was granted and in no event for longer than 30 days. Every order and extension thereof shall contain a provision that the authorization to intercept shall be executed as soon as practicable, shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the in terception of communications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter, and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective, or in any event in 30 days. In the event the intercepted communication is in a code or foreign language , and an expert in that foreign language or code is not reasonably available during the interception period, minimization may be accomplished as soon as practicable after such interception. E. Whenever an order authorizing interception is entered pursuant to this chapter, the order shall require reports to be made to the judge who issued the order showing what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective and the need for continue d interception. Such reports shall be made at such intervals as the judge shall require. F. 1. The contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication intercepted by any means authorized by this chapter shall, if possible, be recorded on tape or wire or other comparable device. Should it not be possible to record the intercepted communication, a detailed resume of such communication shall forthwith be reduced to writing and fi led with the court. The recording of the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication under this subsection shall be done in such way as will protect the recording from editing or other alterations and shall not be duplicated except upon order of the court as hereafter provided. Immediately upon the expiration of the period of the order, or extensions thereof, such recording or detailed resume shall be made available to the judge issuing such order and sealed under his directions.

B. An applicat ion for an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device may be filed in the jurisdiction where the ongoing criminal investigation is being conducted; where there is probable cause to believe that an offen se was committed, is being committed, or will be committed; or where the person or persons who subscribe to the wire or electronic communication system live, work, or maintain an address or a post office box. For the purposes of an order entered pursuant to this section for the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device, such installation shall be deemed to occur in the jurisdiction where the order is entered, regardless of the physical location or the method by which the informatio n is captured or routed to the law-enforcement officer that made the application. Upon application, the court shall enter an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device if the court finds that the inve stigative or law-enforcement officer has certified to the court that the information likely to be obtained by such installation and use is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.The order shall specify: 1.

Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the results of the trap and trace device shall be furnished to the investigative or law-enforcement officer designated by the court at reasonable intervals during regular business hours for the duration of the order. Where the law-enforcement agency implementing an ex parte order under this subsection seeks to do so by installing and using its own pen register or trap and trace device on a packet-switched data network of a provider of electronic communication service to the public, the agency shall ensure that a record will be maintained that will ide ntify (i) any officer or officers who installed the device and any officer or officers who accessed the device to obtain information from the network; (ii) the date and time the device was installed, the date and time the device was uninstalled, and the date, time, and duration of each time the device is accessed to obtain information; (iii) the configuration of the device at the time of its installation and any subsequent modification thereof; and (iv) any information that has been collected by the dev ice. To the extent that the pen register or trap and trace device can be set automatically to record this information electronically, the record shall be maintained electronically throughout the installation and use of such device. The record maintained hereunder shall be provided ex parte and under seal of the court that entered the ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of the device within 30 days after termination of the order, including any extensions thereof.

Motion by defendants, company and debt collector, for sanctions, attorneys fees, and costs pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 and § 1692k(a)(3) of the Fair Deb t Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) was granted where plaintiffs contention that the debt collector lacked standing to seek a warrant for her arrest was meritless; Virginia law made clear that any person could lawfully seek to have a criminal warrant issued, and such warrant would issue if the officer investigating the complaint found that there was probable cause to believe that a criminal offense took place. Guidry v. Clare, 442 F. Supp. 2d 282, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56447 (E.D. Va. 2006). Arrest.  Where officers went to an arrestees home to arrest the arrestees son pursuant to a warrant, the arrestee allegedly closed the door on an officers foot , and the arrestee was arrested for obstruction of justice pursuant to a warrant, the officers were entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity as to the arrestees Fourth Amendment claim because their belief that there was probable cause was objectively reasonable; unlike federal law, Virginia law did not require officers seeking arrest warrants to do so by way of written declarations or sworn affidavits.

Probation violation.  Fourth Amendment and § 19.2-72 do not require sworn statements for the seizure of a probationer whose sentence to confinement has been suspended based on his f ailure to comply with specified terms and conditions of his probation. Unsworn written statements under § 53.1-149, which showed that appellant had had only limited contact with probation authorities and that he still owed over $51,000 in restitution, and appellants failure to comply with a show cause order were a sufficient basis for the trial court to issue a capias for appellants arrest.

Forgery, § § 9, 24. CASE NOTES Constraint.  In a trial on the offense of driving under the influence, the circuit court properly admitted results of a blood test from a sample collected while defendant was in the hospital. Subsection B of § 19.2-73 authorized issuance of a summons, and an arrest followed by a release on a summons satisfied the requirement of constraining the arrestees liberty under the implied consent statutes. Reading § § 19.2-73 and 19.2-74 in pari materia with the implied consent statute, an arrest followed by a release on summons satisfies the requirement of constraining the arrestees personal liberty, for purposes of implicating the statutory duty to provide a blood or breath sample. Young v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 731, 706 S.E.2d 53, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 77 (2011). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Withdrawal or dismissal of warrant or summons.  Neither a chief of police nor a Commonwealths attorney has the authority to unilaterally withdraw or dismiss a lawfully issued arrest warrant or summons. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Ralph B. Robertson, Judge, Richmond General District Court, Criminal Division, 03-025 (5/30/03). Unar rest of lawfully arrested person not authorized.  There is no authority or process by which a police officer or a Commonwealths attorney may unarrest a person who is lawfully arrested on a warrant or summons. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Ralph B. Robertson, Judge, Richmond General District Court, Criminal Division, 03-025 (5/30/03). Proper p rocedure for officers obtaining blood samples.  Implied consent to a blood test is triggered by a valid arrest. If a common-law arrest is not feasible because a defendant is in a medical facility, the arrest ma y be made by the issuance of a summons pursuant to subsection B of § 19.2-73, because that summons is deemed an arrest document. If a summons is issued, it must be based on probable cause, and it must be issued before obtaining the blood draw. The su spect should be advised of the requirements of the implied consent law, after which the blood test may be administered. The arresting officer should remain with the suspect until after the blood is drawn and then release him on the previously issued summ ons. If the suspect objects to the blood test, he should be charged with a violation of § 18.2-268.3 (refusal to take a blood or breath test). See opinion of Attorney General to Colonel W.S. Flaherty, Superintendent, Department of State Police, No. 1 4-022, 2014 Va. AG LEXIS 66 (12/19/14). § 19.2-73.1. Notice of issuance of warrant or summons; appearance; failure to appear. Text In any misdemeanor case or in any class of misdemeanor cases and in a Class 5 or Class 6 felony case, the chief of police of the city or county or his designee, or the sheriff or deputy sheriff of the county, if the county has no police department, in which the case is pending may notify the accused of the issuance of the warrant or summons and direct the accused to appear at the time and place directed for the purpose of the execution of the summons or warrant. However, the issuing judicial officer may direct the execution of such process prior to any such notification. If the accused does not appear, then the warrant or summons shall be executed and returned as prov ided by § 19.2-76. History History. 1979, c. 335; 1991, c. 162; 1993, c. 350. § 19.2-73.2.

Text Law-enforcement officers as defined in § 9.1-101 and state police officers, in the course of their duties, in the investigation of any Class 3 or Class 4 misdemeanor or any traffic infraction, may, within seventy-two hours of the time of the offense, issue a subpoena to any witness to appear in court and testify with respect to any such criminal charge or traffic infraction brought against any person as a result of such investigation. The return of service thereof shall be made within seventy-two hours after service to the appropriate court clerk. A subpoena so issued shall have the same force and effect as if issued by the court. Any person failing to appear in response to a subpoena issued as provided in this section shall be punished as provided by law.

LEXIS 16567 (W.D. Va. 1982). Objective standard applied to determine whether statutory circumstances obtain.  Although § 19.2-74 refers to a predictive estimation of the accused persons future conduct, the standard for determining satisfaction of the statute is obj ective, whether evidence supports a reasonable belief that the statutory circumstances obtain. Fox v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 446, 598 S.E.2d 770, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 306 (2004). A police officer is entitled to detain briefly an individual who has committed an offense, in order to obtain information required for the issuance of a summons; the arresting officer had probable cause to charge defendant with violating a city ordinance, pedestrian in the roadway, and after informing defendant that he intended to is sue him a summons, the officer legally detained him. Beale v. Commonwealth, No. 1412-96-1 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 1, 1997). This statute does not contemplate a custodial situation equivalent to an actual custodial arrest, and under it, a suspect is detained, or in the custody of the po lice officer, only long enough for the officer to take down the name and address of the person and issue a summons.

CASE NOTES Purpose of section.  The purpose of requiring a copy of a criminal process to be left with a defendant is to inform him of the specific charge made against him so that he may intellig ently prepare his defense. Dorchincoz v. Commonwealth, 191 Va. 33, 59 S.E.2d 863, 1950 Va. LEXIS 195 (1950); Gooch v. City of Lynchburg, 201 Va. 172, 110 S.E.2d 236, 1959 Va. LEXIS 208 (1959); Hammer v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 135, 148 S.E.2d 878, 1966 Va. LEXIS 198 (1966). This section merely provides for the service of process against a person charged with a criminal offense once process is actually issued. It is not directed to or intended to be determinative of whether or not written notice or warrant must be issued before an accused may be tried for a misdemeanor. Gooch v. City of Lynchburg, 201 Va. 172, 110 S.E.2d 236, 1959 Va. LEXIS 208 (1959). This section does not apply to an indictment. Rose v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 771, 55 S.E.2 d 33, 1949 Va. LEXIS 216 (1949). Compliance with the section is not jurisdictional, and objection to noncompliance is wai ved if not taken advantage of at the trial. Rose v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 771, 55 S.E.2d 33, 1949 Va. LEXIS 216 (1949). But is presumed.  Where there is no showing that the accused did not receive a copy of the original process under which he was apprehended, the presumption is that this section was complied with. Rose v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 771, 55 S.E.2d 33, 1949 Va. LEXIS 216 (1949). Failure to comply is not necessarily reversible error.  While it is the duty of the arresting officer to comply with this section, his failure to do so does not constitute reversible error unless it affirmatively appea rs that defendant was prejudiced thereby. Dorchincoz v. Commonwealth, 191 Va. 33, 59 S.E.2d 863, 1950 Va. LEXIS 195 (1950); Hammer v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 135, 148 S.E.2d 878, 1966 Va. LEXIS 198 (1966).

Formal warrant unnecessary when summons is issued under former § 46.1-178 (now § 46.2-936).  The clear and necessary implication to be drawn from this section, when read along with former § 46.1-178 (now § 46.2-936), which provides for the issuance of a summons for misdemeanors under former Title 46.1 (now Title 46.2), is that when a summons is issued under former § 46.1-178 (now § 46.2-936) there is no need for the issuance or service of a formal warrant.

A warrant or capias shall be executed by the arrest of the accused, and a summons shall be execut ed by delivering a copy to the accused personally. If the accused is a corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or legal entity other than an individual, a summons may be executed by service on the entity in the same manner as provided in Title 8.01 for service of process on that entity in a civil proceeding. However, if the summons is served on the entity by delivery to a registered agent or to any other agent who is not an officer, director, managing agen t or employee of the entity, such agent shall not be personally subject to penalty for failure to appear as provided in § 19.2-128, nor shall the agent be subject to punishment for contempt for failure to appear under his summons as provided in § 1 9.2-129.

Hudson, 549 F. Supp. 949, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16567 (W.D. Va. 1982). An accused may waive irregularities in the warrant of his arrest, and where he has done so, and the justice has jurisdiction of his person and of the offense with which he is charged, and hears the charge on its merits, the judgment of the justice is final and conclusive, and the guilt or innocence of the accused of that charge can never ag ain be called in question. Jones v. Morris, 97 Va. 43, 33 S.E. 377, 1899 Va. LEXIS 9 (1899). Arresting officers failure to take defendant before a magistrate in the county or corporation in which the accused was arrested, as required by this section, was a mere procedural violation of this section which did not prejudice defendant and which did not involve an error of constitutional dimension giving rise to an application of the exclusionary rule. Tharp v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 487, 270 S.E.2d 752, 1980 Va. LEXIS 268 (1980). Effect of delay in taking defendant before magistrate.  Where defendant was legally seized and constitutionally detained, delay in taking him before a magistrate did not mean that the probable cause to hold him for the crimes stated in the warrants somehow evaporated, so as to require exclusion of the evidence developed during his detention. Horne v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 512, 339 S.E.2d 186, 1986 Va. LEXIS 139 (1986). In the Commonwealth, not every violation of the requirement that a suspect be taken before a magistrate without unnecessary delay results in the exclusion of evid ence. Horne v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 512, 339 S.E.2d 186, 1986 Va. LEXIS 139 (1986). Where defendant was unlawfully arrested in Berryville, subsequently held in custody on Fairfax County warrants and ultimately transported to Fairfax County where he was admitted to bail, the failure of Berryville or Fairfax County officers to take him before a magistrate in Clarke County violated the clear directive in this section. However, the failure to abide by the statute was a mere procedural violation whic h did not involve an error of constitutional dimension giving rise to an application of the exclusionary rule. The delay in taking defendant before a magistrate, although a patent violation of statute, did not abridge his Eighth Amendment rights. Terrell v. Commonwealth, No. 0230-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). The clear legislative mandate in this section was not followed, where from the time Berryville officers took defendant into custody, at some time after 1:00 p.m., until the Fairfax County officers arrived at approximately 5:15 p.m., defendant was not taken before a magistrate. Given the affirmative obligation on law-enforcement officers imposed by this section, the Commonwealth bore the burden of showing the unav ailability of such official. Therefore, Berryville officers violated this section. The Fairfax County officers also violated this section when they took custody of defendant and transported him back to their jurisdiction without first taking him before a magistrate in Clarke County. Terrell v. Commonwealth, No. 0230-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Procedural error.  Arresting officers failure to take defendant before a magistrate in the county or corporation in which the accused was arrested as required by this section wa s a mere procedural error and suppression of evidence and statements was not warranted as a result.

Commonwealth, 208 Va. 3 40, 157 S.E.2d 198, 1967 Va. LEXIS 222 (1967); Reyes v. Slayton, 331 F. Supp. 325, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11822 (W.D. Va. 1971). Close pursuit is pursuit instituted immediately and with intent to recapture or reclaim, as where a thief is fleeing with stolen goods. Reyes v. Slayton, 331 F. S upp. 325, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11822 (W.D. Va. 1971). Officer was in close pursuit where he was directly behind defendant the entire time he followed him, and he activated his lights as soon as it was safe to pull defendant over. Hamm v. City of Norton, No. 1607-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 28, 1999). Circuit court properly overruled defendants motion to suppress because, assuming without deciding that a Virginia Military Institute police officer arrested d efendant outside of his territorial jurisdiction, the issuance of an arrest warrant by a judicial officer cured any defect in the arrest, defendant never challenged the magistrates finding of probable cause or the validity of the warrant upon which h e was tried, and there was no legal basis for defendants assertion that he was denied procedural due process and that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress inasmuch as he had a full and fair opportunity to attempt to prove or disp rove any prejudicial effect of the violation.

CASE NOTES Term forthwith, as used in § 19.2-82, is synonymous with standard used in this section, and the same remedies for a violation of this section should apply to a violation of § 19.2-82. Slade v. Commonwealth, No. 0786-85 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 4, 1987). Officer cannot hold prisoner unreasonable time before making return.  Under this section there must be a reasonable time allowed for making return of the warrant of arrest, and some latitude must be given the officers in keeping a p risoner in custody after he has been arrested and before he is taken to the justice. But it is not permissible to trifle with him, and detain and interrogate him, for the ulterior purpose of extracting a confession as to his own guilt, or getting informa tion from him as to the guilt of others, and it matters not at all that the process of arrest was in its inception regular and valid, and that it was obtained on probable cause. Sands &amp; Co. v. Norvell, 126 Va. 384, 101 S.E. 569, 1919 Va. LEXIS 102 (1919) . False imprisonment may result not only from the arrest of a person without any valid war rant, but also from the unlawful detention of a prisoner who has been lawfully arrested. Unreasonable delay in presenting a prisoner for examination or trial, and a fortiori mistreatment after arrest followed by release without any hearing before the mag istrate, are instances in point. Sands &amp; Co. v. Norvell, 126 Va. 384, 101 S.E. 569, 1919 Va. LEXIS 102 (1919). Statement admissible despite delay.  Failure promptly to present a defendant as required by this section is a mere procedural violation where it involves no constitutional error, thus, a statement ob tained without infringing constitutional safeguards is admissible. Alatishe v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 376, 404 S.E.2d 81, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2508, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 87 (1991). Even where appeals court assumed without deciding that the delay in bringing a defendant before the magistrate violated § 19.2-80, such violation did not requi re exclusion of his statements. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 640 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 22, 2002). Where defendant was taken before a magistrate only 15 minutes after his arrest, evidence obtained pertaining to the case should not have been suppressed as the product of a violation of this section. Pearson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 936, 275 S.E.2d 893, 1981 Va. LEXIS 231 (1981). Appearance before magistrate did not constitute hearing contemplated by this section.  Where plaintiff who had served sentence was arrested under bench warrant mistakenly issued for failure to serve such sentence, appearance before night magistrate who did nothing beyond signing a form committing the plaintiff to jail, did not constitute the advertisement hearing contemplated by this section. McDonald v. Dunning, 760 F. Supp. 1156, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3951 (E.D. Va. 1991). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Delay.  Five hour and 47 minute delay in presenting defendant to a magistrate did not constitute unnecessary delay proscribed by this section because the bulk of the dela y was due to defendants medical treatment by emergency personnel at the scene and at a hospital, caused by defendants strange and erratic behavior. Commonwealth v. Long, 88 Va. Cir. 335, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 24 (Roanoke County June 18, 2014).

A person ar rested without a warrant shall be brought forthwith before a magistrate or other issuing authority having jurisdiction who shall proceed to examine the officer making the arrest under oath. If the magistrate or other issuing authority having jurisdiction has lawful probable cause upon which to believe that a criminal offense has been committed, and that the person arrested has committed such offense, he shall issue either a warrant under the provisions of § 19.2-72 or a summons under the provisions o f § 19.2-73.As used in this section the term brought before a magistrate or other issuing authority having jurisdiction shall include a personal appearance before such authority or any two-way electronic video and audio communication meeting t he requirements of § 19.2-3.1, in order that the accused and the arresting officer may simultaneously see and speak to such magistrate or authority. If electronic means are used, any documents filed may be transmitted in accordance with § 19.2-3.1. If a warrant is issued the case shall thereafter be disposed of under the provisions of §§ 19.2-183 through 19.2-190, if the issuing officer is a judge; under the provisions of §§ 19.2-119 through 19.2-134, if the issuing officer is a magistr ate or other issuing officer having jurisdiction.If such warrant or summons is not issued, the person so arrested shall be released. B. A warrant m ay be issued pursuant to this section, where the person has been arrested in accordance with § 19.2-81.6, and the magistrate or other issuing authority examines the officer making the arrest under oath, and finds lawful probable cause to believe the a rrested individual meets the conditions of clauses (i) and (ii) of § 19.2-81.6. If such warrant is issued, it shall recite § 19.2-81.6 and the applicable violation of federal criminal law previously confirmed with Immigration and Customs Enforcemen t.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2A M.J. Arrest, §§ 8, 12; 5B M.J. Criminal Procedure, §§ 13, 17, 19, 21; 19 M.J. Warrants, § 2. CASE NOTES Term forthwith, as used in this section, is synonymous with standard used in § 19.2-80, and the same remedies for a violation of § 19.2-80 should apply to a violation of this section. Slade v. Commonwealth, No. 0786-85 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 4, 1987). Failure promptly to present defendant as required by this section is a mere procedural violation where it involves no constitutional error. Frye v. Commonwealth, 231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267, 1986 Va. LEXIS 204 (1986). Delay in presentment violates constitution only if exculpatory evidence thereby lost.  While, under Virginia law, an arresting officer must take an accused before a judicial officer with reasonable promptness and without unreasonable delay, violatio n of this requirement reaches constitutional dimension only if it results in the defendants loss of exculpatory evidence. Frye v. Commonwealth, 231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267, 1986 Va. LEXIS 204 (1986). And evidence need not be excluded unless loss of exculpatory evidence results.  A violation of the prompt presentment provision of this section does not require the exclusion of evidence unless the violation caused a loss of exculpatory evide nce. Jumper v. Commonwealth, No. 0497-85 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1986). Failure to have ac cused appear before magistrate.  Where the officer who had arrested the defendant for driving while intoxicated had appeared before a magistrate and obtained a warrant for the defendants arre st without the defendant being present, it was undeniable that the probable cause determination did not adhere to the procedure set forth in this section but this violation alone did not constitute reversible error where it did not infringe any constitut ional right of the defendant. Jones v. Town of Marion, 28 Va. App. 791, 508 S.E.2d 921, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 15 (1999), aff'd, 259 Va. 7, 524 S.E.2d 866, 2000 Va. LEXIS 15 (2000). Effect of delay in taking defendant before magistrate.  Where defendant was legally seized and constitutionally detained, delay in taking him before a magistrate did not mean that the probable cause to hold him for the crimes stated in the warrants somehow evaporated, so as to require exclusion of the evidence developed during his detention. Horne v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 512, 339 S.E.2d 186, 1986 Va. LEXIS 139 (1986). In the Commonwealth, not every violation of the requirement that a suspect be taken before a magistrate without unnecessary delay results in the exclusion of evid ence. Horne v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 512, 339 S.E.2d 186, 1986 Va. LEXIS 139 (1986). Confessions held not excludable despite unreasonable delay.  Assuming, without deciding, that the arresting officers failed to present defendant to the magistrate before an unreasonable period of time had elapsed, thereby v iolating this section, this violation does not result in exclusion of the confession obtained from him in the interim interrogation. Frye v. Commonwealth, 231 Va. 370, 345 S.E.2d 267, 1986 Va. LEXIS 204 (1986). Warrant issued after arrest irrelevant in false arrest action.  In an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that defendant officer denied plaintiff due process by subjecting him to a false arrest for being drunk in public, the arrest warrant issued by the magistrate subsequent to the arrest did not establish as a matter of law that probable cause existed for the defendant to arrest the plaintiff. Robinson v. Goff, 517 F. Supp. 350, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12804 (W.D. Va. 19 81). When a defendant officer in a civil action relies upon probable cause as a defense to a charge of illegal arrest under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, he must establish that probable cause existed at the time the arrest was made. A warrant, subsequently issued by a magistrate, is irrelevant to the determination of whether the officer arresting an individual without a warrant had probable cause to arrest. Robinson v. Goff, 5 17 F. Supp. 350, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12804 (W.D. Va. 1981). Search incident to illegal arrest.  Warrantless arrest for driving with a suspended license was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, even if it was not permitted under § 19.2-74. Therefore, the crack cocaine and cash that the arrestee was carrying and that was discovered in a search incidental to the arrest did not need to be suppressed. Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 128 S. Ct. 1598, 170 L. Ed. 2d 559, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 3674 (2008). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Delay.  Even assuming that the delay in taking defendant to the magistrate was unnecessary, there was only a procedural violation that did not amount to a constitutional error and, suppression of evidence and statements was not warranted as a result. Commonwealth v. Arava, 56 Va. Cir. 240, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 133 (Arlington County June 29, 2001). Five hour and 47 minute delay in presenting defendant to a magistrate did not constitute unnecessary delay proscribed by this section because the bulk of the dela y was due to defendants medical treatment by emergency personnel at the scene and at a hospital, caused by defendants strange and erratic behavior. Commonwealth v. Long, 88 Va. Cir. 335, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 24 (Roanoke County June 18, 2014). No cautionary instruction necessary.  Code does not require the magistrate to give any particularly cautionary instruction to defendant during the course of a hearing under the statute. Commonwealth v . McDowell, 101 Va. Cir. 125, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 14 (Norfolk Jan. 29, 2019). Motion to supress denied.  It was proper for the detective to summarize the evidence of probable cause to the magistrate with defendant present, and although not required by statute, the ma gistrate reminded defendant that anything he said in response could be used against him, and thus his statement was not obtained in violation of his rights and his motion to suppress was denied. Commonwealth v. McDowell, 101 Va. Cir. 125, 2019 Va. Cir. L EXIS 14 (Norfolk Jan. 29, 2019). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Virginia law-enforcement officers have authority to d etain and arrest individuals who have committed violations of the laws of the United States and other states, and such authority extends to violations of federal criminal immigration law. It would not be advisable to enforce such violations outside of the scope of an agr eement with federal authorities. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Kenneth W. Stolle, Member, Senate of Virginia, and The Honorable David B. Albo, Member, House of Delegates, 07-086 (10/15/07).

Rev. 1477 (1991). CASE NOTES Matters of extradition are constitutionally controlled by U.S. Const., Art. IV, § 2, cl. 2. They are statutorily controlled by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (this article) and the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (§ 53.1-210 et seq.). Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23693 (E.D. Va. 1985). Governor of asylum state must make findings and conclusions.  While the Constitution mandates that a fugitive in one state shall be returned to the demanding state, the Governor of the asylum state must make factual findings and legal conclusions following specific inquiries prior to granting extradition. First, he must determine whether the accused has been charged with a crime under the laws of the demanding state, and second, whether the accused was within the de manding state at the time of the offense. The former is generally a question of law but it may be a question of fact. The latter is generally a question of fact. The Governors factual determination may not be set aside unless it appears conclusively that the accused could not be a fugitive. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23693 (E.D. Va. 1985). Governors determination of probable cause precludes further judicial inquiry in asylum state.  Once the Governor of the asylum state has acted on a requisition for extradition based on the demanding states judicial determination that probable cause exis ted, no further judicial inquiry may be had on that issue in the asylum state. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23693 (E.D. Va. 1985). Habeas court in asylum state cannot discharge person arrested on merely contradictory evidence.  A habeas court in an asylum state cannot discharge one who has been arrested under a governors warrant where there is merely contradictory evidence on the sub ject of presence in or absence from the State, as habeas corpus is not the proper proceeding to try the question of alibi, or any question as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Only when it is conclusively proved that no question can be made that the person was not within the demanding state when the crime is said to have been committed is he to be released. Manning v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 60, 334 S.E.2d 151, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 61 (1985). Only function of an Attorney General, in extradition proceedings, is to assist the Gover nor in determining whether extradition ought to be granted. In this sense, he is entitled to absolute immunity because of the quasi-judicial function he is performing. If it be deemed that his duty in this connection be that of an advocate, he is entitle d to the absolute immunity accorded public prosecutors. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23693 (E.D. Va. 1985). Immunity of Governor and Attorney General where statutory duty breached.  If the Governor and Attorney General, in acting on an extradition request, breach some statutory duty or are derelict in their statutory duties, they are, neverth eless, entitled to absolute immunity from damages. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23693 (E.D. Va. 1985). Governor immune since he acts in judicial capacity.  When the Governor of an asylum state acts on an extradition request he performs a judicial function. Accordingly, he would be entitled to absolute immunity in car rying out this function. Arebaugh v. Dalton, 600 F. Supp. 1345, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23693 (E.D. Va. 1985). Judicial immunity of magistrate ordering temporary confinement of extradited prisoner.  Even if, as prison inmate contended, state magistrates have no authority under the Virginia Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (UCEA) (this article) to order tempor ary confinement of extradited prisoners, judicial immunity would still be appropriate. The very applicability of the UCEA with regard to the inmates transfer represented an unsettled and disputed point of law. In contrast, the general authority of ma gistrates to commit persons accused of crimes to jail is well established in Virginia by statute. Pressly v.

Mental competency.  In an extradition proceeding where the mental competency of the detainee is placed in issue, due process compels the court to first determine whether the detainee is sufficiently irrational to compel a mental health evaluation; if such threshold is met, the detainee is entitled to a limited mental health evaluation, to determine whether he or she can assist counsel with the narrow inquiry of whether he or she is the person sought by the demanding jurisdiction and was present at the offense. Solomon v. Kincaid, 105 Va. Cir. 166, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 68 (Fairfax County Apr. 30, 2020).

Petitioner was entitled to a mental health evaluation limited to whether he could assist counsel to determine whether he was the person wanted by New Jersey and w as present in that state at the time of the alleged offense because he exhibited sufficient irrationality; petitioner displayed consistent indicia of irrational thought and behavior sufficient to compel the circuit court to direct a limited competency ev aluation.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Cash or surety bond release.  Circuit court found that release of defendant under supervised release and a personal recognizance bond was appropriate because there was no constitutional right to cash bail and the imposition of a cash or surety bond release term upon defendant, who was determined to be indigent, would have been an unconstitutional application of the Virginia statutory bail bond scheme in derogation of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.

Any person arrested for a felony who has previously been convicted of a felony, or who is presently on bond for an unrelated arrest in any jurisdiction, or who is on probation or parole, may be released only upon a secure bond. This provision may be waived with the approval of the judicial officer and with the concurrence of the attorney for the Commonwealth or the attorney for the county, city or town. Subject to the foregoing, when a person is arrested for either a felony or a misdemeanor, any judicial officer m ay impose any one or any combination of the following conditions of release: 1. Place the person in the custody and supervision of a designated person, organization or pretrial services agency which, for the purposes of this section, shall not include a court services unit established pursuant to § 16.1-233; 2. Place restrictions on the travel, association or place of abode of the person during the period of release and restrict contacts with household members for a specified period of time; 2a. Require the execution of an unsecured bond; 3. Require the execution of a secure bond which at the option of the accused shall be satisfied with sufficient solvent sureties, or the deposit of cash in lieu thereof. Only the actual v alue of any interest in real estate or personal property owned by the proposed surety shall be considered in determining solvency and solvency shall be found if the value of the proposed suretys equity in the real estate or personal property equals o r exceeds the amount of the bond; 3a. Require that the person do any or all of the following: (i) maintain employment or, if unemployed, actively seek employment; (ii) maintain or commence an educational program; (iii) avoid all contact with an alleged victim of the crime and with any potential witness who may testify concerning the offense; (iv) comply with a specified curfew; (v) refrain from possessing a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon; (vi) r efrain from excessive use of alcohol, or use of any illegal drug or any controlled substance not prescribed by a health care provider; and (vii) submit to testing for drugs and alcohol until the final disposition of his case; 3b. Place a prohibition on a person who holds an elected constitutional office and who is accused of a felony arising from the performance of his duties from physically returning to his constitutional office; 3c. Require the accused to accompany the arresting officer to the jurisdictions fingerprinting facility and submit to having his photograph and fingerprints taken prior to release; or 4. Impose any other condition deemed reasonably necessary to assure appearance as required, and to assure his good behavior pending trial, including a condition requiring that the person return to custody after specified hours or be placed on home electronic incarceration pursuant to § 53.1-131.2 or, when the person is required to execute a secured bond, be subject to monitoring by a GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking device, or other similar device. The defendant may be ordered by the court to pay the cost of the device.Upon satisfaction of the terms of recognizance, the accused shall be released forthwith.In addition, where the accused is an individual receiving services in a state training center for individuals with intellectual disability, the judicial officer may place the individual in the custody of the director of the training center, if the director agrees to accept custody. The director is hereby authorized to take custody of the individual and to maintain him at the training center prior to a trial or hearing under such circumstances as will reasonably assure the appearance of the accused for the trial or hearing. B. In any juri sdiction served by a pretrial services agency which offers a drug or alcohol screening or testing program approved for the purposes of this subsection by the chief general district court judge, any such person charged with a crime may be requested by suc h agency to give voluntarily a urine sample, submit to a drug or alcohol screening, or take a breath test for presence of alcohol. A sample may be analyzed for the presence of phencyclidine (PCP), barbiturates, cocaine, opiates or such other drugs as the agency may deem appropriate prior to any hearing to establish bail. The judicial officer and agency shall inform the accused or juvenile being screened or tested that test results shall be used by a judicial officer only at a bail hearing and only to de termine appropriate conditions of release or to reconsider the conditions of bail at a subsequent hearing. All screening or test results, and any pretrial investigation report containing the screening or test results, shall be confidential with access th ereto limited to judicial officers, the attorney for the Commonwealth, defense counsel, other pretrial service agencies, any criminal justice agency as defined in § 9.1-101 and, in cases where a juvenile is screened or tested, the parents or legal gua rdian or custodian of such juvenile. However, in no event shall the judicial officer have access to any screening or test result prior to making a bail release determination or to determining the amount of bond, if any. Following this determination, the judicial officer shall consider the screening or test results and the screening or testing agencys report and accompanying recommendations, if any, in setting appropriate conditions of release. In no event shall a decision regarding a release determi nation be subject to reversal on the sole basis of such screening or test results. Any accused or juvenile whose urine sample has tested positive for such drugs and who is admitted to bail may, as a condition of release, be ordered to refrain from use of alcohol or illegal drugs and may be required to be tested on a periodic basis until final disposition of his case to ensure his compliance with the order. Sanctions for a violation of any condition of release, which violations shall include subsequent p ositive drug or alcohol test results or failure to report as ordered for testing, may be imposed in the discretion of the judicial officer and may include imposition of more stringent conditions of release, contempt of court proceedings or revocation of release. Any test given under the provisions of this subsection which yields a positive drug or alcohol test result shall be reconfirmed by a second test if the person tested denies or contests the initial drug or alcohol test positive result. The result s of any drug or alcohol test conducted pursuant to this subsection shall not be admissible in any judicial proceeding other than for the imposition of sanctions for a violation of a condition of release. C. [Repealed.] D. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an officer taking a juvenile into custody from releasing that juvenile pursuant to § 16.1-247. If any condition of release imposed under the provisions of this section is violated, a judicial officer may issu e a capias or order to show cause why the recognizance should not be revoked. E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a court from imposing a recognizance or bond designed to secure a spousal or child support obligation pursuant to § 16.1-278.16, Chapter 5 (§ 20-61 et seq.) of Title 20, or § 20-114 in addition to any r ecognizance or bond imposed pursuant to this chapter.

Seemes, 38 Va. (11 Leigh) 665, 18 41 Va. LEXIS 22 (1841); Archer's Case, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 705, 1849 Va. LEXIS 88 (1849). What evidence to be considered.  When a prisoner, who has been remanded for trial by the examining court to the higher court, on a charge of felony, and against whom a bill of indictment has been found by the grand jury, applies to the higher court to be let to bail, on the ground that there is only a slight suspicion of guilt against him, that judgment, and the finding of the bill, are not conclusive evidence against the application, but the co urt may examine other evidence. It is a question for the exercise of the sound discretion of the court, and if the court is satisfied that there is material evidence for the Commonwealth that is not before the court, was not before the examining court, o r spread on the record, the court ought not to sustain the motion. Commonwealth v. Rutherford, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 646, 1826 Va. LEXIS 87 (1826). Revocation of bail appealable.  The revocation of a defendants bail has the same effect as a denial of bail and is appealable under this section. Dorsey v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 154, 526 S.E.2d 787, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 254 (2000). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Stay of execution discretionary.  Under subsection C of § 19.2-124, the General Assembly intended to keep in place the circuit courts traditional inherent discretionary authority to stay it s order, and thus, for appeals of presumption of bail cases, the authority of the circuit courts to stay execution of the courts decision remains, and it remains discretionary; defendants motion to lift stay of order was denied. Commonwealth v. J ohnson, 107 Va. Cir. 387, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Fairfax County Mar. 25, 2021). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Civil proceeding.  Appeal of a determination of bond from a general district court to a circuit court is civil in nature; therefore, the fees and costs for such appeal should be cal culated, taxed, and collected as a civil proceeding.

Rich. L. Rev. 149 (2008). CASE NOTES Willfully, as used in subsection A of this section, has the customary meaning th at the act must have been done purposely, intentionally, or designedly. Hunter v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 717, 427 S.E.2d 197, 9 Va. Law Rep. 858, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 33 (1993). Construction.  Courts cannot create ambiguity by straining to interpret a statute whose understanding requires no such exertion, and there is no ambiguity to resolve within the statute. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 211 (Va. Ct. App. July 7, 2015), aff'd, 292 Va. 738, 793 S.E.2d 321, 2016 Va. LEXIS 181 (2016). Fundamentally, § 19.2-128 does not require the Commonwealth to prove where someone was, only where someone was not. Although a court dismissing a failure to ap pear charge is free to announce a finding that the defendant was present in a certain location instead of in court, it is not required to make such a finding. Winder v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 6, 2018). Defendant did not violate this section because the statute did not apply to revocation proceedings, and therefore it was error to convict her of failure to appear . Because defendant was improperly convicted of conduct not proscribed by the statute under which she was charged, the ends of the justice exception of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 applied; even though defendant failed to raise the ends of justice exception, be cause the Commonwealth raised the exception the court could utilize it. Merritt v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 452, 820 S.E.2d 379, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (2018). Notice of continuances.  An accused who is given notice of the original trial date is charged with notice of those dates to which his or her case is expressly continued when such action i s duly recorded in the order of the court; also if the attorney had actual notice of the clients trial date, the fact finder may infer from that evidence that the client also had actual notice of the trial date. Hunter v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 71 7, 427 S.E.2d 197, 9 Va. Law Rep. 858, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 33 (1993). Continuance no relief from appearance requirement.  Pre-trial continuance of the jury trial scheduled for January 10, 1992, did not relieve the defendant, who had been declared a fugitive, from appearing on January 10, 1992, as required by his bond; the appellant was required to appear on this date under the terms of his bond as charged in the indictment. Sloan v. Commonwealth, No. 0934-93-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 4, 1994). Judicial notice.  Trial court did not err in taking notice of its judicial records and the facts regarding the date and time of defendants scheduled hearings because the trial court reasonably concluded that (1) the Commonwealth requested it take judicial notice of the entire record regarding defendants failure to appear, (2) the trial court took such notice, and (3) the statements of the trial court, more specifically the facts recited by the trial court in rendering its decision, and the evidence and arguments of the parties demonstrated clearly that the trial court was taking note of its entire record. Williams v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 750, 706 S.E.2d 530, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 96 (2011). Multiple convictions.  Trial court did not err in finding defendant guilty of three counts of felony failure to appear because the multiple convictions did not violate the Double Jeopar dy Clauses of the United States Constitution or the Virginia Constitution; defendant had three different obligations to appear and faced three distinct criminal allegations with different elements of proof, and in failing to appear as to each underlying felony, he prevented a hearing as to each of the three charges. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 211 (Va. Ct. App. July 7, 2015), aff'd, 292 Va. 738, 793 S.E.2d 321, 2016 Va. LEXIS 181 (2016). Legislature intended the unit of prosecution in the statute to correspond to the number of underlying offenses for which a defendant is obligated to appear; a sin gle act of failure to appear may result in multiple convictions for failure to appear when each such count is based on a distinct underlying felony. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 211 (Va. Ct. App. July 7, 2015), aff'd, 292 Va. 738, 793 S.E .2d 321, 2016 Va. LEXIS 181 (2016). Legislature chose to criminalize the failure to appear of anyone charged with a felony offense, rather than, for example, with any felony offense or with felony offenses; legislatures use of the words a felony offense evinces an intent that the unit of prosecution for failure to appear corresponds to the number of individual felony offenses for which a defendant is obligated to appear. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 211 (Va. Ct. App. July 7, 2015), aff'd, 292 Va. 738, 793 S.E.2d 321, 2016 Va. LEXIS 181 (2016). Defendants double jeopardy rights were not violated when he was convicted of three counts of felony failure to appear because three separate summonses indepen dently required defendant to appear, each felony charge had separate consequences and effects, the fact that defendants three separate felonies were scheduled to be heard at one time did not change the result, and the net effect of defendants wil lful failure to appear were three distinct injuries to the administration of justice even if the injuries occurred at the same time. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 292 Va. 738, 793 S.E.2d 321, 2016 Va. LEXIS 181 (2016). Applicable to defendant who has pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing.  Trial court did not err in holding that the failure to appear statute, subsection B of § 19.2-128, applied to a person such as defendant, who had pled guilty a nd was awaiting sentencing when defendant failed to appear. If the statute was not read to apply to those people who had pled guilty and were awaiting sentencing, no repercussions would attach to a defendant who pled guilty and did not show up at sentenc ing, which would require the absurd result that the trial court would have no alternative but to jail such people until sentencing. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 102, 654 S.E.2d 354, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 461 (2007). Evidence was sufficient to establish willful failure to appear, etc.  where the defendant had notice of the original trial date, all continuances were duly recorded by order of the court, thereby charging the defendant with notice of the trial date, and defense counsel was aware of the trial date and, in fact, had asked for it. Poindexter v. Commonwealth, No. 0457-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 27, 1999). Evidence supported defendants conviction for a subsection B of § 19.2-128 violation as defendant willfully failed to appear since: (1) a bail bond agreemen t was introduced, which provided that defendant could not leave the Commonwealth; (2) defendant understood that defendant could not leave the Commonwealth; (3) defendant went to New York twice; and (4) defendant failed to contact the clerks office or defendants appointed counsel after defendant was arrested in New York on both visits. Deslandes v. Commownealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 352 (Va. Ct. App. July 8, 2008). Evidence that defendant knew his hearing date and did not appear in court on that date supported the trial courts conclusion that his failure to appear was wi llful and thus, the evidence supported his conviction. Brown v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (Va. Ct. App. July 21, 2015). Defendant was properly convicted of felony failure to appear because the evidence was sufficient to establish that his failure to appear was willful where he did not appear for trial, the only evidence concerning whether defendant had notice of the trial date was a note in the trial courts file, of which the trial court took judicial notice under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 2:201 without objection, indicating that defend ant contacted the trial court minutes before the trial was set to commence and informed it that he was running late, and, based on that message, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to conclude that he had notice o...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-129"><akn:num>§ 19.2-129</akn:num><akn:heading>Power of court to punish for contempt</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Nothing in this chapter shall interfere with or prevent the exercise by any court of the Commonwealth of its power to punish for contempt, except that a person shall no t be sentenced for contempt and under the provisions of § 19.2-128 for the same absence.

If the defendant or juvenile is brought before the court within 150 days of the findings of default, the court shall dismiss the default upon the filing of a motion by the party in default. After 150 days of the finding of default, his default shall be recorded therein, and if it is to appear before a district court, his default shall be entered by the judge of such court, on the case papers unless the defendant or juv enile has been delivered or appeared before the court. The process on any such forfeited recognizance shall be issued from the court before which the appearance was to be, and wherein such forfeiture was recorded or entered. Any such process issued by a judge shall be made returnable before, and tried by, such judge, who shall promptly transmit to the clerk of the circuit court of his county or city wherein deeds are recorded an abstract of such judgment as he may render thereon, which shall be forthwit h docketed by the clerk of such court.

At such time, the court shall issue a notice to pay within 10 business days to any employer of such bail bondsman if a property bondsman. If the forfeiture is not paid within 10 business days of the notice to pay, licenses of the employer of the ba il bondsman and agents thereof shall be suspended in accordance with § 9.1-185.8. If the defendant or juvenile appears before or is delivered to the court within 24 months of the findings of default, the court shall remit any bond previously ordered forfeited by the courts, less such costs as the court may direct. If it is brought to the attention of the court that the defendant or juvenile is incarcerated in another state or country within 48 months of the finding of default, th ereby preventing his delivery or appearance within that period, the court shall remit any bond previously ordered forfeited. If the defendant or juvenile left the Commonwealth with the permission of the court, the bond shall be remitted without deduction of costs; otherwise, the cost of returning him to the Commonwealth shall be deducted from the bond. Evidence that the defendant or juvenile is incarcerated or subject to court process in another jurisdiction on the day his appearance is required or a medical certifica te from a duly licensed physician that the defendant was physically unable to so appear shall be considered evidence of good cause why the recognizance should not be forfeited. If such recognizance so forfeited is not for such appearance, process thereon shall be issued from the court in which it was taken, or the court to which it was made re turnable, and in a proceeding in one court on a recognizance entered in another a copy thereof shall be evidence in like manner as the original would be if it had been entered in the court wherein the proceeding is being had thereon.

CASE NOTES Bail revocation and bond forfeiture proceedings may be combined.  While nothing in the statutes requires that a bail revocation proceeding and a bond forfeiture proceeding be combined for hearing, nothing forbids such a procedur e. Heacock v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 235, 321 S.E.2d 645, 1984 Va. LEXIS 194 (1984) (decided prior to the 1987 amendment). Improper to use finding of probable cause to revoke bail as proof in bond forfeiture proceeding.  The surety was denied procedural due process in a bond forfeiture hearing by the treatment of the finding of probable cause in the bail revocation hearing as prim a facie proof for purposes of the bond forfeiture proceeding. Heacock v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 235, 321 S.E.2d 645, 1984 Va. LEXIS 194 (1984) (decided prior to the 1987 amendment). Ju dge need not find accused guilty of crime to revoke bail.  To revoke bail, the judge is not required to find that the accused was guilty of a crime or that a breach of the good behavior condition upon which he had been admitted to bail has been established by a preponderance of the evidence. Heacock v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 235, 321 S.E.2d 645, 1984 Va. LEXIS 194 (1984). Standard of proof in bail revocation and bond forfeiture proceedings compared.  Probable cause is the standard of proof in a bail revocation proceeding. On the other hand, the effort of the Commonwealth to collect a debt due by reason of the forfeiture of the recognizance is a matter purely civil, and the Commonwealth must prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Heacock v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 235, 321 S.E.2d 645, 1984 Va. LEXIS 194 (1984) (decided prior to the 1987 amendment). Burden of proof.  The movant in a show-cause proceeding has the burden of proving the premise of the show-cause order, and, if the movant makes a prima facie case, the burden shift s to the other party to go forward with the evidence. Heacock v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 235, 321 S.E.2d 645, 1984 Va. LEXIS 194 (1984).

Bail and Recognizance, § 20. CASE NOTES Court has discretion.  The statute invests the courts with discretionary powers to meet the exigencies of particular cases by remitting the penalty in whole or in part, and rendering ju dgment on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonable. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 698, 1858 Va. LEXIS 57 (1858); Bolanz v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 31, 1873 Va. LEXIS 3 (1873); Bowling v. Commonwealth, 123 Va. 340, 96 S.E. 739, 1918 Va. LEXIS 34 (1918). This section, which is an extension of the common-law rule, invests the courts with discretionary power to meet the exigencies of the particular case. Bisping v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 753, 240 S.E.2d 656, 1978 Va. LEXIS 143, cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1007, 98 S. Ct. 1878, 56 L. Ed. 2d 389, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 1700 (1978). Section does not apply when final judgment entered.  The discretion vested in the trial court by this section is limited to cases in which there is a pending action or scire facias on the recognizance which has been forfeited, and does not extend to cases in which final judgment has been entered in the action or scire facias. In the latter class of cases the recognizance, as such, no longer remains in court. Jordan v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 560, 115 S.E. 569, 1923 V a. LEXIS 42 (1923). This is true where the trial court did not pass on the merits of the case, but denied relief solely on the ground that it had no control over the final judgment o n the scire facias which had been entered at a former term. Jordan v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 560, 115 S.E. 569, 1923 Va. LEXIS 42 (1923). Impossibility of performance as excuse for breach.  Bail will generally be exonerated from liability where the performance of the conditions of the recognizance are rendered impossible by the act of God, the act of the law, or the act of the obligee. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 698, 1858 Va. LEXIS 57 (1858); Bowling v. Commonwealth, 123 Va. 340, 96 S.E. 739, 1918 Va. LEXIS 34 (1918). The prisoners confinement in the state correctional facility for another felony having rendered it impossible for him to appear at the court at the time presc ribed by the recognizance, it constitutes a good defense for the bail to the scire facias. Caldwell v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 698, 1858 Va. LEXIS 57 (1858). Where the bail was guilty of no negligence whatever, and, without fault on his part, the attorney for the Commonwealth, with full knowledge of the facts voluntari ly suffered the principal to be taken out of the control of his bondsmen by federal authority, by which act the latter was rendered powerless to produce the principal at the time and place of trial the bail should be exonerated from liability upon recogn izance. Bowling v. Commonwealth, 123 Va. 340, 96 S.E. 739, 1918 Va. LEXIS 34 (1918). It is not competent for the accused to absolve himself or his bail by accepting a federal office. Bolanz v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 31, 1873 Va. LEXIS 3 (1873). Discretion not abused.  Where the record conclusively showed that the principal, while on bail, violated the specific good behavior condition of the recognizances by committing additiona l crimes of the same nature and character as his earlier convictions, and no evidence was adduced at the scire facias (now motion to extend) hearing by either the principal or the surety in explanation, excuse, mitigation or palliation of the principal s flagrant violation of the condition, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to remit the whole or any part of the forfeiture. Bisping v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 753, 240 S.E.2d 656, 1978 Va. LEXIS 143, cert. denied, 435 U.S. 1007, 98 S. Ct. 1878, 56 L.

CASE NOTES The words action or judgment as used in this section are broad enough to include a proceeding by scire facias. The award of execution on a recognizance is commonly spoken of as a judgment on a scire facias. Walker v. Commonwealth, 144 Va. 648, 131 S.E. 230, 1926 Va. LEXIS 280 (1926). Substantially sufficient.  A recognizance is not invalid because it required defendant in a prosecution for violation of the prohibition law to appear not before the court or any court, but only before the judge of the court, and, it appearing that the recognizance was taken by a court, or officer, authorized to take it, the recognizance was certainly substantially sufficient within this section. Alls v. Commonwealth, 131 V a. 640, 108 S.E. 645, 1921 Va. LEXIS 53 (1921). A substantially sufficient memorandum of the recognizance taken by a justice of the peace, is protected under this section. Walker v. Commonwealth, 144 Va. 648, 1 31 S.E. 230, 1926 Va. LEXIS 280 (1926). Recognizance held not substantially sufficient as required by this section. Commonwealth v. Fulks, 94 Va. 585, 27 S.E. 498, 1897 Va. LEXIS 111 (1897). Variance held immaterial.  Pursuant to this section and §§ 19.2-135 and 19.2-136, it was held that where the condition of the recognizance of one accused of a felony was for his perso nal appearance to answer the charge against him, and the language of the scire facias of such recognizance was for his personal appearance to answer as of a felony whereof he stands accused, the variance was immaterial, no form of languag e being prescribed for the recognizance. Allen v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 356, 18 S.E. 437, 1893 Va. LEXIS 60 (1893). For other instances of variance between the scire facias and the recognizance, see Wood v. Commonwealth, 25 Va.

A bail bond sman or his licensed bail enforcement agent on a bond in a recognizance may at any time arrest his principal and surrender him to the court before which the recognizance was taken or before which such principals appearance is required, or to the sher iff, sergeant or jailer of the county or city wherein the court before which such principals appearance is required is located; in addition to the above authority, upon the application of the surety, the court, or the clerk thereof, before which the recognizance was taken, or before which such principals appearance is required, or any magistrate shall issue a capias for the arrest of such principal, and such capias may be executed by such bail bondsman or his licensed bail enforcement agent, or by any sheriff, sergeant or police officer, and the person executing such capias shall deliver such principal and such capias to the sheriff or jailer of the county or the sheriff, sergeant or jailer of the city in which the appearance of such principal is required, and thereupon the surety or the property bail bondsman shall be discharged from liability for any act of the principal subsequent thereto. Upon application of the surety for a capias, the surety shall state the basis for which the capias is being requested. Such sheriff, sergeant or jailer shall thereafter deliver such capias to the clerk of such court, with his endorsement thereon acknowledging delivery of such principal to his custody.If a magistrate issues a capias pursuant to this secti on, the magistrate shall transmit a copy of the capias to the court before which such principals appearance is required by the close of business on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or day on which the court is lawfully clos ed. B. If a bail b ondsman on a bond in a recognizance surrenders his principal for any reason other than the principals failure to appear in any court, the bondsman shall deposit with the clerk or magistrate the greater of 10 percent of the amount of the bond or $50, which shall be made at such time the bondsman makes application for a capias. The bondsman shall petition the court within 15 days from the surrender of the principal to show cause, if any can be shown, why the bondsman is entitled to the amount deposite d. If the court finds that there was sufficient cause to surrender the principal, the court shall return the deposited funds to the bondsman. If the court finds that the surrender of the principal by the bondsman was unreasonable, the deposited funds sha ll be returned to the payer. Remission of funds shall not be issued by the court until the sixteenth day after the finding. If the bondsman does not petition the court for the return of the deposited funds within 15 days from the surrender of the princip al, the deposited funds shall be paid into the state treasury to be credited to the Literary Fund.

The fact finder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant detained the victim, by force, without legal justification, and with the intent to deprive him of his personal liberty. Th e evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the bondsman committed abduction. Perry v. Commonwealth, No. 0237-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals July 9, 1996). Fugitive recovery agent ex ceeded authority.  Evidence was sufficient to convict a fugitive recovery agent of violating § 18.2-174 in connection with his stop of a vehicle in which he thought a fugitive mi ght be riding, as he exceeded the scope of the authority granted him under this section and by: (1) wearing a misleading badge representing that he was part of a special investigations unit of a law-enforcement body; (2) by stating that he was wi th a violent crimes unit; and (3) by interrogating the woman he stopped about her possible drunk driving after he realized that the fugitive was not in the car.

CASE NOTES Section accords with policy of the law .  Private adjustment of prosecutions for misdemeanors, provided for by this section, is in accord with the general policy of the law. Of course, compounding or conc ealing crimes, or stifling prosecutions to defeat the ends of justice, will not be permitted, but in prosecutions not involving any great offense against the public, the courts will encourage settlements between the parties as less injurious to the publi c than litigation. Glidewell v. Murray-Lacy &amp; Co., 124 Va. 563, 98 S.E. 665, 1919 Va. LEXIS 148 (1919). It applies to mi sdemeanors involving civil wrongs.  This section applies to those classes of misdemeanors which also involve the infliction of a civil wrong. The course adopted for the disposal of a criminal charge is set out in the statute and is judicial in nature. It contemplates acknowledgment of satisfaction for the civil wrong, and the dismissal of the criminal charge then rests in the judicial discretion of the justice (now judge or court). Darnell v. Davis , 190 Va. 701, 58 S.E.2d 68, 1950 Va. LEXIS 161 (1950). It may app ly though formalities not strictly followed.  The fact that the formalities of this section were not strictly followed will not prevent its application, where it appears that the aggrieved party received sati sfaction, appeared before the justice (now judge or court) and the warrant was dismissed. Orndorff v. Bond, 185 Va. 497, 39 S.E.2d 352, 1946 Va. LEXIS 222 (1946). And there may be est oppel to allege irregularity.  In an action for abuse of process, where defendants claimed that the settlement with plaintiff was in accordance with this section, plaintiff cannot complaint of an alleged irregularity in the dismissal of the warrant against him, when what was done was upon his own proposition. Glidewell v. Murray-Lacy &amp; Co., 124 Va. 563, 98 S.E. 665, 1919 Va. LEXIS 148 (1919). Dismissal of warrant is discretionar y.  Under the explicit terms of this section, the written request for dismissal of the warrant is addressed to the discretion of the judicial officer empowered to tak e the action authorized and allowed by law, and his action terminates the prosecution. Darnell v. Davis, 190 Va. 701, 58 S.E.2d 68, 1950 Va. LEXIS 161 (1950). And warrant may be dismissed though costs not paid.  There is no merit in the contention that a justice of the peace (now judge or court) has no right or jurisdiction to dismiss a warrant under this section where th e defendant fails to pay the costs accrued. Darnell v. Davis, 190 Va. 701, 58 S.E.2d 68, 1950 Va. LEXIS 161 (1950). Accord and satisfa ction letter a public record.  Forged accord and satisfaction letter presented to a general district court by defendant to obtain the dismissal of an assault and battery case pending against de fendant was a public record, even though the statutory requirements of personal appearance by the victim and acknowledgement by the victim were not met, was a public record as it was received in pursuance of law. Moreno v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 121, 775 S.E.2d 422, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 242 (2015).

Murray-Lacy &amp; Co., 124 Va. 563, 98 S.E. 665, 1919 Va. LEXIS 148 (1919). Settlement not a concealing or compounding of offense.  Defendants, who procured plaintiffs arrest for a misdemeanor, upon obtaining a settlement of their claim against plaintiff, had him released and the warrant d ismissed. It was held that the transaction did not fall within the condemnation of § 18.2-462 against concealing or compounding offenses, but was within the spirit, if not within the terms, of this section.

CASE NOTES This section and §§ 19.2-159 and 19.2-160 provide procedural guidelines which are not jurisdictional requirements. Compliance with the provisions of § 19.2-160, for example, may establish a prima facie case of waiver; noncompliance may make more difficult the Commonwealths burden of proving waiver. Van Sant v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 269, 295 S.E.2d 883, 1982 Va. LEXIS 291 (1982). No person may be deprived of his liberty who has been denied assistance of counsel as gu aranteed by the Sixth Amendment. This holding is applicable to all criminal prosecutions, including prosecutions for violations of municipal ordinances. The denial of the assistance of counsel will preclude the imposition of a jail sentence. Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 139 (1972). No imprisonment may be imposed at the trial of a misdemeanor, even though local law permits it, unless the accused is represented by counsel. Argersinger v. Hamli n, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 139 (1972). Absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, wh ether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless he was represented by counsel at his trial. Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 139 (1972). Noncompliance with section does not prove Commonwealth failed to establish waiver.  Although compliance with the requirements of this section and following sections may be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of waiver, and noncompliance ma y make it more difficult for the Commonwealth to meet its burden of establishing a waiver, noncompliance alone does not prove that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden of proving that the defendant waived his right to counsel.

Peyton, 360 F.2d 327, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6336 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 960, 87 S. Ct. 396, 17 L. Ed. 2d 305, 1966 U.S. LEXIS 209 (1966). Sections 19.2-157 through 19.2-161 deal with matters of procedure. Arey v. Peyton, 209 Va . 370, 164 S.E.2d 691, 1968 Va. LEXIS 242 (1968). No continuing obligation to represen t.  Under the facts of the instant case, the defendant was not deprived of effective representation of counsel because appointed counsel did not recognize a continuin g obligation of representation between stages of the proceedings. Jackson v. Cox, 435 F.2d 1089, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 5725 (4th Cir. 1970). Appointed counsel after defendant requested public defender.  Defendants right to counsel was violated when the trial court proceeded to trial without defendant being represented by counsel despite the fact that defendan t, who alleged defendant had retained counsel, requested a public defender and the record contained no facts supporting a conclusion that defendant was attempting to delay the proceedings or that defendant acted in bad faith. Fattaleh v. Commonwealth, 20 06 Va. App. LEXIS 391 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2006). An indigent accused is entitled to have counsel appointed at a preliminary hearing. The purpose of this rule is to protect the indigent accused against an erroneous or improper prosecution. This rule should apply only to those preliminary hearings held after June 22, 1970. Noe v. Cox, 320 F. Supp. 849, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9081 (W.D. Va. 1 970). Preliminar y hearing is critical stage of proceedings.  The preliminary hearing, even one whose sole purpose is merely to determine whether or not sufficient evidence exists to hold an accused, is a critical stage of t he proceedings. Grey v. Slayton, 345 F. Supp. 1278, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12707 (W.D. Va. 1972). But not retroactively.  The holding that a preliminary hearing, even one whose sole purpose is merely to determine whether or not sufficient evidence exists to hold an accused, is a crit ical stage is not retroactive. Grey v. Slayton, 345 F. Supp. 1278, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12707 (W.D. Va. 1972). Since the preliminary hearing in Virginia was not critical at the time of the hearing, then nonobservance of this section did not violate petitioners constitu tional rights. Grey v. Slayton, 345 F. Supp. 1278, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12707 (W.D. Va. 1972). Court-appointed investigator not constitutionally required.  An indigent defendant has no constitutional right to the appointment, at public expense, of an investigator to assist in his defense. When a trial court employs a n investigator at public expense, it is an act of judicial grace not constitutionally required. Stockton v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 124, 314 S.E.2d 371, 1984 Va. LEXIS 275, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 873, 105 S. Ct. 229, 83 L. Ed. 2d 158, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 365 ( 1984). Assist ance of counsel on motion to withdraw guilty pleas.  Because defendant was denied the constitutional right to be represented by counsel at the hearing on defendants motion to withdraw defendants guilty pleas , as defense counsel withdrew without offering argument on the motion and defendants newly appointed counsel could not then participate in the motion, remand was required for a rehearing on the motion in that defendant was denied the assistance of co unsel at a critical stage of the criminal proceeding. Owens v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 291 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 1, 2016). Right to counsel at both appella te levels.  This section, when considered with § 19.2-326, provides an indigent with a statutory right to court-appointed counsel at both appellate levels. Dodson v. Direc tor of Dep't of Cors., 233 Va. 303, 355 S.E.2d 573, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2403, 1987 Va. LEXIS 198 (1987). Court-appointed counsel on appeal.  This section, when considered with § 19.2-326, provides an indigent with a statutory right to court-appointed counsel at both appellate levels. Dodson v. Direc tor of Dep't of Cors., 233 Va. 303, 355 S.E.2d 573, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2403, 1987 Va. LEXIS 198 (1987). Failure to appoint counsel to assist indigent defendant in making appeal from a convicti on is a denial of equal protection and due process guaranteed to him under the federal Constitution and the Virginia Bill of Rights. Cabaniss v. Cunningham, 206 Va. 330, 143 S.E.2d 911, 1965 Va. LEXIS 202 (1965); Via v. Peyton, 208 Va. 387, 158 S.E.2d 12 7, 1967 Va. LEXIS 230 (1967).

For article discussing the requirement of counsel in misdemeanor cases and its implementation in Virginia, see 30 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 431 (1973). CASE NOTES Compliance with this section is a matter of state law, and where the state trial court d ecided after a hearing that the section was not violated, a federal court will not, in a habeas corpus proceeding, disturb that finding, unless the state criminal process, taken as a whole, impugns the concept of fundamental fairness. Barksdale v. Robins on, 397 F. Supp. 267, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11773 (W.D. Va. 1975). The constitutional right to counsel is satisfied if counsel is appointed in sufficient t ime to allow counsel to become familiar with the case, to confer with his client and to prepare for and participate in the trial. Even if a significant and unjustified delay in appointing counsel occurs, that delay does not rise to constitutional dimens ion if the record affirmatively shows that no prejudice resulted. Graves v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 53, 402 S.E.2d 500, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1889, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 38 (1991). Effect of failure to appoint counsel.  While there was a failure to appoint counsel for defendant charged with a felony on the first day a municipal court sat after petitioners arrest, as provided by this section and Rule 3A:5 (b) (1) (now repealed) of the Supreme Court, such a violation of the statute and rule does not affect the jurisdiction of a court of record to subsequently try defendant for a felony. Ferguson v. Superintendent of Va. State Penitentiary, 215 Va. 269, 208 S.E.2d 749, 1974 Va. LEXIS 272 (1974). The failure of the trial court to appoint counsel for the appellant until 25 days after his arrest, in violation of the requirements of this section, was not a de nial of his constitutional right to counsel warranting a reversal of his conviction for distribution of cocaine. Graves v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 53, 402 S.E.2d 500, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1889, 1991 Va.

If the accu sed shall claim that he is indigent, and the charge against him is a criminal offense that may be punishable by confinement in the state correctional facility or jail, subject to the provisions of § 19.2-160, the court shall determine from oral examin ation of the accused or other competent evidence whether or not the accused is indigent within the contemplation of law pursuant to the guidelines set forth in this section. B. In making i ts finding, the court shall determine whether or not the accused is a current recipient of a state or federally funded public assistance program for the indigent. If the accused is a current recipient of such a program and does not waive his right to cou nsel or retain counsel on his own behalf, he shall be presumed eligible for the appointment of counsel. This presumption shall be rebuttable where the court finds that a more thorough examination of the financial resources of the defendant is necessary. If the accused shall claim to be indigent and is not presumptively eligible under the provisions of this section, then a thorough examination of the financial resources of the accused shall be made with consideration given to the following: 1. The n et income of the accused, which shall include his total salary and wages minus deductions required by law. The court also shall take into account income and amenities from other sources including but not limited to social security funds, union funds, vet erans benefits, other regular support from an absent family member, public or private employee pensions, dividends, interests, rents, estates, trusts, or gifts. 2. All assets of the accused which are convertible into cash within a reasonable period of time without causing substantial hardship or jeopardizing the ability of the accused to maintain home and employment. Assets shall include all cash on hand as well as in checking and savings accounts, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, and tax refunds. All personal property owned by the accused which is readily convertible into cash shall be c onsidered, except property exempt from attachment. Any real estate owned by the accused shall be considered in terms of the amounts which could be raised by a loan on the property. For purposes of eligibility determination, the income, assets, and expens es of the spouse, if any, who is a member of the accuseds household, shall be considered, unless the spouse was the victim of the offense or offenses allegedly committed by the accused. 3. Any exceptional expenses of the accused and his family which would, in all probability, prohibit him from being able to secure private counsel. Such items shall include but not be limi ted to costs for medical care, family support obligations, and child care payments.The available funds of the accused shall be calculated as the sum of his total income and assets less the exceptional expenses as provided in the first paragraph of this s ubdivision 3. If the accused does not waive his right to counsel or retain counsel on his own behalf, counsel shall be appointed for the accused if his available funds are equal to or below 125 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines prescribed for the size of the household of the accused by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. The Supreme Court of Virginia shall be responsible for distributing to all courts the annual updates of the federal poverty income guidelines made by the Department.If the available funds of the accused exceed 125 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines and the accused fails to employ counsel and does not waive his right to counsel, the court may, in exceptional circumstances, and where the ends of justice so require, appoint an attorney to represent the accused. However, in making such appointments, the court shall state in writing its reasons for so doing. The written statement by the court shall be included in the permanent record of the cas e. C. If the cour t determines that the accused is indigent as contemplated by law pursuant to the guidelines set forth in this section, the court shall provide the accused with a statement which shall contain the following: I have been advised this day of , 20, by the (name of court) court of my right to representation by counsel in the trial of the charge pending against me; I certify that I am without means to employ counsel and I hereby request the court to appoint counsel for me. (signature of accused) Click to viewThe court shall also require the accused to complete a written financial statement to support the claim of indigency and to permit the court to determine w hether or not the accused is indigent within the contemplation of law. The accused shall execute the said statements under oath, and the said court shall appoint competent counsel to represent the accused in the proceeding against him, including an appea l, if any, until relieved or replaced by other counsel.The executed statements by the accused and the order of appointment of counsel shall be filed with and become a part of the record of such proceeding.All other instances in which the appointment of c ounsel is required for an indigent shall be made in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in this section. D. Except in j urisdictions having a public defender, or unless (i) the public defender is unable to represent the defendant by reason of conflict of interest or (ii) the court finds that appointment of other counsel is necessary to attain the ends of justice, counsel appointed by the court for representation of the accused shall be selected by a fair system of rotation among members of the bar practicing before the court whose names are on the list maintained by the Indigent Defense Commission pursuant to § 19.2-1 63.01. If no attorney who is on the list maintained by the Indigent Defense Commission is reasonably available, the court may appoint as counsel an attorney not on the list who has otherwise demonstrated to the courts satisfaction an appropriate leve l of training and experience. The court shall provide notice to the Commission of the appointment of the attorney. History History.

In the event the accused desires to waive his right to counsel, and the court ascertains that such waiver is voluntary and intelligently made, then the court shall prov ide the accused with a statement to be executed by the accused to document his waiver. The statement shall be in a form designed and provided by the Supreme Court. Any executed statement herein provided for shall be filed with and become a part of the record of such proceeding. In the absence of a waiver of counsel by the accused, and if he shall claim that he is indigent, the court shall proceed in the same manner as is provided in § 19.2- 159. Should the defendant refuse or otherwise fail to sign either of the statements described in this section and § 19.2-159, the court shall note such refusal on the rec ord. Such refusal shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to counsel, and the court, after so advising the accused and offering him the opportunity to rescind his refusal shall, if such refusal is not rescinded and the accuseds signature given, p roceed to hear and decide the case. However, if, prior to the commencement of the trial, the court states in writing, either upon the request of the attorney for the Commonwealth or, in the absence of the attorney for the Commonwealth, upon the court s own motion, that a sentence of incarceration will not be imposed if the defendant is convicted, the court may try the case without appointing counsel, and in such event no sentence of incarceration shall be imposed.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  Record did not support the conclusion that the statute applied to this case; not only did the circuit court not state in writing that a sentence of incarceration would not be imposed, but the circuit court judge also told defendant repeatedly that he could be sentenced to jail if he opted for a jury trial. Breznick v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 216 (Va. Ct. App. July 28, 2020). This section and §§ 19.2-157 and 19.2-159 provide procedural guidelines which are not jurisdictional requirements. Compliance with the provisions of this section, for example, may establish a prima facie case of waiver; noncompliance may make more difficult the Commonwealths burden of proving waiver. Van Sant v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 269, 295 S.E.2d 883, 1982 Va. LEXIS 291 (1982). Burden of proof of waiver.  Absent a knowing and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense unless he is represented by counsel at trial. The burden is on the Commonweal th to prove waiver of the right to counsel by clear, precise, and unequivocal evidence. Van Sant v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 269, 295 S.E.2d 883, 1982 Va. LEXIS 291 (1982). The burden is on the Commonwealth to prove waiver of the right to counsel by clear, precise and unequivocal evidence. Sargent v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 143, 360 S.E.2d 895, 4 Va. Law Rep. 762, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (1987). Right to counsel did not attach where defendant only sentenced to pay a fine.  Trial court did not err by admitting evidence of an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in order to elevate defendants third offense of petit larceny to a felo ny, where despite defendants contention to the contrary she did not have the right to counsel for a prior misdemeanor conviction, as she was only sentenced to pay a fine; moreover, any violation of the statutory right to counsel did not mandate exclu sion of the conviction order. Kapoor v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 557 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 16, 2004). Trial judges failure to advise petitioner of the hazards of a pro se defense, or to inquire whether petitioners choice to proceed pro se was an informed choice, or, indeed, even to acknowledge petitioners desire to waive counsel, taken together with the judges effort to force petitioner to proceed with counsel he did not wan t, deprived petitioner of his Sixth Amendment guarantees. Van Sant v. Gondles, 596 F. Supp. 484, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19610 (E.D. Va. 1983), aff'd, 742 F.2d 1450 (4th Cir. 1984). Trial judges failure to allow petitioner a continuance requested for purpose of preparing his own defense without even an inquiry into petitioners level of preparedness, taken in light of petitioners representations of unpreparedness, deprived petitioner of effective self-representation. Van Sant v. Gondles, 596 F. Supp. 484, 1 983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19610 (E.D. Va. 1983), aff'd, 742 F.2d 1450 (4th Cir. 1984). The fact that a defendant had other retained counsel representing her at trial in the general district court did not necessarily prove that she was ineligible to receive the benefit of court-appointed counsel on appeal to the circuit court. Lemke v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 870, 241 S.E.2d 789, 1978 Va. LEXIS 239 (1978). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Purpose.  Purpose of this section is to impose on the government, the prosecuting party, through the court, the duty to consider waiver of jail time when appropriate to con serve taxpayer funds. Commonwealth v. Thomas, 103 Va. Cir. 139, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 455 (Fairfax County Sept. 24, 2019). Construction.  Under a plain reading of this section, in such event refers not to the trial itself but to the operative factual decision of the lower court that states i n writing that a sentence of incarceration will not be imposed if the defendant is convicted; irrespective of whether the waiver comes at the behest of the Commonwealths Attorney or is product of the initiative of a court, the effect is the same: the Commonwealth waives incarceration once the court so affirms in writing.

CASE NOTES Failure of Commonwealth to show asset was readily convertible to cash.  In conviction for perjury based upon appellants statement of indigence for the appointment of counsel, the record failed to disclose that the motor vehicles u pon which the Commonwealth relied to support the conviction were available to appellant so as to be readily convertible to cash; therefore, there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. Smith v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 606, 405 S.E.2d 626, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2696, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 126 (1991). Evidence sufficient.  Defendant was properly convicted of perjury, under §§ 19.2-161 and 19.2-159, based on the false statements in defendants financial statements to determi ne indigency because defendant owned real estate when defendant signed under oath that defendant did not; § 19.2-159 does not require that real estate be readily convertible into cash.

Motion for Continuance, et seq. CASE NOTES In order to work a delay by the last minute change of counsel, exceptional circumstances must exist. Shifflett v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 25, 235 S.E.2d 316, 1977 Va. LEXIS 167 (1977). No adequate cause to delay trial.  There were no circumstances suggesting adequate cause to delay a trial on a motion for a continuance to enable the defendant to retain counsel of his own choosing , where the only ground assigned was that the defendant needed more time in preparing his defense, and where the record showed that the defendant had adequate time to prepare his defense if he had cooperated with his court-appointed attorney. Shifflett v . Commonwealth, 218 Va. 25, 235 S.E.2d 316, 1977 Va. LEXIS 167 (1977). Surprise.  When a litigant is surprised in the midst of a trial, that is precisely the situation in which a continuance may be appropriate. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 448, 374 S.E.2d 303, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1073, 1988 Va. LEXIS 157 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1028, 109 S. Ct. 1765, 104 L. Ed. 2d 200, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 1991 (1989), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 855, 113 S. Ct. 164, 121 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1992). Defendant could not successfully attack the trial courts decision to grant continuance on the ground that his right of surprise was undermined since there is no such right. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 448, 374 S.E.2d 303, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1073, 1988 Va. LEXIS 157 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1028, 109 S. Ct. 1765, 104 L. Ed. 2d 200, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 1991 (1989), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 855, 113 S. Ct. 164, 121 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1992). Discretion of trial court.  A motion for a continuance in order to obtain the presence of a missing witness is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court whose decision will not be reversed unless the record affirmatively shows an abuse of such discretion. Shifflett v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 25, 235 S.E.2d 316, 1977 Va. LEXIS 167 (1977); Van Sant v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 269, 295 S.E.2d 883, 1982 Va. LEXIS 291 (1982). The same standard of appellate review applies to the denial of a request for a recess during the trial as to a request for a continuance; the decision whether to grant a continuance is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court, and abuse of discretion and prejudice to the complaining party are essential to reversal. Lowery v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 304, 387 S.E.2d 508, 6 Va. Law Rep. 921, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 3 (1990). There was no abuse of discretion in the trial courts granting the Commonwealth a continuance from 12:25 p.m. on October 20, to the start of trial on October 21, in order to allow the authentication of important papers. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 448, 374 S.E.2d 303, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1073, 1988 Va. LEXIS 157 (1988), cert. denied , 490 U.S. 1028, 109 S. Ct. 1765, 104 L. Ed. 2d 200, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 1991 (1989), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 855, 113 S. Ct. 164, 121 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1992). The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing a continuance to obtain the presence of a missing witness where it was not indicated that the person whose presence was sought was a material witness, and where there was a lack of due diligence in obtaining his presence. Shifflett v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 25, 235 S.E.2d 316, 1977 Va. LEXIS 167 (1977). When the Commonwealth was obviously surprised by defendants evidence, the trial courts grant of a four-day continuance was not an abuse of discretion, des pite the fact that the jury had been empaneled. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 236 Va. 448, 374 S.E.2d 303, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1073, 1988 Va. LEXIS 157 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1028, 109 S. Ct. 1765, 104 L. Ed. 2d 200, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 1991 (1989), cert. deni ed, 506 U.S. 855, 113 S. Ct. 164, 121 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1992). Continuance properly granted.  Continuance was necessary where motion was made in order to secure the testimony of a material witness and a subpoena had been requested and issued, but service w as unobtainable due to the witness absence from the state, and there was no evidence that the defense encouraged and/or participated in the witness departure from the state. Cherricks v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 96, 396 S.E.2d 397, 7 Va. Law Rep . 506, 1990 Va.

In a district court, a sum not to exceed $120, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the court in its discretion, and subject to guidelines issued by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia, may waive the limitation of fees up to (i) an additional $120 when the effort expended, the time reasonably necessary for the particular representation, the novelty and difficulty of the issues, or other circumstances warrant such a waiver; or (ii) an amount up to $650 to defend, in th e case of a juvenile, an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult that may be punishable by confinement in the state correctional facility for a period of more than 20 years, or a charge of violation of probation for such offense, when the effort expended, the time reasonably necessary for the particular representation, the novelty and difficulty of the issues, or other circumstances warrant such a waiver; or (iii) such other amount as may be provided by law. Such amount shall be allowed in any case wherein counsel conducts the defense of a single charge against the indigent through to its conclusion or a charge of violation of probation at any hearing conducted under § 19.2-306; thereafter, compensation for additional charges against the same accused also conducted by the same counsel shall be allowed on the basis of additional time expended as to such additional charges; 2. In a circuit court (i) to defend a Class 1 felony charge, an amount deemed reasonable by the court; (ii) to defend a felony charge that may be punishable by confinement in the state co rrectional facility for a period of more than 20 years, or a charge of violation of probation for such offense, a sum not to exceed $1,235, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the court in its discretion, and subject to guidelines is sued by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia, may waive the limitation of fees up to an additional $850 when the effort expended, the time reasonably necessary for the particular representation, the novelty and difficulty of the issue s, or other circumstances warrant such a waiver; (iii) to defend any other felony charge, or a charge of violation of probation for such offense, a sum not to exceed $445, provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, the court in its discreti on, and subject to guidelines issued by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia, may waive the limitation of fees up to an additional $155 when the effort expended, the time reasonably necessary for the particular representation, the nov elty and difficulty of the issues, or other circumstances warrant such a waiver; and (iv) in the circuit court only, to defend any misdemeanor charge punishable by confinement in jail or a charge of violation of probation for such offense, a sum not to e xceed $158. In the event any case is required to be retried due to a mistrial for any cause or reversed on appeal, the court may allow an additional fee for each case in an amount not to exceed the amounts allowable in the initial trial. In the event cou nsel is appointed to defend an indigent charged with a felony that is punishable as a Class 1 felony, such counsel shall continue to receive compensation as provided in this paragraph for defending such a felony, regardless of whether the charge is reduc ed or amended to a lesser felony, prior to final disposition of the case. In the event counsel is appointed to defend an indigent charged with any other felony, such counsel shall receive compensation as provided in this paragraph for defending such a fe lony, regardless of whether the charge is reduced or amended to a misdemeanor or lesser felony prior to final disposition of the case in either the district court or circuit court.Counsel appointed to represent an indigent accused in a criminal case, who are not public defenders, may request an additional waiver exceeding the amounts provided for in this section. The request for any additional amount shall be submitted to the presiding judge, in writing, with a detailed accounting of the time spent and the justification for the additional amount. The presiding judge shall determine, subject to guidelines issued by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia, whether the request for an additional amount is justified in whole or in part, by considering the effort expended and the time reasonably necessary for the particular representation, and, if so, shall forward the request as approved to the chief judge of the circuit court or district court for approval.If at any time the funds appropr iated to pay for waivers under this section become insufficient, the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia shall so certify to the courts and no further waivers shall be approved.The circuit or district court shall direct the payment of su ch reasonable expenses incurred by such court-appointed counsel as it deems appropriate under the circumstances of the case. Counsel appointed by the court to represent an indigent charged with repeated violations of the same section of the Code of Virgi nia, with each of such violations arising out of the same incident, occurrence, or transaction, shall be compensated in an amount not to exceed the fee prescribed for the defense of a single charge, if such offenses are tried as part of the same judicial proceeding. The trial judge shall consider any guidelines established by the Supreme Court but shall have the sole discretion to fix the amount of compensation to be paid counsel appointed by the court to defend a felony charge that is punishable as a C lass 1 felony.The circuit or district court shall direct that the foregoing payments shall be paid out by the Commonwealth, if the defendant is charged with a violation of a statute, or by the county, city or town, if the defendant is charged with a viol ation of a county, city or town ordinance, to the attorney so appointed to defend such person as compensation for such defense.Counsel representing a defendant charged with a Class 1 felony may submit to the court, on a monthly basis, a statement of all costs incurred and fees charged by him in the case during that month. Whenever the total charges as are deemed reasonable by the court for which payment has not previously been made or requested exceed $1,000, the court may direct that payment be made as otherwise provided in this section.When such directive is entered upon the order book of the court, the Commonwealth, county, city or town, as the case may be, shall provide for the payment out of its treasury of the sum of money so specified. If the de fendant is convicted, the amount allowed by the court to the attorney appointed to defend him shall be taxed against the defendant as a part of the costs of prosecution and, if collected, the same shall be paid to the Commonwealth, or the county, city or town, as the case may be. In the event that counsel for the defendant requests a waiver of the limitations on compensation, the court shall assess against the defendant an amount equal to the pre-waiver compensation limit specified in this section for e ach charge for which the defendant was convicted. An abstract of such costs shall be docketed in the judgment docket and execution lien book maintained by such court.Any statement submitted by an attorney for payments due him for indigent representation or for representation of a child pursuant to § 16.1-266 shall, after the submission of the statement, be forwarded forthwith by the clerk to the Commonwealth, county, city or town, as the case may be, responsible for payment.For the purposes of this s ection, the defense of a case may be considered conducted through to its conclusion and an appointed counsel entitled to compensation for his services in the event an indigent accused fails to appear in court subject to a capias for his arrest or a show cause summons for his failure to appear and remains a fugitive from justice for one year following the issuance of the capias or the summons to show cause, and appointed counsel has appeared at a hearing on behalf of the accused.Effective July 1, 2007, t he Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia shall track and report the number and category of offenses charged involving adult and juvenile offenders in cases in which court-appointed counsel is assigned.

CASE NOTES Transcribed testimony properly admitted.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the transcribed testimony of the victim; although the interpreter had difficulty conveying a precise transla tion of some words and concepts, the interpreter performed her duties within reasonable limits of accuracy. Majette v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 512 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 20, 2002). Adequate interpreter services pr ovided.  Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to set aside the jurys verdict finding him guilty of involuntary manslaughter and reckless driving in a case where defendant, a Somalia native who had been in the United States for six years and who understood English, struck and fatally injured a pedestrian while defendant was driving a taxicab; defendants due process rights were not violated becau se he was provided with adequate interpreter services and the evidence showed that he understood the trial process, which meant he was given a fair chance to defend himself against the States accusations. Takow v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 25 5 (Va. Ct. App. June 6, 2006). Interpreter not required.  Trial courts decision not to provide the victim with a translator during the victims testimony did not violate § 19.2-164, because the witness clearly understood what was asked of him, and although the witness may have spoken with some minor imperfections, those imperfections did not establish that the victim was a non-English speaking person as set forth in § 19.2-164. Tharp v. Commonwealth, 2011 V a. App. LEXIS 308 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 11, 2011). Challenges to interpreter waived.  Because defendant made no objection at a preliminary hearing to the victims use of an interpreter pursuant to § 19.2-164, defendants arguments challeng ing the interpreter were waived under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18. McDowell v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 253 (Va. Ct. App. June 9, 2009). § 19.2-164.1. Interpreters for the deaf (Supreme Court Rule 2:507 derived in part from this section). Text In any criminal case in which a deaf person is the accused, an interpreter for the deaf person shall be appointed. In any criminal case in which a deaf person is the vi ctim or a witness, an interpreter for the deaf person shall be appointed by the court in which the case is to be heard unless the court finds that the deaf person does not require the services of a court-appointed interpreter and the deaf person waives h is rights. Such interpreter shall be procured by the judge of the court in which the case is to be heard through the Department for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing. The compensation of an interpreter appointed by the court pursuant to this section shall be fixed by the court and paid from the general fund of the state treasury as p art of the expense of trial. Such fee shall not be assessed as part of the costs. Any person entitled to the services of an interpreter under this section may waive these services for all or a portion of the proceedings. Such a waiver shall be made b y the person upon the record after an opportunity to consult with legal counsel. A judicial officer, utilizing an interpreter obtained in accordance with this section, shall explain to the deaf person the nature and effect of any waiver. Any waiver shall be approved in writing by the deaf persons legal counsel. If the person does not have legal counsel, approval shall be made in writing by a judicial officer. A person who waives his right to an interpreter may provide his own interpreter at his own expense without regard to whether the interpreter is qualified under this section. The provisions of this section shall apply in both circuit courts and district courts. Whenever a person communicates through an interpreter to any person under such circumstances that the communication would be privileged, and such person could not be co mpelled to testify as to the communications, this privilege shall also apply to the interpreter. In any judicial proceeding, the judge on his own motion or on the motion of a party to the proceeding may order all of the testimony of a deaf person and the interpreta tion thereof to be visually electronically recorded for use in verification of the official transcript of the proceedings.

CASE NOTES This section is plain. Hudgins v. Circuit Court, 294 F. Supp. 258, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7989 (E.D. Va. 1968). Refusal to provide an indigent defendant with a free transcript constitutes a denial of constitutional rights. Cabaniss v. Cunningham, 206 Va. 330, 143 S.E.2d 911, 1965 Va. LEXIS 202 (1965). As does counsels failure to advise of right to such transcript.  An indigent defendant is denied his constitutional right to a free transcript where his counsel fails to advise him of this right. Cabaniss v. Cunningham, 206 Va. 330, 143 S.E.2d 911, 1965 Va. LEXIS 202 (1965). And it makes no difference that court-appointed counsel may think there are no grounds for review. Cabaniss v. Cunningham, 206 Va. 330, 143 S.E.2d 911, 1965 Va. LEXIS 202 (1965). Nor does it matter whether the trial judge may think an appeal to be frivolous. Cabaniss v. Cunningham, 206 Va. 330, 143 S.E.2d 911, 1965 Va. LEXIS 202 (1965). In camera hearing.  The in camera hearing was a stage of the trial where something could be done to affect the defendants interests, therefore, the defendant was entitled to have a court reporter present. The in camera hearing was not merely to determine a legal question. Testimony was heard to determine whether appellant was promised immunity from prosecution. Defense counsel was given the right to cross-examine the witness. The witness was taken to the judges chambers for the purpose of asking him substantive evidentiary questions. Brittingham v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 530, 394 S.E.2d 336, 7 Va. Law Rep. 32, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 125 (1990). Section inapplicable in habeas corpu s.  This section is not applicable to the initial request for a transcript if for the purpose of habeas corpus. McLaren v. Peyton, 262 F. Supp. 120, 1966 U.S. Dist. L EXIS 7492 (W.D. Va. 1966). No provision is made for a transcript of the evidence of the criminal trial for use in applying for habeas corpus. Hudgins v. Circuit Court, 294 F. Supp. 258, 196 8 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7989 (E.D. Va. 1968); Hogan v. Aiken, 339 F. Supp. 1005, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15103 (W.D. Va. 1972). The use of a narrative statement is recognized by Sup. Ct. Rule 5:9 as a proper method o f furnishing a record of evidence and incidents of trial for appeal. Houghtaling v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 309, 163 S.E.2d 560, 1968 Va. LEXIS 232 (1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 1021, 89 S. Ct. 1642, 23 L. Ed. 2d 46, 1969 U.S. LEXIS 1758 (1969). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Court has discretion in choosing and contracting for private court reporting services.  It is within the discretion of the court to establish procedures for choosing and contracting for private court reporting services, and the court may exercise its discretion in choosing those people it determines to be trustworthy for the task. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clifford R. Weckstein, Judge, Twenty-Third Judicial Circuit, 02-004 (4/12/02). § 19.2-165.1. Payment of medical fees in certain criminal cases; reimbursement. Text A. Except as p rovided in subsection B, all medical fees expended in the gathering of evidence for all criminal cases where medical evidence is necessary to establish a crime has occurred and for cases involving abuse of children under the age of 18 shall be paid by th e Commonwealth out of the appropriation for criminal charges, provided that any medical evaluation, examination, or service rendered be performed by a physician or facility specifically designated by the attorney for the Commonwealth in the city or count y having jurisdiction of such case for such a purpose. If no such physician or facility is reasonably available in such city or county, then the attorney for the Commonwealth may designate a physician or facility located outside and adjacent to such city or county.Where there has been no prior designation of such a physician or facility, such medical fees shall be paid out of the appropriation for criminal charges upon authorization by the attorney for the Commonwealth of the city or county having juris diction over the case. Such authorization may be granted prior to or within 48 hours after the medical evaluation, examination, or service rendered. B. All medical fees expended in the gathering of evidence through physical evidence recovery kit examinations conducted on victims complaining of sexual assault under Article 7 (§ 18.2-61 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 18.2 shall be paid by the Commonwealth pursuan t to subsection F of § 19.2-368.11:1.

For an article, An End to Insanity: Recasting the Role of Mental Disability in Criminal Cases, see 86 Va. L. Rev. 1199 (2000). CASE NOTES Article sets forth procedu re for commitment.  This article sets forth the procedure for the commitment to a state hospital for observation of a person charged with crime when there is reason to believe that h is mental condition makes such confinement necessary. Barber v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 241, 142 S.E.2d 484, 1965 Va. LEXIS 192 (1965). This section is merely declaratory of the common law. Delp v. Commonwealth, 172 Va. 564, 200 S.E. 594, 1939 Va. LEXIS 260 (1939); Thomas v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 934, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6525 (4th Cir. 1963). Insanity and feeblemindedness are placed on the same plane with respect to criminal liab ility. Graham v. Gathright, 345 F. Supp. 1148, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13271 (W.D. Va. 1972). Commitment proceedings as to persons accused of crime are for their protection. Timmons v . Peyton, 240 F. Supp. 749, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7004 (E.D. Va. 1965), rev'd, 360 F.2d 327, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6336 (4th Cir. 1966). What emerges from this humane legislation is the assurance by the Commonwealth that one whose mental capacity to cope with the exigencies of a trial is in doubt shall not be put in jeopardy without a preliminary inquiry into his present mental condition. Thomas v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 934, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6525 (4th Cir. 1963); Kibert v . Peyton, 383 F.2d 566, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 5196 (4th Cir. 1967). An accused is presumed to be sane at trial unless his mental condition is called into qu estion by proof to the contrary. Thomas v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 934, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6525 (4th Cir. 1963); Poteat v. Peyton, 270 F. Supp. 220, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8688 (W.D. Va. 1967); Jefferson v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 747, 204 S.E.2d 258, 1974 V a. LEXIS 215 (1974). But he mus t have opportunity to raise issue of insanity.  While efforts to overcome the presumption of sanity may be circumscribed by state prescriptions as to the quantum of proof and legal tests of insanity, procedural due process requires that a state shall afford an accused adequate opportunity to raise the issue. Thomas v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 934, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6525 (4th Cir. 1963). Or the protection is illusory.  The protection afforded the defendant by this section is illusory, however, if, when a reasonable doubt as to his sanity arises, neither court nor counsel seeks t o utilize the procedures provided by the state for determining competency. Kibert v. Peyton, 383 F.2d 566, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 5196 (4th Cir. 1967). Separate hearing on issue of sanity was unjustified where the court, upon the concurrenc e of two qualified psychologists, considered defendant mentally competent to stand trial for murder, and the jury affirmed such a conclusion. Wilson v. Cox, 312 F. Supp. 209, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12048 (W.D. Va. 1970). Availability of psychiatric testim ony.  The right to a judicial determination of fitness to stand trial is not to be confused with the contention that a state is constitutionally obligated to provide at public expense the services of psychiatrists whose expert testimony may later prove useful in establishing the affirmative defense of lack of criminal responsibility. While the availability of such evidence at state expense may be invaluable to an indig ent accused unable to employ his own psychiatrists, this would appear to be a merely incidental consequence of the primary statutory objective of preserving his right to a fair trial by first resolving his mental capacity to understand the charges and th e nature of the proceedings against him. Thomas v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 934, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6525 (4th Cir. 1963). Ake v. Oklahoma to be applied prospectively.  The rule announced in Ake v. Oklahoma , 105 S. Ct. 1087 (1985) (that due process of law was denied where no psychiatrist was appointed to examine the defendant, to help him prepare his case, to serve as an expert witness for the defense, and to assist in the defense a t trial) should be applied only to those cases tried subsequent to Feb. 26, 1985. Snurkowski v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 532, 341 S.E.2d 667, 348 S.E.2d 1, 3 Va. Law Rep. 79, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 303 (1986). Refusal to appoint second psychiatrist not error.  The trial court did not err in refusing to appoint a second independent private psychiatrist, where soon after defendant was formally charged, his counsel moved f or the appointment of a private psychiatrist to examine and evaluate the defendant and to aid in his defense and that motion was granted. Ake v. Oklahoma , 470 U.S. 68, 105 S. Ct. 1087, 84 L. Ed. 2d 53 (1985) does not require the appointment of a psychiatrist of the defendants choice. The United States Supreme Court was careful not to prescribe the m ethod for the selection of the independent psychiatrist. Beaver v. Commonwealth, 232 Va. 521, 352 S.E.2d 342, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1717, 1987 Va. LEXIS 163, cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1033, 107 S. Ct. 3277, 97 L. Ed. 2d 781, 1987 U.S. LEXIS 3041 (1987). Plea of guilty by insane defendant.  A man whose mind is so crippled by psychosis that he cannot understand the proceedings or confer intelligently about the case is in no position to plead guilty or to consent to such a plea in his behalf. If a trial court accepts a plea of guilty from such a man, the resulting judgment is vulnerable to collateral attack. Thomas v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 934, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6525 (4th Cir. 1963). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS De fendant entitled to additional examination and testing.  Indigent defendant was entitled to a neurological examination and testing and reexamination of his competency to stand trial and sanity at the time of the offense because he showed a particularized need for the additional testing when the doctor who initially examined him testified that the additional tests would allow him to provide a more definitive opinion. Commonwealth v. Mallory, 97 Va. Cir. 113, 2012 Va. Ci r. LEXIS 206 (Hanover County 2012). Defendant competent to stand trial.  Defendant did not meet his burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence that he was not competent to stand trial because the court found the testimony a nd opinions of the physician who opined that defendant was not incompetent to be more credible and persuasive than that of the physician who opined that defendant was not competent, and the court found that whatever issues defendant may have had with his counsel he had the capacity to represent himself and the desire and constitutional right to do so.

However, if the period between indictmen t and trial is less than 120 days, the person or his counsel shall give such notice no later than 60 days following indictment.

CASE NOTES Statute inapplicable i n juvenile proceedings.  The reference in this section to any person who intends to raise an insanity defense does not include juveniles, and such a defense may not be raised in d elinquency proceedings. Commonwealth v. Chatman, 260 Va. 562, 538 S.E.2d 304, 2000 Va. LEXIS 131 (2000). Refusal to allow defendant to adduce evidence of insanity at trial.  Trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to adduce evidence of insanity at trial because although her counsel initially filed notice of his intentio n to introduce insanity evidence, that notice was withdrawn and repudiated by defendant when she began representing herself and formally withdrew the insanity defense. Given the time elapsed, the trial court reasonably concluded it was inappropriate to c ontinue the matter yet again to accommodate another shift in defense strategy. Barksdale v. Commonwealth, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 126 (Va. Ct. App. July 20, 2021). Commonwealth e ntitled to other sanity evaluations.  Subsection E of § 19.2-169.5 clearly provides that the Commonwealth is entitled not only to the report ordered under § 19.2-169.5, but also to the results o f any other evaluation of the defendants sanity when notice is given by the defense pursuant to this section; subsection E of § 19.2-169.5 cannot be read as applying only to the report ordered. Blevins v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 429, 399 S.E.2d 173, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1156, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 230 (1990). Disclo sure of mental health records to the Commonwealth.  Psychiatric, psychological, medical, and other records produced by the mental health experts in the course of fulfilling their court-ordered responsibilities unde r § 19.2-169.5 are protected under that statute from being disclosed to the Commonwealth until the defendant gives notice under this section. Schwartz v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 407, 611 S.E.2d 631, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (2005). Plea of not guilty by reason of insanity not required to preserve defense of ins anity. Thus, trial judge erred when he ruled that the trial could not proceed in an orderly fashion on the defendants insanity defense unless the defendant entered a formal plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. Jones v. Commonwealth, 28 V a. App. 444, 506 S.E.2d 27, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 543 (1998). Equal protection not denied.  Defendant juvenile was not denied his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 because he had no right in juvenile court to assert an insanity defense to attempting to poison his mothers tea with intent to kill or injure her in violation of § 18.2-54.1 as defendant suffered no disparate treatment as he had the same ability as an adult to assert an insanity defense under § 19.2-168 in the trial court, but he did not exercise his right under § 16.1-270 to be tried as adult and to assert the insanity defense available to him under the adult system. D.L.G. v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. App. 77, 724 S.E.2d 208, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 123 (2012 ). Expert evidence inadmissible.  Trial court did not err by finding that, under Stamper, defendants expert evidence related to his mental state and mens rea was inadmissible because, although he pleaded involuntary intoxication, he did not plead insanity and did not follow the statutory requirements for putting forward an insanity defense. Schmuhl v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 281, 818 S.E.2d 71, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (2018), aff'd, 298 Va. 131, 833 S.E.2d 885, 2019 Va. LEXIS 147 (2019), dismissed, No. CL-2021-2333, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 182 (Fairfax County Aug. 26, 2021). § 19.2-168.1. Evaluation on motion of the Commonwealth after notice. Text A. If the atto rney for the defendant gives notice pursuant to § 19.2-168, and the Commonwealth thereafter seeks an evaluation of the defendants sanity at the time of the offense, the court shall appoint one or more qualified mental health experts to perform suc h an evaluation. The court shall order the defendant to submit to such an evaluation and advise the defendant on the record in court that a refusal to cooperate with the Commonwealths expert could result in exclusion of the defendants expert evid ence. The qualification of the experts shall be governed by subsection A of § 19.2-169.5. The location of the evaluation shall be governed by subsection B of § 19.2-169.5. The attorney for the Commonwealth shall be responsible for providing the exp erts the information specified in subsection C of § 19.2-169.5. After performing their evaluation, the experts shall report their findings and opinions, and provide copies of psychiatric, psychological, medical or other records obtained during the cou rse of the evaluation to the attorneys for the Commonwealth and the defense. The evaluator shall also send a redacted copy of the report removing references to the defendants name, date of birth, case number, and court of jurisdiction to the Commissi oner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services for the purpose of peer review to establish and maintain the list of approved evaluators described in subsection A of § 19.2-169.5. B. If the cour t finds, after hearing evidence presented by the parties, that the defendant has refused to cooperate with an evaluation requested by the Commonwealth, it may admit evidence of such refusal or, in the discretion of the court, bar the defendant from prese nting expert psychiatric or psychological evidence at trial on the issue of his sanity at the time of the offense.

Zahradnick, 572 F.2d 443, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 12933 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 920, 98 S. Ct. 2270, 56 L. Ed. 2d 762, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 1947 (1978) (decided under repealed § 19.2 -169). Li ability for expenses where hospitalized under Title 37.2.  A person is liable for the expenses of his care, treatment, and maintenance when confined to a state hospital pursuant to former Title 37.1 [now Title 37.2], even though he previously had been confined to the facility pursuant to former § 19.2-169 as a person charged with crime. Commonwealth, Dep't of Mental Health &amp; Mental Retardation v. Jenkins, 224 Va. 456, 297 S.E.2d 692, 1982 Va. LEXIS 315 (1982). Refusal to cooperate with Commonwealths mental health expert.  Based on defendants admissions to an inmate that defendants only chance to get less than 20 years was to act strangely, and to the trial court that defend ant understood that a refusal to cooperate with the Commonwealths mental health expert could result in exclusion of defendants own experts opinion, the trial court did not err in finding that any mental illness asserted by defendant did not p reclude defendant from cooperating with the Commonwealths expert. Grattan v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 516 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2008), aff'd, 278 Va. 602, 685 S.E.2d 634, 2009 Va. LEXIS 103 (2009). Exclusion of experts testimony under § 19.2-168.1 was affirmed because having found defendant competent to stand trial, it was reasonable for the court to conclude that defendant understood the courts repeated instructions that he was required to cooperate with the Commonwealths mental health evaluators and its constant warnings about the potential ramifications of his refusal to do so.

(Effective until July 1, 2023) Raising question of competency to stand trial or plead; evaluation and determination of competency. Text A. Raising com petency issue; appointment of evaluators.  If, at any time after the attorney for the defendant has been retained or appointed and before the end of trial, the court finds, upon hearing evidence or representations of counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Commonwealth, that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant, whether a juvenile transferred pursuant to § 16.1-269.1 or adult, lacks substantial capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist his attorney in his own defense, the court shall order that a competency evaluation be performed by at least one psychiatrist or clinical psychologist who (i) has performed forensic evaluations; (ii) has successfully completed forensic evaluation training recognized by the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services; (iii) has demonstrated to the Commissioner competence to perform forensic evaluations; and (iv) is included on a list of approved evaluators maintained by the Commissioner. B. Location of evaluation.  The evaluation shall be performed on an outpatient basis at a mental health facility or in jail unless an outpatient evaluation has been conducted and the outpatient evaluator opines that a hospital-based evaluation is needed to reliabl y reach an opinion or unless the defendant is in the custody of the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services pursuant to § 19.2-169.2, 19.2-169.6, 19.2-182.2, 19.2-182.3, 19.2-182.8, 19.2-182.9, or Article 5 (§ 37.2-814 et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 37.2. C. Provision o f information to evaluators.  The court shall require the attorney for the Commonwealth to provide to the evaluators appointed under subsection A any information relevant to the evaluation, including, but not limited to (i) a copy of the warrant or i ndictment; (ii) the names and addresses of the attorney for the Commonwealth, the attorney for the defendant, and the judge ordering the evaluation; (iii) information about the alleged crime; and (iv) a summary of the reasons for the evaluation request. The court shall require the attorney for the defendant to provide any available psychiatric records and other information that is deemed relevant. The court shall require that information be provided to the evaluator within 96 hours of the issuance of th e court order pursuant to this section. D. The compete ncy report.  Upon completion of the evaluation, the evaluators shall promptly submit a report in writing to the court and the attorneys of record concerning (i) the defendants capacity to understand the proceedings against him; (ii) his ability t o assist his attorney; and (iii) his need for treatment in the event he is found incompetent but restorable, or incompetent for the foreseeable future. If a need for restoration treatment is identified pursuant to clause (iii), the report shall state whe ther inpatient or outpatient treatment (community-based or jail-based) is recommended. Outpatient treatment may occur in a local correctional facility or at a location determined by the appropriate community services board or behavioral health authority. In cases where a defendant is likely to remain incompetent for the foreseeable future due to an ongoing and irreversible medical condition, and where prior medical or educational records are available to support the diagnosis, or if the defendant was pr eviously determined to be unrestorably incompetent in the past two years, the report may recommend that the court find the defendant unrestorably incompetent to stand trial and the court may proceed with the disposition of the case in accordance with § 19.2-169.3. In cases where a defendant has been charged with a misdemeanor violation of Article 3 (§ 18.2-95 et seq.) of Chapter 5 of Title 18.2 or a misdemeanor violation of § 18.2-119, 18.2-137, 18.2-388, 18.2-415, or 19.2-128 and is incompe tent, the report may recommend that the court direct the community services board or behavioral health authority for the jurisdiction in which the defendant is located to (a) conduct an evaluation of the defendant in accordance with subsection B of § 37.2-808 to determine whether the defendant meets the criteria for temporary detention and (b) upon determining that the defendant does meet the criteria for temporary detention, file a petition for issuance of an order for temporary detention of the def endant in accordance with § 37.2-809. No statements of the defendant relating to the time period of the alleged offense shall be included in the report. The evaluator shall also send a redacted copy of the report removing references to the defendant s name, date of birth, case number, and court of jurisdiction to the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services for the purpose of peer review to establish and maintain the list of approved evaluators described in subsection A. E. The compete ncy determination.  After receiving the report described in subsection D, the court shall promptly determine whether the defendant is competent to stand trial. A hearing on the defendants competency is not required unless one is requested by the attorney for the Commonwealth or the attorney for the defendant, or unless the court has reasonable cause to believe the defendant will be hospitalized under § 19.2-169.2. If a hearing is held, the party alleging that the defendant is incompetent shal l bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the defendants incompetency. The defendant shall have the right to notice of the hearing, the right to counsel at the hearing and the right to personally participate in and introduce evi dence at the hearing. The fact that the defendant claims to be unable to remember the time period surrounding the alleged offense shall not, by itself, bar a finding of competency if the def endant otherwise understands the charges against him and can assist in his defense. Nor shall the fact that the defendant is under the influence of medication bar a finding of competency if the defendant is able to understand the charges against him and assist in his defense while medicated. F. Finding.  If the court finds the defendant competent to stand trial, the case shall be set for trial or a preliminary hearing. If the court finds the defendant either incompetent but restorable or incompetent for the foreseeable future, the court shall procee d pursuant to § 19.2-169.2.

Verdict of acquittal by reason of insanity to state the fact; temporary custody and evaluation. Text When the defense is insanity of the defendant at the time the offense was committed, the jurors shall be instructed, if they acquit him on that ground, to state the fac t with their verdict. The court shall place the person so acquitted (the acquittee) in temporary custody of the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services (hereinafter referred to in this chapter as the Commissioner) for evaluation as t o whether the acquittee may be released with or without conditions or requires commitment. The court may authorize that the evaluation be conducted on an outpatient basis. If the court authorizes an outpatient evaluation, the Commissioner shall determine , on the basis of all information available, whether the evaluation shall be conducted on an outpatient basis or whether the acquittee shall be confined in a hospital for evaluation. If the court does not authorize an outpatient evaluation, the acquittee shall be confined in a hospital for evaluation. If an acquittee who is being evaluated on an outpatient basis fails to comply with such evaluation, the Commissioner shall petition the court for an order to confine the acquittee in a hospital for evaluat ion. A copy of the petition shall be sent to the acquittees attorney and the attorney for the Commonwealth. The evaluation shall be conducted by (i) one psychiatrist and (ii) one clinical psychologist. The psychiatrist or clinical psychologist shall be skilled in the diagnosis of mental illness and intellectual disability and qualified by training and experience to perform such evaluations. The Commissioner shall appoint both evaluators. In the case of an acquittee confined in a hospital, at least o ne of the evaluators shall not be employed by the hospital in which the acquittee is primarily confined. The evaluators shall determine whether the acquittee currently has mental illness or intellectual disability and shall assess the acquittee and repor t on his condition and need for hospitalization with respect to the factors set forth in § 19.2-182.3. The evaluators shall conduct their examinations and report their findings separately within 45 days of the Commissioners assumption of custody. Copies of the report shall be sent to the acquittees attorney, the attorney for the Commonwealth for the jurisdiction where the person was acquitted and the community services board or behavioral health authority as designated by the Commissioner. If either evaluator recommends conditional release or release without conditions of the acquittee, the court shall extend the evaluation period to permit (a) the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services and (b) the appropriate community s ervices board or behavioral health authority to jointly prepare a conditional release or discharge plan, as applicable, prior to the hearing.

Court of appeals had no jurisdiction of appeal from commitment order.  The court of appeals had no jurisdiction of an appeal from a commitment order under subsection (1) of former § 19.2-181; an examination of former § 17-116.0 5 (see now § 17.1-405) revealed no proceeding remotely resembling the proceeding at issue.

Court of appeals had no jurisdiction of an appeal from a subsection (1) of former § 19.2-181 commitment order, as none has been conferred by the legislature; i f the hearing held under subsection (1) of former § 19.2-181 was criminal in nature, the court of appeals had no jurisdiction, as there had been no final conviction of a crime from which to appeal (see § 17-116.05:1 (i) [see now § 17.1-406]); fu rthermore, conferral of jurisdiction on the court of appeals by subsection (5) of former § 19.2-181 did not apply to a commitment proceeding under subsection (1) of former § 19.2-181.

Administrative procedures under this section not proper as jury instructions.  The detailed administrative procedures to be followed by the court and the Commissioner of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services [now the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services] under this section when a defendant is acquitted by reason of insanity are directed to the court and are not the concern of the jury and thus are not proper as jury instructions. Spruill v. C ommonwealth, 221 Va. 475, 271 S.E.2d 419, 1980 Va. LEXIS 267 (1980). Trial court properly refused to instruct jury on the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity although defendant argued that the jury should have been told that, pursuant to a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, defendant would not be set free but instead would be committed to the custody of state mental health authorities.

Criminal Procedure, §§ 17, 18, 20, 24. CASE NOTES Purpose.  This sections purpose is to provide for the orderly and expeditious handling of criminal charges to determine whether they should go forward; it authorizes co ntinuances of up to ten days without the consent of the accused, but it does not forbid granting longer continuances for good cause. Ricks v. Commonwealth, No. 0882-89-1 (Ct. of Appeals, Feb. 12, 1991). The preliminary hearing is essentially a screening process. Its primary purpose is to de termine whether there is sufficient cause for charging the accused with the crime alleged, that is, whether there is reasonable ground to believe that the crime has been committed and whether the accused is the person who committed it. Moore v. C ommonwealth, 218 Va. 388, 237 S.E.2d 187, 1977 Va. LEXIS 201 (1977). A preliminary hearing may not be used for the purpose of discovery. Foster v. Commonwealt h, 209 Va. 297, 163 S.E.2d 565, 1968 Va. LEXIS 230 (1968). Neither this section nor any rule of court gives counsel for the accused the right to call witnesses at the preliminary hearing for the purpose of discovery. Will iams v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 724, 160 S.E.2d 781, 1968 Va. LEXIS 174, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1006, 89 S. Ct. 497, 21 L. Ed. 2d 470, 1968 U.S. LEXIS 60 (1968); Foster v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 297, 163 S.E.2d 565, 1968 Va. LEXIS 230 (1968). Because a preliminary hearing is essentially a screening process, the Code of Virginia prescribed as early as 1849, and still prescribes, that the examining judge shall examine on oath the witnesses for and against . . . [the accused]. Defense counsel therefore had the right to present evidence for accused, that is, to show there was no reasonable ground for belief that he had committed murder. But counse l could not complain of the county judges actions at the preliminary hearing on the ground that they were denied the right to discover evidence that might be used by the Commonwealth at a subsequent trial in the circuit court. Williams v. Commonwealt h, 208 Va. 724, 160 S.E.2d 781, 1968 Va. LEXIS 174, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1006, 89 S. Ct. 497, 21 L. Ed. 2d 470, 1968 U.S. LEXIS 60 (1968). Refusal to permit witnesses to testi fy.  Where counsel for defendant made no suggestion to the police court that the testimony of any of the witnesses not permitted to testify would tend to show either t hat the crime had not been committed or that any of the defendants had not committed the crime, and there was no showing that defendant was prejudiced by the courts action in refusing to permit the witnesses to testify, the trial court committed no e rror in overruling defendants motion to quash the indictment because he was denied a proper preliminary hearing. Foster v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 297, 163 S.E.2d 565, 1968 Va. LEXIS 230 (1968). § 19.2-183.1. Joint preliminary hearings. Text Upon motion of the attorney for the Commonwealth, preliminary hearings for persons alleged to have participated in contemporaneous and related acts or occurrences or in a series of such acts or occurrences constituting an offense or offenses may be heard jointly if jurisdiction over each person and offense lies in the same court, unless the court finds that such joint preliminary hearing would constitute prejudice to a defendant. Upon such a finding, the court shall order that the preliminary hearing for that defendant be held separately. History History. 1993, cc. 462, 489. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence.

Lankford v. Foster, 546 F. Supp. 241, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15490 (W.D. Va. 1982), aff'd, 716 F.2d 896 (4th Cir. 1983). Circuit court authorized defendant to employ court reporter because transcript of the pr eliminary hearing may be an effective tool for cross-examining and impeaching witnesses at trial. However, the responsibility for employing the court reporter and having her present rested with the defendant, and the courts denial of a motion for con tinuance based on the court reporters absence, did not result in an abuse of discretion.

CASE NOTES The word shall in the clause then he shall try the accused for such an offense means the court has the responsibility to proceed to try the accused on the misdemeanor, either at the time of the hearing (but subsequent to the finding of no probable cause on the felony) or at some later time. Moore v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 388, 237 S.E.2d 187, 1977 Va. LEXIS 201 (1977). Shall is directory only.  It is manifest from the statutes that the General Assembly intended shall, in the clause then he shall try the accused for such offense, to be dir ectory only, and not mandatory. Moore v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 388, 237 S.E.2d 187, 1977 Va. LEXIS 201 (1977). And district court need not immediately try accused on merits of lesser misdemeanor offense.  The district court has the potential jurisdiction to proceed under certain circumstances to try the accused for a lesser misdemeanor offense included within the f elony charge then before the court. But, the district court, when it makes a finding of no probable cause, is not required to proceed immediately to try the accused on the merits of such lesser offense, although the court may elect to do so. Moore v. Com monwealth, 218 Va. 388, 237 S.E.2d 187, 1977 Va. LEXIS 201 (1977). Under this section, the court, in order to try the defendant for the lesser offense, must find not only lack of probable cause on the felony charge but also suffi cient cause to charge the accused with the misdemeanor. And even then, as we construe the statute, the court is not obligated as a part of that proceeding to try the defendant at that time on the merits of the misdemeanor. Moore v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 388, 237 S.E.2d 187, 1977 Va. LEXIS 201 (1977). Where the defendant is not before the court on a felony, the only options open to the co urt are a finding of guilty or not guilty. Greenwalt v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 498, 297 S.E.2d 709, 1982 Va. LEXIS 320 (1982). Municipal court had jurisdiction to convict defendants of lesser misdemeanor offenses in cluded within felonies then before the circuit court. Rouzie v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 174, 207 S.E.2d 854, 1974 Va. LEXIS 255 (1974). Bu t such convictions placed defendants in double jeopardy.  Municipal court convictions for lesser misdemeanors placed defendants in danger, absent a double jeopardy bar, of prosecution for identical or greater included of fenses.

The county judge had only one issue to decide when he presided at a preliminary hearing: whether there was sufficient cause for charging accused with murder, or, in other words, whether there was reasonable ground to believe that a murder had been committed and accused was the person who had committed the murder. Williams v. Commonwealth, 2 08 Va. 724, 160 S.E.2d 781, 1968 Va. LEXIS 174, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1006, 89 S. Ct. 497, 21 L. Ed. 2d 470, 1968 U.S. LEXIS 60 (1968). Dismissal of felony warrant is not acquittal or finding of not guilty.  A mere dismissal of a felony warrant at a preliminary hearing indicates only a finding of lack of probable cause. Since jeopardy has not attached, discharge canno t operate as an acquittal, or finding of not guilty, of any lesser included misdemeanor offense. Moore v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 388, 237 S.E.2d 187, 1977 Va. LEXIS 201 (1977). Retrial precluded after swearing of witness and dismissal on refusal of Commonwealth to proceed.  Where the trial court ruled against prosecuting defendant on a felony charge, but found probable cause supporting a misdemeanor charge and accordingly swore in a witness, but the attorney for the Commonwealth refused to question the witness, stating that he wished to secure a grand jury for a felony charge, upon which the judge properly dismissed the case, the attorney for the Commonwealth could not prosecute the case anew on a felony charge, as double jeopardy had attached. The Commonwealth had the opportunity to question the sworn witness, defendant had risked a determination of guilt, and absent manifest necessity defendant could not be retried for the same o ffense. Goolsby v. Hutto, 529 F. Supp. 92, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17314 (E.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 691 F.2d 199, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 24605 (4th Cir. 1982). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Double jeopardy.  Defendants double jeopardy rights were not violated when a prosecutor had a felony charge reinstated after taking a dismissal of a lesser included misdemeanor charge on appeal; although jeopardy attached when a general district court tried defendant on a lesser offense, the judgment was annulled when defendant exercised the right to appeal and sought a trial de novo in a circuit court. Commonwealth v. Painter , 64 Va. Cir. 455, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 161 (Rockingham County May 28, 2004), aff'd, 47 Va. App. 225, 623 S.E.2d 408, 2005 Va.

In any hear ing or trial of any criminal offense or in any proceeding brought pursuant to Chapter 22.1 (§ 19.2-386.1 et seq.), a certificate of analysis of a person performing an analysis or examination, duly attested by such person, shall be admissible in eviden ce as evidence of the facts therein stated and the results of the analysis or examination referred to therein, provided that (i) the certificate of analysis is filed with the clerk of the court hearing the case at least seven days prior to the proceeding if the attorney for the Commonwealth intends to offer it into evidence in a preliminary hearing or the accused intends to offer it into evidence in any hearing or trial, or (ii) the requirements of subsection A of § 19.2-187.1 have been satisfied and the accused has not objected to the admission of the certificate pursuant to subsection B of § 19.2-187.1, when any such analysis or examination is performed in any laboratory operated by the Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services or the Depart ment of Forensic Science or authorized by such Department to conduct such analysis or examination, or performed by a person licensed by the Department of Forensic Science pursuant to § 18.2-268.9 or 46.2-341.26:9 to conduct such analysis or examinatio n, or performed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Postal Service, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, the Forensic Document Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or the U.S. Secret Service Laboratory. For purposes of this section, any laboratory that has entered into a contract with the Department of Forensi c Science for the provision of forensic laboratory services shall be deemed authorized by the Department to conduct such analyses or examinations. B. In a hearin g or trial in which the provisions of subsection A of § 19.2-187.1 do not apply, a copy of such certificate shall be mailed or delivered by the clerk or attorney for the Commonwealth to counsel of record for the accused at no charge at least seven day s prior to the hearing or trial upon request made by such counsel to the clerk with notice of the request to the attorney for the Commonwealth. The request to the clerk shall be on a form prescribed by the Supreme Court and filed with the clerk at least 10 days prior to the hearing or trial. In the event that a request for a copy of a certificate is filed with the clerk with respect to a case that is not yet before the court, the clerk shall advise the requester that he must resubmit the request at such time as the case is properly before the court in order for such request to be effective. If, upon proper request made by counsel of record for the accused, a copy of such certificate is not mailed or delivered by the clerk or attorney for the Commonweal th to counsel of record for the accused in a timely manner in accordance with this section, the accused shall be entitled to continue the hearing or trial. C. The certifi cate of analysis of any examination conducted by the Department of Forensic Science relating to a controlled substance or marijuana shall be mailed or forwarded by personnel of the Department of Forensic Science to the attorney for the Commonwealth of th e jurisdiction where such offense may be heard. The attorney for the Commonwealth shall acknowledge receipt of the certificate on forms provided by the laboratory.Any such certificate of analysis purporting to be signed, either by hand or by electronic m eans, by any such person shall be admissible as evidence in such hearing or trial without any proof of the seal or signature or of the official character of the person whose name is signed to it. The attestation signature of a person performing the analy sis or examination may be either hand or electronically signed. D. Any testimo ny offered by either party in a preliminary hearing or sentencing hearing, or offered by the accused in any hearing other than a trial, from a person who performed an analysis or examination that resulted in a certificate of analysis may be presented by two-way video conferencing. The two-way video testimony permitted by this section shall comply with the provisions of subsection B of § 19.2-3.1. In addition, unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the court, (i) all orders pertaining to witnesses apply to witnesses testifying by video conferencing; (ii) upon request, all materials read or used by the witness during his testimony shall be identified on the video; and (iii) any witness testifying by video conferencing shall certify at the conclusi on of his testimony, under penalty of perjury, that he did not engage in any off-camera communications with any person during his testimony. E. For the pur poses of this section and §§ 19.2-187.01, 19.2-187.1, and 19.2-187.2, the term certificate of analysis includes reports of analysis and results of laboratory examination. F. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a locality to purchase a two-way electronic video and audio communication system. Any decision to purchase such a system is at the discretion of the locality. History History.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  The constitutional right of confrontation is not violated when the report of a state chemist is admitted into evidence. Robertson v. Cox, 320 F. Supp. 900, 1970 U .S. Dist. LEXIS 10014 (W.D. Va. 1970). The admission of a laboratory report in evidence under this section violates no constitutional right of a defendant. The right to be confronted with ones accu sers and witnesses does not operate to exclude proper documentary evidence. Robertson v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 62, 175 S.E.2d 260, 1970 Va. LEXIS 212 (1970). Right to confront witness not denied.  Admission in a rape prosecution of reports of the Chief Medical Examiners office indicating presence of seminal fluid in vaginal swabs does not violate the ac cuseds right to confrontation of the witnesses against him. Robertson v. Cox, 320 F. Supp. 900, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10014 (W.D. Va. 1970). The purpose of this section is primarily to obviate the necessity of summoning as witnes ses those physicians or technicians who, in their official capacity, are required to make pathological, bacteriological and toxicological investigations, as well as postmortem examinations. Such a provision is not only expedient and convenient  it pr events the delay that would result if the limited number of physicians, chemists and technicians were forced to testify whenever a report made by them was offered in evidence. Robertson v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 62, 175 S.E.2d 260, 1970 Va. LEXIS 212 (197 0). The effect of this section is to make reports of investigations of the Chief Medical Exa miner admissible as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein, thus obviating the necessity of summoning as witnesses those persons performing the particular tests involved. Bass v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 699, 187 S.E.2d 188, 1972 Va. LEXIS 243 (19 72). Effect of statement in death certificate signed by attending physician concerning cause of death.  Although signed by the decedents attending physician, a statement in a death certificate concerning the cause of death was but the expression of an opinion an d was not, therefore, competent to show the cause of the decedents death. Ward v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 177, 217 S.E.2d 810, 1975 Va. LEXIS 266 (1975). This section merely constitutes a statutory exception to the hearsay rule and does not e liminate the necessity of identifying the substance tested with the person from whom obtained. Bass v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 699, 187 S.E.2d 188, 1972 Va. LEXIS 243 (1972). This section provides a statutory exception to the hearsay rule by permitting investigation reports and autopsy reports of the Chief Medical Examiner or his assis tants to be received in evidence without requiring the investigating official to testify. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 615, 292 S.E.2d 798, 1982 Va. LEXIS 247 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1228, 103 S. Ct. 1237, 75 L. Ed. 2d 470, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 3634 (1983). Only facts contained in certificate are accorded dignity of prima facie evidence.  Reports of investigations made by the Chief Medical Examiner or his assistants or by medical examiners, as well as the records and reports of autopsies, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein in any court or other proceeding; and copies of such reports of investigations, and copies of the records and reports of autopsies, duly attested, shall be received in evidence for any purpose for which th e original could be received, without any proof of the official character of the person whose name is signed thereto. The language of this section means that only facts contained in the certificate are accorded the dignity of prima facie evidence. Robert son v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 62, 175 S.E.2d 260, 1970 Va. LEXIS 212 (1970). Prima facie evidence of facts stated.  Reports of the medical examiner introduced pursuant to this section are prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. Quintana v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 127, 2 95 S.E.2d 643, 1982 Va. LEXIS 276 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1029, 103 S. Ct. 1280, 75 L. Ed. 2d 501, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 4118 (1983). Opinion in medical examiners repor t.  Opinion in a medical examiners report is not competent evidence. Quintana v. Commonwealth, 224 Va. 127, 295 S.E.2d 643, 1982 Va. LEXIS 276 (1982), cert. denie d, 460 U.S. 1029, 103 S. Ct. 1280, 75 L. Ed. 2d 501, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 4118 (1983). Where, in a prosecution for murder, the crucial issue was whether death was brought about by criminal agency, the ultimate question was whether the decedent jumpe d intentionally, fell accidentally, or was thrown to her death, and the facts and circumstances shown by the testimony of lay witnesses were sufficient to enable a jury to decide that question, the deputy chief medical examiners opinion as to whether death was brought about by criminal agency, which opinion was based largely, if not entirely, upon the same facts and circumstances, was inadmissible. Bond v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 534, 311 S.E.2d 769, 1984 Va. LEXIS 292 (1984), limited, Lucas v. Riverh ill Poultry, Inc., 300 Va. 78, 860 S.E.2d 361, 2021 Va. LEXIS 74 (2021). Autopsy report was properly admitted without redaction of the chief medical examiners opinion as to the cause of a newborn babys death where the opinion e vidence was cumulative of other evidence as to the cause of death, which was admitted without objection. Corrales v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 687 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2002). Expressions of opinion in medical examiners report.  Expressions of opinion are not admissible merely because they are included in a medical examiners report; only statements of fact are admissible under this st atutory exception to the rule excluding hearsay evidence. Hopkins v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 280, 337 S.E.2d 264, 1985 Va. LEXIS 280 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1098, 106 S. Ct. 1498, 89 L. Ed. 2d 898, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 1056 (1986). Statute does not provide an exception authorizing admission of expressions of opinion in a report that are derived from evidence that the jury is just as well-equ ipped as the medical examiner to consider and draw its own conclusions; however, if the evidence was such that the jurors were not capable of comprehending and forming an intelligent opinion about it, and drawing their own conclusions, the opinion testim ony of an expert would be admissible, assuming it met all evidentiary requirements. Lucas v. Riverhill Poultry, Inc., 300 Va. 78, 860 S.E.2d 361, 2021 Va. LEXIS 74 (2021). Introduction of report where investigating official testifies.  There is no preclusive language in this section barring introduction of the reports if the investigating official testifies; this section does not require an elec tion by the Commonwealth to introduce the relevant evidence either by a qualified witness or by the written reports. Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 615, 292 S.E.2d 798, 1982 Va. LEXIS 247 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1228, 103 S. Ct. 1237, 75 L. E d. 2d 470, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 3634 (1983). Admission of report harmless error.  Because of defendants confession as to the cause of death of defendants wife, as adduced at trial, any error in the admission of an autopsy report prepare d by a then deceased medical examiner and the testimony of a later medical examiner based on the report was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Abney v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 337, 657 S.E.2d 796, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 103 (2008). Admission of autopsy report not error although pathologist testified at trial.  Fact that the pathologist who performed the autopsy on the victim testified at trial did not render the admission of the autopsy report error. Gray v. Commonwealt h, 233 Va. 313, 356 S.E.2d 157, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2416, 1987 Va. LEXIS 199, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 873, 108 S.

CASE NOTES Civil rights actions.  Where an officer went to a suspects parents residence to execute an arrest warrant for the suspect, the fathers false arrest and malicious prosecution claims failed because a reasonable officer could believe that probable cause existed for the fathers arrest for assault since, the fathers palms hit the officers shoulder area; the argument that the indictment could not support a finding of probable cause because the father was not permitted to present evidence before the grand jury was rejected.

For note, Disclosure of Grand Jury Materials to Foreign Authorities Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), see 70 Va. L. Rev. 1623 (1984). CASE NOTES Considerations in disclosure.  Plaintiffs request to depose a state court grand juror about statements he made as to grand jury deliberations of the charges lodged against plaintiff was den ied, because it was clear that any such testimony ran afoul of the prohibition against disclosing grand jury proceedings, and plaintiff had offered no authority supporting the proposition that one may depose grand jurors at all, let alone that justice so required in his case. Plaster v. Brown, No. 6:05-CV-00006, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 213 (W.D. Va. Jan. 4, 2006). Plaintiffs request to depose a state court grand juror about statements he made as to grand jury deliberations of the charges lodged against plaintiff was den ied because, given the cloak of secrecy that the law imposed on grand jury deliberations, it was difficult to see how deposition testimony concerning statements made by a grand juror regarding the grand jurys deliberations could reasonably be calcula ted to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; as such, the testimony was outside the permissible scope of discovery.

Annotations CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section is not repugnant to Amendments Five and Fourteen of the United States Constitution. Hausenfluck v. Commonwealth, 85 Va. 702, 8 S.E. 683, 1889 Va. LEX IS 83 (1889). There is a constitutional right to a jury drawn from a group which repre sents a cross section of the community.  And a cross section of the community includes persons with varying degrees of training and intelligence and with varying economic and social positions. Under the United States Constitution, the jury is not to be made the representative of the most intelligent, the most wealthy, or the most successful, nor of the least intelligent, the least wealthy, or the least successful. It is a democratic institution, represe ntative of all qualified classes of people. Witcher v. Peyton, 405 F.2d 725, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9388 (4th Cir. 1969). A grand jury should be composed of persons qualified to serve in that capacity under the law, such qualifications being regulated by statute in Virginia. Commonwealth v. Burton, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 645, 1832 Va. LEXIS 37 (1832); Commonwealth v. St. Clair, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 556, 1844 Va. LEXIS 45 (1844); Shinn v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. (3 2 Gratt.) 899, 1879 Va. LEXIS 97 (1879). The phrase, in other respects a qualified juror, must be interpreted according t o the common law, and statutory requirements of jurors. Booth v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 519, 1861 Va. LEXIS 10 (1861); Waller v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 294, 16 S.E.2d 808, 1941 Va. LEXIS 165 (1941), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 679, 62 S. Ct. 1106, 86 L. Ed. 1752, 1942 U.S. LEXIS 647 (1942). Residence in the county.  The court has heretofore decided that residence, within the county, is a necessary qualification of grand jurors. The peculiar functions and duties of grand jurie s, as well as the structure of the clause of the act under consideration, would warrant, if necessary, the reading of it with the words of the county, at the end of each disqualification. Commonwealth v. Towles, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 743, 1835 Va. LEX IS 6 (1835); Moran v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 651, 1839 Va. LEXIS 4 (1839) (see also Commonwealth v. Cherry, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 20 (1815); McCue v. Commonwealth, 103 Va. 870, 49 S.E. 623, 1905 Va. LEXIS 55 (1905). Residence in the State.  A naturalized citizen of the United States or a native citizen of any other state of the union, domiciled in Virginia, being entitled to all the privileges of a c itizen of this State, is a citizen and qualified as such to serve on grand juries. Commonwealth v. Cherry, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 20 (1815); Commonwealth v. Towles, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 743, 1835 Va. LEXIS 6 (1835). Common-law exceptions.  Therefore, it is a good exception at common law to one returned on a grand jury, that he is an alien, or villain, or minor, or that he is outlawed for a crime, or that he was not returned by the proper officer, or that he was returned at the instance of the prosecutor. Booth v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 519, 1861 Va. LEXIS 10 (1861); Waller v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 294, 16 S.E.2d 808, 1941 Va. LEXIS 165 (1 941), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 679, 62 S. Ct. 1106, 86 L. Ed. 1752, 1942 U.S. LEXIS 647 (1942). Being a prohibition officer did not constitute any disqualification to serve as a grand juror. As a matter of public policy it may have been true that, when there were a large number of indictments for violation of the former Prohibition Act under consideration, the courts should have excluded persons who were then actually engaged i n enforcing this statute from serving on the grand jury. This, however, was left to the sound discretion of the trial courts. Webb v. Commonwealth, 137 Va. 833, 120 S.E. 155, 1923 Va. LEXIS 208 (1923). Effect of former service as juror.  A plea in abatement will not lie to an indictment because two or more of the grand jurors which found the indictment had served on another grand jury at the same term. Richardson v. Commonwealth, 76 Va. 1007, 1882 Va. LEXIS 100 (1882). Selection of jurors must always accord with the fact that the proper functioning of the jury system, and indeed, of democracy itself, requires that the jury be a body truly representative of the community, and not the organ of any special group or class. If that requirement is observed, the officials charged with choosing federal jurors may exercise some discretion to the end that competent jurors may be called. But they must not allow the desire for competent jurors to lead them into selections which do not comport with the concept of the jury as a cross section of the community. Tendenci es, no matter how slight, toward the selection of jurors by any method other than a process which will insure a trial by a representative group are undermining processes weakening the institution of jury trial, and should be sturdily resisted. That the m otives influencing such tendencies may be of the best must not blind courts to the dangers of allowing any encroachment whatsoever on this essential right. Steps innocently taken may one by one lead to the irretrievable impairment of substantial libertie s. Witcher v. Peyton, 405 F.2d 725, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9388 (4th Cir. 1969). In the selection of juries recognition must be given to the fact that those eligible for jury service are to be found in every stratum of society. Jury competence is an individual rather than a group or class matter. That fact lies at the very heart of the jury system. To disregard it is to open the door to class distinctions and discriminations which are abhorrent to the democratic ideals of trial by jury. Witch er v. Peyton, 405 F.2d 725, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9388 (4th Cir. 1969). Attacking jury selection procedure.  It is not necessary to a successful attack upon a jury selection procedure that petitioner obtain an admission from the judge and jury commissioners that they hav e discriminated. Witcher v. Peyton, 405 F.2d 725, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9388 (4th Cir. 1969). Want of qualifications or other objections to a grand jury are to be made effective by a plea in abatement. Commonwealth v. Cherry, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 20 (1815); Commonwealth v. Long, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 318 (1822); Moore v. Commonwealth, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 639, 1838 Va. LEXIS 56 (1838) (see also Lawrence v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. 573, 10 S.E . 840 (1890)). Motion to quash.  The incompetency of one grand juror is sufficient to render an indictment defective, when found by a grand jury of which he is a member. For such defect the indic tment will be quashed. Commonwealth v. Burton, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 645, 1832 Va. LEXIS 37 (1832); Shinn v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 899, 1879 Va. LEXIS 97 (1879). When made.  In the case of a grand jury, a party indicted is not bound to object to a grand juror for any disqualification before he is sworn, for he is no party to the selec tion and constitution of the grand inquest of the county. But when he is indicted he becomes a party, and it is competent for him to avail himself of the disqualification. Commonwealth v. Cherry, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 20 (1815); Commonwealth v. Carter, 4 Va . (2 Va. Cas.) 319 (1822); Hunter v. Matthews, 39 Va. (12 Leigh) 228, 1841 Va. LEXIS 39 (1841). After indictment found.  Objection to the qualification of an individual grand juror can be taken after indictment found. Commonwealth v. Long, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 318 (1822); Commonwealth v. St. Clair, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 556, 1844 Va. LEXIS 45 (1844); Day v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 562, 1845 Va. LEXIS 61 (1845). Must be before plea to merits.  Objections to the competency or qualifications of a particular grand juror must be made at a preliminary stage of the case, before a plea to the merits; otherwise , they are considered waived.

Objections waived by plead ing general issue.  A plea in abatement raising objections to the manner of organizing the jury, or to the qualification of grand jurors, is waived by pleading the general issue alon e. Early v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. 921, 11 S.E. 795, 1890 Va. LEXIS 61 (1890); Bailey v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 814, 71 S.E.2d 368, 1952 Va. LEXIS 193, cert. denied, 344 U.S. 886, 73 S. Ct. 186, 97 L. Ed. 686, 1952 U.S. LEXIS 1536 (1952). If a defendant may legally waive an indictment and be tried for a felony without any indictment at all, it seems clear that his constitutional rights are not viol ated by requiring that if he questions the validity of an indictment that is made he shall do so before he goes to trial on a plea of not guilty and is convicted. Bailey v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 814, 71 S.E.2d 368, 1952 Va. LEXIS 193, cert. denied, 344 U .S. 886, 73 S. Ct. 186, 97 L. Ed. 686, 1952 U.S. LEXIS 1536 (1952).

For note, Grand Jury Reform: A Proposal for Change in Virginia, see 23 U. Rich. L. Rev. 279 (1989). CASE NOTES It is the purpose of this section to give the grand jury the benefit of the advice of th e attorney for the Commonwealth relative to the discharge of their duties, without permitting him, by his presence, or otherwise, to influence them in reaching a conclusion during their deliberations. Hall v. Commonwealth, 143 Va. 554, 130 S.E. 416, 1925 Va. LEXIS 290 (1925). Duty of sheriff.  This section makes it the duty of the sheriff to give information of the violation of any penal law to the attorney for the Commonwealth, whose duty it is to inst itute a prosecution in such case. This duty imposed upon the sheriff necessarily carries with it the implied power to investigate, inquire into, and ascertain if an offense has been or is being committed. Carico v. Wilmore, 51 F. 196, 1892 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 79 (D. Va. 1892). Permissible communications with grand jury.  A Commonwealths attorney may advise the grand jury on a legal issue and the law in regard to the various indictments that they are considering, but he may not specifically refer to the indictment against the accused. Pease v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 397, 482 S.E.2d 851, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 124 (1997). A Commonwealths attorney is not permitted by his presence or otherwise to influence a grand jury in reaching a conclusion during their deliberations. Pease v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 397, 482 S.E.2d 851, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 124 (1997). Consultation by the regular grand jury with the attorney for the Commonwealth during del iberations to obtain advice on a legal issue was not error, as such action is explicitly provided for in this section, and his advice to them was properly limited to this matter. Vihko v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 498, 393 S.E.2d 413, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2719 , 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 113 (1990). Appearance of attorney for the Commonwealth.  An indictment will not be quashed because the attorney for the Commonwealth appeared before the grand jury during their deliberation when not sworn as a witness, where it appears from the evidence that he did not advise them to find the indictment, did not know of their finding until the presentment was made, and was not in the room when they had under consideration or deliberation the indictment or the presentme nt upon which the indictment was found. Mullins v. Commonwealth, 115 Va. 945, 79 S.E. 324, 1913 Va. LEXIS 89 (1913). Presence does not invalidate indictment unless accused prejudiced.  Notwithstanding this section forbidding an attorney for the Commonwealth to go before a grand jury during their deliberations, the mere presence of the attorney f or the Commonwealth in the grand jury room does not invalidate an indictment found at the time, if it satisfactorily appears that the accused was not prejudiced thereby. Draper v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 648, 111 S.E. 471, 1922 Va. LEXIS 62 (1922), overrul ed in part, Cooper v. Commonwealth, 277 Va. 377, 673 S.E.2d 185, 2009 Va. LEXIS 36 (2009). Prejudicial conduct before grand jury found.  Where prosecutor initiated contact with grand jury regarding defendants witness, about whom he told them that her testimony would not be truthful, and actuall y examined this witness for the grand jury, such conduct substantially influenced their decision to return murder indictment, to the prejudice of the defendant. Therefore, the indictment was quashed. Pease v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 397, 482 S.E.2d 851 , 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 124 (1997). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No private right of action.  Police officer, who claimed that other police officers conspired to conceal events surrounding the death of a suspect and compelled him to testify falsely about t hose events, did not have a private right of action against a city or its employees to recover damages he sustained when he was terminated from the citys police department. Young v. City of Norfolk, 62 Va. Cir. 307, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 296 (Norfolk J uly 17, 2003). Termination from employment.  To the extent that an employee alleged that the employees termination resulted from complying with the employees obligations under subsection C of § 63 .2-526, and §§ 19.2-201 and 19.2-208, to report welfare fraud and to testify before a grand jury, the employee made out a claim under the Type 1 exception to the employment-at-will doctrine. McClosky v. Warren Co. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 81 V a. Cir. 35, 2010 Va. Cir. LEXIS 102 (Warren County July 15, 2010). Deputies had a Bowman claim for complying with a duty to report sheriffs misconduct. .  Sheriffs deputies had no right to bring a claim under Bowman v. State Bank of Keysvi lle, 229 Va. 534, 331 S.E.2d 797 (1985), for wrongful termination against the sheriff based on either § 15.2-1722 or the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, § 8.01-216.1 et seq.; however, they did state a Bowman claim based on their duty under § 19.2-201 to report wrongfu l conduct.

It may make a presentment or find an indictment upon the informatio n of two or more of its own body, or on the testimony of witnesses called on by the grand jury, or sent to it by the court. If only one of their number can testify as to an offense, he shall be sworn as any other witness. When a presentment or indictment is so made or found, the names of the grand jurors giving the information, or of the witnesses, shall be written at the foot of the presentment or indictment.

CASE NOTES Provision as to indorsement of names merely directory.  The requirement of this section that the names of witnesses shall be written at the foot of the indictment is merely directory, and noncompliance therewith does n ot invalidate the indictment. Shelton v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 450, 16 S.E. 355, 1892 Va. LEXIS 121 (1892); Porterfield v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 801, 22 S.E. 352, 1895 Va. LEXIS 77 (1895); Clopton v.

Although this section provides for the endorsement of names of witnesses who testify before a regular grand jury, the requirement is directory and an omission is not grounds to quash the indictment. Vihko v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 498, 393 S.E.2d 413, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2719, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 113 (1990). Omission does not exclude witnesses.  The omission of the names of witnesses in the indorsement of an indictment will not operate to exclude such witnesses from testifying at the trial. Lawrence v. Co mmonwealth, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 845, 1878 Va. LEXIS 101 (1878), overruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 87 Va. 63, 12 S.E. 226, 1890 Va. LEXIS 90 (1890). The failure of the foreman of the grand jury to write the word foreman after his name is a matter of no moment. The entry on the order book showing the finding of the grand jury is sufficient evidence of that fact, and makes it immaterial whether the words a true bill were in fact indorsed on the indictment or not.

Urbina v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 551 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 4, 2003).

CASE NOTES A defendant found guilty of contempt for failing to produce documents subpoenaed by a sp ecial grand jury was denied due process of law where the notice to the defendant of the hearing at which he was convicted of indirect contempt was insufficient to show that there would be a hearing before the court to determine whether he should be adjud ged in contempt. The trial court abused its discretion in not granting a continuance. Davis v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 395, 247 S.E.2d 681, 1978 Va. LEXIS 195 (1978).

The rationale for nondisclosure of grand jury proceedings to the public is twofold: (1) to protect the reputation of suspected individuals from the stigma which investigation alone can bring; and (2) to promote public cooperation in investigations by providing some anonymity and reducing the risk of recrimination.

The 2004 amendments. The 2004 amendments by cc. 396 and 435 are identical, and added Article 2.1 (§ 18.2-46.1 et seq.) and at the beginning of subdivision 1 q. The 2008 amendments. The 2008 amendment by c. 704 deleted and at the end of subdivision 1 q; redesignated former subdivision 1 r as subdivision 1 s; and inserted subdivision 1 r. The 2009 amendments.

Indictments, Informations and Presentments, §§ 7, 50. CASE NOTES This section is a criminal statute and applies only to a criminal proceeding. Lawrence v . Commonwealth, 206 Va. 51, 141 S.E.2d 735, 1965 Va. LEXIS 168 (1965). It is not applicable to a proceeding under former § 53-296, the recidivist statute. L awrence v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 51, 141 S.E.2d 735, 1965 Va. LEXIS 168 (1965). There is no constitutional requirement that prosecutions for felony be by indictment.  The requirement is merely statutory and may be waived. Livingston v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 830, 36 S.E.2d 561, 1946 Va. LEXIS 146 (1946); Bailey v. Commonwealt h, 193 Va. 814, 71 S.E.2d 368, 1952 Va. LEXIS 193, cert. denied, 344 U.S. 886, 73 S. Ct. 186, 97 L. Ed. 686, 1952 U.S. LEXIS 1536 (1952); Council v. Smyth, 201 Va. 135, 109 S.E.2d 116, 1959 Va. LEXIS 203 (1959); Cunningham v. Hayes, 204 Va. 851, 134 S. E.2d 271, 1964 Va. LEXIS 130, cert. denied, 376 U.S. 973, 84 S. Ct. 1140, 12 L. Ed. 2d 86, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 1527 (1964); Henson v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 120, 155 S.E.2d 346, 1967 Va. LEXIS 193 (1967). While this section prevents the trial of a person on a felony charge except upon a presentment or indictment found by a grand jury, this is purely a statutory req uirement and is not predicated upon any constitutional guarantee. Benson v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 744, 58 S.E.2d 312, 1950 Va. LEXIS 165 (1950); Scales v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 728, 204 S.E.2d 273, 1974 Va. LEXIS 211 (1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1123, 95 S. Ct. 808, 42 L. Ed. 2d 823, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 370 (1975). Although defendant asserted that the delayed entry of the order recording the presentation of the indictment in open court invalidated his conviction, because the re was no constitutional requirement that prosecutions for a felony had to be by indictment, as that requirement was merely statutory and could be waived, the trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction; thus, because the trial court properly ha d jurisdiction, and defendant failed to raise the argument below, defendants argument on appeal was barred. Davis v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (Va. Ct. App. May 3, 2016). Sixth Amendment fair-cro ss-section challenge.  Defendant was not entitled to five years of grand jury selection information because (1) there was no supporting constitutional or statutory authority, (2) the re quest implicated juror privacy concerns, (3) defendant made no attempt to limit the request, and (4) defendants ultimate conviction made any grand jury error harmless. Brown v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 746, 813 S.E.2d 557, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 140 (2 018). Options open to Commonwealth.  When the Commonwealth seeks to prosecute an adult for a felony, it has several options how to proceed, including direct indictment, information, presentment, or a rrest warrant followed by a preliminary hearing. Burfoot v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 38, 473 S.E.2d 724, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 556 (1996). Indictment for felony not juri sdictional.  This section is a clear expression of the legislative policy that the requirement of an indictment in the prosecution for a felony may be waived, and hence is not jurisdictional. Hanson v. Smyth, 183 Va. 384, 32 S.E.2d 142, 1944 Va. LEXIS 164 (1944); Bailey v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 814, 71 S.E.2d 368, 1952 Va. LEXIS 193, cert. denied, 344 U.S. 886, 73 S. Ct. 186, 97 L. Ed. 686, 1952 U.S. LEXIS 1536 (1952); Counci l v. Smyth, 201 Va. 135, 109 S.E.2d 116, 1959 Va. LEXIS 203 (1959). The requirement for indictment is not jurisdictional and constitutionally imposed but is only statutory and procedural. Triplett v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 649, 186 S.E.2d 16, 1972 Va. LEXIS 224 (1972). Because defendants argument that the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to convict him because the record lacked an indictment order failed to all ege grounds that would render the 2015 final sentencing order void ab initio, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1 barred the trial court from amending, on defendants motion to vacate, the order convicting him of the alleged offenses. Because an indictment could be w aived and was thus not jurisdictional, and because any challenge to the form of an indictment was waived unless raised at least seven days before trial, his argument failed to properly call the trial courts subject-matter jurisdiction into question o r otherwise present a basis for declaring that his conviction order was void ab initio. Rock v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 481 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 4, 2022). Nor is preliminary hearing.  The requirement of a preliminary hearing (assuming no waiver) of one arrested on a charge of a felony is not jurisdictional and its denial does not violate the due process and equal protection of the laws clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.Dunnivan v. Peyton, 292 F. Supp. 173, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9561 (W.D. Va. 1968). But denial may be reversible error.  Where the defendant insists upon his statutory rights to a preliminary hearing and indictment, the failure of the trial court to adhere to those procedural requir ements is reversible error. Triplett v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 649, 186 S.E.2d 16, 1972 Va. LEXIS 224 (1972). Defects in form.  Failure of the grand jury foreman to sign the indictments was a defect in form only and accordingly, when the indictments were returned by the grand jury in open court, that defect in form was cured and the indictments became valid instruments under which to try defendant. Although the written charges did not contain the signature of the grand jury foreman, they had been returned in open court by the gran d jury as true bills and, thus, became valid indictments. Reed v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 471, 706 S.E.2d 854, 2011 Va. LEXIS 50 (2011). The term indictment in this section means and includes an indictment which has been properly amended by the court. Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321, 1937 Va. LEXIS 291 (1937). Bringing indictment after finding of no probable cause by district court.  Failure of the General Assembly to bar forever the bringing of an indictment after a finding of no probable cause by a district court was intentional. Such a prov ision would have been totally inconsistent with the provisions of former § 19.1-158 (now § 19.2-203). Moore v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 388, 237 S.E.2d 187, 1977 Va. LEXIS 201 (1977) (decided under former §§ 19.1-162 and 19.1-163.1). Plea cannot be entered a t preliminary hearing.  The procedure prescribed for waiving an indictment does not permit a plea to be entered at a preliminary hearing on a felony charge. Timmons v. Peyton, 240 F. Sup p. 749, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7004 (E.D. Va. 1965), rev'd, 360 F.2d 327, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6336 (4th Cir. 1966). Virginia does not permit a plea to be entered at a preliminary hearing on a felony charge. Dunnivan v. Peyton, 292 F. Supp. 173, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9561 (W.D. Va. 1968). Delayed entry of presentment order.  Delayed entry of the presentment order was not a substantive violation that invalidated defendants indictment or deprived the trial court of jurisdiction wher e defendant did not assert that the indictments contents were deficient in any manner or that the indictment was not returned in open court. Epps v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. App. 393, 785 S.E.2d 792, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 175 (2016), aff'd, 293 Va. 403, 79 9 S.E.2d 516, 2017 Va. LEXIS 77 (2017). Failure of record to show indictment returned will not vitiate conviction.  Where the requirement for an indictment is not jurisdictional, the failure of the record to show affirmatively that the indictment was returned into court by the grand jury is not such a defect as will render null and void the judgment of conviction based thereon. Hanson v. Smyth, 183 Va. 384, 32 S.E.2d 142, 1944 Va. LEXIS 164 (1944). Motion to quash information not available when defects not shown on record or by bill of exception.  A motion to quash an information on the ground that it is not founded upon a complaint in writing verified by the oath of a competent witness, as required by this section, is not available where the defect is not apparent upon the face of the information, and not incorporated in the record by proper bill of exceptions. Quillin v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. 874, 54 S.E. 333, 1906 Va. LEXIS 95 (1906). The question of the sufficiency of an indictment cannot be raised more than four years after a conviction in a collateral proceeding by habeas corpus. Council v. Smyth, 201 Va. 135, 109 S.E.2d 116, 1959 Va. LEXIS 203 (1959).

CASE NOTES Purpose of section.  It may reasonably be assumed from the language used in this section that it was enacted to change the effect of previous court decisions and to grant an accused t he right to a preliminary hearing when he has been arrested on a warrant charging a felony before an indictment has been returned by a grand jury. Webb v. Commonwealth, 204 Va. 24, 129 S.E.2d 22, 1963 Va. LEXIS 111 (1963). This section does not require a preliminary hearing after indictment. Braxton v. Peyton, 365 F.2d 563, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 5353 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 939, 87 S. Ct. 306, 17 L. Ed. 2d 218, 1966 U.S. LEXIS 387 (1966); May v. Peyton, 268 F. Supp. 928, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8289 (W.D. Va. 1967), rev'd, 398 F.2d 476, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 6342 (4th Cir. 1968). This section does not require a preliminary hearing after indictment. The federal courts have upheld the constitutionality of this interpretation of this section and have not required the state to provide a preliminary hearing when the accused has been previously indicted by a grand jury. Couser v. Cox, 324 F. Supp. 1140, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14002 (W.D. Va. 1971). Requirement not jurisdictional.  The requirement of this section is procedural only, and not jurisdictional, and any defect in connection with the required hearing must be raised before trial, or forever lost as a ground of objection. Snyder v. Commonwealth, 202 Va. 1009, 121 S.E.2d 452, 1961 Va. LEXIS 209 (1961); Gibson v. Peyton, 262 F. Supp. 574, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7511 (W.D. Va. 1966). The preliminary hearing granted by this section is not jurisdictional. Ashby v. Cox, 344 F. Supp. 759, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13460 (W.D. Va. 1972). In Virginia, a preliminary hearing in an adult criminal case is merely a procedural requirement, not jurisdictionally significant. Nottingham v. Zahradnick, 573 F .2d 193, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 11882 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 970, 99 S. Ct. 464, 58 L. Ed. 2d 430, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 3882 (1978). Since a preliminary hearing in an adult case is a procedural and not a jurisdictional requirement, where an adult defendant whose victim was a juvenile was given a preliminary hearing in the criminal division of a general district court the declaration of a mistrial by the circuit court judge on the ground that the defendant had been denied a hearing in the juvenile court under subsection I of § 16.1-241 was n ot required under the doctrine of manifest necessity, jeopardy attached, and the defendant could not be retried. Nottingham v. Zahradnick, 573 F.2d 193, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 11882 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 970, 99 S. Ct. 464, 58 L. Ed. 2 d 430, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 3882 (1978). Nor constitutionally mandated.  An accused has a statutory right in Virginia to a preliminary hearing before his indictment but he still does not have a constitutional right to a preliminary hea ring. McCormick v. Peyton, 274 F. Supp. 797, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8154 (W.D. Va. 1967). There is no constitutional right to a preliminary hearing. Ashby v. Cox, 344 F. Supp. 759, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13460 (W.D. Va. 1972). The requirement of a preliminary hearing of one arrested on a charge of a felony is not jurisdictional, and its denial does not violate the due process an d equal protection of the law clauses of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Va. Const., Art. I, § 8. Webb v. Commonwealth, 204 Va. 24, 129 S.E.2d 22, 1963 Va. LEXIS 111 (1963). The requirement for a preliminary hearing under this section is not jurisdictional and constitutionally imposed but is only statutory and procedural. Triplett v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 649, 186 S.E.2d 16, 1972 Va. LEXIS 224 (1972). Defendants conviction for assaulting a police officer in violation of subsection C of § 18.2-57 had to stand, as defendant was not denied the right to a pr eliminary hearing on that charge after the district court terminated the charge by entering a nolle prosequi officer and the Commonwealth then obtained a direct indictment for the same offense and proved its case in the trial court. Since the case had be en terminated in the district court once the nolle prosequi order was entered, defendant was not under actual arrest for that charge as required by the preliminary hearing statute, § 19.2-218, and not holding the preliminary hearing was a statutory, n ot constitutional, matter, which meant that defendants due process rights under Va. Const., Art. I, § 11 were not violated because a preliminary hearing was not held. Wright v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. App. 690, 667 S.E.2d 787, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 509 (2008). Options open to Commonwealth.  When the Commonwealth seeks to prosecute an adult for a felony, it has several options how to proceed, including direct indictment, information, presentment, or a rrest warrant followed by a preliminary hearing. Burfoot v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 38, 473 S.E.2d 724, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 556 (1996). The preliminary hearing and proceedings attendant thereto are of a procedural nature in Virginia. Bird v. Peyton, 287 F. Supp. 860, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9534 (W.D. Va. 1968). There is no guarantee provided for a preliminary hearing in either the Virginia or the U nited States Constitutions. Bird v. Peyton, 287 F. Supp. 860, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9534 (W.D. Va. 1968). The right to a preliminary hearing is given only by statute. Bird v. Peyton, 287 F. Supp. 860, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9534 (W.D. Va. 1968). In the absence of a statute providing otherwise a preliminary hearing is not a prerequisite or an indispensable step in the prosecution of a person accused of cri me. Couser v. Cox, 324 F. Supp. 1140, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14002 (W.D. Va. 1971). In sistence on right to preliminary hearing and indictment.  Where the defendant insists upon his statutory rights to a preliminary hearing and indictment, the failure of the trial court to adhere to those procedural requir ements is reversible error. Triplett v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 649, 186 S.E.2d 16, 1972 Va. LEXIS 224 (1972). Waiver valid despite defendants mistaken belief he would be admitted into drug court program.  Although defendant waived the right to a preliminary hearing based on the expectation that he would be admitted into the drug court program, the later determinati on that he was not eligible for the program did not render his otherwise voluntary waiver invalid. Angelina v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 233 (Va. Ct. App. June 14, 2005). The Virginia preliminary hearing is a critical stage of the criminal process. Noe v. Cox, 320 F. Supp. 849, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9081 (W.D. Va. 1970). And an indigent accused is entitled to have counsel appointed. The purpose of this rule is to protect the indigent accused against an erroneous or improper prosecution. This rule should apply only to those preliminary hearings held after June 22, 1970. Noe v. Cox, 320 F. Supp. 849, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9081 (W.D. Va. 1970). The purposes and procedures of the preliminary hearing in Virginia are so similar to those in North Carolina that, in Virginia, as in North Carolina, the safeguar ds provided by the preliminary hearing may not be fully utilized unless the accused is assisted by counsel. Noe v. Cox, 320 F. Supp. 849, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9081 (W.D. Va. 1970). The procedure in a state court in its preliminary hearing is a matter for state direction so long as the proceedings do not amount to such a gross unfairness as to violate the defendants right to due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Bird v. Peyton, 287 F. Supp. 860, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9534 (W.D. Va. 1968). Failure to appoint a reporter for petitioner in the preliminary hearing does not violate any constitutional rights of petitioner. Bird v. Peyton, 287 F. Supp. 860, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9534 (W.D. Va. 1968). Action of grand jury preempting right to preliminary hearing.  Where a grand jury finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that defendant has committed a felony before defendant is arrested, its action preempts defenda nts right to a preliminary hearing. Webb v. Commonwealth, 204 Va. 24, 129 S.E.2d 22, 1963 Va. LEXIS 111 (1963). A suspect is not entitled to a preliminary hearing if he has not been arrested or charged with any offense prior to indictment by a grand jury. Land v. Commonweal th, 211 Va. 223, 176 S.E.2d 586, 1970 Va. LEXIS 237 (1970). Determination by a grand jury of probable cause to indict preempts an adult defendants right to a preliminary hearing. Nottingham v. Zahradnick, 573 F.2d 193, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 11882 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 970, 99 S. Ct. 464, 58 L. Ed. 2d 430, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 3882 (1978). Section deals only w ith person who is arrested.  Former § 19.1-163.1 (now this section) dealt by its very language only with a person who was arrested, meaning, within this context, a person who was d etained in custody by authority of law or one who was under a legal restraint. Moore v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 388, 237 S.E.2d 187, 1977 Va. LEXIS 201 (1977). Defendant was properly indicted without a preliminary hearing where the Commonwealth took a nolle prosequi of the offenses charged...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-219"><akn:num>§ 19.2-219</akn:num><akn:heading>When capias need not be issued; summons; judgment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text No capias need be issued on a presentment or indictment of an offense for which there is no punishment but a fine or forfeiture, limited to an amount not exceeding twen ty dollars; but a summons to answer such presentment or indictment may be issued against the accused; and if it be served ten days before the return day thereof, and he does not appear, judgment may be rendered against him for the penalty.

Purpose of an indictment is to give the accused notice of the nature and character of th e offense charged. The requirements of an indictment are prescribed by this section, which provides that an indictment shall be a plain, concise, and definite written statement . . . describing the offense charged. Cantwell v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 606, 347 S.E.2d 523, 3 Va. Law Rep. 166, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 312 (1986). The function of an indictment is to give an accused notice of the nature and character of the accusations against him or her in order that the accused can adequat ely prepare to defend against his or her accuser. Sims v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 611, 507 S.E.2d 648, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (1998). The indictment fulfilled the purpose of informing defendant of the charge against him and was not deficient for failing to state that defendant had a prior convic tion on a violent felony that could net defendant a five-year mandatory minimum sentence as the indictment sufficiently alleged the underlying offense and its elements, and the statute the Commonwealth incorporated by reference sufficiently informed defe ndant that he could receive a mandatory minimum sentence if the Commonwealth showed a prior conviction for a violent felony. Thomas v. Commonwealth, 37 Va. App. 748, 561 S.E.2d 56, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 176 (2002). An indictment must give the accused notice of the nature and character of the offense charged so he can make his defense, although in charging a statutory offense it is not necessary to follow the identical words of the statute. Wilder v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 145, 225 S.E.2d 411, 1976 Va. LEXIS 253 (1976). A criminal defendant enjoys the right to be advised of the cause and nature of the accusation lodged against him and this right is fully honored by this section a nd § 19.2-221. Simpson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 109, 267 S.E.2d 134, 1980 Va. LEXIS 221 (1980). The indictment should cite the statute or ordinance that defines the offense or, if there is no defining statute or ordinance, prescribes the punishment for t he offense. Both the United States and Virginia Constitutions recognize that a criminal defendant enjoys the right to be advised of the cause and nature of the accusation lodged against him. The important concerns evident in these provisions are fully honored by this section and § 19.2-221. Rush v. Commonwealth, No. 2058-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 26, 1996). An indictment, in order to be sufficient, must give an accused notice of the nature and character of the offense charged so he can make his defense. Commonwealth v. Dalton, 259 Va. 249, 524 S.E.2d 860, 2000 Va. LEXIS 5 (2000). It is not necessary to include in the indictment an allegation of every fact in the chain of circumstances comprising the offense charged. Howard v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 904, 275 S.E.2d 602, 1981 Va. LEXIS 226 (1981). Ordinarily, an indictment sufficiently charges a statutory offense if it follows the lan guage of the statute but this rule does not apply when the statutory language does not in itself fully and clearly set forth all the material elements of the offense. Sims v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 611, 507 S.E.2d 648, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (1998). References at the foot of the charge to particular criminal statutes fail to save an indictment otherwise defective. Such references support, but do not replace, the definite written statement, required in the body of an indictment. Wilder v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 145, 225 S.E.2d 411, 1976 Va. LEXIS 253 (1976). A defendant cannot be charged in one count with two or more independent offenses. The re ason for the rule is to prevent confusion, multiplication of issues, and prejudice to the defendant. Walker v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 438, 404 S.E.2d 394, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2532, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 89 (1991). The indorsement is not a substantive part of an indictment and is not determinative of t he legal sufficiency of the accusation to charge the crime for which it is sought to hold the accused to answer; it neither strengthens nor weakens the legal force of the averments in the charging portion of the indictment. Wilder v. Commonwealth, 217 Va . 145, 225 S.E.2d 411, 1976 Va. LEXIS 253 (1976). Indictment must contain an averment of facts essential to the punishment to be inflicted. McKinley v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 1, 225 S.E.2d 352, 1976 Va. LEXIS 229 (1976). But punishment need not be affirmatively set forth.  Although it is fundamental that when a statute contains more than one grade of offense carrying different punishments, the indictment must contain an assertion of the facts essential to the punishment sought to be imposed, this section does not require an indictment to affirmatively set forth the punishment for the offense. Sloan v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 240, 544 S.E.2d 375, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (2001). Where an offense is punishable with a higher penalty because it is a second or subsequent offense of the same kind, the more severe punishment cannot be inflicted unless the indictment charges that it is a second or subsequent offense. McKinley v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 1, 225 S.E.2d 352, 1976 Va. LEXIS 229 (1976). An indictment need not be drafted in the exact words of the applicable statute so long a s the accused is given notice of the nature and character of the offense charged. Black v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 277, 288 S.E.2d 449, 1982 Va. LEXIS 200 (1982). Indictment cannot be collaterally attacked unless defect jurisdictional.  As long as the indictment is not so defective as to deprive the court of jurisdiction to render the judgment of conviction, a petitioner may not collaterally atta ck the sufficiency of the indictment by a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Abney v. Warden, Mecklenburg Correctional Ctr., 1 Va. App. 26, 332 S.E.2d 802, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 55 (1985). Indictment n ot invalidated by surplusage.  Additional unnecessary language included in indictment which is surplusage does not invalidate the indictment. Black v. Commonwealth, 223 Va. 277, 288 S.E.2d 449, 1982 Va. LEXIS 200 (1982). When an allegation of variance is based on unnecessary words in an indictment, the unnec essary word or words in the indictment must be descriptive of that which is legally essential to the charge. Stated another way, the unnecessary language must have a material effect on the offense charged and on the proof required to convict unde r that charge. Hairston v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 211, 343 S.E.2d 355, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (1986). If the unnecessary word or words inserted in the indictment describe, limit or qualify the words which it was necessary to insert therein, then they are descripti ve of the offense charged in the indictment and cannot be rejected as surplusage. The offense as charged must be proved. Hairston v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 211, 343 S.E.2d 355, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (1986). Sign ature of grand jury foreman on indictments.  Failure of the grand jury foreman to sign the indictments was a defect in form only and accordingly, when the indictments were returned by the grand jury in open court, that defect in form was cured and the indictments became valid instruments under which to try defendant. Although the written charges did not contain the signature of the grand jury foreman, they had been returned in open court by the gran d jury as true bills and, thus, became valid indictments. Reed v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 471, 706 S.E.2d 854, 2011 Va. LEXIS 50 (2011). II.Illustrative Cases. Use of term on or about in the indictment was consistent with the provisions of this section, where defendant requested no bill of particulars regarding the date or time of the crime charged, counsel for the accused during cross examination made a concerted effort to fix the date of February 17 with certainty before presenting an al ibi defense, and the complaining witnesses were two young children, ages 9 and 10. Marlowe v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 619, 347 S.E.2d 167, 3 Va. Law Rep. 181, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 314 (1986). Time was not an element of sexual offenses alleged, and both indictments and Commonwealths response to bill of particulars sufficiently informed defendant of relevant offense dates. Booker v. Commonwealth, No. 1603-98-1 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 3, 1999). Evidence was not deficient in defendants case where he was charged with and convicted of aggravated sexual battery; where the indictment stated that the charg ed events occurred on or about a certain date through a certain other date, the trial court had a basis for ruling that the dates contained in the indictment were sufficiently narrow to apprise defendant of the charges against him and allow him t o prepare a defense. Clifford v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 499, 633 S.E.2d 178, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 364 (2006), rev'd, 274 Va. 23, 645 S.E.2d 295, 2007 Va. LEXIS 93 (2007).

Venue, § 15. CASE NOTES A criminal defendant enjoys the right to be advised of the cause and nature of the accusation lodged against him and this right is fully honored by § 19.2-220 and this section. Simpson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 109, 267 S.E.2d 134, 1980 Va. LEXIS 221 (1980). The indictment should also cite the statute or ordinance that defines the offense or, if there is no defining statute or ordinance, prescribes the punishment for the offense. Both the United States and Virginia Constitutions recognize that a criminal defendant enjoys the right to be advised of the cause and nature of the accusation lodged against him. The important concerns evident in these provisions are fully honored by § 19.2-220 and this section. Rush v. Commonwealth, No. 2058-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 26, 1996). This section merely prescribes short form indictments for murder and manslaughter. Warlit ner v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 348, 228 S.E.2d 698, 1976 Va. LEXIS 286 (1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 957, 97 S. Ct. 1604, 51 L. Ed. 2d 807, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 1401 (1977). It does not mention, much less establish, any presumptions or burdens. Warlitner v. Commo nwealth, 217 Va. 348, 228 S.E.2d 698, 1976 Va. LEXIS 286 (1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 957, 97 S. Ct. 1604, 51 L. Ed. 2d 807, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 1401 (1977). And nothing in Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975) casts any shadow upon the constitutionality of this section. Warlitner v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 348, 228 S.E.2d 698, 1976 Va. LEXIS 286 (1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 957, 97 S. Ct. 1604, 51 L. Ed. 2d 807, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 1401 (1977). The statutory short form of indictment for murder includes the charge of murder of the first degree. Kibert v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 660, 222 S.E.2d 790, 1976 Va. LEXIS 182 (1976). When the accused pleads guilty to an indictment for murder, he confesses to the highest degree of the offense which the indictment charges and of which he can be convicted under its averments. Kibert v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 660, 222 S.E.2d 790, 1976 Va. LEXIS 182 (1976). The object of the forms of indictment for murder and manslaughter set out in this sectio n was to eliminate the excessive verbiage used in the old common-law forms and to substitute therefor a short, simple statement of the offense charged. Hurd v. Commonwealth, 159 Va. 880, 165 S.E. 536, 1932 Va. LEXIS 226 (1932). Short form approved by state and federal courts.  The short form allowed by this section as a form for indictment has been approved by both the federal and the State courts. Davis v. Slayton, 353 F. Supp. 571, 19 73 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15091 (W.D. Va. 1973). Sufficiency of indictment challenged in federal habeas corpus proceedings.  If an accused is aware of the actual charge against him, and the indictment provides sufficient information upon which to prepare a defense, there has been no vio lation of any constitutional right cognizable in a federal habeas corpus proceeding. Claytor v. Slayton, 342 F. Supp. 767, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14045 (W.D. Va. 1972). Inmate was denied habeas corpus relief on his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the amendment of the murder indictment on the day of trial to add the words willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation, because Virginia law permitted the use of short-form indictments in charging defendants with murder, and therefore the original indictment would have been sufficient to char ge the inmate with first-degree murder; this charge implicitly included the willful, deliberate, and premeditated language of the amended indictment. Coleman v. Johnson, No. 2:04cv724, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33709 (E.D. Va. Sept. 6, 2005). The omission of the words unlawful act and with malice aforethought in a n indictment for murder does not constitute a fatal defect. Coleman v. Smyth, 166 F. Supp. 934, 1958 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3630 (D. Va.), dismissed, 260 F.2d 518, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3128 (4th Cir. 1958). Indictment for murder in first degree need not charge specially facts showing the offense.  Even before this section was enacted it had been held in Commonwealth v. Miller, 3 Va. (1 Va. Cas.) 310 (1812), that it was unnecessary for an indictment for murd er in the first degree to charge specially facts that would show the offense to have been murder in the first degree, and there have been a number of subsequent cases to the same effect. McGrady v. Cunningham, 296 F.2d 600, 1961 U.S. App. LEXIS 3219 (4th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 855, 82 S. Ct. 944, 8 L. Ed. 2d 14, 1962 U.S. LEXIS 1482 (1962). An indictment for murder in the first degree under this section need not charge specifically the facts showing the offense. Ward v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 564, 138 S.E.2d 293, 1964 Va. LEXIS 219 (1964); Simpson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 109, 267 S.E.2d 134, 1980 Va. LEXIS 221 (1980). An indictment need not designate the degree of the offense charged nor allege facts whic h would describe that degree. This short form indictment, therefore, is sufficient to charge murder either in the first or second degree. Hale v. Cox, 336 F. Supp. 1364, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15426 (W.D. Va. 1972). It is not necessary that the indictment should charge murder in the first degree or use that description which, according to the statute, constitutes that degree of offense. Ward v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 564, 138 S.E.2d 293, 1964 Va. LEXIS 219 (1964); Simpson v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 109, 267 S.E.2d 134, 1980 Va. LEXIS 221 (1980). An indictment which charged that the defendant feloniously and unlawfully did kill and murder one named person did not void a conviction of second-degree murder. Claytor v. Slayton, 342 F. Supp. 767, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14045 (W.D. Va. 1972). Manner of killing.  Under an indictment for murder in the form prescribed either by this section or Rule 3A:7, Form 5 of the Supreme Court, the Commonwealth may prove a killing in an y manner or in different manners. Thus, the Commonwealth was not required to elect whether it was proceeding against the defendant on the theory that the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated or under the felony-murder doctrine that the killin g occurred in the commission of abduction. Akers v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 40, 216 S.E.2d 28, 1975 Va. LEXIS 248 (1975). Forms held sufficient.  In a prosecution for homicide, it was contended that the short form of indictment, drawn according to this section, did not give sufficient notice of the cause an d nature of the accusation. It was held that there was no merit in this contention. Hurd v. Commonwealth, 159 Va. 880, 165 S.E. 536, 1932 Va. LEXIS 226 (1932); Bausell v. Commonwealth, 165 Va. 669, 181 S.E. 453, 1935 Va. LEXIS 317 (1935); Maxwell v. Comm onwealth, 167 Va. 490, 187 S.E. 506, 1936 Va. LEXIS 311 (1936). The short form of indictment prescribed by this section is sufficient to support a conviction of murder in the first degree. Hobson v. Youell, 177 Va. 906, 15 S.E .2d 76, 1941 Va. LEXIS 272 (1941). An indictment which substantially follows the statutory short form as prescribed for homicide is sufficient. Coleman v. Smyth, 166 F. Supp. 934, 1958 U.S. Dist. L EXIS 3630 (D. Va.), dismissed, 260 F.2d 518, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3128 (4th Cir. 1958). Accused contended that a demurrer to the indictment should have been sustained because it was not alleged that he did some act towards the commission of the offen se charged. It was held that under this section, the indictment was sufficient and the demurrer was properly overruled. Pamplin v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 470, 188 S.E. 147, 1936 Va. LEXIS 309 (1936). The proposition that the short statutory form of indictment for murder includes the charge of murder in the first degree is now the established law in this Common wealth. Barber v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 241, 142 S.E.2d 484, 1965 Va. LEXIS 192 (1965). Under a short form murder indictment, defendant could be convicted of first or second-degree murder. Burton v. Cox, 312 F. Supp. 264, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12239 (W.D. Va. 1970). The short form of indictment is by this section sufficient to convict on first as well as second-degree murder. Davis v. Slayton, 353 F.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2C M.J. Autrefois, Acquit and Convict, § 6; 10A M.J. Inst ructions, § 35. CASE NOTES Charge o f larceny of United States currency sufficient.  Prior to the passage of this section in 1870, it had been decided that in an indictment for larceny, a description of the subject as United States currency,  was not sufficient. In consequence of that decision, this section was passed, by which, among other things, it was enacted that in a prosecution for the larceny of United States currency, it shall be sufficient if the accused be proved guilt y of the larceny of national bank notes, or United States treasury notes. An indictment now charging the offense as a larceny of United States currency, does charge an indictable offense under the section. Dull v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 965, 1875 Va. LEXIS 77 (1875) (see Holly v. Commonwealth, 113 Va. 769, 75 S.E. 88 (1912)). Possession and larceny need no t be charged.  It is sufficient for an indictment under this section, for embezzlement, to conform to the language of the statute in its description of the offense. Possession n eed not be alleged, nor need larceny be charged. Embezzle has as fixed a meaning as steal, and to charge that defendants did feloniously . . . embezzle and convert to their use, etc., is a sufficient allegation. Commonwealth v. Da vis, 17 Va. L. Reg. 516 (1911). No objection can be urged to an indictment for embezzlement because of the number of transactions contained in the indictment, as the statute allows this to be done. Commonwealth v. Davis, 17 Va. L. Reg. 516 (1911). Distinct acts of embezzlement for six-month period may be joined.  This section allows the prosecutor to proceed against an accused for any number of distinct acts of such embezzlements as may have been committed within a six-month period. The thrust of this section, therefore, is to allow joinder under one charge of separate crimes committed within the specified period where said joinder, absent statutory authority, possibly might run afoul of the rule of duplicity of c harges. Mechling v. Slayton, 361 F. Supp. 770, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12896 (E.D. Va. 1973). Although the rule of duplicity prohibits the simultaneous charging of several unrelated crimes in one indictment, pursuant to this section, distinct acts of embez zlement for a six-month period are related such that they may be grouped together under one charge. Mechling v. Slayton, 361 F. Supp. 770, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12896 (E.D. Va. 1973). Separate impulses to steal.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of three counts of felony embezzlement because he embezzled money as a result of a series of individual impulses to s teal rather than according to a single general impulse; he embezzled 20 times at sporadic intervals from six different cash registers over a 25-day period; and the Commonwealth was not required to prove that defendant acted with a distinct impulse to ste al for each count of embezzlement charged, rather, the focus was on whether defendant had a separate impulse to steal each time he took money, and the evidence established that he embezzled according to a series of individual impulses. Kanu v. Commonweal th, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 287 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2020). Charge of continuous plan, etc., and single offense sufficient.  An indictment did not contravene this section because it charged a continuous plan or scheme and a single offense of embezzlement. Challenor v. Commonweal th, 209 Va. 789, 167 S.E.2d 116, 1969 Va. LEXIS 179 (1969). Evidence relating to earlier embezzlement held inadmissible.  Where it was manifest from the evidence that the two crimes of embezzlement charged in the indictment were not part of a continuous scheme and occurred at times s eparated by several years the court erred in refusing to strike the evidence relating to the earlier embezzlement. Webb v. Commonwealth, 204 Va. 24, 129 S.E.2d 22, 1963 Va.

Larceny, § 16. CASE NOTES Description as would sustain larceny indictment sufficient.  In a prosecution for forging, or attempting to employ as true any forged instrument, it is sufficient to describe the same in the indictment in such manner as wou ld sustain an indictment for the larceny of such instrument. Coleman v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 865, 1874 Va. LEXIS 86 (1874), overruled, Campbell v. Commonwealth, 246 Va. 174, 431 S.E.2d 648, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1505, 1993 Va. LEXIS 101 (1993). No necessity for setting out end orsement.  On the trial when the note was offered in evidence, it was objected to on the ground of variance. It was not necessary to set out in the indictment the endorsemen ts upon the note, or any other matter written upon the same paper, constituting no part of the note itself, and not entering into the essential description of the instrument. Perkins v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. 650 (1850). The description of the writing in the indictment, as the endorsement of a person whose name is forged, will not vitiate the indictment, though the simulated liabi lity might not be that of a technical endorser, but of a different character. Powell v. Commonwealth, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 822, 1854 Va. LEXIS 61 (1854). Nor maker and place of payment.  An indictment charged the forgery of an endorsement on a negotiable note, which was described as to the amount, date to whom payable and when due but did not stat e who was the maker of the note or where it was payable. It was a good indictment. Cocke v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 750, 1855 Va. LEXIS 61 (1855). Variance in indictment and forged order.  The difference between account as set out in the indictment and acct as written in a forged order, is not a material variance, which will exclude the order as evidence. Burress v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 934, 1876 Va. LEXIS 84 (1876), overruled, Keister's Ex'rs v. Philips' Ex'x, 124 Va. 585, 98 S.E. 674, 1919 Va.

For history and general consideration of statute, see Commonwealth v. Peas, 43 Va. (2 Gr att.) 629, 1834 Va. LEXIS 74 (1834). Constitutionality.  The constitutional guarantee that the accused in all criminal prosecutions has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him, etc., is not violated by this section. Shiflett v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 386, 18 S.E. 838, 1894 Va. LEXIS 2 (1894). Extends to most defects in form.  The provisions of this act dispense with the necessity of formal allegations in an indictment, and declare that no indictment shall be quashed, or deemed inva lid, for any of certain enumerated causes. So far as these provisions extend they secure an indictment against objections, however raised. They seem to extend to most if not all defects of form. Lazier v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 708, 1853 Va . LEXIS 76 (1853). Absence of the foremans signature from an indictment, although not specified in § 19.2-226 as an insubstantial defect in form, is nonetheless a defect in f orm only and does not render the indictment so defective as to be in violation of the constitution under § 19.2-227. Reed v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 471, 706 S.E.2d 854, 2011 Va. LEXIS 50 (2011). Failure of grand jury foreman to sign indictments is defect in form only.  Failure of the grand jury foreman to sign the indictments was a defect in form only and accordingly, when the indictments were returned by the grand jury in open court, that defect in form was cured and the indictments became valid instruments under which to try defendant. The absence of the foremans signature from an indictment, although not specified in § 19.2-226 as an insubstantial defect in form, was nonetheless a defect in form only and did not render the indictment so defective as to be in violation of the constitution under Va. Code Ann. § 19.2-227. Reed v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 471, 706 S.E.2d 854, 2011 Va. LEXIS 50 (2011). Power of trial courts to make amendments.  It clearly seems to be the legislative intent to empower the trial courts to make amendments to defective indictments when the defects are much greater, and might be more fatal than those listed as inconsequential and without need of amendment in this section. Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321, 1937 Va. LEXIS 291 (1937). Alteration of printed form not alteration of indictment.  Where indictment was drawn on paper containing a printed form originally designed for use as an information, and this form was merely altered to conform to a prop er form of an indictment and the blanks filled in with typewritten matter which conclusively demonstrated the charge against the accused, a motion to quash, on the ground that the indictment was altered, was properly overruled. McCann v. Commonwealth, 17 4 Va. 429, 4 S.E.2d 768, 1939 Va. LEXIS 162 (1939). Need not prove ultimate ownership of property taken in robbery prosecution.  Because robbery is a crime against the person, the prosecution need not prove the ultimate ownership of the property taken but need only prove that the possessory rights of the victim were superior to those of the thief. As such, it is not legally essential to allege or identify the ultimate owner of the property taken. Hairston v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 211, 343 S.E.2d 355, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (198 6). II.Jurisdiction and Venue. Jurisdiction must appear.  Notwithstanding this section, dispensing with the necessity for merely formal allegations in an information or indictment, it is still necessary that it be shown in terms or by proper averments that the case is one of which the court had jurisdiction. Commonwealth v. Guigon (1886) (see Lazier v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 708 (1853); Anderson v. Commonwealth, 100 Va. 860, 42 S.E. 865 (1902), overruled on an other point, Kelley v. Commonwealth, 140 Va. 522, 125 S.E. 437 (1924)). The naming of the county in the margin is not indispensable, if it be found in the body of the indictment. Tefft v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 721, 1837 Va. LEXIS 45 (1837). Venue in caption applies to whole indictment and each count thereof.  An indictment contained two counts. The caption was Virginia  Roanoke County, to wit. The petitioner demurred to the entire indictment alleging as to the second count that it had no caption and no venue was laid. The caption applies to the whole indictment and to each count in it. Wright v. Commonwealth, 82 Va. 183, 1886 Va. LEXIS 22 (1886). Averment as to precise place not necessary.  In a prosecution for stabbing with intent to kill, where the indictment which was made by the grand jury of the Hustings Court of the City of Richmond charged the assault to have been made at the said city and within the jurisdiction of the said Hustings Court of the City of Richmond, this was sufficient. It was not necessary to state the place in the city where the assault was made. Baccigalupo v. Commonwealth, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 807, 1880 Va. LEXIS 76 (1880). Except in case of local offense.  Where an offense is local in its nature, place is of its essence, and it is essential that the place should be set forth in the indictment, and the proof must cor respond. Morgan v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 80, 21 S.E. 826, 1893 Va. LEXIS 14 (1893) (see Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321 (1937)). Uncertainty as to where offense committed objectionable.  Where the indictment in the caption names one county and in the body of it speaks of the defendant as of another county, the charging the offense to have been com mitted in the county aforesaid, is error, it not being alleged with sufficient certainty that the offense was committed in the county in which the indictment was found. Bell v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 600, 1851 Va. LEXIS 72 (1851). Presentment for playing cards, at or near a place, is objectionable for uncertainty. Bishop v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 785, 1856 Va. LEXIS 39 (18 56). Sufficient averment.  An indictment charging that the prisoner, at the county and within the jurisdiction of the court, feloniously and maliciously did stab one P.T. with intention to maim, etc., and kill him, will not be quashed upon objection that it does not allege that P.T. was within the county or jurisdiction. Commonwealth v. Woodson, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 669, 1839 Va. LEXIS 9 (1839). Insufficient averment.  An indictment which charges that an offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court, but does not state where the offense was committed, is bad on demurrer. Early v. Commonwealth, 93 Va. 765, 24 S.E. 936, 1896 Va. LEXIS 134 (1896). III.Designation of Time. Omission to state, or imperfect statement of time does not hurt indictment. Sledd v. Comm onwealth, 60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 813, 1870 Va. LEXIS 21 (1870); Rhodes v. Commonwealth, 78 Va. 692, 1884 Va. LEXIS 42 (1884). The Commonwealth may prove the commission of the crime charged on a date different from that alleged, and sustain a conviction thereof. Parish v. Commonwealth, 20 6 Va. 627, 145 S.E.2d 192, 1965 Va.

(2 Va. Cas.) 483 (1825); Stephen v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 759, 1830 Va. LEXIS 74 (1830). Legislative prerogative.  This section was intended to meet cases, and to require persons charged with crime to assert their rights and to make their defenses before verdict, and thereafte r to cut off all defenses not made before verdict unless prohibited by the Constitution. The Constitution gives to the accused the right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation, and this right cannot be taken away from him, but there is no inhib ition on the legislature to fix a stage of the procedure beyond which he cannot go in the assertion of his constitutional right. Flanary v. Commonwealth, 133 Va. 665, 112 S.E. 604, 1922 Va. LEXIS 125 (1922). Collateral attack barred unless defects in indictment jurisdictional.  As long as the indictments on which a defendant was convicted were not so defective so as to deprive the court of jurisdiction to render the judgments of convicti on, a petitioner may not collaterally attack the sufficiency of the indictments. Kahaliqi v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 185 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 10, 2001). If an alleged defect be matter of form or surplusage only it is cured by the criminal st atute of jeofails. Lithgow v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 297 (1822). Certainty in charge required.  The statute of jeofails was not intended to introduce a carelessness or laxity in pleading, but merely to cure those defects which the over nicety of the courts h ad introduced into the common law, and which did not put the rights of the Commonwealth or the accused into jeopardy. According to the very terms of the statute, the offense must be charged with sufficient certainty in the indictment or other accusation, for judgment to be given thereon according to the very right of the case. There must still be some certainty in the charge. Commonwealth v. Peas, 43 Va. (2 Gratt.) 629, 1834 Va. LEXIS 74 (1834); Commonwealth v. Ailstock, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 650, 1846 Va. LEXIS 81 (1846); Old v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 915, 1867 Va. LEXIS 36 (1867). Omission to state court where grand jury impanelled is cured.  The omission to state in what court of the county the grand jury was impanelled (the county itself being mentioned), if an error, is cured. Trimble v. Commonwealt h, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 143 (1818). And omission to state offense was unlawfully committed.  The omission to state in an indictment that the offense was committed unlawfully, is cured by the statute of jeofails. Commonwealth v. Bennett, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 235 (1820). Defective spelling of date.  An indictment for grand larceny, charged the goods to have been stolen on the 21st of December, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-thee, leaving out th e r in the last word. This is cured by the statute of jeofails. Aldridge v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 447 (1824). A mistake in the name of the month in which the deceased died, where it is clear from th e rest of the indictment that it was a mistake, and it is clear what month was intended, is one of form cured by the statute of jeofails. Commonwealth v. Ailstock, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 650, 1846 Va. LEXIS 81 (1846). Omission of time of offense.  An indictment for unlawfully transporting ardent spirits accurately charged accused with the offense in every particular except as to the date of the commission o f the offense. There was no demurrer or other objection to the indictment until after a verdict of conviction, which was abundantly supported by the testimony. If objection had been raised because of the omission of the date of the offense, it could have been corrected at the bar by the prosecuting attorney on mere motion under § 19.2-231. It was held that under this section, accused could not raise the objection on appeal that the indictment was defective for failure to state the time of the commiss ion of the offense. Flanary v. Commonwealth, 133 Va. 665, 112 S.E. 604, 1922 Va. LEXIS 125 (1922) (see also Honaker v. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 752, 118 S.E. 85 (1923)). Absence of the foremans signature from an indictment, although not specified in § 19.2-226 as an insubstantial defect in form, is nonetheless a defect in f orm only and does not render the indictment so defective as to be in violation of the constitution under § 19.2-227. Reed v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 471, 706 S.E.2d 854, 2011 Va. LEXIS 50 (2011). Signature of grand jury foreman.  Failure of the grand jury foreman to sign the indictments was a defect in form only and accordingly, when the indictments were returned by the grand jury in open court, that defect in form was cured and the indictments became valid instruments under which to try defendant. The absence of the foremans signature from an indictment, although not specified in § 19.2-226 as an insubstantial defect in form, was nonetheless a defect in form only and did not render the indictment so defective as to be in violation of the constitution under § 19.2-227. Reed v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 471, 706 S.E.2d 854, 2011 Va. LEXIS 50 (2011). Failure to allege incorporation of the owner of property stolen.  See Lithgow v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 297 (1822). Former convi ction alleged by recital only sustained.  A conviction for a second offense in violating the former prohibition law was sustained, notwithstanding the fact that a former conviction was alleged by way of r ecital only, where no objection to the indictment was made by demurrer or otherwise. Cooper v. Commonwealth, 134 Va. 545, 113 S.E. 863, 1922 Va. LEXIS 176 (1922). But omission to charge intent not cu red.  In a prosecution for unlawful and malicious cutting, accused contended on appeal that the indictment was not in compliance with § 18.2-51, in that it failed to charge that the cutting was done with the intent to maim, disable, or kill, as required by the statute. It was held that where no felony is alleged in an indictment, it would be violative of constitutional rights to find one guilty of that grade of offe nse, and, therefore, this section did not cure the defect in the indictment. Tompkins v. Commonwealth, 177 Va. 858, 13 S.E.2d 409, 1941 Va. LEXIS 264 (1941). Misrecital of ordinance.  Defendants conviction for driving while his license was suspended due to no insurance was proper because the original charging document, a Virginia Uniform Su mmons, was not void ab initio as it was issued by a law enforcement officer - not a court; although the summons incorrectly cited the local ordinance incorporating the state provision prohibiting the crime, there was a local ordinance that legally incorp orated the state provision, meaning the city had the legal authority to charge defendant under its existing ordinances; and the misrecital of the ordinance number did not render the summons so defective as to be in violation of the Constitution as defend ant had sufficient notice of the gravamen of the offense. Ellis v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 162, 875 S.E.2d 91, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (2022). Waiver.  Defendant waived any objection to the indictment by failing to raise the existence of a fatal variance between the indictment for criminal street gang recruitment and the evidence at trial prior to the courts verdict as required by this section. Gomez v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. App. 173, 843 S.E.2d 379, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (2020). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statutory requirement not ju risdictional.  Defendant was not entitled to vacate his convictions void ab initio because, since the statutory requirement for an indictment was not jurisdictional, the failure of the record to show affirmatively that the indictment was returned into court by the grand jury was not such a defect as would render the judgment of conviction null and void, defendant did not object to any defect in the indictment process before the verdict, or on direct appeal of the judgments in accordance with the requirements of multi jurisdictional grand juries. Commonwealth v. Fredo, 108 Va. Cir. 534, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 517 (Chesapeake Oct. 25, 2021). Indictment found to be sufficient.  In a case in which defendant was convicted of violating former § 3.1-796.124 [now § 3.2-6571] and he filed a motion to set aside based on alleged deficienci es in the indictment, since he did not raise the issue of the validity of the indictment until 16 months after trial, defendant had waived his right to be more fully advised of the cause and nature of his accusation. Additionally, it was obvious that def endant, the Commonwealth, and the court all were fully aware of the cause and nature of the offense for which he was being tried and of which he was convicted.

Text In a prosecution for a misdemeanor the name and address of the complaining witness, if there be one, shall be written at the foot of the presentment, indictment or info rmation when it is made, found or filed. In case the grand jury that brings in such presentment or indictment or the attorney for the Commonwealth who files such information fail to write the name of a complaining witness at the foot of the presentment, indictment or information, then the name of a complaining witness may be entered of record as such by the court on the motion of the defendant or the attorney for the Commonwealth at any time before the judgment.

CASE NOTES This is not a penal statute, and there is no reason why it should be construed strictly and not carry into effect the obvious intention of the legislature. Wortham v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 669, 1827 Va. LEXIS 31 (1827). Requirement merely directory.  The requirement of the statutes is merely directory, not mandatory, and a failure to observe it will not invalidate an indictment. Porterfield v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 801, 22 S.E. 352, 1895 Va. LEXIS 77 (1895) (see also Commonwealth v. Dever, 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 685 (1840); Commonwealth v. Williams, 40 Va. (5 Gratt.) 702 (1848); Shelton v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 450, 16 S.E. 355 (1892)). It applies only to misdemeanors.  This section does not require name of prosecutor to be written at foot of an indictment for a felony, but only for a misdemeanor. Thompson v. Commonwealth, 88 Va. 45, 13 S.E. 304, 1891 Va. LEXIS 7 (1891). And then only to volunteer prosecuto rs.  A volunteer informer ought to be made a prosecutor, and liable for costs in case of failure. But one who is compelled to be an informer, cannot be considered a pr osecutor. Wortham v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. (5 Rand.) 669, 1827 Va. LEXIS 31 (1827). A private person may be prosecutor, and liable to pay the costs of the defendant, notwit hstanding he was not named at the foot of the information it appearing sufficiently by the presentment, and other proceedings in the cause, that he was the person who instituted the prosecution. After verdict rendered it was too late for the prosecutor t o show, by parol testimony, that he was called on by the grand jury, and did not voluntarily go before them to give them information. Commonwealth v. Dove, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 29 (1815). Costs to prosecutor when indictment quashed because of incapacity of juror.  When in a prosecution for a misdemeanor at the instance of a voluntary prosecutor, the defendant filed a plea in abatement, that one of the grand jurors who found the indictment was not a freeholder, and the issue made upon that plea was found for the defendant, and the indictment quashed, the court gave judgment for the costs against the prosecutor. Commonwealth v. St. Clair, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 556, 1844 Va. LEXI S 45 (1844). An indictment will not be dismissed, though the prosecutor be insolvent, if the court wo uld ex officio have directed a prosecution to be instituted. Commonwealth v. Hill, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 601, 1838 Va. LEXIS 46 (1838). Prosec utor a competent witness in support of indictment.  On an indictment for an assault and battery on the voluntary information of the person assaulted, the informer and prosecutor, being the only witness for the pros ecution, is a competent witness, though liable for costs in case defendant is acquitted. Baker v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 353 (1823); Gilliam v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 688, 1834 Va.

CASE NOTES A defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars as a matter of right; whether the C ommonwealth is required to file a bill of particulars rests within the discretion of the trial court. Quesinberry v. Commonwealth, 241 Va. 364, 402 S.E.2d 218, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1796, 1991 Va. LEXIS 45, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 834, 112 S. Ct. 113, 116 L. Ed. 2d 82, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 5410 (1991). Limitations on use.  As long as an indictment sufficiently recites the elements of the offense, the commonwealth is not required to include all evidence upon which it plans to rely to prove a particular offense, and an accused should not be permitted to use a bill of particulars to expand the scope of discovery in a criminal case. Sims v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 611, 507 S.E.2d 648, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (1998). Purpose of bill of particulars is to state sufficient facts regarding the crime to infor m an accused in advance of the offense for which he is to be tried; he is entitled to no more. Swisher v. Commonwealth, 256 Va. 471, 506 S.E.2d 763, 1998 Va. LEXIS 142 (1998), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 812, 120 S. Ct. 46, 145 L. Ed. 2d 41, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4 850 (1999). Omission of judges name from bill of particulars as testifying witness not error.  Despite defendants arguments on appeal that: (1) by requesting a list of witnesses in his bill of particulars, the Commonwealth was required to provide him wi th the names of the witnesses it intended to call and that failure to do so should have prevented the non-disclosed witness from testifying; and (2) the Commonwealth deliberately misled him in its response to his bill of particulars and that such prosecu torial misconduct was also a basis for vacating his conviction, because defendant cited no authority in his opening brief to support either argument, and no discovery order requiring the production of witnesses had been entered, no error affecting the ou tcome of the trial resulted. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 155 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2007). Bill of particulars and arrest warrant were sufficient.  Both the arrest warrant and the Commonwealths response to a bill of particulars sufficiently informed defendant as to the general nature and character of the conduct for which he was to be tried, and Virginia jurisprudence required no more; the bill of particulars was relief available to an accused, at the discretion of the court, to supplement a charging instrument that failed to fully and clearly set forth all the material elements of the offense, but not to expand the scope of discovery in a criminal case. Raja v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 710, 581 S.E.2d 237, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (2003). Bill of particulars not required.  To be sufficient, an indictment must give the accused notice of the nature and character of the offense charged so he can make his defense; when an indict ment meets that standard, a bill of particulars is not required. Strickler v. Commonwealth, 241 Va. 482, 404 S.E.2d 227, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2320, 1991 Va. LEXIS 69, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 944, 112 S. Ct. 386, 116 L. Ed. 2d 337, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 6388 (1991). Whether the Commonwealth is required to file a bill of particulars rests with the discretion of the trial court. A bill of particulars is not required where the i ndictments provide the defendant adequate notice of the nature and the character of the offense charged so he can make his defense. Curmak v. Commonwealth, No. 0037-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals March 14, 1995). A defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars as a matter of right, but is provided in the discretion of the court. Roach v. Commonwealth, 251 Va. 324, 468 S.E.2d 98, 1996 Va. LEXIS 42 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 951, 117 S. Ct. 365, 136 L. Ed. 2d 256, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 6484 (1996), overruled in part, Morrisette v. Warden of the Sussex I State Prison, 270 Va. 188, 613 S.E.2d 551, 2005 Va. LEXIS 51 (2005). A defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars as a matter of right. Goins v. Commonwealth, 251 Va. 442, 470 S.E.2d 114, 1996 Va. LEXIS 54, cert. denied, 51 9 U.S. 887, 117 S. Ct. 222, 136 L. Ed. 2d 154, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 5758 (1996). Whether to require the Commonwealth to file a bill of particulars is a matter that rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. Mickens v. Commonwealth, 252 Va. 315, 478 S.E.2d 302, 1996 Va. LEXIS 117 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1269, 117 S. Ct. 2442, 138 L. Ed. 2d 202, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 3626 (1997). Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants motion for a bill of particulars because the indictments at issue sufficiently described each o f the alleged offenses and specifically tracked the statutory language of the offenses, and defendant did not identify any legally required matter that was left out of the indictments that deprived him of a substantial right and subjected him to the dang er of being tried upon a charge for which he was not indicted. Paduano v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 173, 766 S.E.2d 745, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 419 (2014). In a capital murder case, defendant failed to establish that the trial court erred by denying his request for a bill of particulars and by convicting him of capit al murder based upon the theory that he drowned or suffocated the child victim because the record showed that defendant had notice of the existence of an alternate theory of the case that the victim died from suffocation rather than drowning in time to s atisfy any due process right to notice of the precise manner in which he was alleged to have caused the victims death; and he established no constitutional entitlement to notice of the precise manner in which the Commonwealth alleged that he caused t he victims death. Rams v. Commonwealth, 70 Va. App. 12, 823 S.E.2d 510, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 45 (2019). Denial of bill of particul ars harmless error.  The trial court acted within its discretion in denying a defendants motion for a bill of particulars specifying what time the alleged burglary occurred, what crime the defendant intended to commit when he gained entry and what force the defendant allegedly used to seize the victim for purposes of a charge of abduction where the defendant was on notice from the preliminary hearing of the time the alleged burgl ary occurred, the indictments indicated the predicate offenses the commonwealth intended to prove and the commonwealth was not required to describe the nature of the force used when abducting the victim; to the extent the indictment for burglary may have been insufficient to apprise the defendant of the nature and character of the offense, the trial courts error in refusing to order a bill of particulars was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the defendant was aware of the predicate offenses t he commonwealth intended to prove and was not surprised by or unprepared for the proof adduced at trial. Sims v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 611, 507 S.E.2d 648, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (1998). Failure to order bill of particulars when Commonwealth amended indictment.  Trial judge did not abuse his discretion by failing to order a bill of particulars when the Commonwealth amended one of the three rape indictments to allege a new offense date. The indictment was sufficient to apprise the appellant of the nature and character of the offense, as he had already entered his plea prior to his bill of particulars request. In a statutory rape case, when the age of the victim is not in dispute, time is not of the essence of such an offense, and the Commonwealth is not required to specify the exact date. Yeager v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 761, 433 S.E.2d 248, 10 Va. Law Rep. 34, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 292 (1993). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Reciprocal discovery.  Defendant, who filed a motion for a bill of particulars, was entitled to discover the place and time of the crime charged, and this provided reciprocal discovery sufficient to render the pre-trial alibi notice requirement of Supreme Court Rule 3A:11(c)(2) consistent with defendants due process rights. Commonwealth v. Thasoonthorn, 55 Va. Cir. 28, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 45 (Fairfax County Feb. 20, 2001). Bill of particulars not required.  Defendants who were charged with violations of § 18.2-152.3:1 were not entitled to a bill of particulars when the indictment sufficiently set forth where and w hen the offenses were allegedly committed. Routing information, names of electronic mail service providers and their subscribers, and the identity of the recepients did not need to be provided when the act of transmission was the act that was circumscrib ed by the statute. Commonwealth v. Jaynes, 64 Va. Cir. 443, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 155 (Loudoun County May 25, 2004). Where the Commonwealth intended to prove vileness as an aggravating factor in support of the death penalty, it was not required to identify the components of the vileness factor on which it intended to offer evidence because the indictment, the discovery responses, and defendants opportunity to hear the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing adequately informed him of the charged offense. Commo nwealth v. Waddler, 65 Va. Cir. 418, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 296 (Portsmouth Aug. 30, 2004). Where defendant was charged with second degree murder, as the indictment did not have to allege he acted with malice, he was not entitled to a bill of particulars under § 19.2-230 concerning evidence on the issue of whether he acted with malice. Commonwealth v. Kuhne, 80 Va. Cir. 299, 2010 Va. Cir. LEX...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-231"><akn:num>§ 19.2-231</akn:num><akn:heading>Amendment of indictment, presentment or information</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If there be any defect in form in any indictment, presentment or information, or if there shall appear to be any variance between the allegations therein and the eviden ce offered in proof thereof, the court may permit amendment of such indictment, presentment or information, at any time before the jury returns a verdict or the court finds the accused guilty or not guilty, provided the amendment does not change the natu re or character of the offense charged. After any such amendment the accused shall be arraigned on the indictment, presentment or information as amended, and shall be allowed to plead anew thereto, if he so desires, and the trial shall proceed as if no a mendment had been made; but if the court finds that such amendment operates as a surprise to the accused, he shall be entitled, upon request, to a continuance of the case for a reasonable time.

In General. II. Character or Nature of Offense. I.In General. Policy.  The judicial and legislative policy is to have both civil and criminal cases tried on their merits and as far as possible to ignore mere formal defects. Collins v . City of Radford, 134 Va. 518, 113 S.E. 735, 1922 Va. LEXIS 174 (1922); Jolly v. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 756, 118 S.E. 109, 1923 Va. LEXIS 128 (1923) (see also Guynn v. Commonwealth, 163 Va. 1042, 177 S.E. 227 (1934)). The policy of the legislature is to try criminal cases on their merits as far as possible, and to ignore mere formal defects. This is demonstrated by the liberal provisions for amendment provided by the statute. Martin v. Warden, Va. State Penitentiary, 2 Va. App. 6, 341 S.E.2d 202, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 235 (1986). Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to permit the court to amend defective indictments, including such indictments as would be fatally defective if objected to at the proper time and an amendment not made. Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321, 1937 Va. LEXIS 291 (1937). The manifest purpose of this section is to allow amendments which avoid unnecessary delays and further the ends of justice, without prejudice to the substantial r ight of the accused to be informed of the accusation, and to one fair trial on the merits. Sullivan v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 867, 161 S.E. 297, 1931 Va. LEXIS 344 (1931); Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321, 1937 Va. LEXIS 291 (1937). This section permits the trial court to amend an indictment at any time before the verdict is returned or a finding of guilt is made, provided the amendment does not change the nature or character of the offense charged. Crawford v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 367 (Va. Ct. App. May 16, 2000)(Ct. of Appeals Dec. 20, 1994); Crawford v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 367 (Va. Ct. App. May 16, 2000). Liberally construed.  This section is remedial, and in accordance with the accepted rule should be construed liberally to correct the evil at which it is directed, and to promote the r emedy thereby provided. The legislative intent is to simplify criminal procedure. A narrow construction of this section would defeat its wise purpose. Sullivan v. Commonwealth, 157 Va. 867, 161 S.E. 297, 1931 Va. LEXIS 344 (1931); Livingston v. Commonwea lth, 184 Va. 830, 36 S.E.2d 561, 1946 Va. LEXIS 146 (1946). This section is remedial in nature and is to be liberally construed in order to achieve the laudable purpose of avoiding further unnecessary delay in the criminal justice process by allowing amendment, rather than requiring reindictment by a grand jury. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). This section is to be construed liberally. Cantwell v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 606, 347 S.E.2d 523, 3 Va. Law Rep. 166, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 312 (1986). Even indictments which are fatally defective may be amended under this provision if such amendment is made at the proper time. Martin v. Warden, Va. State Penitentiary, 2 Va. App. 6, 341 S.E.2d 202, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 235 (1986). Although the evidence at trial showed that defendant attempted to break and enter at a shop or business different than the shop or business named in the indictmen t, the Commonwealth did not attempt to amend the indictment to correct the defect, especially since amendments to change the location of an offense were liberally allowed and such an amendment would not have changed the nature or character of the offense ; since the Commonwealth did not amend the defect, the evidence did not prove the charge alleged in the indictment and, thus, defendants conviction had to be reversed and the indictment had to be dismissed. Dotson v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 531 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 21, 2003). Am endment satisfies constitutional provision.  An amendment under this section, setting out more definitely and specifically, either the cause and nature of the charge, or the date, or the place of the offense , satisfies the constitutional provision, giving to the accused in a criminal prosecution the right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation. The amendment is but a stage in the procedure taking place before trial. Puckett v. Commonwealth , 134 Va. 574, 113 S.E. 853, 1922 Va. LEXIS 181 (1922); Farewell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 475, 189 S.E. 321, 1937 Va. LEXIS 291 (1937) (see Woods v. Commonwealth, 140 Va. 491, 124 S.E. 458 (1924)). This section authorizes, before the general issue is pleaded, any amendment of the indictment which does not change the nature of the offense charged. Thus, the a ccused is given timely and ample opportunity to avail himself of his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. That satisfies such constitutional requirement. Forester v. Commonwealth, 210 Va. 764, 173 S.E .2d 851, 1970 Va. LEXIS 197 (1970). Substantial ri ghts of accused protected.  An amendment, when allowed under this section, must provide that the substantial rights of the accused are protected by informing him of the nature and character of the accusations. Willis v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2486, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 107 (1990). Indictment merely defective and indictment fatally invalid distinguished.  There is a marked difference between an indictment which is merely defective so that it may be amended or the defendant may be given further information by a bill of particulars, and an indictment so fatally invalid that a prosecution cannot be based upon it. Snead v. Smyth, 273 F.2d 838, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 2875 (4th Cir. 1959). No amendment where indictment invalid.  Because the indictment found by the grand jury stated no offense and was invalid, it necessarily follows the trial court had no power to amend the indictment. Wil der v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 145, 225 S.E.2d 411, 1976 Va. LEXIS 253 (1976). This section authorizes a trial court to amend an indictment at any time before the verdict is returned or a finding of guilt is made, provided that the amendment does not change the nature or character of the offense charged. Davis v. Commonwealth, No. 2626-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 1, 1997). Amendment on day of trial.  The amendment of an indictment for robbery on the day of the trial has been declared proper. Owsley v. Cunningham, 190 F. Supp. 608, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3538 (E .D. Va. 1961). Objection that indictment failed to negative exceptions waived.  Accused was indicted for the possession of a still and stilling material. To the indictment accused demurred on the ground that it did not negative the exceptions contained in the prohibition act. The demurrer was not interposed until after the jury had been impaneled and duly sworn to try the issue of fact. It was held that the point was waived by failure to interpose the demurrer in time. If there had been meri t in the point, the indictment could and doubtless would have been amended under this section which authorizes amendments of indictments for misdemeanors which do not change the nature of the offense charged, at any time before judgment is entered. Gilre ath v. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 709, 118 S.E. 100, 1923 Va. LEXIS 123 (1923). Opportunity to plead anew.  Court of Appeals would not consider defendants argument that he was entitled to plead anew after Commonwealths amendment of indictments, since def endant at trial never requested opportunity to plead anew to amended indictments. Majette v. Commonwealth, No. 2307-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 27, 2000). Objection because of variance between allegation and proof cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.  The reason for such holding is that if the attention of the trial court had been called to the alleged variance, it could have been cured by an amendment to the i ndictment under this section. Booth v. Commonwealth, 165 Va. 794, 183 S.E. 257, 1936 Va. LEXIS 253 (1936). If there shall appear to be any variance between the allegations therein and the evidence offered in proof thereof, the court may permit amendment of such indictm ent at any time before the jury returns a verdict or the court finds the accused guilty or not guilty, provided the amendment does not change the nature or character of the offense charged; any objection to deficiencies in arraignment on the amended indi ctment was not presented to the trial court and, therefore, is not before this court on appeal. Barnett v. Commonwealth, No. 2622-95-1 (Ct. of ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-232"><akn:num>§ 19.2-232</akn:num><akn:heading>What process to be awarded against accused on indictment, etc</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When an indictment or presentment is found or made, or information filed, the court, or the judge thereof, shall award process against the accused to answer the same, i f he be not in custody. Such process, if the prosecution be for a felony, shall be a capias; if it be for a misdemeanor, for which imprisonment may be imposed, it may be a capias or summons, in the discretion of the court or judge; in all other cases, it shall be, in the first instance a summons, but if a summons be returned executed and the defendant does not appear, or be returned not found, the court or judge may award a capias. The officer serving the summons or capias shall also serve a copy of the indictment, presentment, or information therewith. If the accused is in custody when an indictment or presentment is found or made, or information is filed, and no process is awarded, the attorney for the Commonwealth s hall so notify the court of such at the time of first appearance for each indictment, presentment, or information for which a report is required upon arrest pursuant to subsection A of § 19.2-390, and the court shall order that the fingerprints and ph otograph of the accused be taken for each offense by a law-enforcement officer or by the agency that has custody of the accused at the time of first appearance.

Every state may control the remedies furnished in her courts, and may at any time change the forms of procedure therein, and the laws in force in that respect at time of trial must prevail. Jones v.

Shiflett v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 386, 18 S.E. 838, 1894 Va. LEXIS 2 (1894). It displaces the rule of the common law that judgment for corporal punishment can be pro nounced against a man only when he is personally present. Shiflett v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 386, 18 S.E. 838, 1894 Va. LEXIS 2 (1894). Defendant has duty to appear in person .  Authority, conferred by this section, to try a misdemeanor charge in the absence of the accused is not a right given him; it is a privilege accorded only to the c ourt. It does not relax the defendants obligation to appear in obedience to the mandate of the summons. Nor does this section abridge the power of the court to require his submission in person to its jurisdiction  perhaps to answer its judgment. Souther v. Reid, 101 F. Supp. 806, 1951 U.S. Dist.

CASE NOTES Section is constitutional.  The constitutional guarantee that the accused in all criminal prosecutions has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him, etc., is not violated by this section. Shiflett v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 386, 18 S.E. 838, 1894 Va. LEXIS 2 (1894). The requirements of this section are met where an accused has voluntarily waived his rig ht to be present at trial but was present at the hearing where sentence was imposed. Hohman v. Commonwealth, No. 0815-95-4 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 31, 1996). Under this section, no arraignment or plea of the accused is necessary in a misdemeanor case. Bare v. Commonwealth, 122 Va. 783, 94 S.E. 168, 1917 Va. LEXIS 94 (1917); Foy v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 671, 111 S.E. 269, 1922 Va. LEXIS 64 (1922). If the accused in a prosecution for a misdemeanor, is absent, no arraignment can be made because of his absence, but nevertheless the court may proceed to trial j ust as if he had appeared and pleaded not guilty. If he is present when his case is called, he should plead, if he desires to make defense, and if he goes to trial without pleading, he thereby waives his right to do so. Bare v. Commonwealth, 122 Va. 783, 94 S.E. 168, 1917 Va. LEXIS 94 (1917). No plea is necessary in a misdemeanor case. However, in such a case an accused may plead as he has been advised, demur or move to quash, he may plead to the juris diction or he may plead guilty. He may plead former jeopardy and not guilty, or he may stand mute. If, upon his trial for a misdemeanor, he be present when his case is called, he should plead such defenses as he deems proper, and if he goes to trial with out a specific plea, he thereby waives his right to make that plea thereafter, and cannot thereafter take advantage of his failure. Royals v. City of Hampton, 201 Va. 552, 111 S.E.2d 795, 1960 Va. LEXIS 128 (1960). Presence of accused not necessary.  A prisoner indicted under § 18.2-415 for a disturbance of religious worship, who was duly summoned but failed to appear, may be tried in his absence without th e award of a capias for his arrest. Shiflett v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 386, 18 S.E. 838, 1894 Va. LEXIS 2 (1894). Continuance.  Upon indictment for carrying on a lottery business, when accused appears and pleads to the charge and moves for a continuance, it is not error to deny the motion. Lawrence v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. 573, 10 S.E. 840, 1890 Va. LEXIS 14 (1890). Forfeiture of rights found.  Appellant, by his conduct of knowingly and voluntarily failing to appear for his trial, forfeited both his constitutional rights of confrontation and due process and his statutory rights under this section. Hohman v. Commonwealth, No. 0815-95-4 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 31, 1996). The proper method of raising the question of former jeopardy is by special plea of forme r acquittal or conviction. Royals v. City of Hampton, 201 Va. 552, 111 S.E.2d 795, 1960 Va. LEXIS 128 (1960). Admissibility of warrants.  Certified criminal warrants reflecting defendants misdemeanor convictions for assault of a family member were properly admitted at defendants trial for fe lony assault of a family member, despite any failure of the warrants to reflect whether defendant was present at the time of the prior convictions because (1) nothing showed defendant was not present, and (2) it was presumed defendant was not sentenced i n absentia, contrary to § 19.2-237.

Continuances, § 19; 4C M.J. Constitutional Law, § 86; 5B M.J. Criminal Procedure, §§ 25, 39. CASE NOTES Generally, charges may be tried only in the circuit courts having territorial jurisdiction over the locations where the crimes occurred and in which venue is laid. Foster-Zahid v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 430, 477 S.E.2d 759, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 709 (1996), aff'd, 254 Va. 168, 489 S.E.2d 687, 1997 Va. LEXIS 102 (1997). Claim involved territorial jurisdiction rather than venue.  Where defendant claimed that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to try defendant because the Commonwealth failed to prove that defendants offense occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the circuit court where defendant was tried, defendants claim pertained to territorial jurisdiction, rather than venue. Gordon v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 818, 568 S.E.2d 452, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 521 (2002). Claim of lac k of territorial jurisdiction was waived.  Where defendant did not dispute that defendants alleged drug offense occurred in Virginia, but merely claimed that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the o ffense occurred in the specific territorial jurisdiction where defendant had been tried and convicted, defendants claim, like that based on improper venue, was waived because defendants objection to the circuit courts territorial jurisdiction was untimely. Gordon v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 818, 568 S.E.2d 452, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 521 (2002). Territorial jurisdiction distinguished from subject matter jurisdiction.  Unlike the subject matter jurisdiction described in § 17.1-513, which may not be waived, the jurisdiction described in § 19.2-239 refers to a circuit court s authority over persons, things, or occurrences located in a defined geographic area, which is properly categorized as territorial jurisdiction and may be waived by failing to timely raise the issue. Gordon v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 818, 568 S.E.2d 452, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 521 (2002). Transfers between circuit courts implicated territorial jurisdiction b ut not subject matter jurisdiction.  Transfer of defendants criminal trial from Norfolk (Virginia) (the place of the offense), to Arlington (Virginia) and the subsequent transfer back to Norfolk after the jury verdicts did not implicate subject matter jurisdiction since both the Arlington and Norfolk circuit courts had subject matter jurisdiction over defendants charges under § 17.1-513. The only question was whether a violation of § 1 9.2-239 occurred when the Arlington circuit court conducted the trial; this issue went solely to the circuit courts lack of authority to exercise territorial jurisdiction and was waived by defendants failure to timely object. Porter v. Commonweal th, 276 Va. 203, 661 S.E.2d 415, 2008 Va. LEXIS 78 (2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1189, 129 S. Ct. 1999, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1097, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 3047 (2009). Jurisdiction may exist where the immediate harm occurs, even if the criminal act does no t physically occur there. Foster-Zahid v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 430, 477 S.E.2d 759, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 709 (1996), aff'd, 254 Va. 168, 489 S.E.2d 687, 1997 Va. LEXIS 102 (1997). Nolo contendere plea.  By pleading nolo contendere, defendant, in essence, admitted as true each factual allegation set forth in the indictment, including the fact that the offense occu rred in the Commonwealth. Jones v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 142, 590 S.E.2d 572, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 2 (2004). Effect of plea agreement.  Acceptance of defendants plea agreement, which provided that the trial court would impose sentence on two counts of aggravated sexual battery and would withho ld decision on the other two counts, did not divest the trial court of its jurisdiction to adjudicate the charges. Holden v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 403, 494 S.E.2d 892, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (1998). The trial court had jurisdiction over a prosecution for embezzlement where the defendant took a guitar amplifier belonging to the victim with him when he moved from Virginia to West Virginia and then used it as collateral for a loan he secured from a pawn shop in West Virginia, as the crime commenced when the defendant appropriated the ampl ifier to his own use and removed it, without authorization, to West Virginia. Bescher v. Commonwealth, No. 1489-97-4 (Ct. of Appeals April 14, 1998). Jurisdiction proven.  In a murder case, the trial court had territorial jurisdiction under §§ 19.2-239 and 17.1-513 because the facts and circumstances proved that the killing oc curred in Richmond, Virginia. The undisputed evidence showed that the stabbing occurred at a rooming house in Richmond, Virginia; diagrams of the residence indicated that it was in Richmond; Richmond police and a Richmond prosecutor investigated the case ; physical evidence was analyzed in Richmond; and defendants arrest warrant had a Richmond address. Dixon v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 165 (Va. Ct. App. May 2, 2006). Trial court did not err in convicting defendant of attempted murder because the trial court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction when it failed to arra ign defendant on the charge when defendant was fully aware of the attempted murder charge and was in no way prejudiced by the omission of a formal arraignment; defendants continued silence in the face of repeated references to the attempted murder ch arge was tantamount to a waiver of his right to be arraigned and to enter a not guilty plea, and having failed to raise any objection, defendant waived any defect. Simmons v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 594, 681 S.E.2d 56, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 367 (2009). Because defendant admitted that the events in question occurred at the apartment of the victims grandmother, and because the grandmother and defendants gi rlfriend testified that the apartment was in a locality in Virginia, the evidence was sufficient to establish the trial courts subject matter jurisdiction under §§ 19.2-239 and 17.1-513. Torres v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 420 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2010). Trial court properly tried defendants trial for the alleged rape of defendants mentally disabled daughter because the court reasonably concluded that the crime occurred in the private confines of the family home in the county of the trial court where defendant spent several hours alone with defendants daughters on at least three evenings each week during the month when the pregnancy of the daughter oc curred.

CASE NOTES The purpose of this section is to secure to the accused the speedy trial guaranteed by t he Constitution, and to further the policy of the law to expedite the trial of criminal cases. Either the Commonwealth or the accused, moving for a continuance, must show good cause. Benton v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 328, 18 S.E. 282, 1893 Va. LEXIS 54 (189 3); Thompson v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 847, 109 S.E. 447, 1921 Va. LEXIS 68 (1921). While in the orderly administration of justice some delay is unavoidable and some is essential to due process, courts must inquire into the reasons for the delay. Stephens v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 224, 301 S.E.2d 22, 1983 Va. LEXIS 212 (1983). The burden is on the prosecution to prove excusable delay. Stephens v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 224, 301 S.E.2d 22, 1983 Va.

Jones v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 545, 115 S.E. 572, 1923 Va. LEXIS 39 (1923). And settin g of trial date is under supervision of court.  This provision contemplates an orderly procedure for setting criminal cases and expressly places the control of that process under the supervision of the trial co urt, not a party litigant. Williams v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 566, 347 S.E.2d 146, 3 Va. Law Rep. 119, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (1986). What is good cause is in discretion of trial court.  Under this section, whether good cause is shown upon a motion for a continuance is a question which rests largely in the discretion of the trial court, and, while the exercise of such discretion is reviewable, the judgment of the trial court in that respect will not be reversed unless plainly erroneous. Lufty v. Commonwealth, 126 Va. 707, 100 S.E. 829, 1919 Va. LEXIS 106 (1919). But such discretion may not be arbitrarily exercised to grant the Commonwealth a continu ance, without good cause, when the prisoner demands trial. Benton v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 328, 18 S.E. 282, 1893 Va. LEXIS 54 (1893). Prejudice against accused is not good cause for continuance.  Affidavits of the prevalence of bitter and general prejudice against the accused do not of themselves constitute good ground for a continuance. Joyce v. Commonwea lth, 78 Va. 287, 1884 Va. LEXIS 6 (1884). Where there was adequate inquiry into the possible prejudicial effect news coverage may have had on the jury at a defendants trial, and where, in the second t rial of the defendant, after he had been convicted in his previous trial, the jurors were examined thoroughly on voir dire to guard against the possibility of unfair publicity affecting their verdict, and where such safeguards were diligently undertaken, it cannot be said that the trial judge committed constitutional error or even abused his discretion in disallowing the defendants motion for a continuance and proceeding with the trial as provided for in this section. A contrary rule would endanger the defendants right to a speedy trial and such delays in criminal proceedings are not to be invoked lightly. Couser v. Cox, 324 F. Supp. 1140, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14002 (W.D. Va. 1971). Nor is want of time for counsel to consult authorities.  Under this section, the indictment and trial of a prisoner for rape forty-eight hours after the alleged commission of the crime is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. Want of time for counsel for the defendant to consult authorities on the law of the case is not sufficient ground to support a motion for a continuance. Wright v. Commonwealth, 114 Va. 872, 77 S.E. 503, 1913 Va. LEXIS 150 (1913). No r is temporary incompetency of witness for Commonwealth.  See Benton v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 328, 18 S.E. 282, 1893 Va. LEXIS 54 (1893). Motion for continuance may be made before arraignment.  It is competent for the prisoner to move for a continuance before his formal arraignment. Joyce v. Commonwealth, 78 Va. 287, 1884 Va. LEXIS 6 (1884). On indictment for capital felony it was held error not to entertain a motion for continuance before arraignment. Anderson v. Commonwealth, 84 Va. 77, 3 S.E. 803, 1887 Va. LEXIS 10 (1887). Commonwealth did not act in bad faith.  Defendants right to a speedy trial was not violated because even though the Commonwealths discovery failures necessitated a court-ordered continuance, sin ce the trial court ruled it did not act in bad faith, the continuance could not be imputed to the Commonwealth; the trial court expressly ruled that the Commonwealth did not act in bad faith, because that determination had not been contested, it was the law of the case. Young v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 73 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 20, 2018), aff'd, 297 Va. 443, 829 S.E.2d 548, 2019 Va. LEXIS 78 (2019). It is not error to pass over a term in granting a continuance, on the prisoners moti on. Bolanz v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 31, 1873 Va. LEXIS 3 (1873). Tolling of speedy trial period.  Statutory speedy trial period was tolled beginning February 8, 2008, under the exception in § 19.2-243 that provides for tolling in the event of a continuance requested by defendant, by joint motion, or by the Commonwealth without objection by defendant. Since defendant did not object to the continuances imposed, the continuances tolled the statutory speedy trial period, and this tolling lasted until July 10, 2009, the date on which the circuit court found defendant competent to stand trial, which was three days before trial. Brown v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 381, 702 S.E.2d 582, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 490 (2010). Defendants speedy trial rights were not violated because defendant failed to make an affirmative objection to the trial courts continuation of the case; b ecause defendant failed to lodge an affirmative objection to the continuance, the supreme court would not consider his request to overturn, modify, or reverse the court of appeals decision that absent a showing of bad faith by the Commonwealth, continuan ces requested by a defendant would not be charged to the Commonwealth. Young v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 443, 829 S.E.2d 548, 2019 Va. LEXIS 78 (2019). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Second grand jury indictment following incompetency finding permitted.  When the defendant first indicted by a grand jury for capital murder and robbery was found to be mentally incompetent and confined to a state hospital, the indict ment against the defendant was dismissed; however, the trial court found that a later indictment for the same crimes obtained upon the defendants release from the hospital could not be dismissed on the ground of the passage of time as the defendant a lleged. Commonwealth v. Sink, 61 Va. Cir. 279, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 18 (Portsmouth Mar. 5, 2003). Delay in commencement of trial due to pandemic.  Continuance of defendants criminal trial was necessitated and the time period during which the court was not conducting criminal jury or bench trials due to t he COVID-19 emergency was excludable because the coronavirus pandemic constituted a natural disaster, as it was a communicable disease of public health threat, and the court found that it could not protect the health and safety of the trial participants if it conducted a jury trial in the midst of the judicial emergency and pandemic.

CASE NOTES The simple requirement of the statute is that some indictment shall be found before the end of the second term, or else the accused shall be discharged from imprisonment, although liable to be again arrested and tried upon any indictment that may be subsequently found against him. Waller v. Commonwealth, 84 Va. 492, 5 S.E. 364, 1888 Va. L EXIS 101 (1888). The word term, as used in this statute, ought to be construed to mean, not the s tated time when a court should be held, but the actual session of the court. Ex parte Santee, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 363 (1823); Commonwealth v. Cawood, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 527 (1826); Commonwealth v. Adcock, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 661, 1851 Va. LEXIS 78 (1851); B rown v. Hume, 57 Va. (16 Gratt.) 456, 1864 Va. LEXIS 3 (1864). Second term must be grand jury term.  The second term of the court, spoken of in the statute, is the second term at which a grand jury is directed to be summoned. Jones v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. (19 Gra tt.) 478, 1868 Va. LEXIS 3 (1868). Term at which accused is sent on not counted.  Where during a term of the court accused is sent on for indictment, that term is not considered one of the two terms at which he must be indicted under this secti on. Bell's Case, 48 Va. (7 Gratt.) 646, 1850 Va. LEXIS 49 (1850); Jones v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 478, 1868 Va. LEXIS 3 (1868); Glover v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. 382, 10 S.E. 420, 1889 Va. LEXIS 53 (1889). Special session not counted.  A special session of court held for the trial of offenses is not the third (now second) term within the meaning of the statute, but is a substitute for it, and th erefore, where there was a failure to hold two regular terms, and then a special session was held, at which the prisoner was not tried, but being indicted at the regular term succeeding the special session, he ought not to be discharged from the crime, b ut may be tried. Commonwealth v. Lovett, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 74 (1817). Indictment must be recorded.  Although a prisoner has in fact been arraigned on, and has pleaded to, an indictment not appearing by the record to have been found by the grand jury, and if a th ird actual term has passed without such record of the findings, he is entitled under this section to be discharged from the crime. Commonwealth v. Cawood, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 527 (1826); Commonwealth v. Adcock, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 661, 1851 Va. LEXIS 78 (18 51). Indictment for differe nt offenses sufficient.  A prisoner was arrested for housebreaking with intent to kill and rob. Subsequently he was indicted for burglary and grand larceny, and was held under this indict ment until the grand jury, the third which had met since his arrest, indicted him for a felonious assault. Upon the last indictment he was tried and convicted. The prisoner contended that he was entitled to his discharge because the indictment on which h e was tried was not found until the third term at which a grand jury was impaneled after his arrest. It was held, that the simple requirement of the statute is that some indictment shall be found before the end of the second term, or else the accused sha ll be discharged from imprisonment. Manifestly the present case does not come within the statute, for here the accused was indicted by the first grand jury that met after his arrest, and the Commonwealth has only done what she has a right to do, exercise her election as to the indictment upon which the prisoner should be tried. Waller v. Commonwealth, 84 Va. 492, 5 S.E. 364, 1888 Va. LEXIS 101 (1888). But information for felony insuf ficient.  The filing of the information being unauthorized in the case of a felony, is of no avail, and an indictment must be found within the time prescribed by the statut e. Jones v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 478, 1868 Va. LEXIS 3 (1868). A misdemeanor may be tried on a presentment or information, as well as on an indictment, while a felony can be tried on an indictment only, and the kind of accusa tion must be made within the period limited by the statute, which the nature of the offense requires. The offense in this case being a felony, it was necessary that an indictment should be found against the prisoner before the end of the second term of the court, in which he is held to answer, unless, etc. Jones v. Commonwealth, 60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 478, 1868 Va. LEXIS 3 (1868). A second indictmen t proper when verdict set aside.  Where a second indictment was for the same act of embezzling as the first, under which the prisoner had been indicted, tried and convicted in time and the verdict set aside for variance, the second indictment was proper and in time. The prisoner was not entitled to be discharged. Commonwealth v. Adcock, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 661, 1851 Va. LEXIS 78 (1851). Question must be raised in trial court .  After the indictment is found, the question whether two terms have elapsed since the prisoner has been held to answer, without any indictment against him, should be raised by plea or otherwise. If this is not done, the question cannot be brought before the appellate court. Glover v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. 382, 10 S.E. 420, 1889 Va. LEXIS 53 (1889). Writ of er ror only extends to matters after indictment.  This motion was made before any indictment was found. The point was not raised by plea or otherwise after the indictment was found, and consequently is not brough t up for review by writ of error. The writ extends only to such matters as occurred after the indictment was found. Glover v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. 382, 10 S.E. 420, 1889 Va. LEXIS 53 (1889). Remedy by habeas cor pus before indictment found.  Where before indictment found, there was a motion made and properly overruled to discharge prisoner on the ground that two terms had elapsed since he had been hel d to answer without any indictment against him, the remedy was not by writ of error, but by habeas corpus, which is too late after final judgment. Bell v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 600, 1851 Va. LEXIS 72 (1851); Glover v. Commonwealth, 86 Va. 382, 10 S.E. 420, 1889 Va.

If there was no preliminary hearing in the district court, or if such preliminary hearing was waived by the accused, the commencement of the running of the five and nin e months periods, respectively, set forth in this section, shall be from the date an indictment or presentment is found against the accused. If an indictment or presentment is found against the accused but he has not been arrested for the offense charged therein, the five and nine months periods, respectivel y, shall commence to run from the date of his arrest thereon. Where a case is before a circuit court on appeal from a conviction of a misdemeanor or traffic infraction in a district court, the accused shall be forever discharged f rom prosecution for such offense if the trial de novo in the circuit court is not commenced (i) within five months from the date of the conviction if the accused has been held continuously in custody or (ii) within nine months of the date of the convicti on if the accused has been recognized for his appearance in the circuit court to answer for such offense. The provisions of this section shall not apply to such period of time as the failure to try the accused was caused: 1.

By the witnesses for the Commonwealth being enticed or kept away, or prevented from attending by sickness or accident; 3. By the granting of a separate trial at the request of a person indicted jointly with others for a felony; 4. By continuance granted on the motion of the accused or his counsel, or by concurrence of the accused or his counsel in such a motion by the attorney for the Commonwealth, or by the fai lure of the accused or his counsel to make a timely objection to such a motion by the attorney for the Commonwealth, or by reason of his escaping from jail or failing to appear according to his recognizance; 5.

The lodging of a detainer or its equivalent shall not constitute an arrest under this section. History History.

Section does not require defendant to waive Sixth Amendment rights.  Court of Appeals of Virginia does not read either the text of § 19.2-243 or the holding of the Supreme Court of Virginia to require criminal defendants to effe ctively waive their Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel and to step into the shoes of their attorney to make tactical decisions with legal consequences or otherwise assume the responsibility for conducting their own defense when their attorney is not present to do so.

When f ive-month period commences.  Under § 1-13.3 [see now § 1-210], when a statute or rule of court requires a notice to be given or any other act to be done within a certain time after any event or judgment, that time shall be in addition to the day on which the event or judgment took place; thus here, the five month speedy trial time allowance under this section did not begin to run until the day after defendants probable cause hearin g.

App. LEXIS 437 (1998). Circuit court did not err in denying defendants motion to dismiss the indictment, based upon an alleged speedy trial violation, because the trial commenced wi thin five months from the date from when defendant was indicted by the grand jury. Defendants continued incarceration, therefore, was based on the indictment by the grand jury for possession with intent to sell or distribute, rather than the charge ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-244"><akn:num>§ 19.2-244</akn:num><akn:heading>Venue in general</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

App. Oct. 10, 2017) (decided under former § 17.1-515.2). Defendant made a false report regarding the commission of a crime to law-enforcement officials in Loudoun County. Pursuant to § 19.2-244, Loudoun County was a proper venue in which to prosecute the offense. McGuire v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 736, 813 S.E.2d 552, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 137 (2018). Venue not substantive element of crime and similar to jurisdiction.  Even though venue is an element which the prosecution must prove, it is not a substantive element of the crime and is similar in nature to jurisdiction. Venue is usually determined by the court as a matter of law where the facts established it or not in dispute and where it is established by a preponderance of the evidence. Harris v. Commonwealth, No. 0849-88-2 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 21, 1990) (decided under prior law). The Commonwealth may prove venue by either direct or circumstantial evidence. Davis v. Co mmonwealth, 14 Va. App. 709, 419 S.E.2d 285, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3545, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (1992). Judicial notice of venue.  Reversal of conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and remand for a new trial was appropriate because the record did not clearly reflect that the trial court took judicial notice that the situs of the alleged offense was within the corporate limits of the city where the trial took place, and absent such judicial notice, the evidence was insufficient to prove venue. Williams v. Commonwealth, 2 89 Va. 326, 771 S.E.2d 675, 2015 Va. LEXIS 44 (2015). Burden of proof.  The burden in a criminal case is upon the Commonwealth to prove venue by evidence which is either direct or circumstantial. Pollard v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 723, 261 S.E.2d 328, 1980 Va. LEXIS 159 (1980). Allegations of venue contained solely in an indictment cannot supply proof, since the mere fact that police of a certain jurisdiction investigate a crime cannot s upport an inference that the crime occurred within their jurisdiction. Sutherland v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 378, 368 S.E.2d 295, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2896, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (1988). Standard of proof.  To prove venue, the Commonwealth must produce evidence sufficient to give rise to a strong presumption that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of t he court, and this may be accomplished either by direct or circumstantial evidence. Foster-Zahid v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 430, 477 S.E.2d 759, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 709 (1996), aff'd, 254 Va. 168, 489 S.E.2d 687, 1997 Va. LEXIS 102 (1997). Motion to strike to challenge venue.  The Virginia Supreme Court has impliedly upheld the use of the motion to strike to challenge venue. Sutherland v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 378, 368 S.E.2d 295, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2896, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (1988). When objection must be made.  An objection to venue must be raised before verdict. Day v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 1078, 407 S.E.2d 52, 8 Va. Law Rep. 475, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1991). Right to challenge venue waived.  Defendants motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction on grounds the Commonwealth did not prove where the crimes took place was properly denied because (1) he waived his right to contest venue by not doing so before pleading guilty; and (2) as he pled guilty to aggravated sexual battery, he conceded that the trial court had jurisdiction. Bryant v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 214 (Va. Ct. App. July 23, 2 013). Evidence offered to prove venue must furnish the foundation for a strong presumption that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court. Pollard v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 723, 261 S.E.2d 328, 1980 Va. LEXIS 159 (1980). Ordinarily, a criminal case must be prosecuted in the county or city in which the offense was committed. To prove venue, the Commonwealth must produce evidence s ufficient to give rise to a strong presumption that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court, and this may be accomplished by either direct or circumstantial evidence. Cheng v. Commonwealth, 240 Va. 26, 393 S.E.2d 599, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2538, 1990 Va. LEXIS 98 (1990). The evidence to establish venue in a criminal case must be sufficient to present a strong presumption that the offense was committed within the jurisdicti on of the court. Davis v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 709, 419 S.E.2d 285, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3545, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (1992). Motion sufficient to put court on notice that venue in question.  At the close of the Commonwealths evidence, defendant moved to strike the evidence for failure of the Commonwealth to prove that he did take, steal, and carry away automobile from Chesterfield County. In other words, the Commonwealth failed to establish that the crime occurred in Chesterfield County. While defendant could have stated his venue objection more clearly, the court finds that his objection was suf ficient to put the trial court on notice that venue was in question. Sutherland v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 378, 368 S.E.2d 295, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2896, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (1988). Issue of venue submitted to jury.  The exact physical location of a murdered body within the river constituted a factual question which the jury could appropriately decide. However, the exact locat ion of the boundary between Virginia and Maryland involves an interpretation of § 7.1-7 [now § 1-308] and represents a legal question outside the jurys province. If it were impossible for the jurors to interpret the evidence concerning the body s exact placement so as to conclude under § 7.1-7 [now § 1-308] that the body lay in Virginia, then the trial court should not have submitted the issue of venue to the jury. Traverso v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 172, 366 S.E.2d 719, 4 Va. Law Re p. 2318, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 21 (1988). Evidence held sufficient to prove venue.  Evidence was sufficient to prove venue in Augusta County where investigating officer testified that offending firearms were found on property in Craigsville, and trial court, without objection, took judicial notice that Craigsville was located in Augusta County, expressly rejecting testimony of both defendant and his estranged wife to the contrary. Lawhorn v. Commonwealth, No. 2100-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 26, 1 999). Ordinarily, a criminal case had to be prosecuted in the county or city in which the offense was committed, under this section; despite special venue provision of former subsection A of § 18.2-60.3, there was no error in the refusal to grant defendants motion to strike a stalking charge based upon an allegation of improper venue, as the evidence gave rise to a strong presumption that at least one of the sta lking events occurred within the jurisdiction of the court where defendant was tried. Raja v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 710, 581 S.E.2d 237, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (2003). Defendants two grand larceny and two uttering a forged check convictions were reversed on appeal, as the trial court erred in finding the evidence insufficien t to establish venue, no evidence was presented by the Commonwealth as to the location of the alleged crimes, and the Commonwealth failed to ask the court to take judicial notice of that location. Harris v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 493 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 31, 2006). It was clearly established that the charged larceny was committed in Henrico County under circumstances in which the Commonwealth presented evidence from an emplo yee of the Henrico County store from which inkjet cartridges were allegedly stolen, who verified that inkjet cartridges found among those in a box found in defendants car were those missing from his store; moreover, witnesses identified defendant as the individual shown leaving the store carrying a box similar to the one found in his c...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-245"><akn:num>§ 19.2-245</akn:num><akn:heading>Offenses committed without and made punishable within Commonwealth; embezzlement or larceny committed within Commonwealth; where prosecuted</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Prosecution for offenses committed wholly or in part without and made punishable within this Commonwealth may be in any county or city in which the offender is found or to which he is sent by any judge or court; and if any person shall commit larceny or embezzlement beyond the jurisdiction of this Commonwealth and bring the stolen property into the same he shall be liable to prosecution and punishment for larceny or em bezzlement in any county or city into which he shall have taken the property as if the same had been wholly committed therein; and if any person shall commit larceny or embezzlement within this Commonwealth and take the stolen property into any county or city other than the county or city within which the same was committed he shall be liable to prosecution and punishment for such larceny or embezzlement in any such county or city into which he shall have taken the property as if the same had been wholl y committed therein; provided, that if any person shall commit embezzlement within this Commonwealth he shall be liable as aforesaid or to prosecution and punishment for his offense in the county or city in which he was legally obligated to deliver the e mbezzled funds or property.

Criminal Procedure, §§ 1, 10; 6B M.J. Embezzle ment, § 6; 12A M.J. Larceny, § 11. CASE NOTES History of section.  See Howell v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 34, 46 S.E.2d 37, 1948 Va. LEXIS 197 (1948). The legislature has power to fix the venue of criminal prosecutions in a place other tha n that in which the crime was committed in the absence of a constitutional limitation. Lovelace v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 541, 138 S.E.2d 253, 1964 Va. LEXIS 215 (1964). The constitutionality of this section, so far as it declares the crime of larceny, is clear. It makes statutory the principle that every act of removal or change of possession of stolen property is a new violation of the owners right. Howell v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 34, 46 S.E.2d 37, 1948 Va. LEXIS 197 (1948). The constitutionality of this section insofar as it describes the crime of larceny is clear. Lovelace v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 541, 138 S.E.2d 253, 1964 Va. LEXIS 215 (1964). No double jeopardy violation.  There was no double jeopardy violation in prosecuting defendant for embezzlement from her employers clinic in Tazewell County after she pled guilty to embezzl ement from a different clinic in Russell County owned by the same employer, because, although § 19.2-245 allowed a prosecution wholly in Russell County for the embezzlement occurring in both Tazewell County and Russell County, defendant failed to prov e that the Russell County conviction encompassed same embezzlement for which she was indicted in Tazewell County. Hatfield v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 486 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 4, 2008). Its true meaning is that venue is given in any county in which the defendant may be found to have committed the offense by bringing in the stolen goods, to the same extent as if the crime had been wholly committed in that county. Howell v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 34, 46 S.E.2d 37, 1948 Va. LEXIS 197 (1948); Lovelace v. Commonwealth, 2 05 Va. 541, 138 S.E.2d 253, 1964 Va. LEXIS 215 (1964). In a prosecution for bringing into Virginia property stolen in another state, an accused who, when arrested, was in jail in the county in which he had sold the pr operty, having been brought there from out of the state on a different charge, was found in that county in the sense intended by this section as a prerequisite to the courts jurisdiction. Howell v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 34, 46 S.E.2d 37, 1948 Va. LEXIS 197 (1948). To be applicable, this section requires proof that the accused participated in taking the stolen property into the county where the prosecution is brought. Nelson v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 268, 403 S.E.2d 384, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2130, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 64 (1991). This section clearly has in view more than one place of venue. Howell v. Commonwealth, 18 7 Va. 34, 46 S.E.2d 37, 1948 Va. LEXIS 197 (1948); Lovelace v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 541, 138 S.E.2d 253, 1964 Va. LEXIS 215 (1964). It is not an attempt to enforce the criminal laws of another state, but defines and puni shes an offense committed in this state. Howell v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 34, 46 S.E.2d 37, 1948 Va. LEXIS 197 (1948); Lovelace v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 541, 138 S.E.2d 253, 1964 Va. LEXIS 215 (1964). The crime continues and accompanies the defendant into every county into which he goes w ith stolen property. Lovelace v. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 541, 138 S.E.2d 253, 1964 Va. LEXIS 215 (1964). Fact that part of crime committed in another state does not affect venue.  In a prosecution for subornation of perjury the fact that the suborner and the perjurer discussed some details of the crime in another state does not affect the v enue under this section. Mundy v. Commonwealth, 161 Va. 1049, 171 S.E. 691, 1933 Va. LEXIS 370 (1933). This section gives Virginia jurisdiction over embezzlement offenses, even though most or all of the illegal acts took place in another state. Keselica v. Commonwe alth, 24 Va. App. 115, 480 S.E.2d 756, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 39 (1997). Embezzlement of computer.  The fact that the consignment contract was silent as to where the computer was to be returned did not mean that there was no venue in which the appellant could be prosecuted for embezzlement. Jackson v. Commonwealth, No. 1552-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 31, 1996). Where appellant was legally obligated to return the computer to victim in Powhatan County, the fact that he would have been legally obligated to return the comput er to her wherever she was does not defeat Powhatan County as a proper venue. Furthermore, the consignment contract was executed in Powhatan County. The contract was for a period of sixty days. At the end of sixty days, the appellant had the legal duty to either return the computer to her or pay Williams $850. Accordingly, Powhatan County was a proper venue in which to prosecute the charge. Jackson v. Commonwealth, No. 1552-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 31, 1996). Embezzlement of rented car.  A rental agreement provided that a car was to be returned to the owner in the City of Lynchburg at a specified time. The Corporation Court of the City of Lynchbur g had venue to try defendant on a charge of embezzling the car. Stegall v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 719, 160 S.E.2d 566, 1968 Va. LEXIS 173 (1968). § 19.2-245.01. Offenses involving reports or statements concerning cigarette sales or stamping. Text Any criminal violation of Chapter 42 (§ 3.2-4200 et seq.) of Title 3.2, Article 10 (§ 18.2-246.6 et seq.) of Chapter 6 of Title 18.2, or § 18.2-514 involving r eports or statements concerning cigarette sales or stamping may be prosecuted in the City of Richmond. History History. 2009, c. 847; 2013, c. 625. Annotations The 2013 amendments. The 2013 amendment by c. 625 substituted Article 10 (§ 18.2-246.6 et seq.) of Chapter 6 of Title 18.2, or § 18.2-514 for or of § 18.2-246.13 or 18.2-514. § 19.2-245.1. Forgery; where prosecuted. Text If any person commits forgery, that forgery may be prosecuted in any county or city (i) where the writing was forged, or where the same was used or passed, or attempted to be used or passed, or deposited or placed with another person, firm, association, or corporation either for collection or credit for the account of any person, firm, association, or corporation; (ii) where the writing is found in the possession of th e defendant; or (iii) where an issuer, acquirer, or account holder sustained a financial loss as a result of the offense. History History. 1979, c. 30; 2000, c. 327; 2019, cc. 46, 621. Annotations The 2000 amendments. The 2000 amendment by c. 327 substituted commits for shall commit, inserted the (i) designation, and added or (ii) where the writing is found in the possession of the defendant. The 2019 amendments. The 2019 amendments by cc. 46 and 621 are identical, and added or (iii) where an issuer, acquirer, or account holder sustained a financial loss as a result of the offense to the end, and made related changes. CASE NOTES A forgery prosecution may take place in any county or city where the writing was forged, or where the same was used or passed, or attempted to be used or passed, or deposited or placed with another person, firm, association, or corporation either for collection or credit; the burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove ven ue by evidence which is either direct or circumstantial. Such evidence must furnish the foundation for a strong presumption that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court, which the court did not adequately establish. Lo ng v. Commonwealth, No. 2031-95-4 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 25, 1997) (decided prior to the 2000 amendment, providing for prosecution where the writing is found). Venue found improper.  Prosecution failed to establish requisite venue in Henrico County, where record established only that defendant possessed a forged check in Henrico County after h aving attempted to pass it at an unspecified store. Copeland v. Commonwealth, No. 1851-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals June 29, 1999). Venue was proper in Mecklenburg County, Virginia, for defendants trial for forgery because the fact that the victim filed a civil lawsuit in Mecklenburg, whil e not dispositive, was competent circumstantial evidence to establish venue when taken together with the totality of the evidence in the record; defendant pointed to no authority that prohibited a subsequent trial court from looking to that civil judgmen t in addition to other evidence in the record to establish venue in a related criminal case, and the evidence only had ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-246"><akn:num>§ 19.2-246</akn:num><akn:heading>Injury inflicted by person within Commonwealth upon one outside Commonwealth</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If a mortal wound or other violence or injury be inflicted by a person within this Commonwealth upon one outside of the same, or upon one in this Commonwealth who after wards dies from the effect thereof out of the Commonwealth, the offender shall be amenable to prosecution and punishment for the offense in the courts of the county or city in which he was at the time of the commission thereof as if the same had been com mitted in such county or city.

Commonwealth, 136 Va. 665, 116 S.E. 462, 1923 Va. LEXIS 114 (1923). The effect of this section and § 18.2-27 is merely to give the courts of the counties or corporations, in which the accused and the deceased may have been, respectively, at the time of the commission of the offense, concurrent jurisdiction, so that the offender may be prosecuted and punished in either county, where the offense is not who lly committed within one county. Covington v. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 665, 116 S.E. 462, 1923 Va. LEXIS 114 (1923). There is nothing incongruous or objectionable in the like result being accomplished by two separate statutes, as by this section and § 18.2-27, which is attain ed in the cases of §§ 19.2-248 and 19.2-249 by single statutes.

Court co rrectly refused to instruct jury on venue issue.  Trial court correctly refused to instruct the jury on the issue of venue, where the uncertainty of whether the fatal wound was inflicted in Richmond or Chesterfie ld County was determinative of venue as a matter of law. Harris v. Commonwealth, No. 0849-88-2 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 21, 1990). Ap propriate venue when it is unknown where murder occurred.  Where it was unknown where the murder occurred, but the victims body was found in the City of Richmond within one mile of the Chesterfield County border, beca use the jurisdiction of the authorities of Chesterfield County extended one mile beyond the limits of that county into the City of Richmond, Chesterfield County was an appropriate venue in which to prosecute defendant for the murder.

For 2007 annual survey article, Electronic Data: A Commentary on the Law in Virginia in 2007, see 42 U. Rich. L. Rev. 355 (2007). CASE NOTES Place of arrest.  Where a York County deputy made traffic stop in the City of Williamsburg, defendant was arrested for the DUI charge in Williamsburg, while the record did not refl ect where defendant was arrested on the habitual offender charge, it was clear that she was not arrested for that offense at the stop. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 105 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 15, 2005). Because a campus police officers concurrent jurisdiction under §§ 19.2-249, 19.2-250, and 23-234 extended up to one mile beyond the citys corporate limits, the officer was well within the statutorily prescribed jurisdiction when the officer stopped and arrested defendant for drunk driving 200 yards into the adjoining county. Boatwright v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 169, 647 S.E.2d 515, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 281 (2007). This section was held applicable to information proceedings for the forfeiture of an automobile while being used in the illegal transportation of intoxicating liquors. Commercial Credit Co. v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1033, 155 S.E. 689, 1930 Va. LEXIS 191 (1930). Suppression of evidence.  Assuming that an investigators actions violated §§ 18.2-146 and 19.2-249, that violation did not entitle defendant to suppression of the evidence becaus e the statutes did not provide for the remedy of exclusion. Hill v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 9, 2012), writ denied, 575 U.S. 989, 135 S. Ct. 1906, 191 L. Ed. 2d 773, 2015 U.S. LEXIS 2841 (2015). Venue proper.  Circuit court had venue to try defendants drunk driving cases because, while the offense did not occur within 300 yards of a city or county boundaries, venue was clearly allowed in the city where it was undisputed that the offense occurred within one mile of the city boundary, and venue for a trial for a refusal to submit charge was in the court in which the driving under the influence charge was tried. Bista v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 380 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 15, 2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Search and seizure.  Though officer who detained the defendant and his companions exceeded his statutory authority under § 19.2-249, he did not violate the Fourth Amendment, theref ore the defendant was not entitled to have evidence seized pursuant to the arrest excluded. Commonwealth v. Dawson, 61 Va. Cir. 309, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 35 (Roanoke Mar. 10, 2003). § 19.2-249.1. Offenses committed within towns situated in two or more counties; where prosecuted. Text An offense or traffic infraction committed within a town situated in two or more counties within the Commonwealth may be alleged to have been committed, and may be pros ecuted and punished, in any one of such counties. History History. 1984, c. 278. Annotations CASE NOTES Venue proper.  Circuit court had venue to try defendants drunk driving cases because, while the offense did not occur within 300 yards of a city or county boundaries, venue was clearly allowed in the city where it was undisputed that the offense occurred within one mile of the city boundary, and venue for a trial for a refusal to submit charge was in the court in which the driving under the influence charge was tried. Bista v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 380 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 15, 2015). § 19.2-249.2. Venue for prosecution of computer and other crimes. Text For the purpose of venue, any violation of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act (§ 18.2-152.1 et seq.) or § 18.2-386.1 shall be considered to have been committed in a ny county or city: 1. In wh ich any act was performed in furtherance of any course of conduct that violated any provision listed above; 2. In which the owner has his principal place of business in the Commonwealth; 3. In which any offender had control or possession of any proceeds of the violation or of any books, records, documents, property, financial instrument, computer software, computer progra m, computer data, or other material or objects that were used in furtherance of the violation; 4. From which, to which, or through which any access to a computer or computer network was made whether by wires, electromagnetic waves, microwaves, optics or any other means of communica tion; 5. In which the offender resides; or 6. In which any computer that is an object or an instrument of the violation is located at the time of the alleged offense.

Acts 2005, c. 746, cl. 3, provides: That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment. Pursuant to § 30 -19.1:4, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities and cannot be determined for periods of commitment to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice.  Acts 2005, cc. 761 and 827, cl. 3 provides: That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment. Pursuant to § 30-19.1:4, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation cannot be determined for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities and is $0 for periods of commitment to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice. The 2015 amendments. The 2015 amendment by c. 423 substituted any violation of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act (§ 18.2-152.1 et seq.) or § 18.2-386.1 for under the Virginia Computer Crimes Act (§ 18.2-152.1 et seq.) any violation of the article in the introductory paragraph; substituted any provision listed above for this article in subdivision 1; and made minor stylistic changes. CASE NOTES Establishing venue.  Commonwealth established venue in Virginia Beach under subdivisions 4 and 6 of § 19.2-249.2 during defendants trial for harassment by computer in violation of § 18.2-152.7:1 because the evidence was sufficient to prove a strong presumption that the victim received the e-mails defendant sent her while she resided in Virginia Beach, on a computer located within Virginia Beach; the victim lived in Virginia Beach, and she testified that all the offensive e-mails were sent to her e-mail account in the City of Virginia Beach.

CASE NOTES Purpose of section.  This section does not purport to extend the effect of municipal ordinances beyond the corporate limits of a city. It is a statute of enforcement of the effective law within the area specified. Its purpose is plain, that is, to prevent the territory contiguous to a city from becoming a refuge for criminals, and to confer on the corporation courts of cities power to enforce the police regulations and law of the are a involved. Murray v. City of Roanoke, 192 Va. 321, 64 S.E.2d 804, 1951 Va. LEXIS 178 (1951); Kelley v. County of Brunswick, 200 Va. 45, 104 S.E.2d 7, 1958 Va. LEXIS 157 (1958). This section does not extend the effect of city ordinances beyond city limits; rather, it confers on city police officers the authority to enforce the statutes of the Commonwealth or law of the jurisdiction involved. Hoambrecker v. City of Lynchburg, 13 Va. App. 511, 412 S.E.2d 729, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1918, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 31 (1992). Jurisdiction defined.  The word jurisdiction as used in this section broadly means the power, right, or authority in the courts to hear, determine, and enforce the law in cases, causes or controversies. It is the power to try and declare the law. It is the authority by which judicial officers take cognizance of, and apply and enforce, the law, as distinguished from the power to enact law. Murray v. City of Roanoke, 192 Va. 321, 64 S.E.2d 804, 1951 Va. LEXIS 178 (1951). Section 19.2-54 and this section must be read together and harmonized. Robertson v. Roger s, 2 Va. App. 503, 346 S.E.2d 41, 3 Va. Law Rep. 49, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (1986), aff'd, 360 S.E.2d 715 (Va. 1987). Exclusionary rule did not apply.  Where appellant asserted that LSD was seized from him in a search pursuant to an unlawful arrest because investigator exceeded his jurisdictional authority under this section, that claim of illegality as to the arrest did not involve a claim that federal constitutional protections were violated which would implicate the exclusionary rule. Even if investigator violated this section or exceeded the common-law autho rity of a private citizen in arresting appellant for a misdemeanor, he nonetheless constitutionally detained appellant. The exclusionary rule did not apply. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied the appellants motion to suppress the evidence. Wright v. Commonwealth, No 2528-96-3 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 9, 1997). Filing of affidavits required by § 19.2-54 in the City of Danville, rather than defendants residence of Pittsylvania County, was appropriate where the Circuit Court of the City of Danville, pursuant to this section, had jurisdiction over the crime and the area where the search was made. Robertson v. Rogers, 2 Va. App. 503, 346 S.E .2d 41, 3 Va. Law Rep. 49, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (1986), aff'd, 360 S.E.2d 715 (Va. 1987). Venue proper.  Circuit court had venue to try defendants drunk driving cases because, while the offense did not occur within 300 yards of a city or county boundaries, venue was clearly allowed in the city where it was undisputed that the offense occurred within one mile of the city boundary, and venue for a trial for a refusal to submit charge was in the court in which the driving under the influence charge was tried. Bista v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 380 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 15, 2015). Trial court did not err in finding that venue was proper in Franklin County, Virginia because the evidence was more than sufficient to meet the lesser standard re quired to establish venue in Franklin County since defendant, the heroin she purchased, and her car in which the heroin was stored were all in the County the day of her arrest; because defendant knew the heroin was in her car, the evidence was more than sufficient to prove she constructively possessed heroin in Franklin County. Buck v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (Va. Ct. App. July 2, 2019). Taxation beyond city limits.  This section is unconstitutional insofar as it authorizes the levy by a city of a license tax upon a circus exhibition beyond its corporate limits for the sole pu rpose of raising revenue to defray the general expenses of the city government. Robinson v. City of Norfolk, 108 Va. 14, 60 S.E. 762, 1908 Va. LEXIS 3 (1908); City of Charlottesville v. Marks' Shows, Inc., 179 Va. 321, 18 S.E.2d 890, 1942 Va. LEXIS 225 ( 1942). Gambling ordinance purporting to be effective outside city limits invalid.  The City of Roanoke had no power under this section to enact a gambling ordinance effective outside the city limits. Murray v. City of Roanoke, 192 Va. 321, 64 S. E.2d 804, 1951 Va. LEXIS 178 (1951). A town ordinance prohibiting drunken driving had no effect beyond the corporate limits. Kelley v. County of Brunswick, 200 Va. 45, 104 S.E.2d 7, 1958 Va. LEXIS 157 (1958). Where offense occurred, not where officer was located, is determinative.  A police officer located outside the one-mile jurisdictional limit of a town had the authority to arrest a speeding driver where the officer employed radar to obs erve a violation within that limit. Where the arresting officer was located when he observed the speeding violation was irrelevant; the relevant question was whether the offense occurred within the towns jurisdiction as defined by this section. Breit bach v. Commonwealth, 35 Va. App. 604, 546 S.E.2d 764, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (2001). City police officer had the authority to stop and arrest appellant within one mile of city limits as long as it was for an offense against the Commonwealth or the county in which the arrest was made. Hoambrecker v. City of Lynchburg, 13 Va. App. 511, 412 S.E.2d 729, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1918, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 31 (1992). Although route defendant actually traveled extended more than one mile beyond city, officer had authority to arrest him where location was still physically within one mile of city limits. Hamm v. City of Norton, No. 1607-98-3 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 28, 1999). Status of policeman acting outside one-mile area.  If a policeman acts outside the one-mile area from the city limits, his status is that of any other private citizen. Moore v. Oliver, 347 F. Supp. 1313, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12015 (W.D. Va. 1972), aff'd, 519 F.2d 1399, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 15004 (4th Cir. 1975). Although uniformed police officer was outside of jurisdictional boundary limits set out in subsection A of § 19.2-250, the officer had the same authority to ar rest as did a private citizen and could make an extraterritorial arrest under those circumstances in which a private citizen would be authorized to make an arrest, including when a breach of the peace was committed in the officers or citizens pre sence; defendants dangerous conduct, on a public highway, in and of itself was a breach of the peace under any definition of that concept, and the officer properly detained defendant after observing the dangerous conduct, and defendants convictio n for refusing to submit to a breath test, in violation of § 18.2-268.3, was affirmed. Hudson v. Commonwealth, 266 Va. 371, 585 S.E.2d 583, 2003 Va. LEXIS 84 (2003). Defendant was properly convicted of assault and battery on a police officer under subsection C of § 18.2-57 because while defendant claimed that the officer s public duties were limited to one mile outside the geographic borders of Virginia Beach under § 19.2-250, a law-enforcement mutual aid agreement permitted by § 15.2-1726 gave the officer authority to perform his public duties in Chesapeake ba sed on the immediate threat to public safety presented by defendants erratic driving. Rowe v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 242 (Va. Ct. App. May 20, 2008), aff'd, 277 Va. 495, 675 S.E.2d 161, 2009 Va. LEXIS 59 (2009). Ap propriate venue when it is unknown where murder occurred.  Where it was unknown where the murder occurred, but the victims body was found in the City of Richmond within one mile of the Chesterfield County border, beca use the jurisdiction of the authorities of Chesterfield County extended one mile beyond the limits of that county into the City o...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-251"><akn:num>§ 19.2-251</akn:num><akn:heading>When and how venue may be changed</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A circuit court may, on motion of the accused or of the Commonwealth, for good cause, order the venue for the trial of a criminal case in such court to be changed to so me other circuit court. Such motion when made by the accused may be made in his absence upon a petition signed and sworn to by him. Whenever the mayor of any city, or the sheriff of any county, shall call on the Governor for military force to protect the accused from violence, the judge of the circu it court of the city or county having jurisdiction of the offense shall, upon a petition signed and sworn to by the accused, whether he be present or not, at once order the venue to be changed to the circuit court of a city or county sufficiently remote from the place where the offense was committed to insure the safe and impartial trial of the accused.

Right and Power to Change. II. Grounds for Change. III. Proceedings. I.Right and Power to Change. This section is not in conflict with Va. Const., Art. I, § 8. Newberry v. Commonwealth , 192 Va. 819, 66 S.E.2d 841, 1951 Va. LEXIS 230 (1951). The purpose of a change of venue is to accord litigants, both the Commonwealth and the d efendant, a fair and impartial trial. Newcomer v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 64, 255 S.E.2d 485, 1979 Va. LEXIS 234 (1979). Under this section, the courts have power whenever necessary to allow a change of venue. Wormeley v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 658, 1853 Va. LEXIS 73 (1853); Muscoe v. Commonwealth, 87 Va. 460, 12 S.E. 790, 1891 Va. LEXIS 94 (1891); Bowles v. Commonwealth, 103 Va. 816, 48 S.E. 527, 1904 Va. LEXIS 42 (1904), overruled, Graham v. Common wealth, 127 Va. 808, 103 S.E. 565, 1920 Va. LEXIS 88 (1920). Question of change of venue is within sound judicial discretion of the trial judge. Evan s v. Commonwealth, 161 Va. 992, 170 S.E. 756, 1933 Va. LEXIS 363 (1933); Poindexter v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 314, 237 S.E.2d 139, 1977 Va. LEXIS 194 (1977); Newcomer v.

Ct. 1503, 89 L. Ed. 2d 903, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 1070 (1986). It is only where the record affirmatively shows an abuse of discretion that the trial courts ruling on a motion for a change of venue will be reversed. Poinde xter v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 314, 237 S.E.2d 139, 1977 Va. LEXIS 194 (1977); Newcomer v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 64, 255 S.E.2d 485, 1979 Va. LEXIS 234 (1979); Watkins v.

An application for a change of venue in a criminal case on the ground of local prejudice rendering impossible an impartial trial is a matter addressed to the soun d discretion of the trial court and its ruling on this question will not be reversed on appeal unless the record clearly shows abuse of that discretion. Farrow v. Commonwealth, 197 Va. 353, 89 S.E.2d 312, 1955 Va. LEXIS 229 (1955). Change of venue is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and refusal to grant it will not constitute reversible error unless the record affirmatively sh ows an abuse of discretion. Stockton v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 124, 314 S.E.2d 371, 1984 Va. LEXIS 275, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 873, 105 S. Ct. 229, 83 L. Ed. 2d 158, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 365 (1984). The trial court must be allowed a wide discretion in deciding motions for change of venue. Looney v. Commonwealth, 115 Va. 921, 78 S.E. 625, 1913 Va. LEXIS 85 (1913); Taylor v. Commonwealth, 122 Va. 886, 94 S.E. 795, 1918 Va. LEXIS 144 (1918); Thompson v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 847, 109 S.E. 447, 1921 Va. LEXIS 68 (1921) (see Wormeley v. Commo nwealth, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 658 (1953); Poindexter v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 314, 237 S.E.2d 139 (1977); Newcomer v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 64, 255 S.E.2d 485 (1979)). Liberal construction.  Statutes conferring the right to a change of venue are enacted with the view of according litigants a fair and impartial trial, and being in furtherance of justic e should be liberally construed so as not to defeat the right. Ramsay v. Harrison, 119 Va. 682, 89 S.E. 977, 1916 Va. LEXIS 142 (1916). Questions of venue not raised at the trial stage are waived. Loomis v. Peyton, 323 F. Sup p. 246, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14521 (W.D. Va. 1971). There is a presumption that a defendant can receive a fair trial from the citizens of th e county or city in which the offense occurred. To overcome this presumption, the accused has the burden of clearly showing that there is such a widespread feeling of prejudice on the part of the citizenry as will be reasonably certain to prevent a fair and impartial trial. Stockton v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 124, 314 S.E.2d 371, 1984 Va. LEXIS 275, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 873, 105 S. Ct. 229, 83 L. Ed. 2d 158, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 365 (1984). Trial courts discretion in ruling upon a motion for change of venue will not be disturbed in the absence of a clear showing of abuse. LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 564, 304 S.E.2d 644, 1983 Va. LEXIS 257 (1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1063, 104 S. Ct. 744, 79 L. Ed. 2d 202, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 728 (1984). II.Grounds for Change. Grounds must exist at time of trial.  Conditions which obtain when the trial was had and not those which existed at the time of the homicide are looked to under this section. Thompson v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 847, 109 S.E. 447, 1921 Va. LEXIS 68 (1921); Evans v. Commonwealth, 161 Va. 992, 170 S.E. 756, 1933 Va. LEXIS 363 (1933). On a change of venue motion courts must look to the conditions at the time of the trial, not to the conditions at the time of the crime. Newcomer v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 64, 255 S.E.2d 485, 1979 Va. LEXIS 234 (1979). Mere belief or fears of defendant not sufficient.  The venue will not be changed for the mere belief of the party or his witnesses that he cannot have a fair trial in the county.

Commonwealth, 114 Va. 872, 77 S.E. 503, 1913 Va. LEXIS 150 (1913). Sheer volume of publicity is not alone sufficient to justify a change of venue. LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 564, 304 S.E.2d 644, 1983 Va. LEXIS 257 (1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1063, 104 S. Ct. 744, 79 L. Ed. 2d 202, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 728 (1984). Showing of either extensive publicity or widespread knowledge of the crime or the accuse d is insufficient by itself to justify a change of venue. Stockton v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 124, 314 S.E.2d 371, 1984 Va. LEXIS 275, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 873, 105 S. Ct. 229, 83 L. Ed. 2d 158, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 365 (1984). Fair trial.  Under this section a change of venue should be ordered when necessary to secure a fair trial. Evans v. Commonwealth, 161 Va. 992, 170 S.E. 756, 1933 Va. LEXIS 363 (1933). Miscarriage of justice.  A criminal case ought not to be sent elsewhere for trial, unless it is made to appear to the court in which the case is pending that a trial in the vicinage is li kely to result in a miscarriage of justice. Muscoe v. Commonwealth, 87 Va. 460, 12 S.E. 790, 1891 Va. LEXIS 94 (1891). Local prejudice of such a character as to prevent a fair and impartial trial in the coun ty or district where the action is brought is a well recognized ground for a change of venue. Uzzle v. Commonwealth, 107 Va. 919, 60 S.E. 52, 1908 Va. LEXIS 154 (1908); Burton v. Commonwealth, 107 Va. 931, 60 S.E. 55, 1908 Va. LEXIS 155 (1908); Jones v. Commonwealth, 111 Va. 862, 69 S.E. 953, 1911 Va. LEXIS 40 (1911); Ramsay v. Harrison, 119 Va. 682, 89 S.E. 977, 1916 Va. LEXIS 142 (1916). Race prejudice.  It was good cause for change of venue under this section that it appeared that the white people of the county were so greatly aroused against the accused, who was a black man, that it was probable that he might not obtain a fair trial. Uzzle v. Commonwealth, 107 Va. 919, 60 S.E. 52, 1908 Va. LEXIS 154 (1908); Burton v. Commonwealth, 107 Va. 931, 60 S.E. 55, 1908 Va. LEXIS 155 (1908). Prejudice not shown by brevity of jurys deliberations.  Defendants contention that prejudice on the part of the jury was proved by the fact they deliberated only a relatively short time was without merit. Rees v. C ommonwealth, 203 Va. 850, 127 S.E.2d 406, 1962 Va. LEXIS 228 (1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 964, 83 S. Ct. 1088, 10 L. Ed. 2d 128, 1963 U.S. LEXIS 1830 (1963). Pretrial publicity did not result in prejudice.  Pretrial publicity involving a single newspaper article, which was not read by any member of defendants jury, was not enough to overcome the presumption that defendant would receive a fair trial in the jurisdiction where the offense occurred and, therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendants motion for a change of venue.

It shall consist of reading to the accused the charge on which he will be tried and calling on him to plead thereto. In a felony case, arraignment is not necessary when waived by the accused. In a misdemeanor case, arraignment is not necessary when waived by the accused or his counsel, or when the accused fails to appear. An accused may plead not guilty, guilty or nolo contendere. The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty to any lesser offense included in the charge upon which the accused is arraigned; but, in misdemeanor and felony cases the court shall not refuse to accept a plea of nolo contendere. With the approval of the court and the consent of the Commonwealth, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of guilty in a misdemeanor or felony case in circuit court, reserving the right, on appeal from the judgment, to a review of the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion. If the defendant prevails on appeal, he shall be allowed to withdraw his plea. Upon rejecting a plea agreement in any criminal matter, a judge shall immediately recuse himself from any further proceedings on the same matter unless the parties agre e otherwise.

For article, A Comparative Look At Plea Bargaining In Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, and the United States, see 57 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 1147 (2016 ). CASE NOTES Rejection of guilty plea.  Under the Virginia Constitution, the statutes and the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, a trial court may reject a guilty plea to the whole of an indictment tendered without a plea agreement only when it determines that the plea is constitutionally invalid; further, this determination extends only to ensuring that a guilty plea is made voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly. Graham v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 133, 397 S.E.2d 270, 7 Va. Law Rep. 551, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (1990). Plea of nolo contendere.  See Jefferson v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. App. 477, 500 S.E.2d 219, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (1998). When an accused enters a voluntary and intelligent plea of nolo contendere to an offense, he waives all defenses except those jurisdictional. Therefore, by enteri ng a plea of nolo contendere to a conspiracy charge, appellant foreclosed the opportunity to appeal the trial courts denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss. Clauson v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 282, 511 S.E.2d 449, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (1999). By pleading nolo contendere, defendant, in essence, admitted as true each factual allegation set forth in the indictment, including the fact that the offense occu rred in the Commonwealth. Jones v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 142, 590 S.E.2d 572, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 2 (2004). Arraignment waived.  Trial court did not err in convicting defendant of attempted murder because defendant was fully aware of the attempted murder charge and was in no way prejudiced by the omission of a formal arraignment, defendants continued silence in the face of repeated references to the attempted murder charge was tantamount to a waiver of his right to be arraigned and to enter a not guilty plea, and having failed to raise any objection, defendant waived any defect; neither § 19.2-254 nor § 19.2-259 expressly provides that formal arraignment and entry of a plea are jurisdictional requirements, but, to the contrary, § 19.2-254 expressly provides that a defendant c an waive arraignment. Simmons v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 594, 681 S.E.2d 56, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 367 (2009). Issues on appeal limited to those specifically reserved.  Defendant waived his right to challenge on appeal the legality of a traffic checkpoint where he entered into a conditional plea agreement that specifically preser ved only the pretrial motions and argument made on a certain date, and where defendant raised no issue of the validity of the checkpoint in those motions or on that date. Wilkins v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 211 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2001). Because defendants only contention during the pre-trial motion to suppress was that the police officer impermissibly stopped him, this statute limits an appea l from a conditional guilty plea to only those issues arising out of the trial courts denial of defendants motion to suppress, and defendant conceded that he never raised the issue of the delayed entry of the order recording the presentation of t he indictment in open court at his pre-trial suppression hearing, this statute precluded review of the issue on appeal unless the issue was jurisdictional, which it was not. Davis v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (Va. Ct. App. May 3, 2016). Because defendant failed in his plea agreement to reserve the right to appeal the issue, the appellate court had no statutory authority to review defendants a ssignment of error regarding whether the circuit court erred in declining to appoint him a fifth attorney. Brown v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 58, 802 S.E.2d 197, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 184 (2017). Withdrawal permitted aft er prevail on appeal.  On appeal, the holding that defendant had not been in custody was reversed and therefore he had been entitled to Miranda warnings before police asked him about a weapon. Even if the Commonwealth was correct about the inevitable discovery of the weapon or the application of the public safety exception, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to § 19.2-254 that allowed him to withdraw his plea if he prevailed on appeal. Hasan v. Commonwealth, 276 Va. 674, 667 S.E.2d 568, 2008 Va. LEXIS 120 (2008). Because defendant entered a conditional guilty plea pursuant to § 19.2-254 and prevailed on appeal regarding the suppression of the evidence at issue, § 19. 2-254 mandated that the case be remanded to permit the possible withdrawal of the plea. Baker v. Commonwealth, 57 Va. App. 181, 700 S.E.2d 160, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 404 (2010). Although the circumstances might have provided the officer with a hunch that defendant might have been carrying a concealed weapon, they alone did not establish t he reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a seizure in order to conduct a pat-down search; defendants nervous behavior, distracted responses, and disregard for the officers instructions, without additional factors, did not support a reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed a weapon, the seizure and pat down violated defendants Fourth Amendment rights, and in light of his conditional guilty plea, the case was remanded to give him a chance to withdraw his plea. Minter v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 391 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 2, 2014). Waiver by entering Alford plea.  Defendant by knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entering Alford pleas waived his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress a statement he made t o police before he was Mirandized. Zimmer v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 695 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2001). Alford plea.  Trial court did not err in finding that defendant violated his probation by refusing to admit that he committed the charged crime during court-ordered sex offende r treatment because his Alford plea did not contain an implicit promise that he would never be required to admit his guilt; a defendant who enters an Alford plea is not an innocent person for the purposes of criminal sentencing and probation, and to miti gate the possibility that an innocent person would so plead, a factual basis is required supporting the finding of guilt before an Alford plea could be accepted. Carroll v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 730, 682 S.E.2d 92, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 392 (2009), aff 'd, 280 Va. 641, 701 S.E.2d 414, 2010 Va. LEXIS 277 (2010). Entry of a knowing and voluntary, but non-conditional plea waived appeal f rom denial of motion to suppress.  Because defendant did not enter a conditional guilty plea to a charge of possession of Oxycodone, in violation of § 18.2-250, but he entered said plea voluntar ily and intelligently, he waived his right to appeal from the judgment denying his motion to suppress the evidence seized against him. Hill v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 667, 626 S.E.2d 459, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 63 (2006). Lack of consent by Commonwealth.  Defendants appeal based on his conditional guilty plea to a drug charge that reserved a challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress was properly dismiss ed because the mandatory language of § 19.2-254 required the Commonwealths consent to a conditional plea, which it did not give. Witcher v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 273, 623 S.E.2d 432, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 526 (2005). Conditional plea to misdemeanor vacated.  Although § 19.2-254 did not permit defendant to enter a conditional plea to a misdemeanor, defendants guilty plea for obstruction of justice was vacated be cause it was not entered knowingly and intelligently; defendant informed the court that defendant wished to preserve right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress and entered a guilty plea on understanding that an appeal was allowed. Cross v. Comm onwealth, 49 Va. App. 484, 642 S.E.2d 763, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 137 (2007), reaff'd in part, op. withdrawn, vacated, 665 S.E.2d 861, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 581 (Va. Ct. App. 2008). Conditional plea to misdem eanor not allowed.  Misdemeanor conviction could not have been appealed because the statute allowing for conditional guilty pleas for felonies did not extend to misdemeanor convictio ns.

History History. Code 1950, § 19.1-244; 1960, c. 366; 1975, c. 495. Annotations CASE NOTES The doctrine of approvement was never the law of this state. Oliver v. Commonweal th, 77 Va. 590, 1883 Va. LEXIS 95 (1883). An approver is one who being indicted for treason, or felony, and arraigned, confesses t he fact before he pleads, and accuses others, his accomplices, in order to obtain his pardon. His approvement is equivalent to an indictment, and if he supports it in all respects, and the person accused by him is found guilty, the approver is entitled t o his pardon, but if he is acquitted, the approver receives judgment to be hanged, upon his own confession of the indictment. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 490 (1826). The admissibility of an accomplice does not depend on the ancient, and exploded doctrine of approvement. Byrd v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. (2 Va.

Code 1950, § 19.1-192; 1960, c. 366; 1975, c. 495. Annotations Cross references. As to right of defendant in criminal prosecution to plead several matters of law or fact, see § 19.2-255. For constitutional provision as to trial without jury in felony cases, see Va. Const., Art. I, § 8. Law Review. For survey of Virginia criminal law and procedure for the year 1970-1971, see 57 Va. L. Rev. 1438 (1971). For note, Criminal Procedure and Criminal Law: Virginia Supreme Court Decisions During the 70s, see 15 U. Rich. L. Rev. 585 (1981). CASE NOTES The language of this section is both expansive and mandatory. Knight v. Johnson, 529 F. S upp. 1309, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10401 (E.D. Va. 1982), rev'd, 699 F.2d 162, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 31208 (4th Cir. 1983). Consent required before defendant can waive right to jury trial not unconstitutional.  There is no violation of any constitutional right of a defendant in requiring consent of the prosecution and the court in order for the defendant to waive his rig ht to a jury trial. Vines v. Muncy, 553 F.2d 342, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 14103 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 851, 98 S. Ct. 163, 54 L. Ed. 2d 120, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 3161 (1977). A jury may be waived only with the consent of the defendant, the Commonwealth, and the court. The statutory requirement of consent by the Commonwealth and by the court does not violate any constitutional right of the defendant. Pope v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 114, 360 S.E.2d 352, 4 Va. Law Rep. 502, 1987 Va. LEXIS 253 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1015, 108 S. Ct. 1489, 99 L. Ed. 2d 716, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 1759 (1988 ). The Virginia Constitution and statutes are silent as to whether an accused will be permitted to withdraw a waiver of a trial by jury once that waiver has been exercised; and, if so, when such withdrawal of the waiver must be exercised. Thomas v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 553, 238 S.E.2d 834, 1977 Va. LEXIS 291 (1977). A defendant has no right to a jury trial if he pleads guilty in person, voluntarily, and after having been advised by counsel. Hancock v. Slayton, 341 F. Supp. 436, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14012 (W.D. Va. 1972). Necessity for renewal of waiver moti on.  The defendant argued on appeal that since the case had to be recessed that the trial judge should have reconsidered the motion to withdraw the waiver of a jury tr ial because the reasons for denying the motion no longer existed. However, the defendant did not renew his motion to withdraw the waiver of a jury trial and did not request the trial judge to reconsider his ruling in any manner. Therefore, the trial judg e had no opportunity to rule upon the question the defendant presented on appeal. Weis v. Commonwealth, No. 1986-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 7, 1997). Where guilty plea to whole of an indictment, error to submit issues to jury.  Where a guilty plea to the whole of an indictment has been tendered, it is reversible error for a trial court to submit the degree of guilt or the question of pun ishment to the jury. Graham v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 133, 397 S.E.2d 270, 7 Va. Law Rep. 551, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (1990). The requirement that a plea of guilty be entered in person is statutory. Gross v. Smyth, 182 Va. 724, 30 S.E.2d 570, 1944 Va. LEXIS 226 (1944). And may be waived.  The requirement that a plea of guilty be made in person, being only statutory, may be waived. Cottrell v. Commonwealth, 187 Va. 351, 46 S.E.2d 413, 1948 Va. LEXIS 227 (1948). De nial of right to withdraw waiver held abuse of discretion.  A motion to withdraw a waiver of a jury trial made 11 days before the defendants cases were set for trial was seasonably made, and the trial judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant the right to withdraw his waiver where the motion was not for the purpose of delay and granting the motion would not have resulted in an unreasonable delay of the trial thereby impeding the cause of justice. Thomas v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 553, 238 S.E.2d 834, 1977 Va. LEXIS 291 (1977). Jury trial cannot be waived unless the accused is represented by counsel. Mitchell v. You ell, 130 F.2d 880, 1942 U.S. App. LEXIS 3229 (4th Cir. 1942). But this requirement is like wise statutory.  The requirement of advice of counsel prior to waiver of a jury creates only a statutory right involving trial procedure, a violation of which would be subject onl y to direct attack and not by a collateral attack in a habeas corpus proceeding. Thornhill v. Smyth, 185 Va. 986, 41 S.E.2d 11, 1947 Va. LEXIS 236 (1947). Guilty plea tendered in mid-trial irrelevant to right to enter plea.  The fact that a plea is tendered mid-trial is irrelevant to the analysis regarding a defendants right to enter a plea of guilty; no limitations either under t he Virginia Constitution, statutes or Rules of Court exist which provide a time by which a defendant must enter his plea of guilty. Graham v. Commonwealth, 11 Va. App. 133, 397 S.E.2d 270, 7 Va. Law Rep. 551, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 171 (1990). Valid plea of guilty which is accepted by the trial court is equivalent to a conviction of the offense to which it is directed. The effect is to authorize imposition of the sentence prescribed by law for that offense. Knight v. Johnson, 529 F. Supp. 1309, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10401 (E.D. Va. 1982), rev'd, 699 F.2d 162, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 31208 (4th Cir. 1983). Effect of plea.  A plea of guilty waives all but jurisdictional objections and the objection that no offense is charged. Hancock v. Slayton, 341 F. Supp. 436, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXI S 14012 (W.D. Va. 1972). If a plea of guilty is made, the prosecution is entirely relieved of the burden of proving any facts. Hancock v. Slayton, 341 F. Supp. 436, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14012 (W.D. Va. 1972). A guilty plea constitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdictional defenses. Knight v. Johnson, 529 F. Supp. 1309, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10401 (E.D. Va. 1982), rev'd, 69 9 F.2d 162, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 31208 (4th Cir. 1983). Judge may hear evide nce in accepting guilty plea.  In accepting a plea of guilty, any trial judge is free to hear the evidence he deems necessary to an understanding of the case and to the fixing of an appropriate sentence. Kibert v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 660, 222 S.E.2d 790, 1976 Va. LEXIS 182 (1976). This does not mean that evidence must be heard upon a plea of guilty. Kibert v. Commonwea lth, 216 Va. 660, 222 S.E.2d 790, 1976 Va. LEXIS 182 (1976). Not only is proof unnecessary to fix the degree of the crime upon a plea of guilty in a murder case, but the introduction of evidence to sustain a conviction upon a guilty plea is equally unnecessary in any criminal case. Kibert v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 660, 222 S.E.2d 790, 1976 Va. LEXIS 182 (1976). Appeal.  Since a plea of guilty is itself a conviction by the defendants own hand, it would seem senseless for a defendant to also want to claim the right to appeal hi s conviction, unless perhaps the guilty plea was coerced. Hancock v. Slayton, 341 F. Supp. 436, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14012 (W.D. Va. 1972). A plea of guilty affords a defendant the right to appeal jurisdictional defects or questions concerning the length of his sentence only. Hancock v. Slayton, 341 F . Supp. 436, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14012 (W.D. Va. 1972). Trial order recited that both the Commonwealths attorney and the trial court concurred in defendants jury trial waiver and a bench trial; this recitation satisfied the requirements of Va. Const., Art. 1, § 8, and of § 19.2-257 regarding waiver of a jury trial. Defendant made no objection to the trial court that the trial order did not accurately reflect the proceedings at his trial; thus, defendant s assertion that the order was inaccurate was waived and would not be considered on appeal. Lindsey v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 433 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 3, 2006). Upon a plea of guilty in a felony case the court is required to try the case. Sentence c annot be imposed upon the plea alone. McGrady v. Cunningham, 296 F.2d 600, 1961 U.S. App. LEXIS 3219 (4th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 855, 82 S. Ct. 944, 8 L. Ed. 2d 14, 1962 U.S. LEXIS 1482 (1962). Voluntary guilty plea stands unless induced by threats, misrepresentation or improper promises.  A plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own counsel, must stand unless induced by threats (or promises to discontinue improper harassment), misrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unfulfillable promises), or perhaps by promises that are by their nature improper as having no proper relatio nship to the prosecutors business (e.g., bribes). Brown v. Peyton, 435 F.2d 1352, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 5756 (4th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 931, 92 S. Ct. 1785, 32 L. Ed. 2d 133, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 2776 (1972). Review o f promises which might have induced guilty plea.  The United States Supreme Courts decision in Brady v. United States , 397 U.S. 742, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1970), provides the standard by which reviewing courts may now measure any promises which might have induced the defendants guilty plea. Simply because the promise made by the judge induced the defendant to plead guilty does not make that plea involuntary. The promise must be of the prohibited type to affect the voluntariness of the ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-258"><akn:num>§ 19.2-258</akn:num><akn:heading>Trial of misdemeanors by court without jury; failure to appear deemed waiver of jury</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In all cases of a misdemeanor upon a plea of guilty, tendered in person by the accused or his counsel, the court shall hear and determine the case without the intervent ion of a jury.

In e ach instance the court shall have and exercise all the powers and duties vested in juries by any statute relating to crimes and punishments. When a person charged with a misdemeanor has been admitted to bail or released upon his own recognizance for his appearance before a court of record having jurisdiction of the case, for a hearing thereon and fails to appear in accordance with the condition of his bail or recognizance, he shall be deemed to have waived trial by a jury and the case may be heard in his absence as upon a plea of not guilty. History History. Code 1950, § 19.1-193; 1960, c. 366; 1975, c. 495. Annotations Cross references. For constitutional provisions as to trial by jury, see Va. Const., Art. I, § 8. CASE NOTES Failure to appear.  Defendants failure to appear for trial in circuit court constituted a waiver of his right to trial by jury. Prezechowski v. Commonwealth, No. 0945-98-3 (Ct. o f Appeals June 1, 1999). The failure to include in the record the defendants consent to waive his right to be tried by a jury or the concurrence by the attorney for the Commonwealth and the court required that the conviction be set aside. Wright v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 303, 357 S.E.2d 547, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2847, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 182 (1987). Word waiver need not be used.  Continuance order stated that upon motion, the matter was to be heard by the court, and it could be discerned that defendant, the attorney for the Commonwealth, a nd the trial court waived a jury trial; the waiver does not need to appear in conviction or sentencing orders, and there is nothing that mandates that the word waiver must be intoned, as long as the elements of waiver are met, and while the order did not expressly state waiver, it was a waiver that occurred with the concurrence of the Commonwealth Attorney and the court, and the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction. Karika v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 1, 2016). The Virginia Constitution and statutes are silent as to whether an accused will be permitted to withdraw a waiver of a trial by jury once that waiver has been exercised; and if so, when such withdrawal of the waiver must be exercised. Thomas v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 553, 238 S.E.2d 834, 1977 Va. LEXIS 291 (1977). Necessity for renewal of waiver moti on.  The defendant argued on appeal that since the case had to be recessed that the trial judge should have reconsidered the motion to withdraw the waiver of a jury tr ial because the reasons for denying the motion no longer existed. However, the defendant did not renew his motion to withdraw the waiver of a jury trial and did not request the trial judge to reconsider his ruling in any manner. Therefore, the trial judg e had no opportunity to rule upon the question the defendant presented on appeal. Weis v. Commonwealth, No. 1986-95-2 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 7, 1997). De nial of right to withdraw waiver held abuse of discretion.  A motion to withdraw a waiver of a jury trial made 11 days before the defendants case was set for trial was seasonably made, and the trial judge abused his di scretion in denying the defendant the right to withdraw his waiver where the motion was not for the purpose of delay and granting the motion would not have resulted in an unreasonable delay of the trial thereby impeding the cause of justice. Thomas v. Co mmonwealth, 218 Va. 553, 238 S.E.2d 834, 1977 Va. LEXIS 291 (1977). § 19.2-258.1. Trial of traffic infractions; measure of proof; failure to appear. Text For any traffic infraction cases tried in a district court, the court shall hear and determine the case without the intervention of a jury. For any traffic infraction c ase appealed to a circuit court, the defendant shall have the right to trial by jury. The defendant shall be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. When a person charged with a traffic infraction fails to enter a written or court appearance, he shall be deemed to have waived court hearing and the case may be heard in his absence, after which he shall be notified of the courts finding; however, the court shall not issue a warrant for his failure to appear pursuant to § 46.2-938.

In 2020, identical cc. 1227 and 1246 purported to amend this section, effective January 1, 2021, by substituting driving privileges for drivers li cense in the last sentence of the last paragraph. However, the earlier amendments by cc. 964 and 965 rendered that language obsolete. The 2001 amendments. The 2001 amendment by c. 414 deleted within ten days of the date of the notice following fails to comply in the second paragraph. The 2020 amendments. The 2020 amendments by cc. 964 and 965 are identical, and substituted finding; however, the court for finding.

Presence of Accused. A. In General. B. Waiver. C. When Essential. D. When Not Essential. E. Must Be Shown by Record. II. Pleading. I.Presence of Accused. A.In General. Source of right.  A defendants right to be present at trial arises from two sources, the Sixth Amendment and this section. Hunter v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 187, 409 S.E.2d 4 83, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1085, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 260 (1991). An accuseds right to be present at trial arises from both the sixth amendment and this section. Cruz v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 454, 482 S.E.2d 880, 1997 Va . App. LEXIS 179 (1997). Presence required when interests of prisoner affected.  It has been uniformly held that, in a trial for felony, it is absolutely necessary to a valid conviction that the prisoner shall be present in court whenever anyt hing is done in his case in any way affecting his interest. Thus, it is the well-established practice that a prisoner accused of felony must be arraigned in person, and must plead in person; and, in all the subsequent proceedings, he must appear in perso n, not by attorney; and such appearance in person must be shown by the record. Boswell v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 860, 1871 Va. LEXIS 35 (1871); Lawrence v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 845, 1878 Va. LEXIS 101 (1878), overruled, Jones v. Com monwealth, 87 Va. 63, 12 S.E. 226, 1890 Va. LEXIS 90 (1890); Longley v. Commonwealth, 99 Va. 807, 37 S.E. 339, 1900 Va. LEXIS 123 (1900); Gilligan v. Commonwealth, 99 Va. 816, 37 S.E. 962, 1901 Va. LEXIS 114 (1901); O'Boyle v. Commonwealth, 100 Va. 785, 40 S.E. 121, 1901 Va. LEXIS 8 (1901); Bowles v. Commonwealth, 103 Va. 816, 48 S.E. 527, 1904 Va. LEXIS 42 (1904), overruled, Graham v. Commonwealth, 127 Va. 808, 103 S.E. 565, 1920 Va. LEXIS 88 (1920). The rule is that the accused must be present on his arraignment when any evidence is given or excluded, when the jury is charged, when the trial court wishes to c ommunicate with the jury in answering questions by them, and when the jury receives further instructions. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 411, 184 S.E.2d 818, 1971 Va. LEXIS 361 (1971). Where the court without consulting or notifying either the Commonwealth or the defendant, responded to jury questions apparently through the bailiff, and the jury subsequently reached a guilty verdict without pursuing either request further, the trial court clearly erred in communicating with the jury in the defendants absence and his conviction was reversed. Swilling v. Commonwealth, No. 1214-86-1 (Ct. of Ap peals June 7, 1988). The right of one charged with felony to be personally present throughout his trial was a basic principle of the common law, and the first sentence of this section is but a legislative declaration of that principle. Williams v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 583, 50 S.E.2d 407, 1948 Va. LEXIS 192 (1948). This section is merely declaratory of the common-law principle. Near v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 929, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6537 (4th Cir. 1963) (commented on in 21 Wa sh. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 346 (1964)). The common-law doctrine relating to the right of a person indicted for a felony to be present during his trial has been enacted into this section. Root v. Cunning ham, 344 F.2d 1, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6116 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 866, 86 S. Ct. 135, 15 L. Ed. 2d 104, 1965 U.S. LEXIS 907 (1965). But see, United States v. Rhodes, 32 F.3d 867, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 21982 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U .S. 1164, 115 S. Ct. 1130, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1092, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 1239 (1995). This section requiring the presence of the accused at every stage of his trial is merely declaratory of a common-law right, and his absence at any critical stage is a violation of his constitutional right. Timmons v. Peyton, 360 F.2d 327, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6336 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 960, 87 S. Ct. 396, 17 L. Ed. 2d 305, 1966 U.S. LEXIS 209 (1966). The provision that a person tried for felony shall be personally present during the trial is declaratory of a principle of the common law, and is an essen tial part of the process of law provided for the trial of persons charged with a felony. Conformity to the rule is essential to jurisdiction and the accused cannot waive it. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 411, 184 S.E.2d 818, 1971 Va. LEXIS 361 (1971). This provision is merely declaratory of a principle of the common law; it is an essential part of the process of law without which the courts have no jurisdiction to pronounce judgment; and it is a right which the accused cannot waive. Bilokur v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 467, 270 S.E.2d 747, 1980 Va. LEXIS 266 (1980). The accused has an inalienable right to be present throughout his trial. Root v. Cunningh am, 344 F.2d 1, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6116 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 866, 86 S. Ct. 135, 15 L. Ed. 2d 104, 1965 U.S. LEXIS 907 (1965). But see, United States v. Rhodes, 32 F.3d 867, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 21982 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1164, 115 S. Ct. 1130, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1092, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 1239 (1995). And such right is to be carefully guarded. Root v. Cunningham, 344 F.2d 1, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6116 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 866, 86 S. Ct. 135, 15 L. Ed. 2d 104, 1965 U.S. LEXIS 907 (1965). But see, United States v. Rhodes, 32 F.3d 867, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 21982 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1164, 115 S. Ct. 1130, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1092, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 1239 (1995). But it must not be so enlarged as to exceed its true scope and purpose. Root v. Cunningha m, 344 F.2d 1, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6116 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 866, 86 S. Ct. 135, 15 L. Ed. 2d 104, 1965 U.S. LEXIS 907 (1965). But see, United States v. Rhodes, 32 F.3d 867, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 21982 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S . 1164, 115 S. Ct. 1130, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1092, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 1239 (1995). The statutory phrase during the trial has been defined as every stage of the trial from the accuseds arraignment to his sentence, when anything is to be done which can affect his interest. Bilokur v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 467, 270 S.E.2d 747, 1980 Va. LEXIS 266 (1980); Jones v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 425, 317 S.E.2d 482, 1984 Va. LEXIS 210 (1984). A person tried for a felony has the right to be personally present during the trial. This right has been read very broadly. The Supreme Court has defined the ph rase during the trial to mean every stage of the trial from [the accuseds] arraignment to his sentence, when anything is to be done which can affect his interest. Brittingham v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 530, 394 S.E.2d 336, 7 Va. Law Rep. 32, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 125 (1990). The in camera hearing was a stage of the trial where something could be done to affect t he defendants interests, therefore, the defendant was entitled to have a court reporter present. The in camera hearing was not merely to determine a legal question. Testimony was heard to determine whether appellant was promised immunity from prosec ution. Defense counsel was given the right to cross-examine the witness. The witness was taken to the judges chambers for the purpose of asking him substantive evidentiary questions. Brittingham v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 530, 394 S.E.2d 336, 7 Va . Law Rep. 32, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 125 (1990). The rule is well established that a person on trial for a felony cannot appear by attorney. Lawrence v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 845, 1878 Va. LEXIS 101 (1878), overruled, Jones v. Commonwealth, 87 Va. 63, 12 S.E. 226, 1890 Va. LEXIS 90 (1890); Bond v. Commonwealth, 83 Va. 581, 3 S.E. 149, 1887 Va. LEXIS 101 (1887); Shelton v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 450, 16 S.E. 355, 1892 Va. LEXIS 121 (1892); Snodgrass v. Commonwealth, 89 Va. 679, 17 S.E. 238, 1893 Va. LEXIS 87 (1893); Coleman v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 635, 19 S.E. 161, 1894 Va. LEXIS 33 (1894). The test for determining whether this section has been violated is whether or not the in terest of the defendant has been affected by the action of the judge in defendants absence. Rogers v. Commonwealth, 183 Va. 190, 31 S.E.2d 576, 1944 Va. LEXIS 143 (1944); Thomas v. Commonwealth, 183 Va. 501, 32 S.E.2d 711, 1945 Va. LEXIS 196 (1945); Carpenter v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 851, 71 S.E.2d 377, 1952 Va. LEXIS 196 (1952). No violation found.  Where the trial court took the issue of its power to vacate a previously suspended sentence under advisement and, after ruling by letter opinion, held a further h earing where the decision was announced and final judgment was pronounced in defendants presence, the trial court did not sentence defendant in his absence. Murphy v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 216 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 9, 2002). Insufficient evidence of prejudice caused by continuance.  Where defendant fails to appear at trial and defense counsel requests a continuance, the Commonwealth cannot establish prejudice which the continuance causes only by showing that witnesses may be lost or not available for a second trial. Cruz v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 113, 474 S.E.2d 835, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 582 (1996).

History History. 1975, c. 495; 1977, c. 624. Annotations CASE NOTES Prejudice not shown by mere fact that defendant was black and victim and jurors were white.  The allegation that defendants sentence of death was racially motivated because he was black but the victim and all the jurors were white was insufficient to establish systematic exclusion of blacks from membership on juries, where he did not challenge the racial composition of the jury at trial, and nothing in the record suggests that his sentence resulted from racial prejudice. Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 331 S.E.2d 422, 1985 Va. LEXIS 224 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1099, 106 S. Ct. 1503, 89 L. Ed. 2d 903, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 1070 (1986). Denial of motion to withdraw waiver of jury trial was improper.  Denial of defendants motion to withdraw his waiver of his right to a jury trial was improper because the record failed to show that the motion was made solely for the purpose of delay or whether defendants request for a jury trial could have been accommodated at the time it was made. The record also failed to disclose the number of witnesses that would have been inconvenienced by the continuance, or the d ifficulty that rescheduling the trial would present to those witnesses. Cokes v. Commonwealth, 280 Va. 92, 694 S.E.2d 582, 2010 Va. LEXIS 60 (2010). Voir dire permitted regarding gangs.  Defendants convictions for second-degree murder, use of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon were pro per because at least some of defendants proffered gang evidence was erroneously excluded and that evidence was to be admissible on retrial. The evidence of the victims friend and the victims gang membership was going to be squarely before the jury and on remand, defendant was entitled to voir dire the venire panel regarding that issue.

CASE NOTES Waiver not ground for seatin g partial panel.  Under appropriate circumstances, a waiver of peremptory strikes by one or both parties is helpful and useful to the alleviation of an overcrowded docket. However, where a defendant has alerted the court to the existence of a potential problem and elects to stand on the statutory mandate of a panel of 20 jurors, he is entitled to a full panel of impartial jurors and may not be required to accept a lesser number si mply because the Commonwealth agrees to waive one or more of its peremptory strikes. Fuller v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 277, 416 S.E.2d 44, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2614, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 113 (1992). Defendant may not be forced to use peremptory strikes to exclude certain veniremen.  It is prejudicial error for the trial court to force a defendant to use the peremptory strikes afforded him by this section to exclude a venireman who is not free from exception. Breeden v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 297, 227 S.E.2d 734, 1976 Va. LEXIS 275 (1976). Refusal to remove partial juror not harmless error even if peremptory strike used.  A trial courts refusal to remove a juror who is not impartial does not constitute harmless error even if counsel uses a peremptory strike to exclude the juror . David v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 77, 493 S.E.2d 379, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 715 (1997). Effect of leading questions.  Answers to leading questions by the trial court or the attorney for the Commonwealth do not per se remove the taint resulting from expressed impression of guilt o r bias. Proof that a prospective juror is impartial and fair should come from the juror and not be based on his or her mere assent to persuasive suggestions. Williams v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 208, 415 S.E.2d 856, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2421, 1992 Va. App. LE XIS 96 (1992). Sufficient race-neutral expl anation found.  Commonwealths concerns with jurors who were not paying attention, one of whom was seen smiling at appellant, provided sufficient race-neutral explanations for the use of two of its peremptory strikes. Allred v. Commonwealth, No. 0223-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals March 14, 1995). Peremptory strikes in capita l murder trial.  There is no basis in Virginia law for additional peremptory strikes in a capital murder trial. Buchanan v. Commonwealth, 238 Va. 389, 384 S.E.2d 757, 6 Va. Law Re p. 531, 1989 Va. LEXIS 149 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 596 (1990). Because peremptory challenges are a creature of statute and are not required by the Constitution, it is for the state to determine the number of peremptory challe nges allowed; a defendant is only denied a right to peremptory challenges in a state capital proceeding when he does not receive that which state law provides. Goins v. Angelone, 52 F. Supp. 2d 638, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15815 (E.D. Va. 1999). Perempto ry strikes may not be combined by co-defendants.  Defendant argued that he and the codefendant were each entitled to exercise four peremptory strikes pursuant to this section. However, the codefendants together w ere statutorily assured no more than four peremptory strikes. Because the trial court permitted a total of six peremptory challenges, there was no error. Banks v. Commonwealth, No. 2990-95-3 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 4, 1997). Number of peremptory s trikes in case of joinder.  Defendants jointly tried are together entitled only to the four peremptory challenges provided by this section. Allowing each defendant three challenges, rather t han four as requested, was within the discretion of the trial court. Adkins v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. App. 159, 480 S.E.2d 777, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 59 (1997). Failure to select jury free fr om prejudice.  Where jurors in question were closely associated with either the accused or the victim and their respective families and the information to which they were expose d and/or conclusions they had formed, coupled with their associations, raised reasonable doubt that they could stand indifferent in the cause, the trial court failed in its duty to procure a jury free from prejudice when it declined to select other juror s. Williams v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 208, 415 S.E.2d 856, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2421, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 96 (1992). Refusal to strike for cause held pro per.  Trial courts decision to deny defendants motion to strike a prospective juror for cause was not manifestly erroneous and would not be reversed, as the tri al court reasonably concluded that the prospective jurors apparent equivocation over whether she could be impartial was due to her nervousness about reaching a decision and wondering later whether it was the correct decision rather than any problem w ith being impartial. Weeks v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 364 (Va. Ct. App. June 24, 2003). Trial court did not abuse its discretion in not striking three jurors for cause because the court properly concluded that the jurors were fair and impartial and w ould be able to render a verdict based solely on the law and the evidence, as none of the jurors indicated they would convict simply because defendant drank alcohol. All of the jurors simply stated that one should not drink and drive, but indicated that they would follow the instructions given by the court. Simmons v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 69, 754 S.E.2d 545, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (2014). The trial court erred in refusing to strike potential juror for cause, where although sh e stated that she would attempt not to base her judgment on information she had gained through the news media, she could not assure the court that she would render her verdict based solely on the evidence adduced at trial. Her answers raised a reasonable doubt as to her qualification to serve as a juror, a doubt that should have been resolved by granting defendants motion to strike her for cause. DeHart v. Commonwealth, 19 Va. App. 139, 449 S.E.2d 59, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 630 (1994). Restoration of juror removed for cause was reversible error.  A trial courts restoration to a jury panel of a venire member previously removed for cause, in order to have a full 20-member panel, was prejudicial, reversib le error notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth had agreed to use its first peremptory strike to remove that member. Winston v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 864, 531 S.E.2d 59, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 529 (2000). Decision of court to use procedure in subsection (4) (now subsection D) not reversible error.  Where Commonwealth refused to exercise right to strike three of four prospective jurors, decision of trial court to use procedure specified in subsection (4) (now subsection D) of this section was not reversible error. Reid v. Commonwealth, No. 0894-94-1 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 10, 1995). Too few jurors; mistrial mandatory.  Despite the accuseds willingness to proceed with a jury of less than 12 members following the illness of a juror, where the Commonwealth insisted upon its co- equal right to a jury of 12 members, the trial court properly declared that a mistrial was mandatory; and a second trial for the same offenses did not violate double jeopardy principles. King v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 364, 579 S.E.2d 634, 2003 Va. App . LEXIS 255 (2003). Section not violated.  The trial court did not violate defendants rights to strike a member of the jury pool chosen to sit on the jury, as provided by § 19.2-262, after another c hosen juror was excused, as: (1) defendant was not forced to choose between two jurors that he had previously struck; (2) his prejudice argument based on his ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-263"><akn:num>§ 19.2-263</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1993, cc</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>462 and 489.

CASE NOTES Communication with jury.  Defendants contention that the trial court erred in entering the jury room to answer a written question the jury posed about sentencing was waived and would n ot be considered the ends-of-justice exception to the requirement that objections to be reviewed on appeal had to be raised at trial; defendant and defense counsels silence when the trial court asked whether the response should be phrased in open court with the jury or whether the trial court could step into the jury room and respond meant defendant on appeal was trying to take advantage of an error for which he was responsible since his failure to object at trial and his subsequent objectio n on appeal was inviting error and then trying to benefit from it, which the appellate court would not allow. Pope v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 500 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 7, 2006). Defendant ones challenge to the courts act of entertaining and answering the jurys questions when neither he nor his counsel were present could be con sidered on appeal under the contemporaneous objection exception as he did not contest the content of the courts answers to the jurys questions; defendant one and his counsel did not have the opportunity to be present and challenge the courts decision to address questions from the jury in their absence.

For article surveying developments in criminal law and procedure in Virginia from July 2001 to September 2002, see 37 U. Rich. L. Rev. 45 (2002). CASE NOTES Trial courts issued instructions were not basis for reversal.  Because defendants unwillingness to submit to a breath test without access to counsel amounted to an unreasonable refusal under subsection A of § 18.2-268. 3, the trial court properly instructed the jury on said issue. Thus, defendants conviction of unreasonably refusing to submit to a breath test, after having been convicted of two predicate offenses within ten years, in violation of § 18.2-268.3, w as upheld on appeal. Brothers v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 468, 650 S.E.2d 874, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 370 (2007). Instruction was not improper for not being a model jury instruction because, statutorily, this was not a ground for withholding a jury instruction that accurately stated the law. Howsare v. Commonwealth, 293 Va. 439, 799 S.E.2d 512, 2017 Va. LEXIS 75 (2017). No abuse of discretion.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting the geriatric parole instruction because geriatric release was a possibility based on defendants age and sentence; and the amended jury instruction was properly denied as defendants proposed instruction was not an accurate statement of the law. Bustos v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2019). Refusal of instruction held error.  Trial courts refusal of a proffered instruction on the sole ground that it was not the model instruction was reversible error, as it violated the statutory di ctate of this section, and because, had the trial court given defendants proffered instruction, the jury would have been clearly informed that a manslaughter conviction was legally insufficient to sustain the charge of use of a firearm during the com mission of a murder. Gaines v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 326, 563 S.E.2d 410, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 304 (2002), aff'd, 39 Va. App. 562, 574 S.E.2d 775, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 75 (2003). Refusal of instruction held proper.  Defendants proffered instruction was properly refused, as such was likely to be obvious to any rational juror applying his or her common sense, and was covere d by other, more general jury instructions, which allowed defense counsel to argue these principles forcefully to the jury in closing argument. Hales v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 22, 2005). § 19.2-263.3. Juror information confidential. Text A. The court m ay, upon motion of either party or its own motion, and for good cause shown, issue an order regulating the disclosure of the name and home address of a juror who has been impaneled in a criminal trial to any person, other than to counsel for either party or a pro se defendant. For the purposes of this subsection, good cause shown includes, but is not limited to, a determination by the court that there is a likelihood of bribery, tampering, or physical injury to or harassment of a juror if his personal i nformation is disclosed. An order regulating the disclosure of information may be modified, and the names and home addresses of the jurors in a criminal case may be disseminated to a person having a legitimate interest or need for the information, with r estrictions upon its use and further dissemination as may be deemed appropriate by the court. B. Additional personal information of a juror who has been impaneled in a criminal case shall be released only to the counsel for the defendant, a pro se defendant, and the attorney for the Commonwealth. The court may, upon motion of either party or its own motion, an d for good cause shown, issue an order authorizing the disclosure of any additional personal information of a juror to any other person. Such order may be modified and may place restrictions on the use and further dissemination of such disclosed informat ion. C. In addition to the provisions of this section, the Supreme Court shall prescribe and publish rules that provide for the protection of the name, home address, and additional personal information of a juror in a criminal trial. D. For purpose s of this section, additional personal information means any information other than name and home address collected by the court, clerk, or jury commissioner at any time about a person who is selected to sit on a criminal jury and includes, but i s not limited to, a jurors age, occupation, business address, telephone numbers, email addresses, and any other identifying information that would assist another in locating or contacting the juror.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Protect jurors from physical injury.  Defendants motion for the court to take judicial notice of this provision was denied in part because if the General Assembly had intended to protect jurors fr om physical injury and harassment only when such physical injury and harassment could impact on the jurys decision-making process, it could have said that as well and it did not.

Motion for Bill of Particulars in Capital Cases. CASE NOTES Whether to allow jury to separate is matter within trial judges discretion. McFalls v . Peyton, 270 F. Supp. 577, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8722 (W.D. Va. 1967), aff'd, 401 F.2d 890 (4th Cir. 1968). As to the exercise of the judges discretion as to whether the jury should separate, it is to be remembered that the statutes or decisions of many states expre ssly allow the separation of the jury even in capital cases. Other states have provided the contrary. The practice has varied, with perhaps a slight present tendency in the more conservative direction. If the mere opportunity for prejudice or corruption is to raise a presumption that they exist, it will be hard to maintain jury trial under the conditions of the present day. Rich v. United States, 330 F. Supp. 949, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11773 (D. Va. 1967). Ex ercise of trial judges discretion in absence of accused.  While it is true that whether to allow the jury to separate is a matter within the trial judges discretion, it is not to be presumed that the discretion is to be exercised in a vacuum; in other words, in the absence of the accused in contravention of § 19.2-259. Near v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 929, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6537 (4th Cir. 1963) (commented on in 21 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 346 (1964)). Abuse of discretion.  In capital cases, where objection is interposed to the jury being permitted to separate after deliberations have been commenced, this may be an abuse of discretio n, especially where no admonitions were given or where the inconvenience to the jurors is likely to touch upon their ability to give proper consideration to the case when they resume their deliberations. Rich v. United States, 330 F. Supp. 949, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11773 (D. Va. 1967). Separation w ith consent of accused and Commonwealth.  Where the jury has been permitted to separate by the court upon the consent of the accused and the Commonwealth, prejudice will not be presumed in favor of the ac cused, and the burden will be upon him to show that the jury, during such separation, were guilty of misconduct to his prejudice. Powell v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 327, 28 S.E.2d 687, 1944 Va. LEXIS 182 (1944); Near v. Commonwealth, 202 Va. 20, 116 S.E.2d 85, 1960 Va. LEXIS 186 (1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 873, 81 S.

Refusal to sequester not error where jurors warned and questioned.  There was no error in denial of defendants motion to sequester the jury during the three-day trial, where the trial judge, when he dismissed the jurors for th e day, warned them to avoid news accounts of the trial and to refrain from discussing the case among themselves or with others, and when they reassembled, he questioned them on the subject and all replied that they had complied with his instructions. Bog gs v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 501, 331 S.E.2d 407, 1985 Va. LEXIS 226 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1031, 106 S. Ct. 1240, 89 L. Ed. 2d 347, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 723 (1986); 495 U.S. 940, 110 S. Ct. 2193, 109 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1990). Media coverage does no t mandate sequestration.  Sequestration is not mandated by the mere fact that the offense has received coverage in the news media. Pope v.

If prejudice is shown, it is grounds for a new trial in any case where the jury is permi tted to separate and the jurors have been subjected to outside influence. This is equally true both for a criminal case and with respect to a civil case involving a de minimis amount. Rich v. United States, 330 F. Supp. 949, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11773 ( D. Va. 1967). Separation of jury as grounds for habeas corpus.  In a petition for habeas corpus, accused was entitled to a hearing where it was alleged that, in the absence of the accused, the trial judge had exercised his dis cretion to allow the jury to separate during the trial and that thereafter the jurors mingled with the spectators and heard prejudicial remarks. Near v. Cunningham, 313 F.2d 929, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 6537 (4th Cir. 1963) (commented on in 21 Wash. &amp; Lee L Rev. 346 (1964)). § 19.2-264.1. Views by juries. Text The jury in any criminal case may, at the request of either the attorney for the Commonwealth or any defendant, be taken to view the premises or place in question, or a ny property, matter or thing relating to the case, when it shall appear to the court that such view is necessary to a just decision.

CASE NOTES Jury view of scene not abuse of discretion.  Trial courts decision to allow the jury to view the crime scene was not an abuse of discretion because it helped the jury understand the layout of the apartme nt complex, the location of the window and the parking lot, and how these factors related to the crimes. Smith v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 521, 633 S.E.2d 188, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 366 (2006). View of prison facility.  With regard to defendants convictions on two capital murder counts and the imposition of two death sentences against him, the trial court did not abuse its di scretion in denying defendants motion for a view of the prison facility since evidence on the general nature of prison life in a maximum-security facility was not even relevant to the determination of his future dangerousness. Prieto v. Commonwealth, 283 Va. 149, 721 S.E.2d 484, 2012 Va. LEXIS 20, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 871, 133 S. Ct. 244, 184 L. Ed. 2d 129, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 6641 (2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS View of intersection.  While a jury view of the intersection where a collision occurred might have been helpful to some degree to the jury in visualizing the intersection, it did not ap pear, based on the evidence before the court, that a view of the intersection was necessary to a just decision. A view of the intersection appeared to be of little probative value. Commonwealth v. Miller, 96 Va. Cir. 130, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 116 (Loudoun County July 19, 2017). Article 4.1.

Counsel cannot put his clients character into evidence through his opening statement, particularly when the jury has already been instructed that counsels statements are not to be viewed as evidence. Fields v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 300, 343 S.E.2d 379, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 272 (1986). Counsel cannot argue d uring opening statement.  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that defendants counsel could not use the opening statement for argument. Spencer v. Commonwealth, 238 Va. 295, 384 S.E.2d 785, 6 Va. Law Rep. 416, 1989 Va. LEXIS 127 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1093, 110 S. Ct. 1171, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1073, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 1036 (1990). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Deference of opening statement.  Pursuant to the Commonwealths motion in limine to determine the admissibility of testimony and argument related to third-party guilt, while defendant was not required to make an opening statement, he could not defer his opening statement after the introduction of evidence, the court had only heard proffers of anticipated evidence at trial, and the introduction of mere inadmissible hearsay to indicate third-pa rty guilt was, ultimately, inappropriate. Commonwealth v. Pettway, 109 Va. Cir. 395, 2022 Va. Cir. LEXIS 32 (Newport News Apr. 1, 2022). § 19.2-265.01. Victims, certain members of the family and support persons not to be excluded. Text During the trial of every criminal case and in all court proceedings attendant to trial, whether before, during or after trial, including any proceedings occurring afte r an appeal by the defendant or the Commonwealth, at which attendance by the defendant is permitted, whether in a circuit or district court, any victim as defined in § 19.2-11.01 may remain in the courtroom and shall not be excluded unless the court d etermines, in its discretion, the presence of the victim would impair the conduct of a fair trial. In any case involving a minor victim, the court may permit an adult chosen by the minor to be present in the courtroom during any proceedings in addition t o or in lieu of the minors parent or guardian. The attorney for the Commonwealth shall give prior notice when practicable of such trial and attendant proceedings and changes in the scheduling thereof to any known vi ctim and to any known adult chosen in accordance with this section by a minor victim, at the address or telephone number, or both, provided in writing by such person.

Criminal Procedure, § 38; 19 M.J. Trial, §§ 1, 3; 20 M.J. Witnesses, § 35. CASE NOTES No abuse of discretion in allowing victim witness to stay in courtroom.  Circuit court did not abuse its discretion under § 19.2-265.01 by allowing a murder victims son, who was a victim within the meaning of subsection B of § 19.2-11.01, to remain in the courtroom after he testified during the guilt phase of the trial because the circuit court correctly concluded that the victims son did not learn anything while he was present in the court that would have changed or affected his victim impact testimony during the penalty phase, and, thus, defendant was not prejudiced by the fact that the son testified during the penalty phase after having heard much of the testimony during the guilt phase. Jackson v. Commonwealth, 2 67 Va. 178, 590 S.E.2d 520, 2004 Va. LEXIS 8, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 891, 125 S. Ct. 168, 160 L. Ed. 2d 155, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 5213 (2004). Because defendant provided no specific reason for finding that a victim witnesss presence in the courtroom during the testimony of other witnesses would impai r the fairness of the trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the victim witness to remain in the courtroom. Hernandez-Guerrero v. Commonwealth, 46 Va. App. 366, 617 S.E.2d 410, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 311 (2005). Circuit court properly found a probationer in violation of his probation, as testimony from a victim-witness in a city prosecution, which was underlying basis for the issuance of a capias in the revocation matter, was relevant; further, that witness was exempt from sequestration, as she could not have shaped her testimony to correspond to the contents of the probationers letter to the judge or the testimony o f the probation officer. Osborne v. Commonwealth, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 376 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 4, 2005). No exception exists to allow defendants family to remain in cou rt at guilt phase and also testify at penalty phase.  Defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel where his counsel did not object to the exclusion of defendants family from the courtroom during the guilt phase of his trial because those family members were expected to testify during the penalty phase; the court rejected defendants argument that counsels failure to object sent a false message that his family did not care enough to be wit h him during his trial. Defendant could not show that an objection would be successful; so he failed to establish the performance prong of the Strickland test; there was no exception under § 19.2-265.01 that would allow defendants family to remain in the courtroom during trial and still be able to testify at the penalty phase. Jackson v. Warden of the Sussex I State Prison, 271 Va. 434, 627 S.E.2d 776, 2006 Va. LEXIS 32 (2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1122, 127 S. Ct. 943, 166 L. Ed. 2d 721, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 198 (2007). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Victims right of advance notif ication.  Dismissal of case based on non-appearance of victim, after the Attorney for the Commonwealth of Virginia determined not to participate in the prosecution, was ina ppropriate when the victim was never notified of the trial date by the Commonwealths Attorney because the victim was not required to specifically request advance notification of judicial proceedings and the Commonwealths Attorney was required to provide the victim advance notification as the victim provided the victims name, address, and phone number to the police department. Defendant's Motion to Dismiss v. Chastain, 107 Va. Cir. 178, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 16 (Fairfax County Jan. 29, 2021). § 19.2-265.1. Exclusion of witnesses (Subsection (a) of Supreme Court Rule 2:615 derived in part from this section and subsection (c) of Supreme Court Rule 2:615 derived from this section). Text In the trial of every criminal case, the court, whether a court of record or a court not of record, may upon its own motion and shall upon the motion of either the atto rney for the Commonwealth or any defendant, require the exclusion of every witness to be called, including, but not limited to, police officers or other investigators; however, each defendant who is an individual and one officer or agent of each defendan t which is a corporation or association shall be exempt from the rule of this section as a matter of right. Additionally, any victim as defined in § 19.2-11.01 who is to be called as a witness shall be exempt from the rule of this section as a matter of law unless, in accordance with the provisions of § 19.2-265.01, his exclusion is otherwise required.

A court may solely in its discretion permit the taking of photographs in the courtroom during the progress of judicial proceedings and the broadcasting of judicial proc eedings by radio or television and the use of electronic or photographic means for the perpetuation of the record or parts thereof in criminal and in civil cases, but only in accordance with the rules set forth hereunder. In addition to such rules, the S upreme Court and the Court of Appeals shall have the authority to promulgate any other rules they deem necessary to govern electronic media and still photography coverage in their respective courts. The following rules shall serve as guidelines, and a v iolation of these rules may be punishable as contempt: Coverage Allowed. 1. The p residing judge shall at all times have authority to prohibit, interrupt or terminate electronic media and still photography coverage of public judicial proceedings. The presiding judge shall advise the parties of such coverage in advance of the proceedin gs and shall allow the parties to object thereto. For good cause shown, the presiding judge may prohibit coverage in any case and may restrict coverage as he deems appropriate to meet the ends of justice. 2. Coverage of the following types of judicial proceedings shall be prohibited: adoption proceedings, juvenile proceedings, child custody proceedings, divorce proceedings, temporary and p ermanent spousal support proceedings, proceedings concerning sexual offenses, proceedings for the hearing of motions to suppress evidence, proceedings involving trade secrets, and in camera proceedings. 3. Coverage of the following categories of witnesses shall be prohibited: police informants, minors, undercover agents and victims and families of victims of sexual offenses. 4. Coverage of jurors shall be prohibited expressly at any stage of a judicial proceeding, including that portion of a proceeding during which a jury is selected. The judge shall inform a ll potential jurors at the beginning of the jury selection process of this prohibition. 5. To protect the attorney-client privilege and the right to counsel, there shall be no recording or broadcast of sound from such conferences which occur in a court facility between attor neys and their clients, between co-counsel of a client, between adverse counsel, or between counsel and the presiding judge held at the bench or in chambers. Location of Equipment and Personnel. 1. The l ocation of recording and camera equipment shall be strictly regulated so as not to be intrusive. 2. Media personnel shall not enter or leave the courtroom once the proceedings are in session except during a court recess or adjournment. 3. Electronic media equipment and still photography equipment shall not be taken into the courtroom or removed from the designated media area except at the following times: a. Prior to the convening of proceedings; b. During any luncheon recess; c. During any court recess with the permission of the trial judge; and d. After adjournment for the day of the proceedings. Official Representatives of the Media. The Virginia Association of Broadcasters and the Virginia Press Association may designate one person to represent the television media, one person to represent the radi o broadcasters, and one person to represent still photographers in each jurisdiction in which electronic media and still photographic coverage is desired. The names of the persons so designated shall be forwarded to the chief judge of the court in the co unty or city in which coverage is desired so that arrangements can be made for the pooling of equipment and personnel. Such persons shall also be the only persons authorized to speak for the media to the presiding judge concerning the coverage of any judicial proceedings. Equipment and Personnel. 1. No di stracting lights or sounds shall be permitted. 2. Not more than two television cameras shall be permitted in any proceeding. 3. Not more than one still photographer, utilizing not more than two still cameras with not more than two lenses for each camera and related equipment for print purposes, shall be permitt ed in any proceeding. 4.

If no technically suitable audio system exists in the court facility, microphones and related wiring essential for media purposes may be installed and maintained at media expense. The microphones and wiring must be unobtrusive and shall be located in places designated in advance of any proceeding by the chief judge of the court in which coverage is desired. 5. Any pooling arrangements among the media required by these limitations on equipment and personnel shall be the sole responsibility of the media without calling upon the presidi ng judge to mediate any dispute as to the appropriate media representative or equipment authorized to cover a particular proceeding. In the absence of advance media agreement on disputed equipment or personnel issues, the presiding judge may exclude all contesting media personnel from a proceeding. 6. In no event shall the number of personnel in the designated area exceed the number necessary to operate the designated equipment. 7. Only television photographic and audio equipment which does not produce distracting sound or light shall be employed to cover judicial proceedings.

Impermissible Use of Media Material. None of the film, video tape, still photographs or audio reproductions developed during or by virtue of coverage of a judicial proceeding shall be admissible as evidenc e (i) in the proceeding out of which it arose, (ii) in any proceeding subsequent and collateral thereto, or (iii) upon any retrial or appeal of such proceedings.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section, permitting the closure by the court of a criminal trial to the public and press, upon the unobjected-to request of the defendant, without requiring the court to make specific findings as to whether alternative solutions would have met the need to ensure fairness and without the specific finding of an overriding interest, violates the right of the public and press to attend criminal trials implicit i n the guarantees of the First Amendment.

CASE NOTES Because such filing is a directory rather than a mandatory requirement, failure to file the names and addresses of such witnesses under this section with the clerk does not prevent the witnesses from being called to testify. Caccioppo v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 534, 458 S.E.2d 592, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 550 (1995). Where a defendants substantive rights were not affected by the Commonwealths failure to file the names and addresses of witnesses being summoned at the ti me of the issuance of the summonses, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the witnesses to testify. Abraham v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 22, 526 S.E.2d 277, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (2000). Nothing in this section prohibits the witnesses summoned by the Commonwealth from testifying due to the Commonwealths failure to file their names or addresses with the clerk; nor is there any suggestion in the statute that such a remedy was intended by the legislature. Abraham v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 22, 526 S.E.2d 277, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (2000). In response to defendants pretrial motion, the prosecutor proffered that her office had filed the returns of service for its witnesses and, thus, the names of its witnesses were available to defendant, despite defendants suggestion that no evidence in the record supports the Commonwealths assertion; the rule is well settled that a unilateral avowal of counsel, if unchallenged, constitutes a proper pro ffer. Maldonado v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 589 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2006), rev'd, 274 Va. 812, 651 S.E.2d 646, 2007 Va. LEXIS 125 (2007). Expert testimony admissi ble in criminal case.  Where a firearms experts testimony was within her area of expertise, was not within the range of the jurys common experience, was relevant, and assisted t he trier of fact in understanding the evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this expert testimony under § 8.01-401.1.McCormick v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 311 (Va. Ct. App. May 20, 2003). § 19.2-267.1. Authority of law-enforcement officer to issue summons to witness; failure to appear. Text A summons may be issued by a law-enforcement officer during the course of his immediate investigation of an alleged misdemeanor for which an arrest warrant is not requi red pursuant to § 19.2-81 to any person he reasonably believes was a witness to the offense. The summons shall command the person to appear and testify at the trial of any criminal charge brought against any person as the result of the offense. A summons issued pursuant to this section shall have the same force as if issued by the court. The failure of any person so summoned to appear after receiving written n otice of the date, time and place of the trial at least five days prior to the trial shall be punishable as contempt of the court in accordance with § 18.2-456 (5).

Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Discretion to prosecute.  Limited power sharing is achieved and remains permitted under the separation of powers doctrine where the Court would merely call and questions witnesses, limited to the complaining officer and in limited circumstances additional witnesses merely summoned by the officer; the court emphasizes that in such questioning, it shall refrain from indicating bias as to the weight or quality of the evidence. Commonwealth v . Wilkerson, 108 Va. Cir. 430, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 185 (Newport News Sept. 1, 2021). § 19.2-267.2. Response to subpoena for information stored in electronic format.

Failure to Testify. I.In General. History of section.  See Enoch v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 411, 126 S.E. 222, 1925 Va. LEXIS 419 (1925). The object of this section was to afford the accused opportunity to testify or not, as h is interest might dictate, and not to deprive him of his right to deny his guilt by plea and rest upon the legal presumption of innocence. Price v. Commonwealth, 77 Va. 393, 1883 Va. LEXIS 70 (1883) (see Blair v. Commonwealth, 166 Va. 715, 185 S.E. 900 ( 1936); Elliott v. Commonwealth, 172 Va. 595, 1 S.E.2d 273 (1939)). This section must be given a reasonable construction. Enoch v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 411, 126 S.E. 222, 1925 Va. LEXIS 419 (1925). And should be liberally construed in favor of the accused, so as to give him the fullest right to testify in his own behalf, and that this right should not be any further impaired than the language of the statute necessarily requires. Enoch v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 411, 126 S.E. 222, 1925 Va. LEXIS 419 (1925). When accused testifies he subjects himself to all the terms of this section.  This section permits the accused himself to testify, but to do so he must accept all of the terms of the section, and (1) be deemed to have waived his privile ge of not giving evidence against himself, and (2) be subject to cross-examination as any other witness. The right to cross-examine him as any other witness implied the right to impeach his credibility by the same rules as those appli cable to other witnesses. To discredit the witness, if there be reason to doubt his truthfulness, is one of the legitimate and leading objects of cross-examination. Smith v. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 773, 118 S.E. 107, 1923 Va. LEXIS 130 (1923) (see Watson v . Commonwealth, 87 Va. 608, 13 S.E. 22 (1891); Thaniel v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 795, 111 S.E. 259 (1922); Smith v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 585, 30 S.E.2d 26 (1944)). This section permits an accused to testify in his own behalf in any criminal proceeding, subject to cross-examination as any other witness. Powell v. Commonwealth , 13 Va. App. 17, 409 S.E.2d 622, 8 Va. Law Rep. 684, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 246 (1991). Once defendant in robbery trial testified on direct examination about his adversarial relationship with witness in an effort to discredit her testimony, Commonwea lth could explore on cross examination additional matters relating to the case, even those that were beyond the scope of matters raised on direct examination. Drumgoole v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 783, 497 S.E.2d 159, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (1998). And waives his rights under § 19.2-270.  Under § 19.2-270 no statement made by a witness upon a legal examination, unless made when examined as a witness in his own behalf, can be used as evidence aga inst him. But where, under this section, a prisoner subsequently goes on the stand as a witness in his own behalf, he thereby waives the right afforded him by § 19.2-270, and may be cross-examined as to his statement at such examination, and the Commo nwealth may contradict his testimony thus adduced. Thaniel v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 795, 111 S.E. 259, 1922 Va. LEXIS 78 (1922); Smith v. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 773, 118 S.E. 107, 1923 Va. LEXIS 130 (1923). But waiver must always be made understandingly and willingly.  The waiver of the privilege of the accused not to give evidence against himself must always be made understandingly and willingly, and generally after being fully warned by the court. Powell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 558, 189 S.E. 433, 1937 Va. LEXIS 296 (1937). Whenever the accused, because of some incident in the trial and through no fault of his, is forced to testify for fear that adverse inferences might be drawn from his failure, then he has not volunteered as a witness and has not waived his rights. Such waiver only follows where liberty of choice has been fully accorded. Powell v. Commonwealth, 167 Va. 558, 189 S.E. 433, 1937 Va. LEXIS 296 (1937). If it cannot be said that the accused voluntarily took the stand and testified, then it cannot be said that he intended to waive his statutory right. Blair v. Com monwealth, 166 Va. 715, 185 S.E. 900, 1936 Va. LEXIS 232 (1936). As to the matter testified about by accused he waives his privilege and becomes subject to cross-examination as any other witness. Enoch v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 411, 126 S.E. 222, 1925 Va. LEXIS 419 (1925). Manifestly, an accused who takes the stand waives his right against self-incrimination in its entirety, not just selectively, and may be cross-examined on any sub ject related to the offenses for which he is on trial. Wells v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 775, 531 S.E.2d 16, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 498 (2000). Testimony stricken where defendant refused to submit to cross-examination.  The trial court properly struck the defendants testimony where, during a recess following his direct examination, he made it clear to the court that he would not resume the witness stand and submit to cross-examination, and the trial court was not required to go through a fruitless charade to demonstrate the situation. Tate, Jr. v. Commonwealth, No. 3017-97-2 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 30, 1998). Inferences permitted by waiver .  The waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination goes so far as to permit inferences to be drawn from prior omissions or failures or refusals to testify at a time when the privilege existed and the inference would have been prohibited. Sims v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 246, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11027 (W.D. Va. 1971). Infere nces from silence as to certain matters.  Where the accused takes the stand in his own behalf and voluntarily testifies for himself, he may not stop short in his testimony by omitting and failing to expla in incriminating circumstances and events already in evidence, in which he participated and concerning which he is fully informed, without subjecting his silence to the inferences naturally to be drawn from it. Wells v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 775, 531 S.E.2d 16, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 498 (2000). A court does not err in instructing a jury that it may draw inferences from the selective silence of a testifying accused and any inferences that a jury may draw are also appropriate subjects for argument by the Commonwealth. Wells v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 775, 531 S.E.2d 16, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 498 (2000). Right of C ommonwealth to comment on silence.  An accused, by taking the stand, waives not only his right against self-incrimination but also his right not to have the Commonwealth comment on his failure to te stify on a particular issue or subject. Wells v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 775, 531 S.E.2d 16, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 498 (2000). Construction of subject to cross-examination as any other witness.  There was some doubt as to the meaning of the phrase, subject to cross-examination as any other witness. This doubt was as to whether the accused waives h is privilege of not testifying against himself and may stop any stage when a question is asked which would tend to incriminate him. This was settled by expressly declaring that if the accused be so sworn and examined, he shall be deemed to have waive d his privilege of not giving evidence against himself. Thaniel v. Commonwealth, 132 Va. 795, 111 S.E. 259, 1922 Va. LEXIS 78 (1922). This section does not extend the class of cases in which the right of cross-examination was given, but simply defines the extent of the right where it already exi sted. If the right to cross-examination did not exist before, it has not been conferred now. Enoch v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 411, 126 S.E. 222, 1925 Va. LEXIS 419 (1925). Extent of right to cross-exami ne.  To guard against false testimony, the right of cross-examination was conferred. It would seem that this safeguard did not extend any further than the benefit conf erred, and that if the benefit was limited the safeguard should be also. Enoch v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 411, 126 S.E. 222, 1925 Va. LEXIS 419 (1925). The statute did not attempt to confer upon the Commonwealth the right to examine the accused, but only to cross-examine him under given conditions. This right to cross-examine, however, could only exist where there had been a prior examination in chief. Enoch v. Commonwealth, 141 Va. 411, 126 S.E. 222, 1925 Va. LEXIS 419 (1925). When the accused voluntarily takes the stand he loses his character as a party, becomes a mere witness, and may be examined as fully as any other witness; he may be examined and must answer concerning all matters that are relevant to the case, whether testified to on the direct examination or not.

CASE NOTES Law prior to adoption of section.  Prior to the adoption of this section as § 4779 of the Code of 1919, convicted felons, as a rule, could not testify unless pardoned or punished, and a person c onvicted of perjury could not testify although pardoned or punished. Lincoln v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 370, 228 S.E.2d 688, 1976 Va. LEXIS 290 (1976). Purpose of section.  This section makes material changes in the law governing the competency of witness to testify, so as to remove practically all disqualifications, and permit the c ourts to hear all evidence bearing on the question at issue just as is usual in the business affairs of life. In pursuance of this policy the law with reference to the testimony of those convicted of felony or perjury was changed. Epes' Adm'r v. Hardaway , 135 Va. 80, 115 S.E. 712, 1923 Va. LEXIS 3 (1923). Impeachment.  It is not proper to ask a witness if he has been indicted, and it is not proper to show that he has been convicted of an ordinary misdemeanor, but it may, for pur poses of impeachment, be shown by the witness himself that he has been convicted of felony or of perjury. Smith v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1111, 156 S.E. 577, 1931 Va. LEXIS 287 (1931). A defendant/witness may be impeached by showing that he has been previously convicted of a felony. Powell v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 17, 409 S.E.2d 622, 8 Va. L aw Rep. 684, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 246 (1991). Any error in refusing to allow a witnesss testimony that would have impeached the victim by contradicting his testimony that defendant never banned him from t he property was harmless since the victim had already been impeached on a number of issues and was a convicted felon, yet the trial court found him credible; an additional piece of impeachment testimony would not have altered the outcome of the trial. Ed ward v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 340 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 19, 2013). Effect of impeachment.  If a witness is impeached, it only goes to his credit, not to his competency. He is a competent witness even if he has convicted of perjury. Patterson v. Commonwe alth, 139 Va. 589, 123 S.E. 657, 1924 Va. LEXIS 135 (1924), writ of error dismissed, 270 U.S. 632, 46 S. Ct. 349, 70 L. Ed. 771, 1926 U.S. LEXIS 455 (1926). Entitlement to discount testimony.  At defendants trial for grand larceny involving a stolen vehicle, the trial court was entitled to discount the defense testimony of defendants girlfriend, who was a convicted felon. Randolph v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 511 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 14, 2003). In defendants prosecution for drug possession, although defendant denied knowledge of the drugs found in a car he was borrowing, the trial court was entitled to consider defendants prior felony conviction in assessing his credibility under § 19.2-269. Etheridge v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 134 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 24, 2009). Defendants conviction for grand larceny of a string trimmer was appropriate because the evidence was sufficient and the trial judge was entitled to consider d efendants prior felony conviction in assessing his credibility. Swiggett v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 53 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 2010). Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery and established defendants willing participation in multiple crimes b ecause the jury was entitled to disbelieve defendants self-serving testimony denying knowledge of a codefendants plan to rob the victims, the jury could consider defendants prior felony convictions in assessing defendants credibility, and the victims testified that defendant actively participated in committing the crimes against them. Holmes v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 206 (Va. Ct. App. June 7, 2022). Testimony not inherently incredible.  In a first-degree murder case, the testimony of the Commonwealths witnesses, most of whom were convicted felons, was not inherently incredible as a matter of law, and the jury was entitled to accept it. The testimony of those witnesses was not manifestly false, or so contrary to human experience as to render it unworthy of belief. Turner v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 197 (Va. Ct. App. July 17, 2018). Proof of prior conviction.  It has long been well settled in this state that the character of a witness for veracity cannot be impeached by proof of a prior conviction of crime, unless the c rime be a felony or one which involved moral turpitude or the character of the witness for veracity. McLane v. Commonwealth, 202 Va. 197, 116 S.E.2d 274, 1960 Va. LEXIS 206 (1960); Lincoln v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 370, 228 S.E.2d 688, 1976 Va. LEXIS 290 (1976). By Commonwealth.  This section means that the fact of conviction of a felony may be shown by the Commonwealth. Harmon v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 442, 185 S.E.2d 48, 1971 Va. LEXIS 37 0 (1971). Effect of guilty plea.  In Jewel v. Commonwealth , 260 Va. 430 (2000), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that for the limited purposes of § 19.2-269, a defendants guilty plea accepted by the trial court constitutes a conviction and an order entering a finding of guilt was un necessary. To the extent that Jewel can be read to suggest that a trial court formally adjudicates a defe ndants guilt by accepting a plea of guilty and entering it in the record, it is overruled. Starrs v. Commonwealth, 287 Va. 1, 752 S.E.2d 812, 2014 Va. LEXIS 11 (2014), limited, White v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 599, 798 S.E.2d 818, 2017 Va. App. LEX IS 118 (2017). Conviction includes guilty plea.  For the limited purposes of this section, the word conviction includes a guilty plea accepted by the court but for which no order has been entered stating a finding of guilt or imposing sentence; proof of such a guilty plea may be shown to impeach a witness. Jewel v. Commonwealth, 260 Va. 430, 536 S.E.2d 905, 2000 Va. LEXIS 145 (2000). Felony, other than perjury, and the details thereof may not be shown. Harmon v. Commonwea lth, 212 Va. 442, 185 S.E.2d 48, 1971 Va. LEXIS 370 (1971). So long as the defendant answers truthfully the inquiry as to a prior felony conviction, the name of the crime cannot be shown. Harmon v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 44 2, 185 S.E.2d 48, 1971 Va. LEXIS 370 (1971). When the Commonwealth attempts to impeach the credibility of the accused by showing prior felony convictions, in order to avoid undue prejudice to the accused, ne ither the nature of the felony, other than perjury, nor the details of the crime are admissible; only the fact of a conviction can be shown. Powell v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 17, 409 S.E.2d 622, 8 Va. Law Rep. 684, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 246 (1991). For purposes of impeachment, the fact of a prior conviction of a felony may be shown against a party-witness in a civil case, but the name of the felony, other th an perjury, and the details thereof may not be shown. Payne v. Carroll, 250 Va. 336, 461 S.E.2d 837, 12 Va. Law Rep. 220, 1995 Va. LEXIS 106 (1995). Witnesses other than defendant may be asked names of felonies for which they have been c onvicted. This rule is not limited to witnesses for the Commonwealth. Dammerau v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 285, 349 S.E.2d 409, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1003, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 363 (1986), overruled, Vescuso v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 59, 360 S.E.2d 547, 4 Va. Law Rep. 631, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 270 (1987). Prior conviction must involve moral turpitude.  It must be clearly shown that the prior conviction was for an offense involving moral turpitude; otherwise the inquiry should not be permitted. Chrisman v. Common wealth, 3 Va. App. 89, 348 S.E.2d 399, 3 Va. Law Rep. 631, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 340 (1986). And character of witness for veracity.  The character of a witness veracity cannot be impeached by proof of a prior conviction of crime, unless the crime be one which involved the character of the w itness for veracity. Chrisman v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 89, 348 S.E.2d 399, 3 Va. Law Rep. 631, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 340 (1986). Misdemeanor must involve moral turpitude.  If the crime be a misdemeanor, the right to inquire is limited to those that involve moral turpitude. Chrisman v. Commonwealth, 3 Va.

Witnesses, §§ 39, 80, 81. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  The effect of this section is to conform the procedure in this state with the general rule that a defendants testimony at a former trial is admissible in evid ence against him in later proceedings and does not violate his constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Consequently, the statute is not in derogation of the federal and state constitutional provisions. Harbaugh v. Commonwealth, 20 9 Va. 695, 167 S.E.2d 329, 1969 Va. LEXIS 163 (1969). This section benefits both the witness-in-jeopardy and the accused by immunizing the witness. Benefit to the witness from use of immunity is manifest. The benefit to the accused lies in taking away the obstacle to confrontation posed by the witness continued assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege. A third, and equally import ant, benefit accrues to the truthfinding process. As the trial judge stated: The reason behind this statute . . . is obvious. There is a search for justice and we must have the truth. Cunningham v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 358, 344 S.E.2d 389, 19 86 Va. App. LEXIS 281 (1986). Protection provided witness limited.  This section by its terms confers only use immunity, i.e., it protects the witness only from the use of the specific testimony compelled from him under the grant of immunity, but not from evidence obtained as a result of such testimony. Such limited protection is obviously not coextensive with the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and cannot overcome the privilege, once validly asserted. Gosling v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 158, 415 S.E.2d 870, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2498, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 94 (1992). Witness testimony should only be compelled if incrimination clearly impossible.  When a witness declares his belief that an answer to a question would incriminate, or tend to incriminate him, the court cannot compel him to answer, unless it is perfectly clear, from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken and that the answer cannot possibly have such tendency. Gosling v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 158, 415 S.E.2d 870, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2498, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 94 (1992). Immunization cures any possi ble prejudice.  Although no Virginia cases on point can be found, immunization has been held in other jurisdictions to cure any possible prejudice, because the defendant is enabl ed to cross-examine. Cunningham v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. App. 358, 344 S.E.2d 389, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 281 (1986). No statement made by witness upon legal examination, unless made when examined as a witness in his own behalf, can be used as evidence against him. Smith v. Commonwealth, 136 Va. 773, 118 S.E. 107, 1923 Va. LEXIS 130 (1923). Where defendan t formerly a witness in his own behalf.  Where the defendants testimony at his brothers trial constituted statements that he made when examined as a witness on his own behalf, he was not entitled to any protection under this section when the prosecutor sought to use that testimony against him. Thornton v. Commonwealth, 22 Va. App. 2, 467 S.E.2d 820, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 178 (1996), limited, Frazier v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 350, 579 S.E.2d 628 , 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (2003). Testimony from a prior trial that ends in a mistrial is admissible under the statute. Mo ore v. Commonwealth, No. 0063-98-4 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 23, 1999). Waiver.  A defendant who chooses to testify waives his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination with respect to the testimony he gives, and that waiver is no less e ffective or complete because the defendant may have been motivated to take the witness stand in the first place only by reason of the strength of the lawful evidence adduced against him. Harbaugh v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 695, 167 S.E.2d 329, 1969 Va. LEX IS 163 (1969). A defendant in a criminal case who takes the stand in his own behalf and testifies without asserting his privilege against self-incrimination thereby waives the p rivilege as to the testimony given so that it may be used against him in a subsequent trial of the same case. The fact that the defendant does not take the stand at the second trial does not prevent the use of his testimony given at the former trial if i t would otherwise be admissible. Harbaugh v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 695, 167 S.E.2d 329, 1969 Va. LEXIS 163 (1969). Statements at co roners inquest are inadmissible.  On a trial for murder, statements made by the accused on his examination at the inquest before the coroners jury cannot be given in evidence against him, unde r the express provisions of this section. Mullins v. Commonwealth, 113 Va. 787, 75 S.E. 193, 1912 Va. LEXIS 104 (1912). But cross-examination as to statements made before coroner is permissible. Thaniel v. Com monwealth, 132 Va. 795, 111 S.E. 259, 1922 Va. LEXIS 78 (1922). The fact that defendant took the stand at his second trial only after the State threatened to introduce his prior testimony does not have the effect of compelling his testimony at the second trial since the State could constitutionally introduce that evidence. Smith v. Slayton, 369 F. Supp. 1213, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10723 (W.D. Va. 1973 ). The decision of the defendant to take the stand at his second trial, apparently to avoid the effect that his prior testimony might have upon the jury, does not ri se to the level of an unconstitutional coercion or compulsion on the part of the Commonwealth. Smith v. Slayton, 369 F. Supp. 1213, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10723 (W.D. Va. 1973). The use of prior testimony from defendants first trial for purposes of rebuttal or impeachment is certainly a natural consequence of taking the stand in one s own defense. Smith v. Slayton, 369 F. Supp. 1213, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10723 (W.D. Va. 1973). Statement of witness for accused in conflict with his former testimony.  Evidence shall not be given against the accused of any statement made by him as a witness upon a legal examination. Therefore, evidence that the statements of wit nesses for the accused conflict with the testimony of the accused as delivered on his examination as a witness at a former trial is inadmissible. Kirby v. Commonwealth, 77 Va. 681, 1883 Va. LEXIS 104 (1883). But statements of joint interest when witness is subsequently indicted are admissible.  Statements made by a person as a witness upon a legal examination touching a matter in which he is jointly interested with another are not excluded under this sec tion when he is subsequently indicted for crime. Hansel v. Commonwealth, 118 Va. 803, 88 S.E. 166, 1916 Va. LEXIS 67 (1916). Statement inadmissible.  In a prosecution for violation of the Prohibition Act, a witness testified as to a statement of accused that he had given away some of the beverages found on his premises. Accused denied having made such statements, and the purpose of the testimony was to impeach his credibility. The statement was not shown to have been made by the accused when examined as a witness in his own behalf, and, therefore, was not admissible. Neal v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 842, 98 S.E. 629, 1919 Va. LEXIS 172 (1919). Denial of due process where defense witness arrested in violation of section.  See Bray v. Peyton, 429 F.2d 500, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 8890 (4th Cir. 1970). Witness silence correctly honored where trial court properly heard and considered se veral questions that defendant proposed to ask witness, recognized an incriminating dimension to the inquiries, and thereby declined to compel witness testimony. Gosling v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 158, 415 S.E.2d 870, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2498, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 94 (1992). Defendants testimony from prior trial admissible.  Trial court properly admitted defendants prior testimony from her boyfriends trial for failure to appear because, as an exception to the statute, regardin g the personal and familial aspect of the defendant and her boyfriends relationship, defendant testified at her own trial that she encouraged her boyfriend to flee during his drug/weapons trial because she was concerned about her boyfriend and the fa ther of her child going to prison. Frazier v. Commonwealth, 268 Va. 412, 601 S.E.2d 624, 2004 Va. LEXIS 126 (2004). § 19.2-270.1. Use of photographs as evidence in certain larceny and burglary prosecutions. Text In any prosecution for larceny under the provisions of §§ 18.2-95, 18.2-96 or § 18.2-98, or for shoplifting under the provisions of § 18.2-103, or for burgl ary under the provisions of §§ 18.2-89, 18.2-90, 18.2-91 or § 18.2-92, photographs of the goods, merchandise, money or securities alleged to have been taken or converted shall be deemed competent evidence of such goods, merchandise, money or sec urities and shall be admissible in any proceeding, hearing or trial of the case to the same extent as if such goods, merchandise, money or securities had been introduced as evidence.

Such person shall be competent to testify in any criminal proceeding wherein the defendant is charged with perjury or pursuant to the provisions o f § 18.2-460 or in any proceeding authorized pursuant to § 19.2-353.3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any judge, clerk of any court, magistrate, or other person having the power to issue warrants, who is the victim of a crime, shall not be incompetent solely because of his office to testify in any criminal or civil proceeding arising out of the crime.

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the notation to the Virginia Rules of Evidence was added to the catchline of this section. Acts 2012, cc. 688 an d 708, cl. 6 provides: That pursuant to the authority set forth in §§ 30-146 and 30-147 of the Code of Virginia, the Virginia Code Commission shall direct any party with whom the Virginia Code Commission contracts to publish the Code of Virgini a to include in the catchline of every section of the Code of Virginia from which any rule contained in the Rules of Evidence has been derived a notation specifying such rule. The 2015 amendments. The 2015 amendment by c. 635 in the second paragraph, substituted Except as otherwise provided in this section, no for No, deleted except proc eedings wherein the defendant is charged with perjury following criminal or civil proceeding in the first sentence, and inserted with perjury or in the second sentence.

CASE NOTES This section is not a blanket prohibition against clerks testifying; it prohibits, inste ad, clerks testifying regarding factual matters which have come before them in the course of their official duties. This section does not prevent a clerk from testifying how and whether he has performed a ministerial function. Carter v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 156, 403 S.E.2d 360, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2191, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 73 (1991)(Ct. of Appeals March 26, 1991); Carter v. Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 156, 403 S.E.2d 360, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2191, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 73 (1991). This section is intended to protect an accused against the testimony of certain judicial officers before whom he has appeared as to admissions or confessions made by him. Baylor v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 116, 56 S.E.2d 77, 1949 Va. LEXIS 266 (1949). But it has no application to an extrajudicial statement. Owens v. Commonwealth, 186 Va. 6 89, 43 S.E.2d 895, 1947 Va. LEXIS 191 (1947). Therefore, statement of accused to judge after judgment is admissible.  Where the testimony of the mayor in whose court case was first tried did not embrace any statements made by the accused on his trial, but embraced a statement mad e by the accused after judgment had been pronounced against him, it was held that the court did not err in admitting this evidence as it did not violate this section. Pflaster v. Town of Berryville, 157 Va. 859, 161 S.E. 58, 1931 Va. LEXIS 343 (1931). Error to allow judges testimony.  Trial court erred in allowing the sitting circuit judge to testify in defendants civil and criminal contempt case where he defied the trial courts order t o have a deputy at the courthouse entrance during weekly business hours, and he took down signs ordered to be posted by the trial court about when the courthouse would be closed absent a deputy at the front entrance despite at least one request by the tr ial court that a sign and corresponding order be returned; the court itself, and not the trial judge, was the victim of defendants contemptuous conduct and other statutory authority, such as § 18.2-459, did not permit a judicial officer who simply witnesses contemptuous behavior to testify. Epps v. Commonwealth, 47 Va. App. 687, 626 S.E.2d 912, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 102 (2006), aff'd, 273 Va. 410, 641 S.E.2d 77, 2007 Va. LEXIS 35 (2007). Because it was the court as an institution which was harmed by contemptuous behavior, a judge was not a victim under § 19.2-271 for purposes of a conte mpt proceeding; a trial court erred in finding that a judge was a victim of alleged contempt, and in permitting the judge to testify. Commonwealth v. Epps, 273 Va. 410, 641 S.E.2d 77, 2007 Va. LEXIS 35 (2007). No error to allow judges testimony.  Because a judge passively witnessed defendants conduct, and did not preside over any of the proceedings, he was properly allowed to testify, despite defendant s claim that the judge was not listed as a witness on the bill of particulars and no discovery order requiring the production of witnesses had been entered; moreover, defendants claim that the judges testimony was cumulative was not addressed , as such was raised for the first time on appeal. Bennett v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 155 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2007). Defendants constitutional right of confrontation was not violated by admission into evidence in criminal proceeding of certificate prepared by general district court judge, which detailed circumstances of offense. Baugh v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 368, 417 S.E.2d 891, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2937, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (1992), overruled in pa rt, Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474, 2008 Va. LEXIS 23 (2008). Virginia legislature does not intend to give birth to a constitutional right to cross-examine a juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR court) judge a t an appeal of a petty direct summary contempt proceeding, a right that a defendant does not otherwise have in the JDR court or the circuit court, as: (1) a JDR court proceeding is not a criminal prosecution within the scope of the Sixth Amendment; (2) t here is no constitutional right to trial at the JDR court and no constitutional right of appeal; (3) there is a statutory prohibition against calling a judge as a witness; and (4) the Virginia general assembly provides a statutory right of appeal with th e caveat that a certificate from the JDR court can be used in such an appeal. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 16, 628 S.E.2d 54, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 130, op. withdrawn, vacated, 49 Va. App. 1, 635 S.E.2d 309, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 456 (2006). Defendant must articul ate basis for challenge.  It may be inappropriate to deny a challenge to a magistrates neutrality in every instance, but where the defendant has not articulated a basis for his challen ge, the trial court is justified in disallowing the defense to interrogate magistrate. Singleton v. Commonwealth, No. 1481-85 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 31, 1987). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Magistrates testimony not allowed.  In a malicious prosecution action, a magistrates testimony was not permitted, as it was irrelevant; neither defendant police officer nor the jury was entitled to place more reliance on arrest warrants issued by one magistrate over another because of one magistrates additional education or job experience. Archer v. Fink, 56 Va. Cir. 253, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 455 (Charlottesville July 13, 2001). § 19.2-271.1. Competency of spouses to testify.

The 2020 amendments. The 2020 amendment by c. 900, substituted Persons married to each other for Husband and wife. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 9B M.J. Husband and Wife, § 87; 20 M.J. Witnesses, § 7 . CASE NOTES Determination to be made at time o f trial.  The privilege of an accused to prevent his spouse from testifying against him is determined at the time of trial and depends upon the couple being validly mar ried at that time. Livingston v. Commonwealth, 21 Va. App. 621, 466 S.E.2d 757, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 97 (1996). The Commonwealths attorney had the burden of first obtaining the consent of the accu sed husband before it could call the wife as a witness against him. Livingston v. Commonwealth, 21 Va. App. 621, 466 S.E.2d 757, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 97 (1996). A person is not incompetent to testify against his spouse under Virginia law. Shiflett v .

Lester v. Bennett, 1 Va. App. 47, 333 S.E.2d 366, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 58 (1985). Out-of-state witness immune from process though not summoned under this article.  The enactment of this article did not supplant, but rather supplemented, the common-law rules on the subject. Hence a resident of Tennessee who voluntarily accept ed service and appeared to testify in a criminal proceeding in Virginia, was privileged against service of civil process in Virginia, though he had not been summoned according to the procedure provided in the Uniform Act. Davis v. Hackney, 196 Va. 651, 8 5 S.E.2d 245, 1955 Va. LEXIS 135 (1955). The privilege from process extends to the property of the witness reasonably necessary to his attendance as well as to his person; and is based on considerations too important to yield to the personal advantage or disadvantage of individual suitors. Davis v. Hackney, 196 Va. 651, 85 S.E.2d 245, 1955 Va. LEXIS 135 (1955).

CASE NOTES What constitutes a conviction for purposes of impeachment.  A conviction occurs when an accused enters a plea of guilty that is voluntarily and intelligently made; it is not necessary for the final judgment or sentencing o rder to have been entered for the prior conviction to be used for impeachment purposes when the accused testifies in another case. Jewel v. Commonwealth, 30 Va. App. 416, 517 S.E.2d 264, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 467 (1999), aff'd, 260 Va. 430, 536 S.E.2d 905, 2000 Va. LEXIS 145 (2000). In Jewel v. Commonwealth, 260 Va. 430 (2000), the Supreme Court of Virginia held that for the limited purposes of § 19.2-269, a defendants guilty plea accepted by the trial court constitutes a conviction and an order entering a finding of guilt was unnecessary. To the extent that Jewel can be read to suggest that a trial court formally adjudicates a de fendants guilt by accepting a plea of guilty and entering it in the record, it is overruled. Starrs v. Commonwealth, 287 Va. 1, 752 S.E.2d 812, 2014 Va. LEXIS 11 (2014), limited, White v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 599, 798 S.E.2d 818, 2017 Va. App. L EXIS 118 (2017). Verdict never accepted or re corded by court.  Where a pool of the jury revealed that they had agreed to a two-thirds majority verdict, and after questioning the jurors and determining that all of them did not agree the trial court declared a mistrial and discharged them, defendant was not convicted at that trial, because the court never accepted or recorded the jurys verdict, and the fact that a harsher sentence was given at a second trial did not violat e defendants constitutional rights.

For related discussion, see 12A M.J. Larceny, § 14. CASE NOTES Object of section.  This section does not dispense with the necessity of stating in an indictment for larceny the name of the owner of the stolen property, nor enable any person to b e such owner who was not capable of being so at common law. Its only object was to get rid of the difficulties often existing at common law in regard to the proper person to be stated as the owner of property in an indictment for larceny or other offense s against property. Hughes v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 565, 1867 Va. LEXIS 25 (1867). This section has no application to proving a violation of § 18.2-81; § 18.2-81 is s ilent on the issue of ownership. Section 18.2-81 proscribes not only burning another persons property, but the broader offense of burning any property with malice or the intent to defraud an insurance company or another person; thus, § 18.2-81 req uires proof only of malice or intent to defraud. Proof of ownership, or of an insurable interest, is not an element of malicious burning under § 18.2-81, and this section does not make it such. Hamm v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 150, 428 S.E.2d 517, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1115, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (1993). Allegation as to owner must be proved.  On a trial for larceny, to convict the prisoner, there must be satisfactory proof that the property stolen was the property of the person stated in the indictment . Jones v. Commonwealth, 58 Va. (17 Gratt.) 563, 1866 Va. LEXIS 14 (1866); Robinson v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 866 (1879); Prather v. Commonwealth, 85 Va. 122, 7 S.E. 178, 1888 Va. LEXIS 18 (1888). But it is only necessary to prove absolute or special ownership.  To sustain an indictment for larceny it is only necessary to prove that the goods alleged to have been stolen are either the absolute or the special property of t he alleged owner. Latham v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 934, 37 S.E.2d 36, 1946 Va. LEXIS 158 (1946). Carrier has special ownership in property transported.  Since the initial carrier is liable for loss, damage or injury to property in interstate commerce, it follows as a corollary that the initial carrier has a legal or special ownership in the property transported. Latham v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 934, 37 S.E.2d 36, 1946 Va. LEXIS 158 (1946). Variance between indictment and proof at trial as to ownership.  When the Commonwealth alleged in an indictment that the money obtained by the defendant was the property of a named individual, her grandfather, but the evidence showed the money was the property of the bank in which the grandfather maintained a savings account, it proved a different offense, resulting in a fatal variance and requiring that the defendants conviction be reversed. Gardner v. Commonwealth, 262 V a. 18, 546 S.E.2d 686, 2001 Va. LEXIS 80 (2001). Where the indictment omitted the word Inc., the significance of the term related solely to the legal status of the victim and not to the identity of the v ictim or the manner in which the crime was committed. Nuckles v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 665 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 5, 2002), rev'd, 266 Va. 519, 587 S.E.2d 695, 2003 Va. LEXIS 107 (2003) (reversing Nuckles v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 665 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 5, 2002)). Constructive possession.  Conviction for destruction of property was sufficiently supported by the evidence although the woman named in the indictment as the owner of the automobile which the defendant damaged did not have legal title to the property. The evidence proved that the woman had possession of the automobile and that she was to receive title to it under an agreement with her former husband, who did have legal title to the proper ty. Proof that the person alleged in the indictment to be the owner of such property has actual or constructive possession of the property is sufficient in a prosecution for this offense. Tammaro v.

Sections 18.2-31 and 18.2-32 and this section are in pari materia and should be read together. Tucker v. Commonwealth, 159 Va. 1038, 167 S.E. 253, 1933 Va. LEXIS 294 (1933); Puckett v. Commonwealth, 182 Va. 237, 28 S.E.2d 619, 1944 Va. LEXIS 173 (1944). Higher offense within the meaning of this section is to be determined by the max imum of the penalty affixed to the offense. Benton v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 782, 21 S.E. 495, 1895 Va. LEXIS 75 (1895). For section to apply, crime must be substantially charged in the indictment.  One indicted for felony may be convicted of part of an offense charged but the statute does not apply unless the particular crime of which one was convicted was s ubstantially charged in the indictment. Myers v. Commonwealth, 148 Va. 725, 138 S.E. 483, 1927 Va. LEXIS 272 (1927). Crime convicted of not different in nature from that in indictment.  Defendant was not convicted of a crime different in nature from that charged in the indictment where the original indictment charged the crime of breaking and ent ering a dwelling house with the intent to maim, and was amended to charge breaking and entering with the intent to commit murder, nor did the trial court err in permitting the amendment. Smith v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 592, 394 S.E.2d 30, 7 Va. Law Re p. 55, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 130 (1990). Circuit courts do not lose jurisdiction because conviction for lesser included offense.  Former § 17-123 (see now § 17.1-513) provides that the circuit court has jurisdiction of all indictments for felonies. Since the defendant was indicted for a felony, the case had to be tried in the circuit court. Circuit courts do not lose jurisdiction to convict and sentence a defendant merely because the conviction turns out to be for a lesser included misdemeanor offense. Jimenez v. Commonwealth, 10 Va . App. 277, 392 S.E.2d 827, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2361, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 80 (1990), rev'd, 241 Va. 244, 402 S.E.2d 678, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1657, 1991 Va. LEXIS 36 (1991). On indictment for felony, defendant may be convicted of lower offense.  On an indictment for malicious cutting and wounding with intent to maim, disfigure, disable and kill, the defendant may be convicted of unlawful cutting and wound ing with like intent, or of assault and battery. Montgomery v. Commonwealth, 98 Va. 840, 36 S.E. 371, 1900 Va. LEXIS 112 (1900). Jury verdict finding accused guilty of a lesser degree of homicide will not be disturbed even though the evidence adduced tends to prove murder in the first degre e and none other. Blankenship v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 587, 70 S.E.2d 335, 1952 Va. LEXIS 169 (1952). Evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction of a felony charged in an indictment is alike sufficient to sustain a conviction of a lesser offense substantially charged in the indictment. Fleming v. Commonwealth, 170 Va. 636, 196 S.E. 696, 1938 Va. LEXIS 218 (1938). Of what offenses accused may be convicted under indictment charging murder in first degree.  Under this section upon an indictment charging murder in the first degree, accused might be convicted not only of murder in the first degree but of murder in the second degree or manslaughter, and accused might be found guilty of an attempt to commit murder, first or second degree, or manslaughter, and where an indictment specifically charges an attempt to commit murder, the jury can find the accused guilty of an attempt to commit murder in the second degree, and impose the penalty of one year in jail. Lee v. Commonwealth, 144 Va. 594, 131 S.E. 212, 1926 Va. LEXIS 274 (1926). Co nviction of lower offense is acquittal of higher offense.  A person indicted for murder and convicted of murder in the second degree is not again liable to conviction for murder in the first degree. Benton v. Commonwealth , 91 Va. 782, 21 S.E. 495, 1895 Va. LEXIS 75 (1895) (see also Bateman v. Commonwealth, 183 Va. 253, 32 S.E.2d 134 (1944)). A conviction of the defendant of murder in the second degree acquits him of murder in the first degree. Carson v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 398, 49 S.E.2d 704, 1948 V a. LEXIS 174 (1948). The conviction of the accused of the lower offense of voluntary manslaughter is an acquittal of the higher offenses of first and second-degree murder. Kuckenbecke r v. Commonwealth, 199 Va. 619, 101 S.E.2d 523, 1958 Va. LEXIS 105 (1958). Where the indictment charged the accused with murder, the effect of a verdict finding him guilty of involuntary manslaughter, under the provisions of this section , was to acquit him of murder in either degree and voluntary manslaughter. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 186 Va. 587, 43 S.E.2d 906, 1947 Va. LEXIS 181 (1947). On new trial accused cannot be tried for any higher offense than that of which he was convicted on the last trial. Lane v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 58, 55 S.E.2d 450, 1949 Va. LEXIS 261 (1949). If an accused is fairly acquitted of a higher offense included in the indictment, and, upon conviction of a lesser offense, applies for and obtains a new trial, h e does not thereby waive the advantage of the acquittal of the higher offense thus obtained. He is not, however, acquitted of the offense in respect to which he asks for a new trial. He may be tried again for that offense with all its incidents and conse quences. Lane v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 58, 55 S.E.2d 450, 1949 Va. LEXIS 261 (1949). Where defendant was indicted for armed robbery, but was tried as an accessory to armed robbery and convicted for receiving stolen property, and the conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court, he could not be retried for any crime of greater gravity than the receipt of stolen goods. Dove v. Peyton, 343 F.2d 210, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6318 (4th Cir. 1965). And the same rule applies to a trial upon an indictment with one count that governs in a trial upon an indictment with several counts. Lane v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 58, 55 S.E.2d 450, 1949 Va. LEXIS 261 (1949). Effect of conviction as to crimes of equal degree.  Housebreaking in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny, and grand larceny, are of equal degree. A conviction of either, when set aside at the instance of th e accused, as a waiver of his jeopardy as to both, and upon a new trial he may be put upon trial upon the whole indictment in which both are charged. Benton v. Commonwealth, 91 Va. 782, 21 S.E. 495, 1895 Va. LEXIS 75 (1895). Effe ct of conviction of felony punishable as misdemeanor.  Conviction of unlawful shooting is a conviction of a felony, though punished by imprisonment in jail and a fine, and after reversal of the sentence a second trial may be had for the felony, and not merely for a misdemeanor, notwithstanding this section. Forbes v. Commonwealth, 90 Va. 550, 19 S.E. 164, 1894 Va. LEXIS 21 (1894). Under this section, one indicted for felony, may be convicted of an attempt to commit su ch felony; and one prosecuted for grand larceny, may be found guilty of petit larceny. Commonwealth v. Worrell, 5 Va. L. Reg. 836 (1920). And conviction of at tempt is acquittal of felony.  A person indicted for rape may be found not guilty of rape, but of an attempt to commit rape, but a verdict of guilty of an attempt to commit rape is an acquittal of the offense of rape, and if such verdict be set aside, the accused cannot on a second trial, be convicted of rape, as this is a higher offense. Cates v. Commonwealth, 111 Va. 837, 69 S.E. 520, 1910 Va. LEXIS 84 (1910). No conviction for assault in prosecution for sodomy where no charge of force.  Where in an indictment for sodomy no charge of assault was involved, because no force against, or lack of consent on the part of, the prosecutrix was averred, the re can be no conviction of assault. Nor is the case in any way within this section authorizing a conviction for a part only of the larger offense charged. Wise v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 757, 115 S.E. 508, 1923 Va. LEXIS 62 (1923). Section applies to robbery.  It was argued by counsel for defendant that this section applies to cases of homicide, malicious wounding, etc., but that it is not applicable to a case of robber y. The argument was more specious than sound, and if permitted to prevail, the defendant would go hence without punishment, although his guilt were firmly established by the evidence. Maxwell v. Commonwealth, 165 Va. 860, 183 S.E. 452, 1936 Va. LEXIS 263 (1936). Indecent exposure not lesser offense of sodomy.  Indecent exposure, though it may occur in almost all cases of sodomy where two persons are involved, is not a fact that must be charged or proved to sustain a con viction of sodomy in any case. Therefore, indecent exposure is not a lesser offense included in the offense of sodomy. Ashby v. Commonwealth, 208 Va. 443, 158 S.E.2d 657, 1968 Va. LEXIS 130 (1968).

CASE NOTES Upon conviction of lessor offense, higher offense no longer available.  Under this section a person indicted for rape may be found not guilty of rape, but of an attempt to commit rape, but a verdict of guilty of an attempt to commit r ape is an acquittal of the offense of rape, and if such verdict be set aside, the accused cannot on a second trial, be convicted of rape, as this is a higher offense barred by § 19.2-285. Cates v. Commonwealth, 111 Va. 837, 69 S.E. 520, 1910 Va. LEXIS 84 (1910). Conviction of at tempt is acquittal of main offense.  The result of a verdict which finds the accused guilty of an attempt to produce an abortion is to acquit him of the principal offense of abortion or miscarriage u nder § 18.2-71. Anderson v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 665, 58 S.E.2d 72, 1950 Va. LEXIS 159 (1950). Accessory after the fact.  Before a defendant can be tried and convicted of being an accessory after the fact, he must be charged with that offense. Therefore, unless such a charge is speci fically made, neither the state nor an accused is entitled to an accessory-after-the-fact instruction. Commonwealth v. Dalton, 259 Va. 249, 524 S.E.2d 860, 2000 Va. LEXIS 5 (2000). In deleting the modifier, after the fact, the General Assembly indicated its intention to eliminate accessories after the fact from the application of thi s section. Commonwealth v. Dalton, 259 Va. 249, 524 S.E.2d 860, 2000 Va. LEXIS 5 (2000). Accessory before the fact instructio n.  Trial court did not err in submitting a murder charge to the jury based on the theory that defendant was an accessory before the fact or co-conspirator in the commission of the charged murder; the Commonwealth is entitled to an accessory before the fact instruction on a felony indictment even when the defendant is not charged in the indictment with being an accessory before the fact to the felony. Schwart z v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 407, 611 S.E.2d 631, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 156 (2005). Indictment chargin g crime also embraces attempt.  Indictment charging that petitioner feloniously did enter the storehouse, etc., although charging the consummated crime of storebreaking, also embraced th e lesser offense of attempting to enter without breaking or attempting to break and enter. Willoughby v. Smyth, 194 Va. 267, 72 S.E.2d 636, 1952 Va. LEXIS 228 (1952). Refusal of accessory after the fact instruction appropriate.  Defendants convictions for first-degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony were appropriate because her argument that the trial court e rred in refusing to allow her to proceed on the theory that she was an accessory after the fact and refusing an instruction that would have permitted the jury to make that finding was without merit under § 19.2-286 and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:17(c). Before a defendant could be tried and convicted of being an accessory after the fact, she must have been charged with that offense; unless such a charge was specifically made, neither the Commonwealth nor an accused was entitled to an accessory-after-the-fact instruction and accessory after the fact was not a lesser included offense of murder.

LEXIS 182 (1976). Failure of verdict to specify degree of crime erroneous.  Where a person is tried upon an indictment for murder the verdict should specify the degree of the crime of which he is convicted. If it does not so specify, it i s erroneous. Commonwealth v. Williamson, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 211 (1820); Briggs v. Commonwealth, 82 Va. 554, 1886 Va. LEXIS 74 (1886). But verdict valid if punishment indicates degree.  A verdict which does not expressly find the degree may nevertheless be valid if the assessment of punishment clearly indicates such degree. Hobson v. Youell, 177 Va. 906, 15 S.E.2d 76, 1941 Va. LEXIS 272 (1941). Upon a plea of guilty, the court cannot submit the degree of guilt and the question of punishment to a jury for its determination. Upon a plea of guilty to the whole indictment, the court has no authority to submit the degree of guilt and the question of the punishment to be inflicted upon the accused to a jury for its determination. The accused and the public are both entitled to the independent judgment of the court upon the degree of his guilt and the punishment to be inflicted uninfluenced by the judgment or advice of the jury or other bystanders.

Fixing punishment by agree ment permissible.  The practice, developed in a number of trial courts, whereby upon the arraignment of the accused and his plea of guilty, one of the attorneys, in the presence of the other, states to the court the essential facts constituting the crime charged and the punishment agreed upon, whereupon the court accepts such recommendation and, without examining the witnesses, fixes the punishment accordingly, is permissible under this section but such practice may be abused and should not be extended.

Indictments, Informations and Presentments, § 55; 19 M.J. Verdict, § 13. CASE NOTES When judgment not affected by bad co unt.  In a prosecution for violation of a city ordinance no demurrer to the warrant, which contained two counts, was interposed and no motion was made to instruct the j ury to disregard the first count. There was a general verdict of guilty, which might well have been found under the second count. Under this section, even if the first count was bad, the regularity of the judgment was not affected thereby. Collins v. Cit y of Radford, 134 Va. 518, 113 S.E. 735, 1922 Va. LEXIS 174 (1922). Since each of the four judgments of conviction against defendant were supported by sufficient evidence to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial co urt did not err in denying defendants motion to strike the charges against him on which he was convicted. Payne v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 616 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 2, 2003). A motion to exclude evidence which could only be applicable to the faulty count, is in effect a motion to disregard that count. Rand v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 738, 1852 Va.

CASE NOTES Section does not apply when warrants were quashed because void.  This section, providing immunity against a second trial for the same offense, speaks only of cases in which there has first been an acquittal by the jury upon the facts and merits. It does not in terms at least, apply to a case, where no jury was sworn, but the warrant of a justice of the peace was quashed and dismissed on the ground that the statute under which it was issued was unconstitutional and void . Commonwealth v. Perrow, 124 Va. 805, 97 S.E. 820, 1919 Va. LEXIS 167 (1919). Nor when indictment wa s dismissed for variance.  When defendant was acquitted on the first trial because of a variance between the indictment and the proof, this acquittal could not be pleaded in bar to a second trial on the same crime. Burress v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 934, 1876 Va. LEXIS 84 (1876), overruled, Keister's Ex'rs v. Philips' Ex'x, 124 Va. 585, 98 S.E. 674, 1919 Va. LEXIS 150 (1919). Nor when quashed for racial discrimination in selection of grand jury.  Where former indictments against defendant were quashed on his motion because of racial discrimination in the selection of the grand jury, and a jury verdict on o ne of them was set aside and annulled, and subsequently another grand jury returned indictments against defendant substantially identical with the former ones, pleas of autrefois acquit would not lie to the new indictments, for defendant was not in jeopa rdy under the invalid indictments. Mealy v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 216, 68 S.E.2d 507, 1952 Va. LEXIS 127 (1952). Acquittal on defective indictment.  This section was intended to apply when a person had been brought to trial under a defective indictment upon the facts and merits, and acquitted. He may then plea d such acquittal in bar of a second prosecution for the same offense, notwithstanding the defective indictment. Burress v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 934, 1876 Va.

Voluntary de novo appeal did not constitute new trial.  Appellate court did not reach defendants issue of whether two charges constituted the same offense, under § 19.2-292, because the charges at issue were brought as a part of a single prosecution, and it was well settled that an appeal de novo from a general district court to a circuit court annulled the former judgment as completely as if no trial had ever occurred; thus, defendants argument tha t her voluntary appeal, after her conviction for a misbranding charge in district court, constituted a new trial, was without merit. McClellan v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 759, 576 S.E.2d 785, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 95 (2003). Former trial by court or jury may constitute jeopardy.  The spirit and purpose of the immunity intended to be secured by the doctrine of double jeopardy is violated whenever a defendant in any criminal case has been fo rmerly tried by competent authority  whether court or jury  and discharged upon a defense constituting a bar to the proceeding, whether that defense is rested upon the law or the facts.

CASE NOTES Discharge of jury after excluding states evidence does not bar subsequent prosecution.  The court discharged the jury after sustaining motion of the defendant to exclude the Commonwealths evidence on the ground of variance. The discharge of the j ury on such ground did not bar a subsequent prosecution. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 866 (1879). Nor does verdict set aside for varia nce.  A second indictment being for the same act of embezzling as the first, and the prisoner having been indicted, tried and convicted in time, and the verdict set asi de for variance between allegation and proof as to ownership of the property, the second indictment was proper and in time, and the prisoner is not entitled to be discharged. Commonwealth v. Adcock, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 661, 1851 Va. LEXIS 78 (1851) (see al so Robinson v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 866 (1879)). Section 19.2-243 is to be read as a proviso to this section, so as to authorize the tria l and conviction of a party upon a new indictment or proper accusation who has been acquitted on the ground of variance, or upon an exception to the form or substance of the indictment, only if this new indictment is found and the trial had within three terms after the prisoner was first held for trial. Commonwealth v. Adcock, 49 Va. (8 Gratt.) 661, 1851 Va. LEXIS 78 (1851). When dis charge upon demurrer bars further prosecution.  Where defendant was indicted and charged with the commission of the crime of bigamy and with counselling, aiding and abetting and assisting in the commission of t he crime of bigamy, and a demurrer to that indictment was sustained on the ground that as a matter of law an unmarried man was not included within the language of the statute defining bigamy and could not be an accessory to the crime, and it was ordered that the defendant be discharged from said indictment and may go thereof without day, the order discharging defendant without day was an ultimate decision upon a question of law, and when defendant was arraigned upon a second indictment c harging him with aiding and abetting in the commission of the crime of bigamy the trial court erred in sustaining a demurrer to a plea of autrefois acquit to the second indictment. Adkins v. Commonwealth, 175 Va. 590, 9 S.E.2d 349, 1940 Va. LEXIS 204 (19 40). Sufficiency of evidence argument considered.  Court of appeals addressed defendants argument that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions even though his convictions were reversed due to a fatal variance between the indictments and the proof offered at trial because if successful, it could impose a double jeopardy bar to reprosecution under properly worded indictments. Purvy v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. App. 260, 717 S.E.2d 847, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 389 (2011). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Prior dismissal did not bar retrial.  Where a dismissal in a prior case in a circuit court was entered before a jury was empaneled and before an arraignment, and was not intended to have been with pre judice or amounting to an acquittal, double jeopardy did not bar retrial of the same charges in a city court.

Applicability.  This section is implicated only when both convictions are for violations of a statute or a local ordinance or a combination of such; as such, the statute does not apply if one of the charges is a common-law offense. Morris v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 181, 609 S.E.2d 92, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 79 (2005). For a case discussing the history of this section and § 19.2-294.1 and the cases inte rpreting those sections, see Lash v. County of Henrico, 13 Va. App. 251, 410 S.E.2d 689, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1136, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (1991), overruled, Hall v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 892, 421 S.E.2d 455, 9 Va. Law Rep. 54, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (19 92). The purpose of this section is to remove the hardship manifest in Arrington v. Commonwea lth, 87 Va. 96, 12 S.E. 224 (1890), in which a prisoner had committed but a single act, but inasmuch as it violated two statutes, he was convicted under both. Owens v. Commonwealth, 129 Va. 757, 105 S.E. 531, 1921 Va. LEXIS 132 (1921). Preventive effect.  Although the language of this section does not state that it provides a defense of former jeopardy, it amounts to such a defense in purpose and desired effect. Li ke the Fifth Amendment bar of former jeopardy, this section prevents the Commonwealth from subjecting an accused to the hazards of vexatious, multiple prosecutions. Phillips v. Commonwealth, 257 Va. 548, 514 S.E.2d 340, 1999 Va. LEXIS 53 (1999). This section is applicable only to criminal proceedings. It does not apply to a proceedi ng under § 18.2-336 [see now § 19.2-386.30] to forfeit property used in connection with a lottery, for that is a civil case. Quidley v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 1029, 59 S.E.2d 52, 1950 Va. LEXIS 191 (1950). This section applies only to multiple or successive prosecutions.  The plain language of this statute bespeaks a legislative intent that it applies only to multiple or successive prosecutions. Hall v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 89 2, 421 S.E.2d 455, 9 Va. Law Rep. 54, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (1992). When defendant was charged with multiple arson counts, § 19.2-294 did not bar his convictions of those counts, because that statute only barred multiple or suc cessive prosecutions, and defendant was tried in a single, simultaneous, prosecution for all the offenses alleged. Schwartz v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 61, 581 S.E.2d 891, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 339 (2003), aff'd, 267 Va. 751, 594 S.E.2d 925, 2004 Va. LEXI S 72 (2004). This section does not apply to simultaneous prosecutions. Slater v. Commonwealth, 15 Va. App. 593, 425 S.E.2d 816, 9 Va. Law Rep. 793, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 8 (1993). Simultaneous prose cutions not barred.  This section does not bar multiple convictions arising out of the same act if they are prosecuted simultaneously. Thus where warrants for involuntary manslaughter and driving while under the influence of alcohol were issued at the same time, although the charges were heard at different times in different courts, because the charges were initiated simultaneously, the proceedings were concurrent, not successive, an d thus, both convictions were permitted under this section. Doss v. Commonwealth, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 425 (Va. Ct. App. May 9, 1995). Defendants convictions in the circuit court for cruelty to animals in violation of § 3.1-796.122, after defendant had already been convicted in district co urt for failure to provide care for the same animals under § 3.1-796.68, did not violate § 19.2-294 because the cruelty convictions occurred as part of the same prosecution as her convictions for failure to provide care, and § 19.2-294 did not a pply to simultaneous prosecutions. Hillman v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 195 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 2, 2002). Evidence that defendant used his finger to rub his 12-year-old stepdaughters genitalia and also touched his stepdaughters breasts was sufficient to sustai n his convictions for animate object sexual penetration and aggravated sexual battery, and nothing in § 19.2-294 barred defendants convictions for both crimes in a single, simultaneous prosecution. Fincham v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (Va. Ct. App. June 8, 2004). Trial court did not err in failing to dismiss indictments for robbery and possession of a firearm after a felony conviction on double jeopardy grounds, as the pro secutions against defendant were simultaneous, not successive, because they were joined in a single evidentiary hearing in the general district court; thus, upon an adjudication on misdemeanor charges, the later events in the circuit court on the felony charges were merely a continuation of the same prosecution. Morris v. Commonwealth, 45 Va. App. 181, 609 S.E.2d 92, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 79 (2005). Simultaneous initiation of charges is not exclusive measure of whether convictions arise from a single prosecution; rather, the more significant and compelling factor is whether the offenses were prosecuted in a single, concurrent evidentiary hearing. Phillips v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. App. 674, 500 S.E.2d 848, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 373 (1998), aff'd, 257 Va. 548, 514 S.E.2d 340, 1999 Va. LEXIS 53 (1999). Multiple convictions arising from same act not necessarily precluded.  This section does not preclude multiple convictions arising from the same act, provided the related offenses are prosecuted simultaneously. Hairston v. Commonweal th, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 814 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 31, 1996). Where felony and misdemeanor charges are instituted at separate times, but are heard sim ultaneously in a single proceeding, they are part of a single prosecution, even though jurisdictional limitations necessitate that they be concluded in different courts. Phillips v. Commonwealth, 27 Va. App. 674, 500 S.E.2d 848, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 373 ( 1998), aff'd, 257 Va. 548, 514 S.E.2d 340, 1999 Va. LEXIS 53 (1999). Conspiracy test.  The court has adopted the totality of the circumstances test established by the Fourth Circuit in United States v. MacDougall, 790 F.2d 1135 (4th Cir. 198 6), to determine whether the evidence proves a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies. Bolton v. Commonwealth, 19 Va. App. 376, 451 S.E.2d 687, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 721 (1994). The MacDougall test examines five criteria: (1) the time periods of the alleged conspiracy(ies); (2) the places where the alleged activities occurred; (3) the peo ple involved; (4) the overt acts alleged; and (5) the substantive statutes involved. Bolton v. Commonwealth, 19 Va. App. 376, 451 S.E.2d 687, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 721 (1994). Multiple convictions for same act in same trial.  This section does not bar multiple convictions for the same act when those convictions are obtained in a single trial; however, multiple convictions and p unishments for the same act may be precluded by the double jeopardy clause, even though obtained in a single trial. Hall v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 892, 421 S.E.2d 455, 9 Va. Law Rep. 54, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (1992). This section does not bar multiple convictions for separate crimes arising out of the same act when those convictions are obtained in a single trial.

Within the limits prescribed by law, the court shall ascertain the term of confinement in the state correctional facility or in jail and the amount of fine, if any, when a person is convicted of a criminal offense, unless the accused is tried by a jury and has requ ested that the jury ascertain punishment. Such request for a jury to ascertain punishment shall be filed as a written pleading with the court at least 30 days prior to trial. B. When the ac cused is tried by a jury, deliberations of the jury shall be confined to a determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused, except that when the ascertainment of punishment by the jury has been requested by the accused, a proceeding in accordance with § 19.2-295.1 shall apply. C. In any case in which a jury has fixed a sentence as provided in this chapter and the sentence is modified by the court pursuant to the authority contained within this chapter, the court shall file with the record of the case a written explanation of such modificati on including the cause therefor. History History. Code 1950, §§ 19.1-291, 19.1-292; 1960, c. 366; 1975, c. 49 5; 2007, c. 259; 2020, Sp. Sess. I, c. 43. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2020 Sp. Sess. I, c. 43, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall become effective on July 1, 2021. At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the phrase or when the accused is found guilty of capital murder, the provisions of Article 4.1 (§ 19.2-2 64.2 et seq.) of Chapter 15 shall apply was deleted at the end of subsection B pursuant to Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 344, 345, which repealed Article 4.1 (§ 19.2-264.2 et seq.) of Chapter 15. The 2007 amendments. The 2007 amendment by c. 259 designated the provisions of the section as subsection A and added subsection B. The 2020 Sp. Sess. I amendments. The 2020 amendment by Sp. Sess. I, c. 43, effective July 1, 2021, rewrote subsection A, which read: Within the limits prescribed by law, the term of confineme nt in the state correctional facility or in jail and the amount of fine, if any, of a person convicted of a criminal offense, shall be ascertained by the jury, or by the court in cases tried without a jury; added subsection B; and redesignated former subsection B as subsection C.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Virginias method of sentencing in a jury trial under this section and former § 53-272 (now §§ 53.1-151 and 53.1-186) does not violate due process. R oman v. Parrish, 328 F. Supp. 882, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12559 (E.D. Va. 1971). Defendants Sixth Amendment rights were not violated in a case where defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, a jury recommended a three-year prison sentence pursuant to § 19.2-295, and the trial court imposed a three-year period of postrelease supervision; the postrelease supervision portion of defendants sentence was imposed pursuant to statutory law, was within that statutes permissible range, and did not require the trial court to find any additional facts that were not implicit in the jurys finding of guilt. Alston v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 759, 652 S.E.2d 456, 2007 Va. LEXIS 133 (2007). The right to have the jury both try the issue of guilt and fix the penalty is a part of the right of trial by jury. Huggins v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 327, 191 S.E.2d 734, 1972 Va. LEXIS 356 (1972). Statutory right to jury trial as to punishment.  Court of Appeals of Virginia concludes that, upon the election of trial by jury, a defendant has a statutory right, pursuant to §§ 19.2-295 and 19.2-295.1, and subject to limitations and qualifications established by the legislature, to have his punishment ascertained by a jury. Webb v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 371, 768 S.E.2d 696, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 54 (2015). Due process clause not contrary to conclusion that jury sentencing preferable. Nothing i n the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment intrudes upon the conclusion of this state that jury sentencing is preferable, whether in a unitary or bifurcated trial. Vines v. Muncy, 553 F.2d 342, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 14103 (4th Cir.), cert. denie d, 434 U.S. 851, 98 S. Ct. 163, 54 L. Ed. 2d 120, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 3161 (1977). No due process right to be sen tenced by jury.  Nothing in the United States or Virginia Constitution gives a defendant the right to be sentenced by a jury or solely by a jury and the imposition of postrelease periods of suspended incarceration and supervision pursuant to § 19.2-295.2 does not violate any due process right of a defendant to be sentenced by a jury under this section. Boyd v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 537, 507 S.E.2d 107, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 612 (1998). The choice of sentencing procedures is a matter of legislative determination. Duncan v. C ommonwealth, 2 Va. App. 342, 343 S.E.2d 392, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 278 (1986). Right granted adults to have their sentences fixed by juries is purely statutory in both origin and nature. Ballard v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 213, 321 S.E.2d 284, 1984 Va. LEXIS 192 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1085, 105 S. Ct. 1848, 85 L. Ed. 2d 146, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 1594 (1985). Juveniles not denied equal protection by different sentencing procedure.  Juveniles are not deprived of equal protection by the Virginia procedure in criminal cases, whereby an adult tried by jury has his sentence fixed by the jury unde r this section, while a juvenile transferred to circuit court and tried by jury has his sentence fixed by the judge under § 16.1-272. Ballard v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 213, 321 S.E.2d 284, 1984 Va. LEXIS 192 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1085, 105 S. Ct. 1848, 85 L. Ed. 2d 146, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 1594 (1985). Rational basis exists for different sentencing procedure for juveniles.  A rational basis does exist for the classification under which sentences of adults are fixed by juries but sentences of juveniles transferred to the circuit court are fixed by the judge. While, for the purpose of determining guilt or innocence, a transferred juvenile is treated as an adult, and although he may be subject to adult penalties in the sentencing phase of his case, § 16.1-272 permits a circuit court to treat him in all respects as a juvenile, with the full panoply of beneficent alternatives available in juvenile court, including the use of a juvenile probation officer. Ballard v. Commonwealth, 228 Va. 213, 321 S.E.2d 284, 1984 Va. LEXIS 192 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1085, 105 S. Ct. 1848, 85 L. Ed. 2d 146, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 1594 (1985). Criminal defendant entitled to decision on sentence by jury and by trial judge.  Under the practice in this state, the convicted criminal defendant is entitled to two decisions on the sentence, one by the jury and the other by the tria l judge in the exercise of his statutory right to suspend. Vines v. Muncy, 553 F.2d 342, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 14103 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 851, 98 S. Ct. 163, 54 L. Ed. 2d 120, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 3161 (1977). His ultimate sentence does not therefore rest with the jury alone but is always subject to the control of the trial judge. Vines v. Muncy, 553 F.2d 342, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 14103 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 851, 98 S. Ct. 163, 54 L. Ed. 2d 120, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 3161 (1977). Under the practice in this state, the punishment as fixed by the jury is not final or absolute, since its finding on the proper punishment is subject to suspensio n by the trial judge, in whole or in part, on the basis of any mitigating facts that the convicted defendant can marshal. Vines v. Muncy, 553 F.2d 342, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 14103 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 851, 98 S. Ct. 163, 54 L. Ed. 2d 120, 19 77 U.S. LEXIS 3161 (1977). Any criticism of jury sentencing because it lacks the objectivity and principled decision of a judge is overcome by the existence of the power in the trial judge to bring his so-called superior judgment to bear upon the issue of proper punishment in reaching his decision whether to suspend the sentence or not. Vines v. Muncy, 553 F.2d 342, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 14103 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 851, 98 S. C t. 163, 54 L. Ed. 2d 120, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 3161 (1977). The power to impose sentences in all misdemeanor and felony cases resides in the jury. Wi tcher v. Peyton, 382 F.2d 707, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 5197 (4th Cir. 1967). Consideration of mitigating circumstances is for the court.  By vesting the trial court with discretionary authority to suspend or modify the sentence imposed by the jury, the legislature intended to leave the consideration of mitigating circumstances to the court. Reese v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 316 (Va. Ct. App. July 6, 2004).

Criminal Procedure, §§ 33, 75. CASE NOTES Standard codified in this section.  In a post-sentence situation concerning withdrawal of a guilty plea entered after a plea agreement, judicial discretion is involved, and the applicable standard f or exercising this discretion was enunciated in former Rule 3A:25(d) and is codified in this section. Lilly v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 960, 243 S.E.2d 208, 1978 Va. LEXIS 253 (1978). Jurisdiction.  Trial court erred in ruling that it had no jurisdiction to consider defendants motion to withdraw his guilty plea where the motion was filed and argued before the 21-day period set forth in § 19.2-296 expired. Velazquez v. Commonwealth, 292 Va. 603, 791 S.E.2d 556, 2016 Va. LEXIS 168 (2016). Defendant filed a motion to withdraw defendants guilty plea and defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel after filing a notice of appeal, but wit hin twenty-one days from the date of the trial courts sentencing order. Therefore, remand for a hearing on defendants motions was necessary because the trial court erred in finding that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the motions to with draw the guilty plea and to withdraw as counsel. Smith v. Commonwealth, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 15, 2016). Whether or not accused should be allowed to withdraw plea of guilty for the purpose of s ubmitting a not guilty plea is a matter that rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and is to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case. Jones v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 503, 513 S.E.2d 431, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (1999). Motion to withdraw plea should be granted if it appears from the surrounding circumstanc es that the plea of guilty was submitted in good faith under an honest mistake of material fact or facts, or if it was induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence and would not otherwise have been made. Jones v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 503, 513 S.E.2 d 431, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (1999). A defendant has no absolute right to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contendere; rather, such privilege is permissive. Moreno v. Commonwealth, No. 1126-98-4 (Ct . of Appeals May 4, 1999). Least surprise or influence causing plea sufficient for withdrawal.  Generally, the withdrawal of a plea of guilty should not be denied in any case where it is in the least evident that the ends of justice will be subserved by perm itting not guilty to be pleaded in its place; the least surprise or influence causing a defendant to plead guilty when he has any defense at all should be sufficient grounds for permitting a change of plea from guilty to not guilty. Lynch v. Commonwealth , 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 275 (Va. Ct. App. May 22, 2001). Manifest injustice.  Trial court properly denied her motion to withdraw her guilty plea because defendants arrest warrant was for a felony, defendant was familiar with the system due to defendants prior convictions, and defendant understood the maximum punishment; therefore, pursuant to § 19.2-296, a manifest injustice did not occur. Milton v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 316 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 9, 2012). Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants post-sentencing motion to withdraw his guilty plea because there was no manifest injustice : he admitted committing the crime; he agreed with the Commonwealths proffer of facts; the trial court had found him competent; and it had subject matter jurisdiction over the case. Bryant v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 214 (Va. Ct. App. Ju ly 23, 2013). Defendant did not show a manifest injustice required that defendants postsentence motion to withdraw defendants guilty plea be granted, when defendant s criminal record was disclosed late, because defendant was not prejudiced, as: (1) defendant knew or should have known of the record; (2) defendant did not seek withdrawal before sentencing after knowing of the record, despite knowing the sentence defen dant could receive; and (3) defendant benefitted from the disposition of other charges by nolle prosequi. Young v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 15 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 21, 2014). Defendant did not show a manifest injustice required that defendants post-sentence motion to withdraw defendants guilty plea be granted, when defendant s criminal record was disclosed late, because the Commonwealth did not violate a discovery order by not disclosing the record earlier, since: (1) the Commonwealths Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7C:5 duty to disclose ended when defendant waived a preliminary he aring; (2) the Commonwealth had no sua sponte duty to provide the record; and (3) the Commonwealth did not know of the record until a probation officers presentence report, so the record was not known to a representative of the Commonwealth, before a preliminary hearing or waiver thereof. Young v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 15 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 21, 2014). On the merits, defendant failed to prove that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was necessary to correct manifest injustice where he admitted that his answer s during the plea colloquy were truthful, there was no assertion that the plea was involuntary or that any terms of a plea agreement were violated, and the trial court found that defendant understood the charges and voluntarily entered into the plea agre ement. Velazquez v. Commonwealth, 292 Va. 603, 791 S.E.2d 556, 2016 Va. LEXIS 168 (2016). Actual or potential adverse employment or housing consequences that flowed from defendants guilty plea to a petit larceny charge did not satisfy the manifest injustice standard and, therefore, did not provide a basis upon which to set aside her guilty plea. Brown v. Commonwealth, 297 Va. 295, 826 S.E.2d 883, 2019 Va. LEXIS 39 (2019). Because there was no manifest injustice, the trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to withdraw her guilty plea; the record supported the trial courts finding that a second agreement was intended as a sentencing recommendation because the trial court had already accepted a plea agreement, and defendants guilty plea. Belmonte v. Commonwealth, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 144 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 3, 2021). Defense to c harges not enough to set aside guilty plea.  Defense to the charges is not by itself sufficient to require a trial court to set aside a guilty plea because the guilty plea must also be entered inadvisedly; a ny number of circumstances might render a plea inadvised, including the fact that an attorney overlooked a viable defense or the defendant did not understand the nature of the charges. Pritchett v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 777, 739 S.E.2d 922, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 117 (2013). Defendant is allowed to withdraw his or her guilty plea in situations where the defendant would not have pled guilty but for some external circumstance such as co ercion, or poor or erroneous advice from counsel; a defendant who wishes to withdraw his or her guilty plea must do more than tender a defense. Pritchett v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 777, 739 S.E.2d 922, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 117 (2013). In resolving the question of whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion for withdrawal of a guilty plea after sentencing to correct some manifest injustice resulting from a plea agreement, not only what the trial court may have told, or failed to tell, the defendant before accepting his plea but also the events that occurred after acceptance of the plea and before sentencing must be considered. If, upon the whole record, it appears that the defendant, at any time before sentencing, was fairly warned or otherwise made aware that the court was not bound to follow the recommendation of the attorney for the Commonwealth, then the defendant is in no position to claim that his plea was rendered unknowing and involuntary, resulting in manifest injustice. Lilly v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 960, 243 S.E.2d 208, 1978 Va. LEXIS 253 (1978). In determining whether a trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty, an appellate court should consider not only what the trial court may have told, or failed to tell, the defendant before accepting his plea but also the events that occurred after acceptance of the plea and before sentencing. Underwood v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 224 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2000). Determining whether court erred in declining to allow withdrawal of a guilty plea requires an examination of the circumstances confronting the accused immediately prior to and at the time he or she pleaded to the charge. Jones v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 503, 513 S.E.2d 431, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (1999). Trial courts inquiry.  Trial courts inquiry should have been whether defendant proffered a valid defense recognized by the law, not the likely effectiveness of the defense. Hernande z v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 67, 793 S.E.2d 7, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 326 (2016). Reasonable defense.  Because defendant had not established a reasonable defense, the circuit court did ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-297"><akn:num>§ 19.2-297</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1994, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>706. § 19.2-297.1. Sentence of person twice previously convicted of certain violent felonies. Text A. Any person convicted of two or more separate acts of violence when such offenses were not part of a common act, transaction or scheme, and who has been at liberty as defined in § 53.1-151 between each conviction, shall, upon conviction of a third or subsequent a ct of violence, be sentenced to life imprisonment and shall not have all or any portion of the sentence suspended, provided it is admitted, or found by the jury or judge before whom he is tried, that he has been previously convicted of two or more such a cts of violence. For the purposes of this section, act of violence means (i) any one of the follo wing violations of Chapter 4 (§ 18.2-30 et seq.) of Title 18.2: a. First and second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter under Article 1 (§ 18.2-30 et seq.); b. Mob-related felonies under Article 2 (§ 18.2-38 et seq.); c.

Arson in violation of § 18.2-77 when the structure burned was occupied or a Class 3 felony violation of § 18.2-79. (ii) conspiracy to commit any of the violations enumerated in clause (i) of this section; and (iii) violations as a principal in the second degree or accessory before the fact of the pro visions enumerated in clause (i) of this section. B. Prior convi ctions shall include convictions under the laws of any state or of the United States for any offense substantially similar to those listed under act of violence if such offense would be a felony if committed in the Commonwealth.The Commonwealth s hall notify the defendant in writing, at least thirty days prior to trial, of its intention to seek punishment pursuant to this section. C. Any person sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to this section shall not be eligible for parole and shall not be eligible for any good conduct allowance or any earned sentence credits under Chapter 6 (§ 53.1-186 et seq.) of Title 53.1. However, any person su bject to the provisions of this section, other than a person who was sentenced under subsection A of § 18.2-67.5:3 for criminal sexual assault convictions specified in subdivision f, (i) who has reached the age of sixty-five or older and who has serve d at least five years of the sentence imposed or (ii) who has reached the age of sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the sentence imposed may petition the Parole Board for conditional release. The Parole Board shall promulgate regulat ions to implement the provisions of this subsection. History History. 1994, cc. 828, 860, 862, 881; 1994, 2nd Sp.

CASE NOTES Introduction of recidivism evidence.  This section did not forbid recidivism evidence from being presented in the guilt phase of a jury trial, and neither the jury bifurcation statute, § 19.2-295.1 , nor Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:17.1 were inconsistent with this interpretation; recidivism evidence was properly admitted in a prosecution for malicious wounding after having been twice convicted of a violent felony. Washington v. Commonwealth, 46 Va. App. 276, 616 S.E.2d 774, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 320 (2005), aff'd, 272 Va. 449, 634 S.E.2d 310, 2006 Va. LEXIS 73 (2006). Introducti on of prior convictions during guilt phase.  Trial judge erred in admitting defendants two prior robbery convictions during the guilt phase of the trial because the felony convictions, which had to be pr oved to invoke § 19.2-297.1, were not elements of the malicious wounding offense proscribed by § 18.2-51; this section unambiguously related to the punishment to be imposed upon conviction. Washington v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 157, 604 S.E.2d 92 , 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 503 (2004). Proof of a defendants prior predicate convictions is admissible during the guilt phase of the trial. This reading comports with the plain language of § 19. 2-295.1 and gives full meaning, force and effect to §§ 19.2-295.1 and 19.2-297.1.Washington v. Commonwealth, 272 Va. 449, 634 S.E.2d 310, 2006 Va. LEXIS 73 (2006). Conviction of non-offense.  Court of appeals applied the ends of justice exception to defendants conviction for participating in a criminal street gang predicate act of violence because defendant was convicted of a non-offense; because defendant was not convicted of a crime that was a predicate criminal act, he was convicted of a crime that did not exist. Smith v. Virginia, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (Va. Ct. App. May 14, 2019). To meet its burden of proof, the Commonwealth needed to show that defendant had been before sentenced in the United States; accordingly, the trial court correctly admitted into evidence copies of orders showing defendants prior sentences so that the Commonwealth could prove its case in chief. Person v. Commonwealth, No. 1989- 92-2 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 12, 1994) (decided under former § 19.2-297). Robbery offenses not subst antially similar.  Based on a comparison of the elements of the crimes of robbery in Maryland and Virginia, an appellant may be convicted in Maryland of behavior that would not have been a crime in Virginia, which compels the conclusion that the offenses are not substantially similar for purposes of § 19.2-297.1 as in Maryland, in cases not involving capital or felony murder, a defendant can be convicted of an afterthought robbe ry, but Virginias appellate courts have expressly rejected the notion of robbery as an afterthought crime in the non-capital murder context. Dean v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 209, 734 S.E.2d 673, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 394 (2012). Assault with intent to maim.  Defendants conviction of assault with intent to maim under former Md. Ann. Code art. 27, § 386 substantially conformed to § 18.2-51 and could be used un der subsection B of § 19.2-297.1 to establish a violent felony under § 17.1-805 to support defendants conviction of possession of a firearm after being convicted of a violent felony under subsection A of § 18.2-308.2 as defendant was specifi cally convicted of an intent to maim, which was proscribed by § 18.2-51. Dillsworth v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 93, 741 S.E.2d 818, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (2013). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS The presumption against bail for a murder charge applied in a bail determination under § 19.2-406.  The burden on the Commonwealth to show good cause why bail should not have been reduced or defendant released on his own recognizance during the Commonwealths pretrial appeal did not eliminate the presumption against bail for defendants murder charge.

Pending prono uncement, the court may commit the accused to jail or may continue or alter the bail except that in those cases where the accused is convicted of a murder in the first degree, the court shall commit him to jail and he shall not be allowed bail pending th e pronouncement of sentence. Before pronouncing the sentence, the court shall inquire of the accused if he desires to make a statement and if he desires to advance any reason why judgment should not be pronounced against him. Whenever any person willfully and knowingly fails to surrender or submit to the custody of a sheriff as ordered by a court, any law-enforcement officer, with or without a warrant, may arrest such person anywhere in the Commonwealth. If the arrest is made in the county or city in which the person was ordered to surrender, or in an adjoining county or city, the officer may forthwith return the accused before the proper c ourt. If the arrest is made beyond the foregoing limits, the officer shall proceed according to the provisions of § 19.2-76, and if such arrest is made without a warrant, the officer shall procure a warrant from the magistrate serving the county or ci ty wherein the arrest was made, charging the accused with contempt of court. After the pronouncement of sentence, if the court is aware that the defendant is registered, certified, or licensed by a health regulatory board or holds a multistate l icensure privilege, or is licensed by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services in accordance with § 37.2-404, and the defendant has been convicted of a felony, crime involving moral turpitude, or crime that occurred during the co urse of practice for which such practitioner or person is licensed, the court shall order the clerk of the court to transmit certified copies of sentencing documents to the Director of the Department of Health Professions or to the Commissioner of Behavi oral Health and Developmental Services. Such certified copies of sentencing documents shall be transmitted within 30 days after the sentencing hearing. History History. 1975, c. 495; 1976, c. 285; 2009, c. 192; 2022, c. 339.

CASE NOTES Allocution and closi ng argument distinguished.  Allocution is the defendants right to speak on his own behalf after the fact finder determines guilt but before the judge pronounces sentence. The defendant s closing argument is not allocution, but is his opportunity to present arguments in mitigation before the fact finder deliberates. Bassett v. Commonwealth, 222 Va. 844, 284 S.E.2d 844, 1981 Va. LEXIS 382 (1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 938, 102 S. Ct . 1996, 72 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1982); 499 U.S. 983, 111 S. Ct. 1639, 113 L. Ed. 2d 734 (1991). The right of allocution is not constitutionally required. Stamper v. Baskerville, 531 F. Supp. 1122, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10781 (E.D. Va. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1225, 103 S. Ct. 1231, 75 L. Ed. 2d 466, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 3614 (1983). Court rejected petitioners claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial due to his counsels failure to raise the issue that the t rial court violated his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as under § 19.2-298 when it failed to allow petitioner to allocute before he was sentenced because there is no constitutional right to an allocution before senten cing. The record demonstrated that petitioner was prone to making statements detrimental to his case and he did not allege what he would have said if he had been given the opportunity to address the court or how such a statement would have impacted the s entence he received. Powell v. Warden of the Sussex I State Prison, 2005 Va. LEXIS 106 (Va. Nov. 8, 2005), dismissed, 272 Va. 217, 634 S.E.2d 289, 2006 Va. LEXIS 85 (2006). Denial of due process to refuse defendants request to speak.  When a defendant effectively communicates his desire to the trial judge to speak prior to the imposition of sentence, it is a denial of due process not to grant d efendants request. Stamper v. Baskerville, 531 F. Supp. 1122, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10781 (E.D. Va. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1225, 103 S. Ct. 1231, 75 L. Ed. 2d 466, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 3614 (1983). Sentence in absentia.  Trial court erred in imposing a jail sentence in absentia. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 183 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 1, 2003). Effect of acceptance of plea agreeme nt.  Acceptance of defendants plea agreement, which provided that the trial court would impose sentence on two counts of aggravated sexual battery and would withho ld decision on the other two counts, did not divest the trial court of its jurisdiction to adjudicate the charges. Holden v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 403, 494 S.E.2d 892, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (1998). No clear error shown.  At habeas corpus hearing, where the record showed that the defendant, who was represented at trial by experienced criminal lawyers, did not inform the trial judge of his desire to address the court before sentencing and the judge failed to inform him of his right to speak under this section, but counsel was well aware of the omission at trial and chose to forbear objecting for tactical reasons, there was no c lear error. Stamper v. Baskerville, 531 F. Supp. 1122, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10781 (E.D. Va. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1225, 103 S. Ct. 1231, 75 L. Ed. 2d 466, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 3614 (1983). Harmless error.  Trial courts failure to afford defendant a right of allocution under § 19.2-298 was harmless error as defendants refusal to proffer an allocution state ment deprived the trial court of an opportunity to correct its mistake, and precluded the appellate court from determining whether defendant received a fair trial and substantial justice. Montgomery v. Commonwealth, 56 Va. App. 695, 696 S.E.2d 261, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 324 (2010). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Defendants presence at sentencing required.  Court denied defendants request to be absent from his own sentencing hearing in a capital murder case because, inter alia, in the same memorandum in which def endant sought to waive his presence, he also asked the court to impose less than the maximum sentence provided by law; the Commonwealth would be offering victim impact testimony at sentencing, and the presence of defendant was statutorily required as the victim, upon a motion of the attorney for the Commonwealth, was permitted to testify in the presence of the accused regarding the impact of the offense upon the victim; and allocution was a fundamental right, and a denial of defendants right to allo cution constituted error and undermined a sentence. Commonwealth v. Rams, 96 Va. Cir. 215, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 121 (Prince William County July 31, 2017). § 19.2-298.01. Use of discretionary sentencing guidelines. Text A. In all felo ny cases, other than Class 1 felonies, the court shall (i) have presented to it the appropriate discretionary sentencing guidelines worksheets and (ii) review and consider the suitability of the applicable discretionary sentencing guidelines established pursuant to Chapter 8 (§ 17.1-800 et seq.) of Title 17.1. Before imposing sentence, the court shall state for the record that such review and consideration have been accomplished and shall make the completed worksheets a part of the record of the case and open for inspection. In cases tried by a jury, the jury shall not be presented any information regarding sentencing guidelines. B. In any felo ny case, other than Class 1 felonies, in which the court imposes a sentence which is either greater or less than that indicated by the discretionary sentencing guidelines, the court shall file with the record of the case a written explanation of such dep arture. C. In felony c ases, other than Class 1 felonies, tried by a jury and in felony cases tried by the court without a jury upon a plea of not guilty, the court shall direct a probation officer of such court to prepare the discretionary sentencing guidelines worksheets. In felony cases tried upon a plea of guilty, including cases which are the subject of a plea agreement, the court shall direct a probation officer of such court to prepare the discretionary sentencing guidelines worksheets, or, with the concurrence of the accused, the court and the attorney for the Commonwealth, the worksheets shall be prepared by the attorney for the Commonwealth. D. Except as p rovided in subsection E, discretionary sentencing guidelines worksheets prepared pursuant to this section shall be subject to the same distribution as presentence investigation reports prepared pursuant to subsection A of § 19.2-299. E. Following t he entry of a final order of conviction and sentence in a felony case, the clerk of the circuit court in which the case was tried shall cause a copy of such order or orders, the original of the discretionary sentencing guidelines worksheets prepared in t he case, and a copy of any departure explanation prepared pursuant to subsection B ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-299"><akn:num>§ 19.2-299</akn:num><akn:heading>Investigations and reports by probation officers in certain cases</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Unless the defendant or the attorney for the Commonwealth objects, the court may order that the report contain no more than the defendants criminal history, any history of substance abuse, any physical or health-related problems as may be pertinent, including any diagnoses of an intellectual or developmental disability as defined in § 37.2-100, and any applicable sentencing guideline worksheets. This expedited report shall be subject to all the same procedures as all other sentencing reports and sentencing guidelines worksheets. The probation officer, after having furnished a copy of this report a t least five days prior to sentencing to counsel for the accused and the attorney for the Commonwealth for their permanent use, shall submit his report in advance of the sentencing hearing to the judge in chambers, who shall keep such report confidential . Counsel for the accused may provide the accused with a copy of the presentence report. The probation officer shall be available to testify from this report in open court in the presence of the accused, who shall have been provided with a copy of the pr esentence report by his counsel or advised of its contents and be given the right to cross-examine the investigating officer as to any matter contained therein and to present any additional facts bearing upon the matter. The report of the investigating o fficer shall at all times be kept confidential by each recipient, and shall be filed as a part of the record in the case. Any report so filed shall be made available only by court order and shall be sealed upon final order by the court, except that such reports or copies thereof shall be available at any time to any criminal justice agency, as defined in § 9.1-101, of this or any other state or of the United States; to any agency where the accused is referred for treatment by the court or by probatio n and parole services; and to counsel for any person who has been indicted jointly for the same felony as the person subject to the report. Subject to the limitations set forth in § 37.2-901, any report prepared pursuant to the provisions hereof shall without court order be made available to counsel for the person who is the subject of the report if that person (a) is charged with a felony subsequent to the time of the preparation of the report or (b) has been convicted of the crime or crimes for whi ch the report was prepared and is pursuing a post-conviction remedy. Such report shall be made available for review without a court order to incarcerated persons who are eligible for release by the Virginia Parole Board, or such persons counsel, purs uant to regulations promulgated by the Virginia Parole Board for that purpose. The presentence report shall be in a form prescribed by the Department of Corrections. In all cases where such report is not ordered, a simplified report shall be prepared on a form prescribed by the Department of Corrections. For the purposes of this subsection, information regarding the accuseds participation or membership in a criminal street gang may include the characteristics, specific rivalries, common practices, s ocial customs and behavior, terminology, and types of crimes that are likely to be committed by that criminal street gang. B.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Section 19.2-301 does not independently require trial courts to order a mental examination of a defendant prior to sentencing; instead, it simply provides that wh en the process of securing a mental examination of a defendant is initiated pursuant to this section, a judge shall thereafter order a mental examination in accordance with specific parameters and procedures. Cox v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. App. 339, 859 S.E .2d 690, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 106 (2021). A trial court is required to defer sentencing of a defendant only when one of the parties requests mental examination of the defendant, and § 19.2-301 does not even come into play unless one of the triggering conditions in this section is met. The court does not read § 19.2-301 to independently grant a defendant an absolute and unqualified right to a psychosexual evaluation and report prior to sentencing. C ox v. Commonwealth, 73 Va. App. 339, 859 S.E.2d 690, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 106 (2021). Sexual abnormality.  When dealing with sexually abnormal behavior, the Virginia legislature does not make a distinction between force and violence. Simerly v. Commonwe alth, 29 Va. App. 710, 514 S.E.2d 387, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 276 (1999). If the question to be answered is whether the defendants conduct indicates sexual abnormality, the answer should never rest upon the victims condu ct. The victims decision to avoid violence does not make the defendants conduct any less abnormal. Simerly v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 710, 514 S.E.2d 387, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 276 (1999). Defendant was convicted of an offense that indicates sexual abnormality where th e record was replete with evidence that defendant used force to commit rape. Because the defendants counsel requested that the court defer sentencing until he could be given a mental examination but the trial court refused, the case was reversed and remanded for resentencing after the receipt of the report of mental examination. Simerly v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 710, 514 S.E.2d 387, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 276 (1999). Mental evaluation not mandatory when imposing sentence for violation of probation.  Decision to order a mental examination under § 19.2-300 is not discretionary when a defendant who has been convicted of an offense indicating sexual abnormalit y requests such an evaluation prior to sentencing for that conviction; however, it is not mandatory before revoking a suspended sentence due to a probation violation, as the previously imposed sentence is merely being modified. Alsberry v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 314, 572 S.E.2d 522, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 721 (2002). Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to order a mental evaluation before imposing a sentence for defendants probation violation; defendant co uld have requested an evaluation when he was first sentenced, but he did not do so, and this request was made during the hearing on his fourth probation violation, more than six years after defendants abnormal behavior first came to light.

Text The judge shall order the defendant examined by at least one psychiatrist or clinical psychologist who is qualified by specialized training and experience to perform su ch evaluations. Upon a finding by the court that a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist is not reasonably available for the instant case, the court may appoint a state licensed clinical social worker who has been certified by the Commonwealth as a sex o ffender treatment provider as defined in § 54.1-3600 and qualified by experience and by specialized training approved by the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services to perform such evaluations. The examination shall be performed o n an outpatient basis at a mental health facility or in jail. However, if the court specifically finds that outpatient examination services are unavailable or if the results of outpatient examination indicate that hospitalization of the defendant for fur ther examination is necessary, the court may order the defendant sent to a hospital designated by the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services as appropriate for examination of persons convicted of crimes. The defendant shall then be hospitalized for such time as the director of the hospital deems necessary to perform an adequate examination, but not to exceed 30 days from the date of admission to the hospital. Upon completion of the examination, the examiners shall prepare a written report of their findings and conclusions and shall furnish copies of such report to the defendant, counsel for the defendant, and the attorney for the Commonwealth at least five days prior to sentencing and shall furnish a copy of the report to the judg e in advance of the sentencing hearing.

The court may fi x the period of probation for up to the statutory maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned. Any period of supervised probation shall not exceed five years from the release of the defendant from any acti ve period of incarceration. The limitation on the period of probation shall not apply to the extent that an additional period of probation is necessary (i) for the defendant to participate in a court-ordered program or (ii) if a defendant owes restitutio n and is still subject to restitution compliance review hearings in accordance with § 19.2-305.1.

In any case where fingerprints or fingerprint identification information has not been provided by a law-enforcement officer to the clerk of court, the j udge shall require that fingerprints and a photograph be taken by a law-enforcement officer as a condition of probation or of the suspension of the imposition or execution of any sentence for such offense. Such fingerprints shall be submitted to the Cent ral Criminal Records Exchange under the provisions of subsection D of § 19.2-390.

Because the trial court acted within its subject matter jurisdiction when it entered the order extending probation indefinitely until further order, defendant cou ld not collaterally attack that order as void ab initio; the order imposed a term of indefinite probation until further order by the court and thus specifically contemplated termination of probation by a subsequent court order. Cilwa v. Commonwea lth, 298 Va. 259, 836 S.E.2d 378, 2019 Va. LEXIS 153 (2019). Extending probation period.  No time limitation in either § 19.2-304 or § 19.2-306 implicates a courts subject matter jurisdiction to enter uncontested orders extending probation pe riods before or after their expiration; as a result, the parties are free to extend these deadlines, with the trial courts concurrence, even after their expiration. Cilwa v. Commonwealth, 298 Va. 259, 836 S.E.2d 378, 2019 Va. LEXIS 153 (2019). Effect of extending probation period.  An extension of the period of probation under this section has the effect of extending the time period during which revocation may occur under § 19.2-306. Cook v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 290, 176 S.E.2d 815, 1970 Va. LEXIS 249 (1970). Where defendants probation period had been extended under § 19.2-304, the trial court was entitled to revoke his suspended sentence, although the original period of suspension had expired, because, pursuant to subsection A of § 19.2-306, the trial court could revoke the suspension anytime during the probation period. Mohamed v. Commonwealth, 56 Va. App. 95, 691 S.E.2d 513, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 145 (2010) . Fundamental fairness requires a judicial hearing of a summary nature for the probation p eriod to be extended, since increasing the period of probation has the effect of extending the restraints on the probationers liberty which are normally incident to his probation and extends the time period during which revocation may occur. Cook v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 290, 176 S.E.2d 815, 1970 Va. LEXIS 249 (1970). Hearing required to extend probation.  Trial court erred in revoking defendants suspended sentence, because defendant had no notice of the request to extend probation and was not given opportunity to be heard on whether probation should have been extended. Thus, the extension was invalid and the cause of revocation occurred beyond the one-year probation period and beyond the two-year period of suspension. Dudash v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXI S 415 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2012). Although a probation officers decision to notify defendant verbally, a day before a hearing to extend defendants probation, that defendant needed to appea r before the court was not condoned, defendant did receive actual notice. Therefore, the defect in notice did not render the courts order void, as any defect in notice merely rendered the order voidable. Figueroa v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 114 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 7, 2015). Verbal notice the day before a hearing does not conform to the statutory requirements. Figueroa v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 114 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 7, 201 5). Reasonable notice.  Trial court properly revoked the remainder of defendants suspended sentence when she violated the terms of her probation because the General Assembly did not did not intend to impose the same notice and hearing requirements for abatement of probation when it enacted the notice statute, defendant was unable to show prejudice inasmuch as she acknowledged her release date when she signed the conditions of probat ion forms, and the trial court retained jurisdiction to revoke defendants suspended sentence at any time within five years of her conviction. Edwards v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 96 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2018). Suspension of probation upon event enhancing purpose of probation.  The trial court is given broad discretion to suspend sentences and fix the terms of probation. With this broad authority to fix the terms and conditions of probat ion, to increase or decrease the probation period, and to revoke or modify any condition of the probation, there is no reason or restriction that would preclude the trial court from suspending the probation upon the occurrence of events that enhance the purpose of probation. Sami v. Commonwealth, No. 0367-86-4 (Ct. of Appeals July 27, 1987). Invalid order.  Where defendant was not present when the order was entered extending his period of probation, and no notice was given to him of the action proposed to be taken by the court, and he was afforded no opportunity to be heard on whether his period of probation should be extended, the order was not a valid order. Cook v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 290, 176 S.E.2d 815, 1970 Va. LEXIS 249 (1970). There was no error in a trial court finding that a probationer violated the terms of probation and in the court revoking the probationers suspended sentence w hen the probationer violated special instructions which were imposed by the probation officer at the courts direction. Furthermore, the instructions which the probation officer imposed were reasonable and warranted enforcement and were tailored to a sex offender such as the probationer. Smith v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 316 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 12, 2017). Authority of court to modify condition of suspension.  Evidence supported the trial courts conclusion that a payment allotted to defendants wife from defendants military retirement benefit was a condition of defendants suspended sentences rather than a condition of probation and, thus, that the trial court correctly concluded it lacked authority under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1 to modify the condition pursuant to § 19.2-304. Reinke v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 357, 657 S.E.2d 805, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 111 (2008). Court could impose probation after probation expired because (1) probation was a condition of suspended sentences, and, on finding a violation, a court could revo ke and re-suspend any part of the sentence and impose new conditions, (2) a contrary interpretation led to the absurd result that a violation notice could be given after probation expired but another probation period could not be imposed as a condition f or re-suspending a revoked sentence, and (3) defendants continuance requests caused defendants revocation hearing to be held after the probationary period. Bost v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 200 (Va. Ct. App. July 24, 2018). Liberal construction of the statute favors giving a trial court the flexibility to consider and, if appropriate, to adopt an agreed-upon extension to a probation period if doing so would support the courts rehabilitation goals for the criminal and would uphold the courts equally important duty to protect the public from recidivist crime. Cilwa v. Commonwealth, 298 Va. 259, 836 S.E.2d 378, 2019 Va. LEXIS 1 53 (2019). Altering conditions of suspe nded sentence.  Court could remove a good behavior requirement as a probation condition but lacked jurisdiction to alter good behavior and related provisions imposed as condition s of the suspension of a sentence more than 21 days after entry of a sentencing order. McFarland v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 511, 574 S.E.2d 311, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 770 (2002). Trial courts order requiring defendant to pay restitution as a condition of his suspended sentence violated the rule because it improperly modified the origin al sentencing order; in the absence of a finding that defendant violated the original sentencing order, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter its sentencing order that added new terms and conditions to the suspended sentence almost three years aft er the trial courts final order. Majeski v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 289 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 13, 2015). Circuit court abused its discretion in revoking defendants previously suspended sentence on the ground that he violated the conditions of his probation becaus e defendants probation officer impermissibly imposed a probation condition that contradicted an express term of probation previously imposed by the circuit court; as the probation officer unilaterally imposed the condition without obtaining judicial approval or following procedure provided in the statute, the condition was ineffective. Massey v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 53 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2019). Revocation proper.  Trial court acted within its authority in revoking suspended sentences because defendant did not object on the ground that the period of suspension had expired, s ubject m...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-305"><akn:num>§ 19.2-305</akn:num><akn:heading>Requiring fines, costs, restitution for damages, support, or community services from probationer</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. While on pr obation the defendant may be required to pay in one or several sums a fine or costs, or both such fine and costs, imposed at the time of being placed on probation as a condition of such probation, and the failure of the defendant to pay such fine or cost s, or both such fine and costs, at the prescribed time or times may be deemed a breach of such probation. The provisions of this subsection shall also apply to any person ordered to pay costs pursuant to § 19.2-303.3. B. A defendant placed on probation following conviction may be required to make at least partial restitution or reparation to the aggrieved party or parties for damages or loss caused by the offense for which conviction was had, or may be required to provide for the s upport of his spouse or others for whose support he may be legally responsible, or may be required to perform community services. The defendant may submit a proposal to the court for making restitution, for providing for support, or for performing commun ity services. C. No defendan t shall be kept under supervised probation solely because of his failure to make full payment of fines, fees, or costs, provided that, following notice by the probation and parole officer to each court and attorney for the Commonwealth in whose jurisdict ion any fines, fees, or costs are owed by the defendant, no such court or attorney for the Commonwealth objects to his removal from supervised probation.

CASE NOTES Restitution pr ovisions applicable to probationer.  By its terms, the restitution portion of this statute comes into play when the defendant is on probation. This is the import of the words Such defendant. They refer to the first sentence where the defendant is described as one on probation. Baker v. Commonwealth, 230 Va. 252, 335 S.E.2d 276, 1985 Va. LEXIS 274 (1985). Payment of restitution.  Trial court erred in requiring defendant to pay, as a condition of his suspended sentence, restitution that included the cost of the installation of a security sy stem installed by the burglary victims after the burglary because, while related to defendants burglary, the installation of a security system was not caused by the offense, and the attenuation was too great. Howell v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 737, 652 S.E.2d 107, 2007 Va. LEXIS 121 (2007). Because defendants plea agreement to receiving or concealing stolen property in violation of § 18.2-108 specifically waived any right of appeal from the de cision of the trial court, not merely the conviction itself, the trial court did not err in ordering defendant to pay restitution pursuant to subsection B of § 19.2-305. Craig v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 1, 2011). Restit ution was limited to damages caused by the offense.  Under § 19.2-305(B) restitution was limited to damages caused by the offense; therefore, the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered defendant to pay restitution related to an indirect financial loss that occurred when a pipe burst inside a victims home while the victim was convalescing elsewhere. Maye v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 8, 2011). Trial court did not abuse its discretion, pursuant to § 19.2-303, subsection B of § 19.2-305, and subsection A of § 19.2-305.1, by the amount of a restit ution ordered because the finding by the trial court that the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services received no value from the services rendered to Medicaid-eligible clients by defendants employee, who actually had no tra ining to be a personal care aide, was not plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. Burriesci v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. App. 50, 717 S.E.2d 140, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 344 (2011). Because some costs were directly caused by defendants embezzlement, $76,224.45 of the restitution award was affirmed for the office expenses, insurance costs, the client and law suits legal fees, forensic accounting fees, the future anticipated costs for the forensic accountants testimony, and other costs not challenged by defendant. Tyler v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 218, 875 S.E.2d 119, 2022 Va. App . LEXIS 316 (2022). Restitution proper for damages caused by the offense.  Restitution award was proper, as it was for the medical expenses of an officer who was injured when chasing defendant and thus, was directly caused by defendant s criminal conduct of escaping from police custody. Shelton v. Commonwealth, 66 Va. App. 1, 781 S.E.2d 750, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 32 (2016). Amount of restitution.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering defendant to pay restitution in the amount necessary to replace the locks and cylinders on the first car, whi ch defendant took without authorization, and on the second car, and to reprogram the second cars computer because, by unlawfully taking the first car and its contents, including the victims purse containing the keys to the second car, defendant c ompromised the victims ability to protect her vehicles from unwanted intrusion as both sets of keys were missing when the first car was recovered; and requiring defendant to pay for changing the locks was not too remote or attenuated from the crime o f unauthorized use of a motor vehicle to establish an abuse of discretion. Fleisher v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 685, 822 S.E.2d 679, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 20 (2019). Amount owed on loan for property damaged or destroyed.  In a case in which defendant was convicted of attempted malicious wounding, the trial court did not err in imposing, as one of the conditions of defendants su spended sentence, that he was had to pay the victim $6,639.23 in restitution because, although defendant contended that it was error for the trial court to include in his restitution the $3,289.23 still owed by the victim on her car loan after the insura nce company had paid her full restitution, a trial court, in determining restitution, could include the amount still owed on a loan for property damaged or destroyed through defendants criminal acts. Baugh v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 287 (Va . Ct. App. Dec. 10, 2019). Payment of court costs.  Because defendant did not pay court costs during the original term of probation as required by a 1995 standing order that was incorporated into the sentencing ord er, defendant was still under the trial courts jurisdiction when it entered an order extending defendants probation and thereafter found defendant in violation of probation. Heiderscheidt v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 256 (Va. Ct. App. Jun e 9, 2009). Restitution order improper.  Trial court erred in ordering defendant to pay restitution, where there was no evidence that the money orders were negotiated prior to the stop placed on them and no evidence to establish the identity of the victim payee. Phillips v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 88 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2017). Circuit court erred in denying defendants motion for reconsideration because the trial court ordered him to pay $1,500 restitution to the victim for what was apparently taken from the victims home when defendant pleaded guilty to and was convicted of receiving stolen goods  a television, valued at $450  and an offense that presupposed he was not the thief. Ellis v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App . 706, 813 S.E.2d 16, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 125 (2018). Trial court erred by awarding $49,583.80 in restitution for the case fees, embezzlement expenses, and legal services fees, the Virginia State Bar (VSB) fees, and the anticipated future audit costs. Defendants conduct did not directly cause the VSB fees and anticipated future audit costs because the firm had an independent duty to monitor and reconcile its accounts and supervise defendant which sufficiently at tenuated the costs from her offense. Tyler v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. App. 218, 875 S.E.2d 119, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 316 (2022). Court-orde red child support as condition of probation.  Probation condition that defendant report to the Division of Child Support Enforcement and submit to an order of support for any child that was not in his custody was not improper in defendants conviction for driving after having been declared an habitual offender because subsection B of § 19.2-305 authorized such a condition. Martin v. Commonwealth, 274 Va. 733, 652 S.E.2d 109, 2007 Va. LEXIS 124 (2007). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Entry of judgment.  Where judgment was not entered and the restitution order was not docketed under the statute by order of the court or written request of the victim, criminal resti tution could not be ordered. Commonwealth v. Mehryar, 57 Va. Cir. 496, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 521 (Fairfax County Nov. 15, 2000). Restitution provisions.  Court was granted statutory authority to require a defendant who was placed on probation to pay restitution pursuant to § 19.2-303 and this section. Commonweal th v. Washington, 55 Va. Cir. 358, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 299 (Rockingham County June 29, 2001). Postrelease supervision did equate to probation for purposes of ordering restitution. Commonwealth v.

Subject to the provisions of § 19.2-306.2, in any case in which the court has suspended the execution or imposition of sentence, the court may revoke the suspension of sentence for any cause the court deems sufficient that occurred at any time within the probati on period, or within the period of suspension fixed by the court. If neither a probation period nor a period of suspension was fixed by the court, then the court may revoke the suspension for any cause the court deems sufficient that occurred within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned. B. The court m ay not conduct a hearing to revoke the suspension of sentence unless the court issues process to notify the accused or to compel his appearance before the court within 90 days of receiving notice of the alleged violation or within one year after the expi ration of the period of probation or the period of suspension, whichever is sooner, or, in the case of a failure to pay restitution, within three years after such expiration. If neither a probation period nor a period of suspension was fixed by the court , then the court shall issue process within six months after the expiration of the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be incarcerated. Such notice and service of process may be waived by the defendant, in which case the court may proceed to determine whether the defendant has violated the conditions of suspension. C. If the cour t, after hearing, finds good cause to believe that the defendant has violated the terms of suspension, then the court may revoke the suspension and impose a sentence in accordance with the provisions of § 19.2-306.1. The court may again suspend all or any part of this sentence for a period up to the statutory maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned, less any time already served, and may place the defendant upon terms and conditions or probation. Th e court shall measure the period of any suspension of sentence from the date of the entry of the original sentencing order. However, if a court finds that a defendant has absconded from the jurisdiction of the court, the court may extend the period of pr obation or suspended sentence for a period not to exceed the length of time that such defendant absconded. D. If any cour t has, after hearing, found no cause to impose a sentence that might have been originally imposed, or to revoke a suspended sentence or probation, then any further hearing to impose a sentence or revoke a suspended sentence or probation, based solely on the alleged violation for which the hearing was held, shall be barred. E. Nothing con tained herein shall be construed to deprive any person of his right to appeal in the manner provided by law to the circuit court having criminal jurisdiction from a judgment or order revoking any suspended sentence.

For any hearing c onducted pursuant to § 19.2-306, Code of Virginia, the circuit court shall have presented to it a sentencing revocation report prepared on a form designated by the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission indicating the condition or conditions of the suspended sentence, good behavior, or probation supervision that the defendant has allegedly violated. 2. For any hearing conducted pursuant to § 19.2-306 in which the defendant is cited for violation of a condition or conditions other than a new criminal o ffense conviction, the court shall also have presented to it the applicable probation violation guideline worksheets established pursuant to Chapter 1042 of the Acts of Assembly 2003. The court shall review and consider the suitability of the discretiona ry probation violation guidelines. Before imposing sentence, the court shall state for the record that such review and consideration have been accomplished and shall make the completed worksheets a part of the record of the case and open for inspection. In hearings in which the court imposes a sentence that is either greater or less than that indicated by the discretionary probation violation guidelines, the court shall file with the record of the case a written explanation of such departure. 3.

App. 600, 513 S.E.2d 885, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (1999 ). Probation, suspension, distinct concepts.  In drafting conviction orders, sentencing judges must be cognizant that probation and suspension of sentence are separate and distinct concepts and that they may be fixed at different intervals to accomplish different goals. Sentencing orders frequently fail to clarify whether a period of suspension of sentence and a period of probation are fixed for the same or different periods of time, particularly where sente ncing orders denominate probation as unsupervised. Sentencing judges who intend that a sentence shall be suspended for a fixed period, even where the period of suspension is to expire at the same time as the period of probation, should clearly st ate the respective period of suspension and period of probation in the sentencing order. Carbaugh v. Commonwealth, 19 Va. App. 119, 449 S.E.2d 264, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 623 (1994). The concepts are distinct but overlapping, in the sense that a sentence of confinement may be suspended without admitting the defendant to probation while a prere quisite to probation is that any sentence of confinement be first suspended. Collins v. Commonwealth, 269 Va. 141, 607 S.E.2d 719, 2005 Va. LEXIS 13 (2005). Suspension of execution of sentence includes release under appeal bond.  Appeal of a criminal conviction does not affect the finality of judgment, but only suspends the execution of the sentence. Therefore, the execution of defendant s sentence was suspended when he was released under his appeal bond and he was subject to the implicit condition of good behavior. Collins v. Commonwealth, 269 Va. 141, 607 S.E.2d 719, 2005 Va. LEXIS 13 (2005). When § 19.2-305.1 and this section are applied in conjunction, the requirement of § 19.2-305.1 D (now § 19.2-305.1 E) that only unreasonable failure to pay restitution shall result in revocation of a suspended sentence, restricts the scope of the courts authority under this section to revoke a suspension for any cause deemed by it sufficient.

If an accused is tried at one time for two or more offenses, the court may enter one judgment order respecting all such offenses. The final judgment order shall be entered on a form promulgated by the Supreme Court. History History. 1975, c. 495; 1996, c. 60. Annotations Research References. Virginia Forms (Matthew Bender). No. 9-2502. Sentencing OrderRequired Form. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 5B M.J. Criminal Procedure, §§ 70, 73. CASE NOTES Authentication of orders.  Nothing in this section required the Commonwealth to introduce a document that was signed by a judge who convicted defendant of rape to have that document conside red by the trial court that convicted defendant of robbery, and the court that convicted defendant of robbery did not err when it considered documents that were not signed by the judge but were properly authenticated by his clerk. Seaton v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 739, 595 S.E.2d 9, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 165 (2004). Admissibility of warrants.  Certified criminal warrants reflecting defendants misdemeanor convictions for assault of a family member were properly admitted at defendants trial for fe lony assault of a family member, despite any noncompliance with § 19.2-307, regarding the contents of judgments, due to not showing defendants plea, because any statutory noncompliance did not make the warrants wholly inadmissible, as the warrants were relevant to the trial courts required inquiry as to whether defendant had the required number of predicate prior convictions. Farmer v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 285, 746 S.E.2d 504, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 229 (2013). Judges notes complied with section.  Judges notes clearly complied with the substance of § 19.2-307 as they listed defendants guilty plea, the judges finding of guilt, the sentence, an d conditional suspension of the sentence. It was immaterial that the judge did not list whether the case was tried by a judge or jury, as all cases of that type in juvenile and domestic relations district court were tried by a judge. Sanders v. Commonwea lth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 320 (Va. Ct. App. July 15, 2008). Requirements satisfied.  Defendants prior conviction, in the general district court, of driving a motor vehicle after having been found to be an habitual offender was adequately prove d by a record of his plea of guilty to the offense and his sentence, which comported with the prescribed punishment for the offense, notwithstanding a failure of the record to show a judicial finding of defendants guilt. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 40 Va . App. 250, 578 S.E.2d 831, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 193 (2003). In light of the presumption of regularity, the absence of a mark on a prior juvenile adjudication indicating that a Boykin-type colloquy had been given, especiall y when there was no requirement in § 19.2-307 that the information be on the adjudication, defendant was properly convicted of violating § 18.2-308.2.Isaac v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 423 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2010). Requirements not satisfied.  At the sentencing phase of defendants trial, the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence three documents which the Commonwealth contended were prior or ders of conviction; these documents, as orders of conviction, failed in every respect to satisfy the requirements of this section. Bellinger v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 471, 477 S.E.2d 779, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 719 (1996). Trial courts judgment of conviction finding defendant guilty of possessing a firearm while under the age of 29, after having been convicted of a delinquent ac t that would have been a felony if committed by an adult, had to be reversed, as the juvenile court order that the trial court relied on did not make clear to which offense, or both, it was referring to when it stated found guilty in regard to ch arges against him when he was 15-years-old of grand larceny and petit larceny; accordingly, the juvenile courts judgment order was not sufficiently clear, and the Commonwealth could not definitively show that defendant had been adjudicated guilty of a delinquent act that would have been a felony had he been an adult. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 91 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 14, 2006). Conviction of felony domestic assault and battery was not supported by sufficient evidence because the warrant at issue, which alleged that defendant assaulted a family or household member on or about 06/11/2004 to 06/13/2004, failed to indicate any finding of guilt and thus, was insufficient to prove a prior conviction on any date; nonetheless, the lesser-included misdemeanor was proven beyond a reasonab le doubt.

CASE NOTES Sentences run consecutively.  The general rule in Virginia, both before there was a statute on the subject and since, is that sentences run consecutively and not concurrently. The first statut e appears in the Acts of 1877-78, p. 315. See Commonwealth v. Leath, 3 Va. (1 Va. Cas.) 151 (1805), where the rule was applied before any statute had been enacted on the subject, and Parsons v. Commonwealth, 154 Va. 832, 152 S.E. 547 (1930), where the ru le was applied after the statute had been enacted. Hudson v. Youell, 179 Va. 442, 19 S.E.2d 705, 1942 Va. LEXIS 237, cert. denied, 317 U.S. 630, 63 S. Ct. 47, 87 L. Ed. 508, 1942 U.S. LEXIS 290 (1942). Trial courts refusal to run defendants sentence with the time he was already serving on a different offense was a decision within the trial courts sou nd discretion. There was no abuse in the exercise of that discretion. Swilling v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 24 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2009). Circuit court did not err in dismissing an inmates petition seeking an order requiring the Virginia Department of Corrections to comply with a judgment giving him credit for time spent incarcerated because the inmate was not entitled credit toward his Virginia sentence for the time he was incarcerated while he was in Virginia custody serving time for his West Virginia sentence; while in Virginia, the inmate r emained in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of West Virginia under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, Article V(g) of § 53.1-210 and W. Va. Code § 62-14-1, and the sentences imposed were to be served consecutively to and not concu rrently with each other under § 19.2-308. Dorr v. Clarke, 284 Va. 514, 733 S.E.2d 235, 2012 Va. LEXIS 192 (2012). Word any in Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-308.2 unambiguously includes any other sentence, including another sentence under the same code section, and the speci fic language of the statute limits the circuit courts general discretionary authority; the General Assembly intended that the penalty for a violation of the statute not be diluted by running any of that time concurrently with any other sentence. Comm onwealth v. Botkin, 68 Va. App. 177, 805 S.E.2d 412, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 262 (2017), aff'd, 296 Va. 309, 819 S.E.2d 652, 2018 Va. LEXIS 157 (2018). Circuit court contemplated running defendants sentences concurrently but found that his pattern of behavior was concerning and decided it would run his senten ces consecutively; this was an appropriate exercise of the circuit courts discretion. Harrell v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 595 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 22, 2022). Terms of appellants incarceration were presumed to run consecutively, and a careful reading of the judgment belied his suggestion that the trial court conclud ed it lacked the authority to run the mandatory minimum terms concurrently. In fact, the trial court explicitly recognized that it had flexibility to run the sentences concurrently. Nevertheless, after considering the mitigating evidence against the aggr avating circumstances of the offenses, the trial court, in the permissible exercise of its discretion, determined that appellant should serve his sentences consecutively. Ferrell v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 95 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 2023). Unless ordered to run concurrently.  The court is given express power to order sentences to run concurrently, but in the absence of express direction, they still run consecutively. Hudson v. Youell, 179 Va. 442, 19 S.E.2d 705, 1942 Va. LEXIS 237, cert. denied, 317 U.S. 630, 63 S. Ct. 47, 87 L. Ed. 508, 1942 U.S. LEXIS 290 (1942). Where the court said that each of four sentences was to be computed from the date of this judgment, it was meant thereby that the sentences should run con currently and not consecutively. Conner v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 455, 150 S.E.2d 478, 1966 Va. LEXIS 243 (1966). Concurrent service is expressly ordered, within the meaning of this section, whenever the order contains a direction compliance with which will produce th at result. Perkins v. Peyton, 369 F.2d 590, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 4298 (4th Cir. 1966). Absent an express direction by the trial court that they are to run concurrently, multiple sentences are to run consecutively. Edmond v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 610 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 14, 2004). Multiple sentences to confinement shall not run concurrently, unless expressly ordered b y the court, and in the absence of express direction, they will run consecutively. Robertson v. Superintendent of Wise Correctional Unit, 248 Va. 232, 248 Va. 232, 445 S.E.2d 116, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1551, 1994 Va. LEXIS 83 (1994). As this section is self-executing.  The legislative intent seems manifest that this section was intended to be self-executing. Hudson v. Youell, 179 Va. 442, 19 S.E.2d 705, 1942 Va. LEXIS 237, cert. denied, 317 U.S. 630, 63 S. Ct. 47, 87 L. Ed. 508, 1942 U.S. LEXIS 290 (1942). Sequence in which sentences must be served not specified by statute.  Nothing in former § 53-207 nor any other provision specifies the sequence in which sentences must be served. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. D ist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). There is no constitutional or statutory requirement that sentences must be served in the order in which they are imposed by judgment. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). And it does not require the court to state sequence in its orders sentencing to imprisonment upon two or more convictions. Hudson v. Youell, 179 Va. 442, 19 S.E.2d 705, 1942 Va. LEXIS 237, cert. denied, 317 U.S. 630, 63 S. Ct. 47, 87 L. Ed. 508, 1942 U.S. LEXIS 290 (1942). Both the nature and sequence of service of multiple sentences are determined by the court or courts rendering judgment. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). Kind, amount, and sequence of punishment must be clearly specified.  So long as the kind, amount, and sequence of punishment were clearly specified before petitioner began to serve any of the sentences, none of his constitutional r ights were violated. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). It prevails over former § 53-207.  Former § 53-207 (now § 53.1-186), stating that confinement shall commence from the date of the final judgment, must be read in conjunction with this section , and being general in its terms must give way to this section whenever they conflict, the latter being specific in its terms. Wilkinson v. Youell, 180 Va. 321, 23 S.E.2d 356, 1942 Va. LEXIS 174 (1942); Conner v. Commonwealth, 207 Va. 455, 150 S.E.2d 478 , 1966 Va. LEXIS 243 (1966). The provisions of former § 53-207 (now § 53.1-186) must be read with this section and does not control the sequence of sentence service. Perkins v. Peyton, 369 F.2d 590, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 4298 (4th Cir. 1966). Former section 53-207 (now § 53.1-186) is not mandatory and it must be read in conjunction with, and when in conflict must give way to, this section, which pro vides that multiple sentences shall run consecutively and not concurrently, unless otherwise directed by the court. Shockley v. Slayton, 333 F. Supp. 868, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10901 (W.D. Va. 1971). Concurre nt sentences cannot later be made consecutive.  Original sentences expressly ordering concurrent service within the meaning of this section are beyond the power of the trial judge later to make them consecutive . Perkins v. Peyton, 369 F.2d 590, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 4298 (4th Cir. 1966). Order that revoked sentences run consecutively was not an abuse of discretion.  Defendants revoked sentences of six months, to be served consecutively, were affirmed as when defendant was originally sentenced, § 19.2-308 required that multiple sentences be served consecutively, unless expressly ordered otherwise; the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the original conviction orders evinced an intent to impose consecutive terms for the suspended sentences. James v . Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 276 (Va. Ct. App. June 27, 2006). When defendant was convicted of taking indecent liberties with a child while in a custodial or supervisory relationship, it was not an abuse of discretion to revo ke defendants previously suspended sentence or to run the sentence consecutively to defendants new sentence because, (1) by committing a new offense, defendant forfeited the conditional freedom inherent in the courts earlier d ecision to suspend part of defendants sentence, (2) defendant did not claim the trial court based defendants sentence or revocation on facially unlawful considerations or that either sentence exceeded applicable statutory limits, and (3) consecut ive sentences were presumed, under § 19.2-308. Nicholson v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 405 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2011). This section does not apply to orders of suspension and probation.  It applies only to the serving of sentences to confinement in prison. An order granting probation is not a sentence to confinement. Vick v. Commonwealth, 201 Va. 474, 111 S.E.2d 824, 1960 Va. LEXIS 117 (1960). The suspended portions of a defendants sentence would not run concurrently.  unless expressly so ordered by the court pursuant to this section. Malinowski v. Commonwealth, No. 1511-88-4 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 14, 1990). Trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering imposed sentences to run consecutively, rather than concurrently, because it exercised its authority by condi tioning the resuspension of part of defendants sentences on the sentence...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-309"><akn:num>§ 19.2-309</akn:num><akn:heading>Sentence of confinement for conviction of a combination of felony and misdemeanor offenses</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When any person is convicted of a combination of felony and misdemeanor offenses and sentenced to confinement therefor, in determining the sequence of confinement, the felony sentence and commitment shall take precedence and such person shall first be committed to serve the felony sentence.

Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  Prisoner was convicted of felony and misdemeanor offenses spanning the course of several years and each charge constituted its own separate case; therefore, § 19.2-309 did not apply and sentences were served in order of judgment with the remaining active time from the prisoners first period of incarceration to be served first, and the time not physically served on each sentence to be served second. Commonw ealth v. Demille, 78 Va. Cir. 137, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 9 (Fairfax County Feb. 18, 2009), aff'd, 283 Va. 316, 720 S.E.2d 69, 2012 Va. LEXIS 13 (2012). § 19.2-309.1.

In making such a determination of priority, the Director shall give due regard to the capacity of local as well as state correc tional facilities and, to the extent feasible, shall seek to balance between local and state correctional facilities the excess of prisoners requiring detention.

Every perso n convicted of a felony on or after July 1, 1990, every person convicted of a felony offense under Article 7 (§ 18.2-61 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 18.2 who was incarcerated on July 1, 1989, and every person convicted of a misdemeanor violation of § 16.1-253.2, 18.2-57, 18.2-60.3, 18.2-60.4, 18.2-67.4, 18.2-67.4:1, 18.2-67.4:2, 18.2-67.5, 18.2-102, 18.2-119, 18.2-121, 18.2-130, 18.2-370.6, 18.2-387, or 18.2-387.1 or subsection E of § 18.2-460 or of any similar ordinance of any locality shall have a sample of his blood, saliva, or tissue taken for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis to determine identification characteristics specific to the person. If a sample from the person is stored in the DNA data bank as indicated by the Department of Forensic Science DNA data bank sample tracking system, no additional sample shall be taken. A fee of $53 shall be charged for the withdrawal of this sample. The fee shall be taxed as part of the costs of the criminal case resulting in the conviction and $15 of the fee shall be paid into the general fund of the locality where the sample was taken and $38 of the fee shall be paid into the general fund of the state treasury. This fee shall only be taxed one time regardless of the number of samples taken. The assessment provided for herein shall be in addition to any other fees prescribed by law. The analysis shall be performed by the Department of Forensic Science or other entity designated by the Department. The identification characteristics of the pro file resulting from the DNA analysis shall be stored and maintained by the Department in a DNA data bank and shall be made available only as provided in § 19.2-310.5. B. After July 1, 1990, the blood, saliva, or tissue sample shall be taken prior to release from custody. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 53.1-159, any person convicted of an offense listed in subsection A who is in custody after July 1, 1990, shall provide a bl ood, saliva, or tissue sample prior to his release. Every person so convicted after July 1, 1990, who is not sentenced to a term of confinement shall provide a blood, saliva, or tissue sample as a condition of such sentence. A person required under this section to submit a sample for DNA analysis is not relieved from this requirement regardless of whether no blood, saliva, or tissue sample has been taken from the person or, if a sample has been taken, whether the sample or the results from the analysis of a sample cannot be found in the DNA data bank maintained by the Department of Forensic Science. C. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Department of Forensic Science from including the identification characteristics of an individuals DNA profile in the DNA data bank as ordered by a circuit court pursuant to a lawful plea agreement. D. A collectio n or placement of a sample for DNA analysis that was taken or retained in good faith does not invalidate the samples use in the data bank pursuant to the provisions of this article. The detention, arrest, or conviction of a person based upon a data b ank match or data bank information is not invalidated if it is determined that the sample was obtained, placed, or retained in the data bank in good faith, or if the conviction or juvenile adjudication that resulted in the collection of the DNA sample wa s subsequently vacated or otherwise altered in any future proceeding, including but not limited to post-trial or post-fact-finding motions, appeals, or collateral attacks. E. The Virgini a Department of Corrections and the Department of Forensic Science shall, on a quarterly basis, compare databases of offenders under the custody or supervision of the Department of Corrections with the DNA data bank of the Department of Forensic Science. The Virginia Department of Corrections shall require a DNA sample of those offenders under its custody or supervision who are required to submit a sample pursuant to this section if they are not identified in the DNA data bank. F. The Departm ent of State Police shall verify that a DNA sample required to be taken for the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry pursuant to § 9.1-903 has been received by the Department of Forensic Science.

The judge, after a finding of guilt, when fixing punishment in those cases specifically enumerated in subsection B, may, in his discretion, in lieu of imposing any other penalty provided by law and, with consent of the person convicted, commit such person for a per iod of four years, which commitment shall be indeterminate in character. In addition, the court shall impose a period of confinement which shall be suspended. Subject to the provisions of subsection C, such persons shall be committed to the Department of Corrections for confinement in a state facility for youthful offenders established pursuant to § 53.1-63. Such confinement shall be followed by at least one and one-half years of supervisory parole, conditioned on good behavior. The sentence of indet erminate commitment and eligibility for continuous evaluation and parole under § 19.2-313 shall remain in effect but eligibility for use of programs and facilities established pursuant to § 53.1-63 shall lapse if such person (i) exhibits intractabl e behavior as defined in § 53.1-66 or (ii) is convicted of a second criminal offense which is a felony. A sentence imposed for any second criminal offense shall run consecutively with the indeterminate sentence. B. The provisi ons of subsection A shall be applicable to first convictions in which the person convicted: 1. Commi tted the offense of which convicted before becoming 21 years of age; 2. Was convicted of a felony offense other than any of the following: aggravated murder, murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree or a violation of § 18.2-61, 18.2-67. 1, or 18.2-67.2 or subdivision A 1 of § 18.2-67.3; and 3. Is considered by the judge to be capable of returning to society as a productive citizen following a reasonable amount of rehabilitation. C. Subsequent to a finding of guilt and prior to fixing punishment, the Department of Corrections shall, concurrently with the evaluation required by § 19.2-316, review all aspects of the case to determine whether (i) such defendant is physically and emotionally su itable for the program, (ii) such indeterminate sentence of commitment is in the best interest of the Commonwealth and of the person convicted, and (iii) facilities are available for the confinement of such person. After the review such person shall be a gain brought before the court, which shall review the findings of the Department. The court may impose a sentence as authorized in subsection A, or any other penalty provided by law. D. Upon the de fendants failure to complete the program established pursuant to § 53.1-63 or to comply with the terms and conditions through no fault of his own, the defendant shall be brought before the court for hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions for pron ouncement of sentence as set forth in § 19.2-306, the court, after hearing, may pronounce whatever sentence was originally imposed, pronounce a reduced sentence, or impose such other terms and conditions of probation as it deems appropriate.

CASE NOTES No language in this section directs the court to make any findings before it can deny alternative sentencing under this section. Rather, the language of this section gives the judge complete discretion whether to impose this sentencing alternative on defendants who qualify under its provisions. Crank v. Rogers, 1 Va. App. 491, 339 S.E.2d 909, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 229 (1986). The language of this section, unlike former 18 U.S.C. § 5010 (d) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act, does not require the trial court to find that the youthf ul offender would not benefit from treatment under the statute before imposing any other sentence. Crank v. Rogers, 1 Va. App. 491, 339 S.E.2d 909, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 229 (1986). Nor does due process require considering alternatives.  Due process does not require the trial judge to indicate, before imposing sentence, that he has considered sentencing alternatives available under this section. C rank v. Rogers, 1 Va. App. 491, 339 S.E.2d 909, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 229 (1986). In order to prevail on claim that defense counsel was ineffective for not requesting court to sentence defendant under provisions of this section, defendant must establish both that counsels assistance was deficient and that this deficiency prejudiced this defense. Crank v. Rogers, 1 Va. App. 491, 339 S.E.2d 909, 1986 Va. App. LEX IS 229 (1986). Sentencing alternatives under this section differ from those required by § 18.2-53.1. Thus, a commitment under this section is contrary to the mandatory provision of § 18.2-53.1.LaFleur v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 190, 366 S.E.2d 712, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2235, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 25 (1988). Purpose of § 18.2-53.1 would be eroded by committing offender under this section in l ieu of sentencing him under § 18.2-53.1. This would substitute a discretionary penalty for an inflexible one. The General Assembly has directed a contrary policy which courts must follow. LaFleur v. Commonwealth, 6 Va.

Eligibility for participation in community corrections alternative program; evaluation; sentencing; withdrawal or removal from program; paym ent of costs. Text A. As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:Intractable behavior means behavior that, in the determination of the Department of Corrections, (i) indicates an inmates unwillingness or inability to conform his behavior to that necessary to his successful completion of the program or (ii) is so disruptive as to threaten the succes sful completion of the program by other participants.Nonviolent felony means any felony except th ose considered an act of violence pursuant to § 19.2-297.1 or any attempt to commit any of those crimes. B. A defendant (i) who otherwise would have been sentenced to incarceration for a nonviolent felony and whose identified risks and needs the court determines cannot be addressed by conventional probation supervision or (ii) whose suspension of sentence would otherwise be revoked after a finding that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of probation for a nonviolent felony, may be considered for commitment to a community corrections alternative program established under § 53.1-67.9 as follows: 1. Follo wing conviction and prior to imposition of sentence or following a finding that the defendants probation should be revoked, upon motion of the defendant or the attorney for the Commonwealth or upon the courts own motion, the court may order such defendant referred to the Department of Corrections for a period not to exceed 45 days from the date of commitment for evaluation and diagnosis by the Department to determine eligibility and suitability for participation in the community corrections alte rnative program. The evaluation and diagnosis may be conducted by the Department at any state or local correctional facility, probation, parole office, or other location deemed appropriate by the Department. When a defendant who has not been charged with a new criminal offense and who may be subject to a revocation of probation scores incarceration on the probation violation guidelines and agrees to participate, the probation and parole officer, with the approval of the court, may refer the defendant to the Department for such evaluation, for a period not to exceed 45 days. 2. Upon determination that (i) such commitment is in the best interest of the Commonwealth and the defendant and (ii) facilities are available for the confinement of the defendant, the De partment shall recommend to the court in writing that the defendant be committed to the community corrections alternative program. The Department shall have the final authority to determine an individuals eligibility and suitability for the program. 3. Upon receipt of such a recommendation and a determination by the court that the defendant will benefit from the community corrections alternative program and is capable of returning to society as a productive citizen following successful completion of the program, and if the defendant would otherwise be committed to the Department, the court (i) shall impose sentence, suspend the sentence, and place the defendant on probation pursuant to this section or (ii) following a finding that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of his probation previously ordered, shall place the defendant on probation pursuant to this section. Such probation shall be conditioned upon the defen dants entry into and successful completion of the community corrections alternative program. The court shall order that, upon successful completion of the program, the defendant shall be released from confinement and be under probation supervision fo r a period of not less than one year. The court shall further order that the defendant, prior to release from confinement, shall (a) make reasonable efforts to secure and maintain employment; (b) comply with a plan of restitution or community service; (c ) comply with a plan for payment of fines, if any, and costs of court; and (d) undergo substance abuse treatment, if necessary. The court may impose such other terms and conditions of proba...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-317"><akn:num>§ 19.2-317</akn:num><akn:heading>When writ of error lies in criminal case for accused; when for Commonwealth; when for county, city or town</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

A writ of e rror shall also lie for any county, city or town from the Supreme Court to the judgment of any circuit court declaring an ordinance of such county, city or town to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, except when the violation of any such ordinance is made a misdemeanor by state statute. C. A writ of e rror shall also lie for the Commonwealth from the Supreme Court to a judgment of the Court of Appeals in a criminal case, except where the decision of the Court of Appeals is made final under § 17.1-410 or § 19.2-408.

CASE NOTES This section grants only the right to seek to invoke appellate jurisdiction and does not mean that the jurisdiction may be invoked in every case. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). The right to appellate review is not a necessary element of due process. Saunders v. Reyn olds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not require that petitioner be granted a writ of error as a matte r of right. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). Decision to grant or refuse petition is based on merits of case.  A decision to grant or refuse a petition for writ of error is based upon one equally-applied criterion  the merits of the case. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). Thus, equal protection not denied where meritless petition refused.  So long as the court adheres to a merits review of each petition for writ of error, there is no denial of equal protection to the felon whose petition is refused because it is without merit. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). Writ of error lies only to final j udgment.  The judgment to which a writ of error will lie under this section is a final judgment pronounced at the end of a trial, and not an intermediate ruling of the tria l court made as an incident of the trial of the case against a defendant. Sturgill v. Commonwealth, 175 Va. 584, 7 S.E.2d 141, 1940 Va. LEXIS 203 (1940); Fuller v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 327, 53 S.E.2d 26, 1949 Va. LEXIS 174 (1949). When the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed defendants appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss a case in which defendant was found incompetent to stand tr ial for lack of jurisdiction due to the appeals criminal nature, the case was not transferred to the Virginia Court of Appeals because there had been no final conviction. Martinez v. Commonwealth, 296 Va. 387, 821 S.E.2d 529, 2018 Va. LEXIS 176 (2018 ). And to rejection of plea.  While it is permissible for the defendant in a criminal trial to file a plea seeking a dismissal of the prosecution under the provisions of § 19.2-243, the rej ection of the plea is but an antecedent incident to the trial of the indictment against the defendant, and is in no sense the pronouncement of a final judgment to which a writ of error will lie under this section. Sturgill v. Commonwealth, 175 Va. 584, 7 S.E.2d 141, 1940 Va. LEXIS 203 (1940). Judgment under statute authorizing probation.  After a trial court has adjudged a defendant guilty and has suspended either the imposition or the execution of sentence, or commitment of the defendant, and has fixed the terms of his probation under former § 53-272 (now §§ 53.1-151 and 53.1-186), its action is final and subject to review. And the revocation of the probation does not alter the finality of the judgment. Fuller v. Commonwealth, 18 9 Va. 327, 53 S.E.2d 26, 1949 Va. LEXIS 174 (1949). Judgment not final where trial court fails to impose sentence or fix terms of probation.  The trial court entered an order that defendant was guilty as charged, which recited that mitigating circumstances justified suspension of sentence, that before t aking action the court desired to have a report of the probation officer, and that the court suspended imposition of any sentence temporarily for the purpose of allowing defendant time for presentation of a writ of error to the Supreme Court. It was held that the order was not a final judgment of the trial court as contemplated by the statute. Fuller v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 327, 53 S.E.2d 26, 1949 Va. LEXIS 174 (1949). As to the States inability to appeal in criminal cases prior to the 1986 amendment o f Va. Const., Art. VI, § 1, see Commonwealth v. Willcox, 111 Va. 849, 69 S.E. 1027, 1911 Va. LEXIS 39 (1911); Commonwealth v. Perrow, 124 Va. 805, 97 S.E. 820, 1919 Va. LEXIS 167 (1919); City of Roanoke v. Donckers, 187 Va. 491, 47 S.E.2d 440, 1948 Va . LEXIS 239 (1948); Peyton v. King, 210 Va. 194, 169 S.E.2d 569, 1969 Va. LEXIS 221 (1969). The State may appeal in criminal case involving revenue laws.  Under Va. Const., Art. I, § 8 and Art. VI, § 1, the legislature may allow the Commonwealth an appeal in any criminal case involving the revenue laws, regard less of the degree of punishment. Commonwealth v. Willcox, 111 Va. 849, 69 S.E. 1027, 1911 Va. LEXIS 39 (1911); Commonwealth v. Perrow, 124 Va. 805, 97 S.E. 820, 1919 Va. LEXIS 167 (1919). Reading the second sentence of former § 17-116.08 (see now § 17.1-411) with the second sentence of this section, the Commonwealth is also assured, c onsistent with Va. Const., Art. VI, § 1, of the right to appeal to the Supreme Court adverse judgments in prosecutions for the violation of any law relating to the state revenue, even though in criminal prosecutions generally, according to this sectio n, the accused only may appeal to the Supreme Court. Commonwealth v. Smith, 230 Va. 354, 337 S.E.2d 278, 1985 Va. LEXIS 287 (1985). State revenue case.  Where the defense to a prosecution for the unlawful sale of malt liquor was that the defendant had the right to sell it at the place where sold, under the revenue laws of the State, the case involved a violation of a law relating to the state revenue within the provisions of this section. Commonwealth v. Goodwin, 109 Va. 828, 64 S.E. 54, 1909 Va. LEXIS 102 (1909). Two felons who are not similarly situated need not be treated alike to the extent that e ach must be granted a writ regardless of the merits of his claims. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). Procedure of granting a writ of error to one felon and refusing it to another is not violative of the equal protection clause. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). Distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors do not violate equal protection.  With respect to appellate procedure, the distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors either do not exist or, where they do, they are based upon well-reasoned o bjectives which serve a legitimate state interest and protect the constitutional rights of defendants convicted of crime and thus do not violate equal protection. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is not violated by the procedure in which a person convicted of a misdem eanor in a court not of record is given an automatic appeal to a higher court while a person originally convicted in a court of record has no such automatic right of appeal to a higher court. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LE XIS 206 (1974). For cases construing former § 19.2-317.1 relative to the ineffective assistance of counsel, see Frye v.

CASE NOTES This section does not allow a writ of error to an interlocutory judgment or order adjudi cating one guilty of contempt. An order which reserves the imposition of penalty or punishment for a period to allow the contemnor to purge himself is such an order. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Universal Moulded Prods. Corp., 189 Va. 523, 53 S.E.2d 835, 1949 Va. LEXIS 194 (1949). An order adjudging a defendant guilty of contempt is a final judgment to which a writ of error lies under this section. Weston v. Commonwealth, 195 Va. 175, 77 S.E.2d 405, 1953 Va. LEXIS 188 (1953). Decree not interlocutory where appellant was sentenced to 15 days in jail and execution of the sentence was suspended until a date certain. The fact that the court suspended execution of the sentence and continued the case until a date certain so that the appellant could purge himself of the civil contempt did not make the decree interlocut ory. The contempt decree imposed a sentence and fully adjudicated all issues; it was final, and jurisdiction of the appeal was therefore proper. Peet v. Peet, 16 Va. App. 323, 429 S.E.2d 487, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1305, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 102 (1993). Jurisdiction over prohibition writ.  Court had appellate jurisdiction over matters involving divorce and judgments for civil contempt of court; thus, the issues raised in the petition for a writ of p rohibition fell within the courts subject matter jurisdiction. The court rejected the claim that a final order was necessary to invoke the courts original jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition. Hoffman P'ship, LLP v. Circuit Court, 72 Va. A pp. 206, 843 S.E.2d 396, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 175 (2020). Jurisdiction in appeal of proper divorce decree debt liability determination.  Where matter clearly arose out of the enforcement of a provision in a divorce decree requiring husband to hold wife harmless for their joint debt to bank, Court o f Appeals had jurisdiction to consider the trial courts determination that husband failed to comply with the terms of the decree. Douglas v. Douglas, 17 Va. App. 380, 437 S.E.2d 244, 10 Va. Law Rep. 590, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 559 (1993). Appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review denial of contempt motion.  Circuit courts decision declining to hold a spouse in a divorce proceeding in civil contempt of court was not reviewable by an appellate court. Weedon v. Weed on, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 166 (Va. Ct. App. May 6, 2014). Court of appeals did not have appellate jurisdiction to consider a show cause direction because the circuit courts decision declining to hold a husband in civ il contempt of court was not reviewable on appeal. Reid v. Reid, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 224 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 29, 2017). Civil contempt.  Section 19.2-318 did not provide appellate jurisdiction for either the Supreme Court of Virginia or the Court of Appeals of Virginia to review the judgment of the circuit court dismissing the rule to show cause and refusing to hold the property owner in civil contempt of court; therefore, finding no abrogation of the common-law rule in the current or former versions of § 19.2-318 that would give the court juri sdiction of the instant appeal, the court turned to subdivision A 3 of § 8.01-670. The General Assembly abrogated the common-law rule that appellate review of contempt proceedings was not available only with regard to judgments for contempt; c onsequently, the court did not have jurisdiction under subdivision A 3 of § 8.01-670 to review the judgment dismissing the rule to show cause and refusing to hold the property owner in civil contempt of court. Jenkins v. Mehra, 281 Va. 37, 704 S.E.2d 577, 2011 Va. LEXIS 18 (2011). Because it was within the discretion of the trial court to exercise its contempt powers, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that a mother suc cessfully purged her contempt. Molchany v. Draughn, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 188 (Va. Ct. App. June 28, 2016). Claim of the guardian ad litem that the trial court erred by dismissing the show cause rules she brought against the mother were dismissed because the court of ap peals did not have jurisdiction over the dismissal of the rules to show cause; the court of appeals does not have jurisdiction to review a trial courts refusal to find a litigant in contempt. Molchany v. Draughn, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 188 (Va. Ct. App. June 28, 2016). Appellate court did not have jurisdiction under either this section or § 17.1-405 to review a trial courts ruling that a wife was not in contempt of court for failing to abide by a previous child custody and support order. Newton v. Jones, 66 Va. App. 20, 781 S.E.2d 759, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 42 (2016). Appellate court did not have jurisdiction to review the trial courts award of attorney fees to appellee because the award arose out of, and was dependent on, the trial courts finding that appellee was not in contempt. Because the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to review the trial courts ruling that appellee was not in contempt, it also lacked jurisdiction to review the award of attorney fees base d on that ruling.

App. May 1, 2018).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-319"><akn:num>§ 19.2-319</akn:num><akn:heading>When execution of sentence to be suspended; bail; appeal from denial</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If a person sentenced by a circuit court to confinement in the state correctional facility indicates an intention to apply for a writ of error, the circuit court shall postpone the execution of such sentence for such time as it may deem proper. In any other criminal case wherein judgment is given by any court to which a writ of error lies, and in any case of judgment for any civil or criminal contempt, from wh ich an appeal may be taken or to which a writ of error lies, the court giving such judgment may postpone the execution thereof for such time and on such terms as it deems proper. In any case after conviction if the sentence, or the execution thereof, is suspended in accordance with this section, or for any other cause, the court, or the judge th ereof, may, and in any case of a misdemeanor shall, set bail in such penalty and for appearance at such time as the nature of the case may require; provided that, if the conviction was for a violent felony as defined in § 19.2-297.1 and the defendant was sentenced to serve a period of incarceration not subject to suspension, then the court shall presume, subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions of bail will reasonably assure the appearance of the convicted person or the saf ety of the public. In any case in which the court denies bail, the reason for such denial shall be stated on the record of the case. A writ of error from the Court of Appeals shall lie to any such judgment refusing bail or requiring excessive bail. Upon review by the Court of Appeals, if the decision by the trial court to deny bail is overruled, the Court of Appeals shall either set bail or remand the matter to circuit court for such fur ther action regarding bail as the Court of Appeals directs.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  Where a trial court required a driving under the influence defendant to turn in his license to the court clerk upon his conviction, § 19.2-319 did not provide him with any relief on appeal because the revocation of a drivers license was not a punishment that could be postponed pending appeal, rather it was an act of the State under its police power to protect the public. Corbin v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 196, 604 S.E.2d 111, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 516 (2004). Scope of section.  The statute does not purport to make the decision of the Court of Appeals final in a bail proceeding. It merely delineates the court to which an appeal is to be t aken in a noncapital case as well as in a case where a death sentence has been imposed. In addition, the statute addresses only cases where bail has been refused or excessive bail required. It does not speak to the question whether the Commonwealth may a ppeal to the Supreme Court when the prisoner successfully has appealed to the Court of Appeals. Commonwealth v. Smith, 230 Va. 354, 337 S.E.2d 278, 1985 Va. LEXIS 287 (1985). This section grants discretionary authority to the trial court to set bail pending appea l. Strohecker v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 242, 475 S.E.2d 844, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 619 (1996). Scope of relief.  This section provides for the postponement of the execution of a sentence in order to give a defendant a fair opportunity to apply for a writ of error. Here, appe llant made no assertion to the trial court that he needed additional time to prepare his petition for appeal; rather, from appellants motion it appeared that he misconstrued the statute, requesting that execution of his sentence be postponed pend ing action by the Court of Appeals . . . This section provides for no such relief. Thus, there was no prejudice to appellant by the trial courts refusal to suspend execution of this sentence. Strohecker v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 242, 475 S.E.2 d 844, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 619 (1996). Trial court erred in denying defendants motion for bail pending appeal after the trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion beca use defendant had already filed his notice of appeal in defendants criminal case prior to filing the motion for bail; the trial court was either required to suspend execution of defendants sentence upon defendants indication that defendant wo uld be filing a writ of error, at which point the trial court could consider whether to grant bail pursuant to § 19.2-319, or the trial court could otherwise suspend execution of the sentence at any time during the pendency of appeal and then consider a bail request pursuant to § 19.2-322.1.Askew v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 127, 638 S.E.2d 118, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 558 (2006). Unlike § 19.2-120, this section contains no general standards by which exercise of discretion to grant or deny post-conviction bail may be measured. Although post-conviction bail is generally less liberally accorded than in the pretrial stage, the statute requires the trial judge to exercise not an arbitrary discretion, but a sound judi cial discretion. Dowell v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 225, 367 S.E.2d 742, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2732, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 41 (1988). Section 19.2-319 gives the court broad discretion in determining whether and under what circumstances to grant bail pending appeal; thus, the trial court erred in concluding it lacked authority to condition defendants release on bail pending an appeal of his felony convictions on his participation in an electronic home monitoring program. Staton v. Commonwealth, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 673 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 11, 2001). Order postponing execution of judgment of conviction only suspends execution of judgment.  The circuit judges order postponing execution of the judgment of conviction only acts to suspend execution of the judgment; it does not vacate the judgment or affect finality of the judgement. Preston v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 731, 419 S.E.2d 288, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3552, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 170 (1992). Trial court cannot refus e to suspend judgment.  To refuse to suspend a judgment of imprisonment is a denial of the right to a writ of error conferred by statute. This the trial court has no right to do. Ramey v . Commonwealth, 145 Va. 848, 133 S.E. 755, 1926 Va. LEXIS 440 (1926). But the peri od of suspension is within its discretion.  Under this section, the period of suspension of sentence in order to give accused time to apply for a writ of error is within the sound judicial discretion of the trial court.

For 2007 annual survey article, Criminal Law and Procedure, see 42 U. Rich. L. Rev. 311 (2007). CASE NOTES Scope of relief.  Trial court erred in denying defendants motion for bail pending appeal after the trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion beca use defendant had already filed his notice of appeal in defendants criminal case prior to filing the motion for bail; the trial court was either required to suspend execution of defendants sentence upon defendants indication that defendant wo uld be filing a writ of error, at which point the trial court could consider whether to grant bail pursuant to § 19.2-319, or the trial court could otherwise suspend execution of the sentence at any time during the pendency of appeal and then consider a bail request pursuant to § 19.2-322.1.Askew v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 127, 638 S.E.2d 118, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 558 (2006). Because judicial precedent established that prior convictions could be used as predicate offenses even though execution of the sentence (or judgment) was suspende d or the conviction was pending on appeal, the trial court did not err in finding that defendants second DUI conviction was a final judgment that could be used as a predicate conviction under Va. Code Ann. §§ 18.2-266 and 18.2-270(C)(1), even t hough execution of the sentence had been suspended for 90 days and the conviction was pending on appeal at the time of defendants trial on his third DUI offense.

Reversal of judgment.  Where the presentment does not charge the offense, the appellate court will reverse the judgment against the accused, though no motion in arrest of judgment was m ade in the court below. Old v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. (18 Gratt.) 915, 1867 Va. LEXIS 36 (1867). Where act charged not criminal.  Where in a criminal case the Supreme Court reverses a judgment overruling a demurrer to the indictment on the ground that the act charged in the indictment did no t constitute a crime, it may enter the order which the lower court ought to have entered, sustaining the demurrer and discharging the prisoner from further detention or prosecution under the indictment. Wise v. Commonwealth, 135 Va. 757, 115 S.E. 508, 19 23 Va. LEXIS 62 (1923). Affirmance where no error in judgment.  A case was submitted to the Supreme Court upon a verdict of guilty of a violation of the Sunday law, accompanied by a certificate of facts. From these facts reaso nably fair-minded men might draw different conclusions as to whether the work done was one of necessity. The court was not able to say that the verdict, approved by the trial court, was erroneous, and affirmed the judgment. Pirkey Bros. v. Commonwealth, 134 Va. 713, 114 S.E. 764, 1922 Va.

This decision is final and irreversible, and cannot be changed upon a second appeal in the cause. Chahoon v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 822, 1871 V a. LEXIS 86 (1871). Remand for varianc e between verdict and judgment.  On a trial for a felony, for which the shortest term of imprisonment was five years, the jury found the prisoner guilty, and fixed the term of his imprisonment in the state correctional facility at three years. Upon a writ of error, on the application of the prisoner, the judgment was reversed and the prisoner remanded for another trial. Jones v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 848 (1871).

Text In appeals to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, when a challenge to a conviction rests on a claim that the evidence was insufficient because the trial court im properly admitted evidence, the reviewing court shall consider all evidence admitted at trial to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. If the reviewing court determines that evidence was erroneously admitted and that s uch error was not harmless, the case shall be remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth elects to have a new trial.

CASE NOTES Necessity of n ew trial because of evidentiary error.  Reversal and remand for a new trial was necessary, as to the criminal charges against defendant, which were affected by the testimony of a witness, because the tr ial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony by the witness as to the cost of repairs for damage to a burglarized property and the admission of the testimony was not harmless error. Gilliam v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 231 (Va. Ct. App. May 27, 2014). St atement made before defendant was charged is admissible.  Trial court did not err in admitting into evidence defendants statement that he flipped his vehicle because the statement was voluntary as it was not responsi ve to any question propounded by the State trooper, and its admissibility was not barred by the Fifth Amendment; the trooper was reading the informed consent form, as he was required by law to do, when defendant blurted out the statement. Wilson v. Commo nwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 3, 2015). Trial court did not err in admitting into evidence defendants statement that he flipped his vehicle because admission of the statement did not violate defenda nts right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment; adversarial judicial proceedings had not begun, and the conversation between defendant and a State trooper took place at a time when defendant had not been charged and was not being confronted by the pr ocedural intricacies or expert adversaries of the judicial process. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 3, 2015). Exclusion of evidence held har mless error.  Circuit courts error in excluding defendants statement to the victim was not harmless because by refusing to admit the proffered testimony, the circuit co urt effectively prevented defendant from offering relevant and admissible evidence in support of his defense that he lacked the criminal intent alleged by the Commonwealth. Bethel v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 120 (Va. Ct. App. May 2, 2017). Evidence held sufficient.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of two counts of carnal knowledge and two counts of indecent liberties because, notwithstanding any impeachment, the trial court accepted the 14-year-old victims testimony of a sexual relationship between herself and defendant; the victims testimony was supported by her pregnancy and subsequent abortion; the stepfathers and girlfriends statements were a dmissible under the recent complaint exception to the hearsay rule as they were utilized to corroborate the victims independent testimony; and defendants statements regarding the victims pregnancy and abortion constituted a waiver of his asse rtion that the Commonwealths testimony on those issues was inadmissible. Pickett v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 219 (Va. Ct. App. July 21, 2015). Evidence was sufficient to support the circuit courts finding that defendant maliciously wounded the victim and used a firearm to commit that malicious woundi ng because the circuit court explicitly weighed a number of factors in making its credibility determination; the fact that the victim used crack cocaine and consumed alcohol sometime before the shooting did not render his testimony inadmissible but were relevant factors for the circuit court to weigh in assigning credibility. McClain v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 17, 2017). Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction under § 18.2-248 given his statements to the police, a detectives testimony that he had observed th e interaction between defendant and a driver of the SUV, illegal narcotics were subsequently found in the drivers SUV, and residue on a scale was confirmed to be cocaine upon forensic analysis. Arencibia v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 2020). Evidence held insufficient.  Circuit court was plainly wrong in finding there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of petit larceny because the Commonwealth failed to prove that the v ideo an officer viewed was of the incident and that there was a willful concealment of merchandise by defendant that was done with the intent to convert the merchandise; the circuit court had to make a number of inferences because no evidence was provide d actually establishing that the items concealed were merchandise or goods. Wright v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 293 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 30, 2018). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Constitutionality.  Acts 2013, c. 675, as codified in § 19.2-324.1, is constitutional; the enactment does not infringe upon any protection afforded by either the Fifth Amendment t o the U.S. Constitution or Article I, § 8, of the Constitution of Virginia. The Constitution of Virginia expressly permits the General Assembly to legislate on matters of procedural as well as substantive law; therefore, no amendment to the Constituti on of Virginia was necessary for this enactment to take effect on July 1, 2013.

Sup. Ct. R. 5A:6(a), defendants sentence could be suspended pursuant to § 19.2-319 and, thus, the trial court erred in concluding that it was divested of jurisdiction to consider defendants motion for bai l because defendant had already filed defendants notice of appeal in defendants criminal case.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Virginias recoupment statutes, §§ 19.2-336 and 19.2-358, did not violate defendants right to due process even though they placed the burden of proof on him to show that he was unable to pay court costs, or violate his right to equal protection even though they did not require that the trial court project his future ability to pay court costs before imposing the duty. Roads v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2013). Virginias recoupment statutes, §§ 19.2-336 and 19.2-358, did not violate defendants due process or equal protection rights as defendant would not be subject to enhanced punishment for a failure to pay court costs solely due to his future indigence, should it occur, since the penalties defendant feared would be imposed if he did not pay the costs could not be imposed absent an intentional refusal to obey the sentence or a failure to make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary funds under subsection B of § 19.2-358; if the default was excusable, the court could allow defendant additional time for payment, reduce the amount due or of each inst allment, or remit the unpaid portion in whole or in part under subsection C of § 19.2-358. Roads v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2013). Under this section the accused is liable for the costs of his conviction, without any fo rmal entry of judgment therefor. Commonwealth v. McCue's Ex'rs, 109 Va. 302, 63 S.E. 1066, 1909 Va. LEXIS 35 (1909). Section does not invade ri ght of trial by jury.  The taxing of the costs of the jury to a defendant in a criminal case is not an invasion of the constitutional right of the accused to a trial by jury. Kincaid v. Commonwealth, 200 Va. 341, 105 S.E.2d 846, 1958 Va. LEXIS 193 (1958). Defendants understanding of the cost of a jury trial and her desire to avoid this expense did not constitute coercion rendering her waiver of a jury involuntary. Ohree v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 299, 494 S.E.2d 484, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (1998). Costs are no part of the punishment of the accused. Anglea v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. (10 G ratt.) 696, 1853 Va. LEXIS 75 (1853); Commonwealth v. McCue's Ex'rs, 109 Va. 302, 63 S.E. 1066, 1909 Va. LEXIS 35 (1909). But they are exacted simply to reimburse the State for necessary expenditures in the enf orcement of its violated laws. Anglea v.

Commonwealth, 200 Va. 341, 105 S.E.2d 846, 1958 Va. LE XIS 193 (1958). This statute only subjects the accused to such costs as the Commonwealth is bound to pay. Anglea v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 696, 1853 Va. LEXIS 75 (1853) (see Finch v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 643 (1858)). Authorized fees.  Court was authorized to assess a fee against defendant for the Commonwealths attorney fee, the clerks fee, and the recording fee under this section. Ohree v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 299, 494 S.E.2d 484, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (1998). Court was authorized to assess a fee for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund against a defendant convicted of welfare fraud; the Commonwealth and its citizens were injured by the defendants commission of the crime. Ohree v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 299, 494 S.E.2d 484, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (1998). An individual convicted of a crime against the Commonwealth can be said to have caused the Commonwealth to incur the expense of the prosecution of that individual ; therefore the imposition of a courthouse maintenance fee upon a defendant convicted of welfare fraud furthered the legislatures goal of reimbursement and was valid. Ohree v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 299, 494 S.E.2d 484, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (199 8). Costs are not affected by a pardon.  A pardon releasing a prisoner from all pains, penalties and forfeitures incurred by his conviction and sentence was held not to release him from the costs incurre d in his prosecution by the Commonwealth. Anglea v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 696, 1853 Va. LEXIS 75 (1853). The only officer empowered to institute proceedings for the collection of costs due the State in a criminal prosecution is the Comptroller. See § 8-758 (now § 8.01-196). If the claim for such costs be asserted in a chancery suit by the local attorney for the Commonwealth, without the consent and approval of the Comptroller, it is a pr oceeding without authority, the State does not thereby become a party, and is not bound by any decree affecting her rights. Commonwealth v. McCue's Ex'rs, 109 Va. 302, 63 S.E. 1066, 1909 Va. LEXIS 35 (1909). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Responsibility for costs.  Defendants appeal of a district court conviction for unreasonably failing to permit his blood or breath to be tested when charged with driving while intoxicat ed was a criminal matter to which the same procedures applied as appeals from misdemeanor convictions, and defendant was therefore responsible for the jury expense incurred in the circuit court when defendant withdrew his appeal on the day of trial when a jury had been assembled and resolved his case via plea bargain; to avoid the charge, defendant would have had to have withdrawn his jury demand at least 10 days prior to trial.

Text A. The clerk o f the circuit court and district court of every county and city shall submit to the judge of his court, the Department of Taxation, the State Compensation Board and the attorney for the Commonwealth of his county or city a monthly report of all fines, co sts, forfeitures and penalties which are delinquent more than 90 days, including court-ordered restitution of a sum certain, imposed in his court for a violation of state law or a local ordinance which remain unsatisfied, including those which are delinq uent in installment payments. The monthly report shall include the social security number or drivers license number of the defendant, if known, and such other information as the Department of Taxation and the Compensation Board deem appropriate. The Executive Secretary shall make the report required by this subsection on behalf of those clerks who participate in the Supreme Courts automated information system. B. The clerk o f the circuit court and district court of every county and city shall submit quarterly to the attorney for the Commonwealth of his county or city and any probation agency that serves such county or city: 1. A lis t of all defendants with an outstanding balance of restitution ordered by the court served by such clerk. Such report shall include the defendants name, case number, total amount of restitution ordered, amount of restitution remaining due, and last d ate of payment; and 2.

It shall be the duty of the attorney for the Commonwealth to cause proper proceedings to be instituted for the collection and satisfaction of all fines, costs, forfeitures, penalties and restitution. The attorney for the Commonwealth shall determine whether it woul d be impractical or uneconomical for such service to be rendered by the office of the attorney for the Commonwealth. If the defendant does not enter into an installment payment agreement under § 19.2-354, the attorney for the Commonwealth and the cler k may agree to a process by which collection activity may be commenced 90 days after judgment.If the attorney for the Commonwealth does not undertake collection, he shall contract with (i) private attorneys or private collection agencies, (ii) enter into an agreement with a local governing body, (iii) enter into an agreement with the county or city treasurer, or (iv) use the services of the Department of Taxation, upon such terms and conditions as may be established by guidelines promulgated by the Offi ce of the Attorney General, the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court with the Department of Taxation and the Compensation Board. If the attorney for the Commonwealth undertakes collection, he shall follow the procedures established by the Department of Taxation and the Compensation Board. Such guidelines shall not supersede contracts between attorneys for the Commonwealth and private attorneys and collection agencies when active collection efforts are being undertaken. As part of such contract, priv ate attorneys or collection agencies shall be given access to the social security number of the defendant in order to assist in the collection effort. Any such private attorney shall be subject to the penalties and provisions of § 18.2-186.3.The fees of any private attorneys or collection agencies shall be paid on a contingency fee basis out of the proceeds of the amounts collected. However, in no event shall such attorney or collection agency receive a fee for amounts collected by the Department of Taxation under the Setoff Debt Collection Act (§ 58.1-520 et seq.). A local treasurer undertaking collection pursuant to an agreement with the attorney for the Commonwealth may collect the administrative fee authorized by § 58.1-3958. D. The Departm ent of Taxation and the State Compensation Board shall be responsible for the collection of any judgment which remains unsatisfied or does not meet the conditions of § 19.2-354. Persons owing such unsatisfied judgments or failing to comply with instal lment payment agreements under § 19.2-354 shall be subject to the delinquent tax collection provisions of Title 58.1. The Department of Taxation and the State Compensation Board shall establish procedures to be followed by clerks of courts, attorneys for the Commonwealth, other state agencies and any private attorneys or collection agents and may employ private attorneys or collection agencies, or engage other state agencies to collect the judgment. The Department of Taxation and the Commonwealth sha ll be entitled to deduct a fee for services from amounts collected for violations of local ordinances.The Department of Taxation and the State Compensation Board shall annually report to the Governor and the General Assembly the total of fines, costs, fo rfeitures and penalties assessed, collected, and unpaid and those which remain unsatisfied or do not meet the conditions of § 19.2-354 by each circuit and district court. The report shall include the procedures established by the Department of Taxatio n and the State Compensation Board pursuant to this section and a plan for increasing the collection of unpaid fines, costs, forfeitures and penalties. The Auditor of Public Accounts shall annually report to the Governor, the Executive Secretary of the S upreme Court and the General Assembly as to the adherence of clerks of courts, attorneys for the Commonwealth and other state agencies to the procedures established by the Department of Taxation and the State Compensation Board.The Office of the Executiv e Secretary of the Supreme Court shall annually report to the Governor, the General Assembly, the Chairmen of the House Committee for Courts of Justice and Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and the Virginia State Crime Commission on the total of restitu tion assessed, collected, and unpaid for each circuit and district court and the total of restitution collected and deposited into the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund pursuant to subsection I of § 19.2-305.1 by each circuit and district court.

Any defenda nt convicted of a traffic infraction or a violation of any criminal law of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision thereof, or found not innocent in the case of a juvenile, who is sentenced to pay a fine, restitution, forfeiture, or penalty may pay such fine, restitution, forfeiture, or penalty and any costs that the defendant may be required to pay in deferred payments or installments. The court assessing the fine, restitution, forfeiture, or penalty and costs shall authorize the clerk to esta blish and approve individual deferred or installment payment agreements. If the defendant owes court-ordered restitution and enters into a deferred or installment payment agreement, any moneys collected pursuant to such agreement shall be used first to s atisfy such restitution order and any collection costs associated with restitution prior to being used to satisfy any other fine, forfeiture, penalty, or cost owed, unless an order for restitution is docketed in the name of the victim or it is ordered th at an assignment of the judgment to the victim be docketed.

The requirements set forth in § 19.2-354.1 shall be posted in the clerks of fice and on the courts website, if a website is available. As a condition of every such agreement, a defendant who enters into an installment or deferred payment agreement shall promptly inform the court of any change of mailing address during the te rm of the agreement. If the defendant is unable to make payment within 90 days of sentencing, the court may assess a one-time fee not to exceed $10 to cover the costs of management of the defendants account until such account is paid in full. This on e-time fee shall not apply to cases in which costs are assessed pursuant to § 17.1-275.1, 17.1-275.2, 17.1-275.3, 17.1-275.4, 17.1-275.7, 17.1-275.8, or 17.1-275.9. Installment or deferred payment agreements shall include terms for payment if the defe ndant participates in a program as provided in subsection B or C. The court, if such sum or sums are not paid in full by the date ordered, shall proceed in accordance with § 19.2-358. B.

If, after the per son has an installment or deferred payment agreement, the person fails to pay as ordered, his participation in the program may be terminated until all fines, costs, forfeitures, restitution, and penalties are satisfied. The Director of the Department of Corrections and any sheriff or other administrative head of any local correctional facility shall withhold such ordered payments from any amounts due to such person.

The Director of the Dep artment of Corrections shall prescribe rules governing the receipt of wages paid to persons sentenced to state correctional facilities participating in such programs, the withholding of payments, and the disbursement of appropriate funds. C. The court s hall establish a program and may provide an option to any person upon whom a fine and costs have been imposed to discharge all or part of the fine or costs by earning credits for the performance of community service work (i) before or after imprisonment or (ii) in accordance with the provisions of § 19.2-316.4, 53.1-59, 53.1-60, 53.1-128, 53.1-129, or 53.1-131 during imprisonment. The program shall specify the rate at which credits are earned and provide for the manner of applying earned credits agai nst the fine or costs. The court assessing the fine or costs against a person shall inform such person of the availability of earning credit toward discharge of the fine or costs through the performance of community service work under this program and pr ovide such person with written notice of terms and conditions of this program. The court shall have such other authority as is reasonably necessary for or incidental to carrying out this program. D. When the co urt has authorized deferred payment or installment payments, the clerk shall give notice to the defendant that upon his failure to pay as ordered he may be fined or imprisoned pursuant to § 19.2-358. E. The failure of the defendant to enter into a deferred payment or installment payment agreement with the court or the failure of the defendant to make payments as ordered by the agreement shall allow the Tax Commissioner to act in accordance with § 19.2-349 to co llect all fines, costs, forfeitures, and penalties.

When an ind ividual obligated to pay a fine, costs, forfeiture, or penalty defaults in the payment or any installment payment, the court upon the motion of the Commonwealth in the case of a conviction of a violation of a state law, or attorney for a locality or for the Commonwealth in the event of a conviction of a violation of a local law or ordinance, or upon its own motion, may require him to show cause why he should not be confined in jail or fined for nonpayment. A show cause proceeding shall not be required p rior to issuance of a capias if an order to appear on a date certain in the event of nonpayment was issued pursuant to subsection A of § 19.2-354 and the defendant failed to appear. B. Following t he order to show cause or following a capias issued for a defendants failure to comply with a court order to appear issued pursuant to subsection A of § 19.2-354, unless the defendant shows that his default for the payment of fines, costs, forfeit ures, or penalties was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the sentence of the court, or not attributable to a failure on his part to make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary funds for payment, or unless the defendant shows that an y failure to appear was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court, the court may order the defendant confined as for a contempt for a term not to exceed sixty days or impose a fine not to exceed $500. The court may provide in its order that payment or satisfaction of the amounts in default for the payment of fines, costs, forfeitures, or penalties at any time will entitle the defendant to his release from such confinement or, after entering the order, may at any time redu ce the sentence for good cause shown, including payment or satisfaction of such amounts. C. If it appea rs that the default for the payment of fines, costs, forfeitures, or penalties is excusable under the standards set forth in subsection B, the court may enter an order allowing the defendant additional time for payment, reducing the amount due or of each installment, or remitting the unpaid portion in whole or in part. D. When an ind ividual obligated to pay restitution defaults in the payment or any installment payment, the court upon the motion of the Commonwealth in the case of a conviction of a violation of a state law, or attorney for a locality or for the Commonwealth in the ev ent of a conviction of a violation of a local law or ordinance, or upon its own motion, may proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection E. E. If, pursuan t to subsection D or at a hearing conducted pursuant to subsection F of § 19.2-305.1, the court finds that a defendant is not in compliance with a restitution order, the court may order the defendant confined as for a contempt for a term not to exceed 60 days unless the defendant shows that his default was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the sentence of the court, or not attributable to a failure on his part to make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary funds for payment, or unless the defendant shows that any failure to appear was not attributable to an intentional refusal to obey the order of the court. The court may provide in its order that payment or satisfaction of the amounts in default at any time will entitle the de fendant to his release from such confinement or, after entering the order, may at any time reduce the sentence for good cause shown, including payment or satisfaction of such amounts. If it appears that the defendants default for the payment of resti tution is excusable under the standards set forth in this subsection, the court may modify the terms for payment of restitution, except that the court may not modify the amount of restitution owed by the defendant. F. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to alter or interfere with the collection of fines by any means authorized for the enforcement of money judgments rendered in favor of the Commonwealth or any locality within the Commonwealth.

The 2018 amendments by cc. 316 and 671 are identical, and in subsection A, deleted restitution following forfeiture; inserted for the payment of fines, costs, forfeitures, or penalties twice in subsection B and once in subsection C; added subsections D and E; and made stylistic changes. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Virginias recoupment statutes, §§ 19.2-336 and 19.2-358, did not violate defendants due process or equal protection rights as defendant would not be subject to enhanced punishment for a failure to pay court costs solely due to his future indigence, should it occur, since the penalties defendant feared would be imposed if he did not pay the costs could not be imposed absent an intentional refusal to obey the sentence or a failure to make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary funds under subsection B of § 19.2-358; if the default was excusable, the court could allow defendant additional time for payment, reduce the amount due or of each inst allment, or remit the unpaid portion in whole or in part under subsection C of § 19.2-358. Roads v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2013). Virginias recoupment statutes, §§ 19.2-336 and 19.2-358, did not violate defendants right to due process even though they placed the burden of proof on him to show that he was unable to pay court costs, or violate his right to equal protection even though they did not require that the trial court project his future ability to pay court costs before imposing the duty. Roads v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 26, 2013). Confinement constituted involuntary servitude and was proscribed by Thirteenth Amendment.  Where the states sole ground for detaining defendant at a state farm was his failure to pay costs of the criminal prosecution, defendants confinement cons tituted involuntary servitude and his imprisonment for nonpayment of costs contravened the Thirteenth Amendment. Wright v. Matthews, 209 Va. 246, 163 S.E.2d 158, 1968 Va. LEXIS 222 (1968) (Case construed former § 53-221 which was repealed by Acts 1982 , c. 638. Former § 53-221 applied specifically to persons held to labor for the nonpayment of fines and costs). Imposition of fine.  Because defendant failed to provide a record that sufficiently established that defendant was convicted of traffic infractions and not crimes, pursuant to Va. Sup . Ct. R. 5A:8(b)(4)(ii), defendant waived the argument on appeal that the trial court erred in imposing a fine under § 19.2-358. Turnbull v. County of Spotsylvania, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 24 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2012). This section plainly applies to any payment or installment payment plans, not only those entered pursuant to § 19.2-354. Porter v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 46 7, 778 S.E.2d 549, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (2015). Compliance with a restitution plan may be enforceable through § 19.2-306, if incorporated into a sentencing order as a condition of a suspended sentence, or it may be enforceable through § 19.2-358, regardless of whether the restitution plan stated that it was entered into pursuant to § 19.2-354. The enforcement mechanisms of §§ 19.2-306 and 19.2-358 are not mutually exclusive. Porter v. Commonweal th, 65 Va. App. 467, 778 S.E.2d 549, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (2015). Statute of limitations inapplicable.  Trial court did not err in ruling that the contempt charge against defendant was not time-barred; a violation of the statute is not classified as a misdemeanor, a nd thus, § 19.2-8 does not apply. Porter v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 467, 778 S.E.2d 549, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (2015). Trial court did not err in ruling that the contempt charge against defendant was not time-barred; as contempt proceedings are not criminal prosecutions, s tatutes of limitation for crimes do not apply to bar them. Porter v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 467, 778 S.E.2d 549, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (2015). Restitution.  Trial court properly found that defendant was in contempt for violating the statute because the sentencing order requiring her to pay restitution constituted a co ndition of her suspended sentence and a freestanding obligation to pay and she failed to pay; despite the fact that defendants probation expired, rendering enforcement of the restitution plan through § 19.2-306 untenable, the restitution plan rema ined enforceable through this section. Porter v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 467, 778 S.E.2d 549, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (2015). Motion for remittance denied.  Because payment of the costs associated with the Sex Offender Polygraph, Sex Offender Treatment, and GPS did not reimburse to the public treasury the precise amou nt that the conduct of defendant had rendered it necessary should be expended for the vindication of the public justice of the state and its violated laws, and because each of those conditions was imposed as an alternative to depriving defendant of his l iberty, § 19.2-358 was applicable only to defendants $1,602.17 in fines and costs, and was not applicable to the Sex Offender Polygraph, Sex Offender Treatment, and GPS; thus, defendants motion to remit fines and costs as to those conditions w as denied. Commonwealth v. Greenway, 100 Va. Cir. 252, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 617 (Chesterfield County Oct. 29, 2018).

NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION The Virginia Victims of Crime Act is remedial in nature. It provides a system of redress for specified individuals who have suffered loss due to the commission of a crime. Prior to its enactment, no such remedy existed, and the addition of this form of compensation was calculated to fill what was perceived to be agap in available remedies. This being the case, it is axiomatic that the statute be liberally constru ed to promote its beneficent purpose, and its provisions should be read so as to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed. Bailey v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund, 77 O.W.C. 150 (1998). The Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund is remedial in nature. provides a system of redress for specified individuals who have suffered loss due to the commission of a crime. Prior to its enactment, no such remedy existed, and the addition of this form of compensation was calculated to fill what was perceived to be agap in available remedies. This being the case, it is axiomatic that the statute be liberally cons trued to promote its beneficent purpose. Its provisions should be read so as to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed. Morrison v. Victims of Crimes Compensation Act, 77 O.W.C. 239 (1998). In evaluating a claim under the Virginia Victims of Crime Act, the Commission is to apply the following analysis: (1) determine eligibility; (2) determine whether the award is allowed; (3) determine the amount of the award; (4) apportion the award if necessary; and (5) reduce the award to each claimant as may be required under the Act. Bailey v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund, 77 O.W.C. 150 (1998). Under the Compensation Victims of Crime Act, benefits are awarded to innocent persons who suffer personal physical injury or death because of criminal acts. Benef its may be reduced or rejected if the victim contributes to the infliction of the injuries. Creed v. Criminal Injuries Comp. Fund, 76 O.W.C. 173 (1997). Where the police report of the crime does not indicate that the victim was engaged in any criminal conduct, or that he was armed, or that he contributed in any wa y to the infliction of his own injury, but at most suggests that he was present in someones home where marijuana may have been sold, there is no basis for denying or reducing the claim. Bailey v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund, 77 O.W.C. 150 (19 98). The Commission adopted a policy on November 4, 1998, which provided that [t]he Fund may pay up to one thousand dollars for crime scene clean-up when a crime r esulting in physical injury occurs in a residence . . .. Requests for Awards for Crime Scene Clean-Up involving automobiles will be decided by the Commission judicially on a case-by-case basis. Montgomery v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund, 78 O. W.C. 276 (1999). The Commission interprets its crime scene clean-up policy to cover replacement and clean-up of items damaged by stains resulting from the police use of graphite a t the crime scene. However, it does not cover payment for items taken by the police as evidence. Montgomery v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund, 78 O.W.C. 276 (1999). § 19.2-368.2. Definitions.

Except as o therwise specifically provided by law, whenever any property is forfeited to the Commonwealth by reason of the violation of any law, or if any statute provides for the forfeiture of any property or money, or if any property or money be seized as forfeite d for a violation of any of the provisions of this Code, the Commonwealth shall follow the procedures set forth in this chapter. B. An action a gainst any property subject to seizure under the provisions of Chapter 22.2 (§ 19.2-386.15 et seq.) shall be commenced by the filing of an information in the clerks office of the circuit court. Any information shall be filed in the name of the Com monwealth by the attorney for the Commonwealth or may be filed by the Attorney General if so requested by the attorney for the Commonwealth. Venue for an action of forfeiture shall lie in the county or city where (i) the property is located, (ii) the pro perty is seized, or (iii) an owner of the property or the person in whose custody the property is found could be prosecuted for the illegal conduct alleged to give rise to the forfeiture. Such information shall (a) name as parties defendant all owners an d lienholders then known or of record and the trustees named in any deed of trust securing such lienholder, (b) specifically describe the property, (c) set forth in general terms the grounds for forfeiture of the named property, (d) pray that the same be condemned and sold or otherwise be disposed of according to law, and (e) ask that all persons concerned or interested be notified to appear and show cause why such property should not be forfeited. In all cases, an information shall be filed within thre e years of the date of actual discovery by the Commonwealth of the last act giving rise to the forfeiture or the action for forfeiture will be barred. C. Any action of forfeiture commenced under this section shall be stayed until the court in which the owner of the property or the person in whose custody the property is found is being prosecuted for an offense authorizing the forfeiture finds the owner or the person in whose custody the property is found guilty of any offense that authorizes forfeiture of such property, and any property eligible for forfeiture under the provisions of any statute shall be forfeited only upon such finding of guilt of the owner or the person in whose custody the property is found, regardless of whether the owner or the person in whose custody the property is found has been sentenced. If no such finding is made by the court, all property seized shall be released from seizure no later than 21 days from the date the stay terminates. However, property that has been seized may be forfeited pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter even though no finding of guilt is made if (i) such forfeiture is ordered by a court pursuant to a lawful plea agreement or (ii) the owner of the property or the person in whose custody the property was found has not submitted a written demand for the return of the property with the law-enforcement agency that seized the property within 21 days from the date the stay terminates.

CASE NOTES Language of section is mandatory.  The language of §§ 18.2-249 [now 19.2-386.22] and 19.2-386.1 through 19.2-386.14 is plain, unambiguous, and mandatory. Jenkins v. Commonwealth, 13 Va. App. 420, 411 S.E.2d 841, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1598, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 322 (1991). Courts authority dependent upon adherence to provisions of section.  The subject matter jurisdiction necessary to forfeiture is conferred upon the trial court only through these several statutes (§§ 18.2-249 [now 19.2-386.22] and 19.2-386.1 through 19.2-386.14) and the courts authority is dependent upon scrupulous adherence to their provisions.

Jurisdiction con tingent on filing of information.  If the Commonwealth wishes to obtain title to property through the forfeiture provisions of §§ 19.2-386.1 through 19.2-386.14, it must file an information f or forfeiture within 90 days of the date it physically takes the property into its possession. Failure to do so deprives a trial court of jurisdiction to consider the information for forfeiture. Commonwealth v. Brunson, 248 Va. 347, 448 S.E.2d 393, 1994 Va. LEXIS 135 (1994). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Invocation of right against self-incrimination.  In a civil forfeiture action, where defendant had previously pleaded guilty to gambling activities, defendant was not entitled to subsequently invoke his Fifth Am endment rights to avoid self-incrimination in the subsequent civil action because the records sought by the State were germane to defendants illegal gambling activities and, in particular, the issue of whether the items seized from his residence were used in connection with, or derived from, those activities; the States motion to compel production was granted.

In a felony case a pretrial appeal from a circuit court may be taken by the Commonwealth from: 1. An or der of a circuit court dismissing a warrant, information or indictment, or any count or charge thereof on the ground that (i) the defendant was deprived of a speedy trial in violation of the provisions of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the Un ited States, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of Virginia, or § 19.2-243; or (ii) the defendant would be twice placed in jeopardy in violation of the provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or Article I, Sect ion 8 of the Constitution of Virginia; or 2. An order of a circuit court prohibiting the use of certain evidence at trial on the grounds such evidence was obtained in violation of the provisions of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth Amen dments to the Constitution of the United States or Article I, Section 8, 10 or 11 of the Constitution of Virginia prohibiting illegal searches and seizures and protecting rights against self-incrimination, provided the Commonwealth certifies that the app eal is not taken for purpose of delay and that the evidence is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding. B. A petition for appeal may be taken by the Commonwealth in a felony case from any order of release on conditions pursuant to Article 1 (§ 19.2-119 et seq.) of Chapter 9 of this title. C. A petition for appeal may be taken by the Commonwealth in a felony case after conviction where the sentence imposed by the circuit court is contrary to mandatory sentencing or restitution terms required by statute.

E.

CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  This section, which provides the Commonwealth a limited right to appeal interlocutory orders, does not violate the United States constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Commonwealth v. Ramey, 19 Va. App. 300, 450 S.E.2d 775, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 701 (1994). The constitutional and statutory authority for Commonwealth appeals is narrowly circumscribed. It was not enacted to allow Commonwealth appeals from all allegedly erroneous pre-trial rulings by the trial court. Even if the trial courts ruling was erroneous, nonresponsive and exceeded the bounds of the relief requested, and even i f it was intended to frustrate the Commonwealths right of appeal, these facts do not provide a basis for the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Commonwealth v. Brown, 8 Va. App. 41, 378 S.E.2d 623, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2091, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 22 (1989). The purpose of Chapter 25 of Title 19.2, § 19.2-398 et. seq., is to afford the Commonw ealth a limited right of appeal under certain carefully specified circumstances. Those appeals are pre-trial, and the statutory scheme plainly contemplates that rulings on such appeals are interlocutory and reversible, as are the reviewed trial court rul ings. Satchell v. Commonwealth, 20 Va. App. 641, 460 S.E.2d 253, 12 Va. Law Rep. 69, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 638 (1995). Sect ion must be strictly construed against Commonwealth.  This section is in derogation of the general constitutional prohibition against appeals by the Commonwealth. It must be strictly construed against the state and l imited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute. Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 10 Va. App. 41, 390 S.E.2d 3, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1769, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (1990). This section does not permit appeal of a trial judges evidentiary rulings at a hearing on a motion to suppress. Commonwealth v. Thornton, 24 Va. App. 478, 483 S.E.2d 487, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (1997). Right to appeal unconstitutional statute whether facial or as applied challenge.  The plain language of this section gives the Commonwealth the right to appeal whenever a statute is found unconstitutional, whether the finding is based on a  facial or an as applied challenge. Commonwealth v. Johnson, No. 0629-90-4 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 16, 1990). Use of shall is directory only.  Language in § 19.2-400 stating what a notice of appeal shall contain, along with almost identical language in § 19.2-398, is directory only. Thus, t he Commonwealths failure to timely file the certification described in §§ 19.2-398 and 19.2-400 was not jurisdictional. Commonwealth v. Hackett, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 120 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 11, 2008). Commonwealths limited right of appeal.  The legislature has narrowly limited the Commonwealths right to appeal suppression orders of the trial courts to orders which are based on constitutional viol ations; therefore, where the Commonwealth appealed an order suppressing certain evidence solely on the grounds that the evidence was obtained in violation of §§ 19.2-59 and 19.2-60, the court of appeals would not entertain the Commonwealths app eal. Commonwealth v. Ragland, 7 Va. App. 452, 374 S.E.2d 183, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 139 (1988). Under this section the Commonwealths right to appeal is limited to suppression orders granted on the basis of violation of specific provisions of the United S tates and the Virginia Constitutions. Commonwealth v. Rodgers, 21 Va. App. 745, 467 S.E.2d 813, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (1996). Commonwealth had a limited right to appeal the trial courts granting of defendants motion to suppress, but the trial courts judgment had to be affirme d, as the Commonwealths argument that the motion to suppress should not have been denied because the evidence showed that there was probable cause to make an arrest and to search incident to that arrest had to be rejected because that argument had no t been raised in the trial court and, therefore, could not be considered for the first time on appeal. Commonwealth v. Flythe, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 410 (Va. Ct. App. July 18, 2003). Commonwealths appeal of the trial courts dismissal of indictments filed against defendant charging him with possession of cocaine with intent to distribut e and possession of a firearm while possessing cocaine with intent to distribute was dismissed; the record showed that the Commonwealth had submitted evidence, including sworn testimony, immediately prior to the trial courts ruling on defendants motion to dismiss and the statute under which the Commonwealth appealed, clause (ii) of subdivision A 1 of § 19.2-398 expressly applied only to pretrial appeals, which was not involved in the present case.

No appeal shall be allowed the Commonwealth pursuant to subsection A of § 19.2-398 unless within seven days after entry of the order of the circuit court from which the appeal is taken, and before a jury is impaneled and sworn if there is to be trial by jury or, in cases to be tried without a jury, before the court begins to hear or receive evidence or the first witness is sworn, whichever occurs first, the Commonwe alth files a notice of appeal with the clerk of the trial court. If the appeal relates to suppressed evidence, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall certify in the notice of appeal that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and that the evid ence is substantial proof of a fact material to the proceeding. All other requirements related to the notice of appeal shall be governed by Part Five A of the Rules of the Supreme Court. Upon the filing of a timely notice of appeal, the order from which the pretrial appeal is taken and further trial proceedings in the circuit court, except for a bail hearing, shall thereby be suspended pending disposition of the appeal. An appeal by the Commonwealth pursuant to subsection C of § 19.2-398 shall be governed by Part Five A of the Rules of the Supreme Court. History History. 1987, c. 710; 2003, c. 109; 2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 344, 345. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 344 and 345, cl. 3 provides: That any person under a sentence of death imposed for an offense committed prior to July 1, 2021, but who has not been executed by July 1, 2021, shall have his sentence changed to life imprisonment, and such person who was 18 years of age or older at the time of the offense shall not be eligible for (i) parole, (ii) any good conduct allowance or any ear ned sentence credits under Chapter 6 (§ 53.1-186 et seq.) of Title 53.1 of the Code of Virginia, or (iii) conditional release pursuant to § 53.1-40.01 or 53.1-40.02 of the Code of Virginia. Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 344 and 345, cl. 4 provides: That notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person may be sentenced to death or put to death on or after the effective date of this act [July 1, 2021] for any violation of law. Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, cc. 344 and 345, cl. 5 provides: That the provisions of this act may result in a net increase in periods of imprisonment or commitment . Pursuant to § 30-19.1:4 of the Code of Virginia, the estimated amount of the necessary appropriation is $77,376 for periods of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities and $0 for periods of commitment to the custody of the Department of J uvenile Justice. The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 109 substituted shall for will in the first paragraph; in the second paragraph, substituted subsection A of § 19.2 -398 for this chapter in the first sentence, substituted the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and that the evidence is substantial proof of a fact material to the proceeding for such evidence is essential to the prosec ution at the end of the second sentence, and in the last sentence inserted pretrial, and deleted pursuant to § 19.2-403 following hearing; and added the final paragraph. The 2021 Sp. Sess. I amendments. The 2021 amendments by Sp. Sess. I, cc. 344 and 345, effective July 1, 2021, are identical, and substituted an aggravated murder for a capital murder  in the first paragraph. CASE NOTES Purpose.  Purpose of this section is to prevent a circuit court from defeating the ability of the Commonwealth to pursue its appeal once the appeal is properly noted. West v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 679, 432 S.E.2d 730, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1613, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 223 (1993). Use of shall is directory only.  Language in § 19.2-400 stating what a notice of appeal shall contain, along with almost identical language in § 19.2-398, is directory only. Thus, t he Commonwealths failure to timely file the certification described in §§ 19.2-398 and 19.2-400 was not jurisdictional. Commonwealth v. Hackett, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 120 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 11, 2008). Court sees no material difference in the shall certify direction found in § 19.2-400 and the shall file direction found in § 19.2-405; the C ommonwealths failure regarding the notice of filing transcripts in this case did not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Commonwealth v. Stanley, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 260 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2019). Circuit court may reconsider its ord er.  This section did not bar circuit court from reconsidering its order granting motion to suppress after the Commonwealth had filed a notice of appeal from that orde r where trial court granted defendants motion to suppress evidence in the circuit court. West v. Commonwealth, 16 Va. App. 679, 432 S.E.2d 730, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1613, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 223 (1993). Commonwealths limited right of appeal.  Commonwealths appeal of the trial courts dismissal of indictments filed against defendant charging him with possession of cocaine with intent to distribut e and possession of a firearm while possessing cocaine with intent to distribute was dismissed; the record showed that the Commonwealth had submitted evidence, including sworn testimony, immediately prior to the trial courts ruling on defendants motion to dismiss and the statute under which the Commonwealth appealed, clause (ii) of subdivision A 1 of § 19.2-398 expressly applied only to pretrial appeals, which was not involved in the present case. Commonwealth v. Green, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 347 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2006). Notice of appeal timely.  Commonwealth had seven days following the entry of the trial courts order in which to file a notice of appeal, and its notice of appeal fell within that time period; because the notice of appeal was timely filed and clearly identified the order being appealed, it was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court of appeals. Commonwealth v. Dubois, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 324 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2015). Commonwealths notice of appeal, filed before the trial court entered the order from which the appeal was taken, was timely, as it provided more notice of the intent to appeal than required. Commonwealth v. Jenkins, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 183 (Va. Ct. App. July 10, 2018). The court had jurisdiction over an appeal of a methamphetamine and cocaine charge even though the notice of appeal was deficient, because the accompanying certifi cate clarified what cases the Commonwealth intended to appeal by stating the suppressed evidence was substantial proof of facts material to the Commonwealths case, to wit: illegal narcotics (cocaine and methamphetamine). Commonwealth v. Dotson, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 7, 2023). Date of entry.  It is the date of the entry of the order by the circuit court, not the circuit courts rendition of a judgment, that matters for purposes of timely filing a no tice of appeal. Commonwealth v. Dubois, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 324 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 2015). Tolling of dismissal order.  Appellate court, after finding that the trial court should not have entered its judgment suppressing evidence against defendant, found that it did not need to add ress the trial courts subsequent dismissal of the three indictments against defendant. Pursuant to § 19.2-400 and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1, the Commonwealths appeal of the trial courts ruling on the suppression order suspended the dismissal of the indictments pending the Commonwealths appeal and since the Commonwealth prevailed, the indictments were treated as not having been dismissed at all. Commonwealth v. DeBusk, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 268 (Va. Ct. App. June 3, 2008). Commonwealths limited right of appeal.  Circuit court erred in dismissing the charges after granting defendants motions to suppress as the Commonwealth made clear that it was likely to exercise its statutory right to a pretrial appeal. Commonwealth v. Williams, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 240 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 29, 2019).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_19.2-401"><akn:num>§ 19.2-401</akn:num><akn:heading>Cross appeal; when allowed; time for filing</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The defendant shall have no independent right of appeal pursuant to § 19.2-398. If the Commonwealth appeals, the defendant may cross appeal from any orders from whic h the Commonwealth may appeal, pursuant to § 19.2-398. The defendant shall be under no obligation to defend an appeal filed by the Commonwealth. However, when an appeal is taken by the Commonwealth, and the defendant wishes to defend or cross appeal, the circuit court shall, where the defendant is indigent, appoint counsel to represent the defendant on appeal. The remuneration to be awarded appointed counsel shall be governed by § 19.2-326. In pretrial appeals, the defendant shall file a notice of cross appeal with the clerk of the circuit court within seven days following the notice of appeal filed by the Commonwealth. Any brief on cross appeal shall be consolidated with the defendants brief as appellee, if any. History History. 1987, c. 710; 2003, c. 109. Annotations The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 109 inserted In pretrial appeals at the beginning of the second paragraph. CASE NOTES Law of the case.  Law of the case doctrine prevented defendant from challenging the appellate courts first decision because it involved the same case, the same parties, and the same facts, post-trial Commonwealth appeals did not have a right to reconsideration of issues previously decided by the appellate court, and there was a distinction regarding the finality of appellate court decisions in Commonwealth pretrial appeals ver sus post-trial appeals. Greer v. Commonwealth, 67 Va. App. 324, 796 S.E.2d 422, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (2017). Timeliness.  Appellate court lacked jurisdiction over defendants appeal because his notice of appeal was untimely where he had a statutory right to challenge his convictio n by timely filing his own notice of appeal or by cross-appealing the Governments appeal, but did neither.

When a noti ce of appeal has been filed pursuant to § 19.2-400, the Commonwealth may petition the Court of Appeals for an appeal pursuant to § 19.2-398. The Commonwealth shall be represented by the Attorney General or the attorney for the Commonwealth prosecut ing the case if he filed a notice of appearance pursuant to § 2.2-511. B. The provisi ons of this subsection apply only to pretrial appeals. The petition for a pretrial appeal shall be filed with the clerk of the Court of Appeals not more than 14 days after the notice of transcript or written statement of facts required by § 19.2-405 i s filed or, if there are objections thereto, within 14 days after the judge signs the transcript or written statement of facts. The accused may file a brief in opposition with the clerk of the Court of Appeals within 14 days after the filing of the petit ion for pretrial appeal. If the accused has filed a notice of cross appeal, he shall file a petition for cross appeal to be consolidated with, and filed within the same time period as, his brief in opposition. The Commonwealth may file a brief in opposit ion to any petition for cross appeal within 10 days after the petition for cross appeal is filed. Except as specifically provided in this section, all other requirements for the petition for pretrial appeal and brief in opposition shall conform as nearly as practicable to Part Five A of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. History History. 1987, c. 710; 2003, c. 109; 2014, cc. 33, 294; 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 489. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 489, cl. 3 provides: That any case for which a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court has been filed prior to January 1, 2022, shal l continue in the Supreme Court of Virginia and shall not be affected by the provisions of this act. Acts 2021, Sp. Sess.

Such case shall b e considered mature for purposes of further proceedings from the date of such certificate. Acts 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 489, cl. 6 provides: That the provisions of this act amending § 17.1-400 of the Code of Virginia shall become effective in due course and that the remaining provisions of this act shall become effective on January 1, 2022. The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 109 inserted the subsection A and B designations; in subsection B, inserted the first sentence, inserted pretrial preceding a ppeal throughout, substituted 14 for fourteen throughout, and substituted 10 for ten in the next-to-last sentence. The 2014 amendments. The 2014 amendments by cc. 33 and 294 are identical, and in the second sentence of subsection B, substituted the notice of transcript or written statement of facts required by § 19.2-405 is filed or for the date that the transcript or written statement of facts is filed, or and added of facts to the end. The 2021 Sp. Sess. I amendments. The 2021 amendment by Sp. Sess. I, c. 489, effective January 1, 2022, in subsection A, inserted Attorney General or the and added if he filed a notice of appearance pursuant to § 2.2-511. CASE NOTES Time requirement for filing interlocutory appeal by Commonwealth in criminal cases.  In reading §§ 17.1-408 and 19.2-402 and Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12 together and giving effect to as much of their respective provisions as possible, in any inter locutory appeal by the Commonwealth in a criminal case, a petition for appeal that is compliant with the provisions of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12(c)(1) must be filed within fourteen days of the receipt by the clerk of the trial court of the transcript or writ ten statement of facts or, if there are objections thereto, within fourteen days after the judge signs the transcript or written statement of facts, and, in such cases, the Virginia Court of Appeals has no authority to grant an extension of time for any reason, and any grant of such authority to that Court must come from the general assembly. Commonwealth v. Square, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct. App. June 12, 2012). Fourteen-day time limit in the more specific and more recent expression of legislative intent of § 19.2-402 applies to interlocutory appeals by the Commonwealt h in criminal cases, rather than the forty-day time limit of § 17.1-408. Commonwealth v. Square, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct. App. June 12, 2012). Court of app eals lacked authority to grant extension.  When the Commonwealths petition for an interlocutory appeal appealing an order granting a motion to suppress did not contain assignments of error, the appella te court erroneously granted an extension of time within which to file a proper petition and had no jurisdiction to consider the petition because (1) the requirement of assignments of error was jurisdictional, (2) the legislature intended in §§ 19. 2-402 and 17.1-408 to expeditiously dispose of such appeals, (3) § 19.2-402 did not let the appellate court grant an extension in such cases, (4) § 19.2-402, reducing the time to file an interlocutory petition for appeal to fourteen days, governed, as the statute was a more specific and more recent expression of legislative intent, and (5) § 19.2-402s incorporation of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12 did not include authority to grant extensions of time, so (6) the general assembly did not intend to g rant extensions to file a petition for appeal in these cases. Commonwealth v. Square, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct. App. June 12, 2012). Petition mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, held untimely.  Although Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:3(c) allowed the Commonwealth to mail its petition appealing the trial courts judgment granting defendants motion to suppress evidence to the court of appeals, it required the Commonwealth to obtain an official receipt showing that the petition was mailed on time and to produce that receipt on demand, and the appellate court held that because the Commonwealth could not produce a receipt showing that it mailed its petition on or before the date it was due, and could not otherwise show that its petition was filed on time, the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the Commonwealths appeal. Commonwealth v. Green, 2004 Va. App. LEX IS 16 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 13, 2004). Petition timely.  Commonwealths appeal, filed more than 14 days after the transcript was filed, was timely, as the transcript was filed before the court ruled and the appeal wa s filed within 14 days of the notice of appeal. Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 251 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 10, 2013). Petition for appeal was filed well within the time frame established by the statutes, and thus the Commonwealths failure regarding the notice of filing transc ripts neither caused prejudice to defendant nor deprived the appellate court of jurisdiction by rendering the petition for appeal untimely. Commonwealth v. Stanley, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 260 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2019). Incorporation of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12(a) does not apply to interlocutory appeals by the Commonwealth.  While § 19.2-402 incorporates by reference the requirements of the Rules of the Supreme Court Virginia applicable to the Virginia Court of Appeals, the authori ty to grant an extension of time as found in Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12(a) does not apply to interlocutory appeals by the Commonwealth because the statutes plain language incorporates by reference only the substantive requirements for the petition as foun d in other subsections of Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:12. Commonwealth v. Square, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct.

The Court of Appeals, however, shall grant or deny the petition for a pretrial appeal, and the petition for cross appeal, if any, not later than 30 days after the brief in opposition is timely filed or the time for such filing has expired. No petition for rehearing may be filed in any pretrial appeal pursuant to this chapter.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Court sees no material difference in the shall certify direction found in § 19.2-400 and the shall file direction found in § 19.2-405; the C ommonwealths failure regarding the notice of filing transcripts in this case did not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Commonwealth v. Stanley, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 260 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2019). Petition timely.  Commonwealths appeal, filed more than 14 days after the transcript was filed, was timely, as the transcript was filed before the court ruled and the appeal wa s filed within 14 days of the notice of appeal. Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 251 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 10, 2013). Petition for appeal was filed well within the time frame established by the statutes, and thus the Commonwealths failure regarding the notice of filing transc ripts neither caused prejudice to defendant nor deprived the appellate court of jurisdiction by rendering the petition for appeal untimely. Commonwealth v. Stanley, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 260 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 12, 2019). Petition untimely.  Commonwealths appeal from the granting of defendants motion to suppress was dismissed, because the notice of filing transcript was not timely filed nor wa s the petition for appeal filed by the applicable deadline and the deadlines in this section have to be strictly construed against the Commonwealth. Commonwealth v. Spinola, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 252 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 8, 2015). Issues deemed waived.  Issues the Commonwealth presented on appeal were treated as waived because it failed to timely file a transcript from the motions hearing and thus, failed to prov ide the court of appeals with a record sufficient to decide the issues presented by the appeal; without the transcript, the court of appeals could not ascertain the basis for the circuit courts decision to suppress defendants statements, and acco rdingly, it could not determine whether the circuit courts decision was erroneous. Commonwealth v. Caballero, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (Va. Ct. App. May 24, 2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Request deni ed where defendant could not file appeal.  Defendants request for a transcript was denied because, as the defendant could not appeal the decision of the court, the defendant could not show a particular ized need for a transcript.

Upon a pretrial appeal being taken by the Commonwealth pursuant to § 19.2-398, if the defendant moves the trial court for release on bail, that court shall promptly, but in no event later than three days after the Commonwealths notice of appeal is filed, hold a hearing to determine the issue of bail. The burden shall be upon the Commonwealth to show good cause why t he bail should not be reduced or the accused released on his own recognizance. If it is determined that the accused shall be released on bail, bail shall be set and determined in accordance with Article 1 (§ 19.2-119 et seq.) of Chapter 9 of this titl e.

The 1999 amendments by cc. 829 and 846 are identical, and substituted Article 1 (§ 19.2-119 et seq.) of Chapter 9 of this title for §§ 19.2-1 19 through 19.2-134 in the third sentence. The 2003 amendments. The 2003 amendment by c. 109 added the first sentence, and inserted a pretrial in the second sentence. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Bail for murder charge.  Section 19.2-120 presumption against bail for a murder charge applied in a bail determination under § 19.2-406; the burden on the Commonwealth to show good cau se why bail should not have been reduced or defendant released on his own recognizance during the Commonwealths pretrial appeal did not eliminate the presumption against bail for defendants murder charge.

The provisions of § 19.2-243 shall not apply to the period of time commencing when the Commonwealths notice of pre trial appeal is filed pursuant to this chapter and ending 60 days after the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court issues its mandate disposing of the pretrial appeal. Such finality of the Court of Appeals decision shall not preclude a defendant, if he is convicted, from requesting the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court on direct appeal to reconsider an issue which was the subject of the pretrial appeal.

CASE NOTES Reconsideration of pretrial appeal.  Court of appeals was authorized to reconsider the constitutionality of the strip search and the admissibility of the strip search evidence when those questions we re presented on direct appeal after defendants conviction; it erred in failing to do so. Cole v. Commonwealth, 294 Va. 342, 806 S.E.2d 387, 2017 Va. LEXIS 162 (2017), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2025, 204 L. Ed. 2d 228, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 3250 (2019). Defendant not deprived of right to speedy trial.  Because defendants trial was set for a date after the sixty-day mandate period following an interlocutory appeal expired, defendant, therefore, was required t o object to continuing the trial date. Accordingly, dismissal based on a violation of the speedy trial statute was inappropriate because defendants failure to object amounted to acquiescence that the delay in commencing trial would be charged against defendant.
