House Joint Resolution 18 of the 1990 General Assembly directed the Virginia Code Commission to undertake a revision of Title 65.1. In January of 1991, the Commis sion sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing the proposed revision of Title 65.1 which was published as House Document No. 38 of the 1991 Session. The Commissions draft of the revision of Title 65.1, as amended by the General Assembly, became c. 355 of the Acts of 1991 and was effective Oct. 1, 1991. Many of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of Title 65.1 or prior law. Acts 1991, c. 355, cl. 2 provides that whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions or contents of any section or chapter of Title 65.1 or any other t itle of this Code as such titles existed prior to Oct. 1, 1991, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section or chapter of this title or any other title of this Code and whenever any such former section or chapter is given a new number i n this or any other title, all references to any such former section or chapter of Title 65.1 or any other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, prov isions, contents or portions thereof. Acts 1991, c. 355, cl. 3 provides that the rules and regulations of the Industrial Commission of Virginia in effect on the effective date of this act (Oct. 1, 199 1) shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated under this act. Acts 1991, c. 355, cl. 4 provides that this recodification of Title 65.1 as Title 65.2 shall not be construed to require the reappointment of any officer or any m ember of a board, council, committee or other appointed body referred to in Title 65.2, and each such officer and member shall continue to serve the term for which appointed pursuant to the provisions of Title 65.1. Acts 1991, c. 355, cl. 5 provides that the provisions of § 30-152 shall apply to the codification of Title 65.2 so as to give effect to other laws enacted at t he 1991 Session of the General Assembly notwithstanding the delay in the effective date of this act (Oct. 1, 1991). Editors note. Acts 2002, c. 538, provides: That the Workers Compensation Commission, by July 1, 2003, shall promulgate rules and regulations instituting an expedited ca lendar for the administration of claims under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act in which an employers denial of benefits satisfies criteria establishing that delays will cause an injured employee to incur severe economic hardship. Law Review.

IV. Procedure. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former § 65.1-1 or prior law. History of Act.  For a resume of the history, nature, scope and effect of the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act, see Feitig v. Chalkley, 185 Va. 96, 38 S.E.2d 73, 19 46 Va. LEXIS 183 (1946). Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act and amendments constitute one complete act. Commonwealth v. Granger, 188 Va. 502, 50 S.E.2d 390, 1948 Va. LEXIS 184 (1948). It is in aid of the Child Labor Law.  Liability imposed upon the employer by the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act is in aid of the Child Labor Law rather than opposed to it; infants, wh ether lawfully employed or not, are within the language and intent of the Act, and the remedy afforded by the Act is exclusive of all other remedies. Chalkley v. Nolde Bros., 184 Va. 553, 35 S.E.2d 827, 1945 Va. LEXIS 176 (1945). ERISA an d state disability laws.  Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) does not preempt Virginias workers compensation scheme requiring employers to provide security for the pay ment of occupational injury and illness benefits. Employers Resource Mgt. Co. v. James, 62 F.3d 627, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 22126 (4th Cir. 1995). While a state may not require an employer to alter its Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) plan, it may force the employer to choose between providing disability benefits in a separately administered plan and including the state-mandated benefits in its ERISA plan. If the state is not satisfied that the ERISA plan comports with the requirements of its disability insurance law, it may compel the employ er to maintain a separate plan that does comply. Employers Resource Mgt. Co. v. James, 62 F.3d 627, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 22126 (4th Cir. 1995). Congress did not intend, at the same time it preserved the role of state disability laws, to make enforcement of those laws impossible. A state may require an emp loyer to maintain a disability plan complying with state law as a separate administrative unit. Employers Resource Mgt. Co. v. James, 62 F.3d 627, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 22126 (4th Cir. 1995). General effect of Act.  The Act is said to be in the nature of a compromise between employer and employee to settle their differences arising out of personal injuries, but it is a compro mise greatly to the advantage of the employee. By it the question of the negligence of the employer is eliminated, the common-law doctrines of the assumption of risk, fellow servants, and contributory negligence are abolished, and the rules of evidence a re laxly enforced  so laxly that an award may be made on hearsay evidence alone, if credible, and not contradicted. The relief afforded is fixed, certain and speedy, and at a time when most needed. Under it there is no doubt or uncertainty as to the right of recovery or the amount thereof. The damage resulting from an accident is treated as a part of the expense of the business and to be borne as such, as much as the expense of repairing a piece of machinery which has broken down. Humphries v. Boxle y Bros. Co., 146 Va. 91, 135 S.E. 890, 1926 Va. LEXIS 314 (1926). Under the Act both employer and employee surrender former rights and gain certain advantages. The employee surrenders his right to bring an action at law against his employer for full damages and agrees to accept a sum fixed by statute. He gains a wider security in line with the more inclusive recovery afforded. The employer surrenders his right of defense on the grounds of contributory negligence, assumption of risk and the fellow servant rule. He is relieved from liability for damages to the employee for which in an ordinary negligence case he might otherwise be liable to a much greater extent. Fauver v. Bell, 192 Va. 518, 65 S.E.2d 575, 1951 Va. LEXIS 199 (19 51). As to an employer coming within its terms, the Act imposes a legal obligation to compensate financially the injured employee for an injury received in the course of and arising out of his employment, or the employees dependents in the case of his death. Thus, the statute reads into every contract of employment within the purview of the Act the obligation of the employer to pay, and the right of the employee o r his dependents to recover, such benefits. Glassco v. Glassco, 195 Va. 239, 77 S.E.2d 843, 1953 Va. LEXIS 193 (1953). United States Constitution does not prevent the Virginia Workers Compensation Act from applying to an accident, where the worker was employed by the employer as an insulator and was repairing insulation on board a vessel moored at the employers facility in Norfolk, Virginia; since the employee was injured in a local, maritime in dustrial accident.

The earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of 52 weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, divided by 52; but if the injured employee lost more than seven consecutive calendar days during such period, although not in the same week, then the earnings for the remainder of the 52 weeks shall be divided by the number of weeks remaining after the time so lost has been deducted. When the employment prior to the injury exten ded over a period of less than 52 weeks, the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the employee earned wages shall be followed, provided that results fair and just to both parties will be thereby obtained. When, by reason of a shortness of time during which the employee has been in the employment of his employer or the casual nature or terms of his employment, it is impractical to compute the average weekly wages as above defined, regard shall be had to the average weekly amount which during the 52 weeks previous to the injury was being earned by a person of the same grade and character employed in the same class of employment in the same locality or community. b. When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair either to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury. 2. Whenever allowances of any character made to an employee in lieu of wages are a specified part of the wage contract, they shall be deemed a part of his earnings. For the purpose of thi s title, the average weekly wage of the members of the Virginia National Guard and the Virginia Defense Force, registered members on duty or in training of the United States Civil Defense Corps of the Commonwealth, volunteer firefighters engaged in firef ighting activities under the supervision and control of the Department of Forestry, and forest wardens shall be deemed to be such amount as will entitle them to the maximum compensation payable under this title; however, any award entered under the provi sions of this title on behalf of members of the National Guard or their dependents, or registered members on duty or in training of the United States Civil Defense Corps of the Commonwealth or their dependents, shall be subject to credit for benefits pai d them under existing or future federal law on account of injury or occupational disease covered by the provisions of this title. 3. Whenever volunteer firefighters, volunteer emergency medical services personnel, volunteer law-enforcement chaplains, auxiliary or reserve police, auxiliary or reserve deputy sheriffs, members of volunteer search and rescue organizations, volunteer members of community emergency response teams, and volunteer members of medical reserve corps are deemed employees under this title, their average weekly wage shall be deemed sufficient to produce the minimum compensation provided by this title for injured workers or their dependents. For the purposes of workers compensation insurance premium calculations, the monthly payroll for each volunteer firefighter or volunteer who is an indivi dual who meets the definition of emergency medical services personnel in § 32.1-111.1 shall be deemed to be $300. 4. The average weekly wage of persons, other than those covered in subdivision 3 of this definition, who respond to a hazardous materials incident at the request of the Department of Emer gency Management shall be based upon the earnings of such persons from their primary employers. Award means the grant or denial of benefits or other relief under this title or any ru le adopted pursuant thereto. Change in condition means a change in physical condition of the employee as well as an y change in the conditions under which compensation was awarded, suspended, or terminated which would affect the right to, amount of, or duration of compensation. Client company means any person that enters into an agreement for professional employe r services with a professional employer organization. Coemployee means an employee performing services pursuant to an agreement for professi onal employer services between a client company and a professional employer organization. Commission means the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission as well as its forme r designation as the Virginia Industrial Commission. Employee means: 1. a. Eve ry person, including aliens and minors, in the service of another under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, written or implied, whether lawfully or unlawfully employed, except (i) one whose employment is not in the usual course of the trade, business , occupation or profession of the employer or (ii) as otherwise provided in subdivision 2 of this definition. b. Any apprentice, trainee, or retrainee who is regularly employed while receiving training or instruction outside of regular working hours and off the job, so long as the training o r instruction is related to his employment and is authorized by his employer. c. Members of the Virginia National Guard, whether on duty in a paid or unpaid status or when performing voluntary service to their unit in a nonduty status at the request of their c ommander.Income benefits for members of the National Guard shall be terminated when they are able to return to their customary civilian employment or self-employment. If they are neither employed nor self-employed, those benefits shall terminate when the y are able to return to their military duties. If a member of the National Guard who is fit to return to his customary civilian employment or self-employment remains unable to perform his military duties and thereby suffers loss of military pay which he would otherwise have earned, he shall be entitled to one day of income benefits for each unit training assembly or day of paid training which he is unable to attend. d. Members of the Virginia Defense Force. e. Registered members of the United States Civil Defense Corps of the Commonwealth, whether on duty or in training. f. Except as provided in subdivision 2 of this definition, all officers and employees of the Commonwealth, including (i) forest wardens; (ii) judges, clerks, deputy clerks and employ ees of juvenile and domestic relations district courts and general district courts; and (iii) secretaries and administrative assistants for officers and members of the General Assembly employed pursuant to § 30-19.4 and compensated as provided in the general appropriation act, who shall be deemed employees of the Commonwealth. g.

However, notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this subdivision, such individuals who would otherwise be deemed to be employees of the city, county, or town in which their services are employed and by whom their salaries are paid or in which their compensation is earnable shall be deemed to be employees of the Commonwealth while rendering aid outside of the Commonwealth pursuant to a request, approved by the Commonwealth, under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact enacted pursuant to § 44-146.28:1. j. Members of the governing body of any county, city, or town in the Commonwealth, whenever coverage under this title is extended to such members by resolution or ordinance duly adop ted. k. Volunteers, officers and employees of any commission or board of any authority created or controlled by a local governing body, or any local agency or public service corporation o wned, operated or controlled by such local governing body, whenever coverage under this title is authorized by resolution or ordinance duly adopted by the governing board of any county, city, town, or any political subdivision thereof. l.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Covid-19.  If a first responder becomes ill from COVID-19 from an exposure at work, it is likely a compensable illness under the Workers Compensation Act. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Ken Stolle, Sheriff, City of Virginia Beach, 20-024, 2020 Va. AG LEXIS 21 (5/22/20). If COVID-19 is an upper respiratory disease, it falls under the heart and lung presumption of the Act for first responders, however the statutory presumption appl ies only to a limited class of first responders under certain circumstances and, therefore, would not have broad applicability to all or most of the first responders whose official duties regularly place them at far greater risk of contracting COVID-19 t han the general public following social distancing guidelines. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Ken Stolle, Sheriff, City of Virginia Beach, 20-024, 2020 Va. AG LEXIS 21 (5/22/20). A first responder who has the benefit of a presumption, has the initial burden of producing evidence to trigger the presumption (evidence of the disease, and evid ence of disability or death caused by the disease); once the presumption is triggered, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption (that the disease was not caused by the employment and that there is a non-work-related cause).

Health Sys., 64 Va. App. 550, 769 S.E.2d 717, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 96 (2015). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION This section is only applicable when a physical or mental condition prevents claimant from testifying under oath. No evidence was presented indicating a physical or mental condition prevented claimant from testifying or understanding the meaning of the oath. The fact that his injury prevented him from recalling how his accident occurred is not sufficient to invoke the presumption afforded by Va. § 65.2-105. Ro sales v.

For essay, The Court of Appeals of Virginia Celebrates Thirty Years of Service to the Commonwealth, see 50 U. Rich. L. Rev. 217 (2015). CASE NOTES Failure to have full c ommission hear the review.  Decision reviewing the award of benefits to a claimant was reversed on appeal as the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission lacked authority to review the e mployers appeal of that decision as a result of having only two out of three statutorily required Commissioners hear the review due to a vacancy existing on the Commission. The employer had not waived the issued since it had raised the same in a moti on to reconsider or vacate the decision. Hitt Constr. v. Pratt, 53 Va. App. 422, 672 S.E.2d 904, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2009). Matter was not heard before a properly constituted full Virginia Workers Compensation Commission because only two of the three statutorily authorized commissi oners decided it; because the Commissions authority is a matter of legislative prerogative, the Commission is bound by the plain meaning of the words in the Workers Compensation Act, and § 17.1-327, which fail to provide the authority to recal l or designate a retired commissioner to serve in a review proceeding. Layne v. Crist Elec. Contr., Inc., 62 Va. App. 632, 751 S.E.2d 679, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 371 (2013). Composition of review panel.  Employer failed to support its contention that there was no employer representative because there was no evidence pertaining to the previous vocation, employment or affiliation of the Chief Deputy Virginia Workers Compensation Commissioner to determine whether or not he acted as an employer representative. McCluster v. Baltazar, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2017). Composition of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission review panel was proper because the mechanism provided in subsection D of § 65.2-705, was trigg ered since one commissioner was absent, and thus, the chairman appointed a deputy commissioner to the review panel, which consisted of two commissioners and one deputy commissioner; because a majority of commissioners existed, a quorum was achieved, and the review panel was authorized to take judicial, legislative, and discretionary action. McCluster v. Baltazar, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2017). Prior affiliation of a deputy commissioner appointed to serve on a review panel is irrelevant as to whether the panel was properly constituted. Dollar Tree Stores , Inc. v. Tefft, 69 Va. App. 15, 813 S.E.2d 908, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 146 (2018). Language of both subsection D of § 65.2-705 and subsection D of § 65.2-200 is clear and unambiguous. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. v. Tefft, 69 Va. App. 15, 813 S.E.2d 908, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 146 (2018). Under the plain language of subsection D of § 65.2-705, the statute only requires that when a retired member is recalled to serve on a review panel, they must occupy the seat, i.e., be of the same classification as the commission member they are replacing; as this portion of the statute plainly refers only to retired members of the commission, it does not compel the conclusion that a deputy com missioner, serving by appointment on a review panel, must be of a certain affiliation. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. v. Tefft, 69 Va. App. 15, 813 S.E.2d 908, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 146 (2018). Workers Compensation Commission properly found that the composition of the review panel did not contravene the statutory requirement because the chairman of t he commission correctly appointed a deputy commissioner to participate in the panel in light of a commissioners absence; the deputy commissioner was not and had never been a retired member of the commission, and thus, his background as either an employee or employer representative was irrelevant.

It shall be the duty of the Commission to administer this title and adjudicate issues and controversies relating thereto. In all matters within the jurisdiction of the Commission, it shall have the power of a court of record to administer oath, to compel the attend ance of witnesses and the production of documents, to punish for contempt, to appoint guardians pursuant to Part C (§ 64.2-1700 et seq.) of Subtitle IV of Title 64.2, and to enforce compliance with its lawful orders and awards. The Commission shall ma ke rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions of this title. B. The Commiss ion may appoint deputies, bailiffs, and such other personnel as it may deem necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this title. C. The Commiss ion or any member thereof or any person deputized by it may for the purposes of this title subpoena witnesses, administer or cause to be administered oaths, and examine or cause to be examined such parts of the books and records of the parties to a proce eding as relate to questions in dispute arising in instances in which the Commission has power to award compensation. This authority shall extend to requests from like agencies of other states who honor similar requests from the Commission. D. The Commiss ion shall publish and, upon request, furnish free of charge, such blank forms and literature as it shall deem requisite to facilitate or promote the efficient administration of this title. The Commission shall publish a workers compensation guide for employees which informs an injured employee of his rights under this title. If the Commission receives notice of an accident, it shall provide a workers compensation guide to the employee. E. A majority of the commissioners, including any deputy commissioner appointed or retired commissioner recalled pursuant to subsection D of § 65.2-705, shall constitute a quorum for the exercise of judicial, legislative, and discretionary functions of the Commissi on, whether there is a vacancy in the Commission or not, but a quorum shall not be necessary for the exercise of its administrative functions. F. The Commiss ion shall tabulate the accident reports received from employers in accordance with § 65.2-900 and shall publish the same in the annual report of the Commission and as often as it may deem advisable, in such detailed or aggregate form as it may deem be st. The name of the employer or employee shall not appear in such publications, and the employers reports shall be private records of the Commission and shall not be open for public inspection except for the inspection by the parties directly involve d, and only to the extent of such interest. These reports shall not be used as evidence against any employer in any suit at law brought by any employee for the recovery of damages. History History.

The Commission has the power to enter awards granting or denying benefits under the Work ers Compensation Act and dictating the terms under which those benefits will be paid as long as those terms do not conflict with the requirements of the Act. Rusty's Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, 29 Va. App. 119, 510 S.E.2d 255, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 67 (1999). Duty of Commission.  Workers Compensation Commission erred in applying a per se prejudice standard to find that the employers filing of an accident report involving the claim of the claimant, which was made more than two years after the claimants accident and outside the statute of limitations, tolled the statute of limitations which otherwise would have barred the claimants application for benefits. Rather, it should have applied an actual prejudice standard because the evidence showed that it fulfilled its duty of notifying the claimant in an earlier case that she only had a certain amount of time to file a claim, and, thus, in the present case the claimant may hav e been aware that she only had a certain amount of time to file a claim, which would undercut her argument that she did not know that she had to file a workers compensation claim within two years. Hall v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 41 Va. App. 835, 589 S.E.2d 484, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 642 (2003). Virginia Workers Commissions authority under the statute to administer this title and to make rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions of thi s title, cannot be enlarged to include the administration of provisions that are not expressly set forth in Title 65.2 or the power to recall or designate a retired commissioner to serve in review proceedings by rule or regulatory proceeding; the General Assembly did not confer that authority on the Commission, and none can be presumed. Layne v. Crist Elec. Contr., Inc., 62 Va. App. 632, 751 S.E.2d 679, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 371 (2013). Authority of Commission.  Even if the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission incorrectly used the term law of the case in the second review opinion, there was no reversible e rror as the Commission had the authority to limit or permit reconsideration of any issues it had already decided when it reviewed the case again after remanding the matter to a deputy commissioner, and the ruling in the second review opinion merely refle cted the practical reality that the Commission generally did not review the determinations it had already made. Meidan, Inc. v. Leavell, 62 Va. App. 436, 749 S.E.2d 201, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 291 (2013). Making and enforcing rules.  Commission has power to make and enforce rules not inconsistent with the Workers Compensation Act, to further the Acts provisions. Turpin v. Fairfax Count y Sch. Bd., 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 614 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 1999). Notice of rule passed under this s ection.  Employer and insurance carrier held charged with notice of rule of Commission passed pursuant to this section. Parker v. Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co., 201 Va. 328, 111 S.E.2d 453, 1959 Va. LEXIS 230 (1959). Rules may not be inconsistent with act .  As an administrative agency, the commission has been delegated authority to make rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions of the workers compensa tion act but that authority does not permit the commission to adopt rules that are inconsistent with the act. Brown v. United Airlines, Inc., 34 Va. App. 273, 540 S.E.2d 521, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 49 (2001). Inapplicability of A dministrative Process Act.  Where the Workers Compensation Commission merely implemented an expedited procedure to determine the continuing award or denial of claimants benefits, the Commission was acting in a quasi-judicial function and, therefore, was not subject to the Virginia Administrative Process Act. Williams v. VEPCO, 18 Va. App. 569, 445 S.E.2d 693, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1598, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 398 (1994). Deputy may be appo inted to sit with commissioners.  The Commission acted under the authority granted to it by § 65.2-203 when it appointed a deputy to sit with two members of the Commission to review the termina tion of an award. Clinch Valley Med. Ctr. v. Hayes, 34 Va. App. 183, 538 S.E.2d 369, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 835 (2000).

Such attendance, production, and examination shall be required by subpoena of the Commission upon timely request therefor by any party to a proceeding before it, unless the Commission finds that the issuance of such subpoena is for dilatory purposes, would cause substantial inconvenience to such witnesses, or is not likely to produce significant relevant evidence. B. The county or city sheriff or town sergeant, and their respective deputies, shall serve subpoenas of the Commission or its deputies and shall receive the same fees as are now provided by law for like civil actions. Each witness who appears in obedience to such sub poena of the Commission shall receive for attendance the fees and mileage for witnesses in civil cases in courts. C. The clerk o f any court of record shall, upon the application of any party in interest to a proceeding pending under this title, issue a subpoena for the attendance at such proceeding of any witness whose testimony is sought.

CASE NOTES Scope of authority of Workers Compensation Commission.  Workers Compensation Commission has the same authority as a court to punish for noncompliance with its discovery orders and it has the inherent authority to s trike a partys defenses for failure to comply with a discovery order. Jeff Coal, Inc. v. Phillips, 16 Va. App. 271, 430 S.E.2d 712, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1261, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 95 (1993). Commission has full authority to enforce its orders and protect itself from deception. W hile the language of former § 65.1-100.1 (now § 65.2-710) is permissive and provides that a party may enforce an award in court, it must be read and considered in pari materia with the Commissions power pursuant to former § 65.1-20 to punish for disobedience of its orders. Hudock v. Industrial Comm'n, 1 Va. App. 474, 340 S.E.2d 168, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (1986) (decided under prior law). Commissions discretion not unb ridled.  The decision to punish a party for disobedience of an order is a matter committed to the commissions discretion. An appellate court cannot, however, resign it s jurisdiction over an administrative agency or lower court simply because a matter is committed to that agencys or courts discretion. The discretion granted to such bodies is not unbridled. Rather, it is a judicial discretion, the exercise of wh ich implies conscientious judgment. Mason v. Danis Enters. Corp., 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 358 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 1995). Power of contempt.  The Commission, as a quasi-judicial body within the area of its jurisdiction, has the power of contempt over those in disobedience of its lawful orders. This is a concomitant of judicial power, necessary to the proper and effective discharge of its duties. Hudock v. Industrial Comm'n, 1 Va. App. 474, 340 S.E.2d 168, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (1986) (decided under prior law). The workers compensation commission has the same authority as a court to punish for noncompliance with its orders. Martin v. C &amp; J Clark Am., Inc., 1995 Va. A pp. LEXIS 926 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 29, 1995). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission abused its discretion in assessing 34 separate contempt fines for a professional employer organizations failure t o appear at a show cause hearing, one for each of its 34 client companies, as there was no statute or rule that vested the Commission with the authority to summarily divide one case into 34. Cura Group, Inc. v. Va. Workers' Comp. Comm'n, 45 Va. App. 559, 612 S.E.2d 735, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 181 (2005). When a judicial body punishes for contempt, it is obliged to use the least possible power adequate to the end proposed. Thus, when a contemnor is subjected to Draconian punitive measures, such as the outright dismissal of a case with prejudice or the striking of evidence central to a claim or defense, the record must support the assertion t hat no lesser sanction could have adequately compelled compliance and preserved the dignity of the tribunal. Mason v. Danis Enters. Corp., 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 358 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 1995). Laches held inapplicable.  In a contempt proceeding arising out of the charging of an improper attorneys fee, the doctrine of laches did not apply to delay from settlement of the claim to the finding of contempt, where, upon being advised by the claimant of the additional attorneys fee that had been charged, the Commission moved expeditiously. Hudock v. Industrial Comm'n, 1 Va. App. 474, 340 S.E.2d 168, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (198 6) (decided under prior law). Imposition of lesser sanctions warranted.  Where no fault could be charged to claimant other than on account of his selection of counsel, and in light of the deputy commissioners letter directing that counsel was alone responsible for rescheduling the deposition, the commission had within its power less extreme sanctions, which it should have imposed upon counsel as the responsible party, before imposing the most severe sanction of striking th e medical records. Mason v. Danis Enters. Corp., 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 358 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 1995). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Discovery: Where the claimant is on an outstanding award there is a proceeding under the title such as to allow for discovery, and the Commission has the authority to requir e the production of documents and other things. Habina v. Jasper Construction, VWC File No. 173-22-55 (Aug. 26, 2005). The 21 day time frame contained in Rule 1.8 for providing answers to interrogatories also applies to request for production of documents. After a party has been p rovided the initial 21 days, it is within the discretion of the deputy commissioner to determine the time frame for responses to an Order to Compel. Habina v. Jasper Construction, VWC File No. 173-22-55 (Aug. 26, 2005). Deputy Commissioner properly excluded video surveillance evidence because evidence was in existence prior to employers responses to discovery seeking such evi dence and employer did not produce evidence, as requested; employers assertion that employee would not be prejudiced by late admission of evidence not relevant to question of whether employer failed to comply with pre- hearing discovery. Davis v. Las co Bathware, VWC File No. 211-12-03 (Nov. 24, 2003). Deputy Commissioner properly refused to allow employer to call witness not identified in discovery; employers discovery response was that it had not decided w hom to call as witness; Commission agreed with Deputy Commissioners finding that this response was not complete when made and thus employer required to supplement response. Crowe v. Lowes of South Boston Va., VWC File No. 208-09-67 (Oct. 16, 2003 ). The Commission is vested with the authority of courts and judges to enforce the production of records. Since the Commission can enforce the production of records , the Commission may also determine what records are to be produced. Morgan v. Eastern State Hospital, 78 O.W.C. 192 (1999). An employee should not be compelled to seek out and obtain a document pursuant to a motion for production filed by an adverse party, absent evidence that the docu ment to be produced is otherwise unavailable to the requesting party. Zeballos v. Mendez, 75 O.W.C. 229 (1996). An employee cannot ignore or neglect proper discovery requests, but must answer them substantively within the time period allowed by discovery rules, or within th at period challenge requests she considers objectionable. Commission discovery orders may not be ignored with impunity. Dismissal of the claim is an appropriate sanction for such conduct. Zeballos v. Mendez, 75 O.W.C. 229 (1996). While the Act does not contain specific authority to impose sanctions as provided in Virginia Supreme Court Rule 4:12, Va. Ann. Code § 65.2-202 does grant the Commission the same authority to enforce its orders as is vested in the circuit courts of Virginia. This Section has been interpreted to include the sanctions set out in Rule 4:12. The Commissions authority to impose sanctions for failure to discov er are stated in Rule 1.12 of the Rules of the Commission. Foster v. Hooker Furniture Corp., 75 O.W.C. 355 (1996). Dismissal of a claim is not an appropriate sanction for dilatory conduct during discovery that obstructs the efficient administration of the claim, where the clai mant has finally complied. A more appropriate sanction for repeated dilatory conduct that obstructs the administration of the proceedings may be found in the Commissions power to punish for contempt, which may be enforced at an interlocutory show ca use hearing and may be more easily tailored to the degree of offense. Foster v. Hooker Furniture Corp., 75 O.W.C. 355 (1996).

CASE NOTES Deputy appointed to sit with commissioners.  The Commission acted under the authority granted to it by this section when it appointed a deputy to sit with two members of the Commission to review the terminat ion of an award. Clinch Valley Med. Ctr. v. Hayes, 34 Va. App. 183, 538 S.E.2d 369, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 835 (2000). Deputy commissioner authorized to take additional evidence.  The Commission has authority to take additional evidence. The Commission also has the power to delegate duties to the deputy commissioners. Therefore, the deputy commissioner has authority to take additional evidence in a case when ordered to do so by the Commission. Smith v. Weber, No. 0873-85 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 5, 1986) (decided under former § 65.1-12). Deputy commissioners authority.  Award of benefits to the claimant in a workers compensation action was appropriate, in part under subsection A of § 65.2-203 because the deputy commissione r and the Workers Compensation Commission were not plainly wrong in accepting the claimants testimony as credible. Oftentimes the full commission would not review the evidence in the same way that the deputy commissioner did and to the extent the full Commission had not actually viewed the witnesses and their appearance or demeanor, it naturally followed that it would simply adopt the deputy commissioners credibility determinations about those witnesses, which it was free to do without expla nation. Va. Int'l Terminals v. McCarthy, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 216 (Va. Ct. App. June 28, 2011). Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act Claims.  Deputy commissioner of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission who heard the claim filed under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensatio n Act, § 38.2-5000 et seq., had the power to extend nonjurisdictional filing deadlines and grant continuances. Kidder v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, 37 Va. App. 764, 560 S.E.2d 907, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (2002). Commission properly reversed deputy Commissioners termination of benefits.  As the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions finding that a surveillance tape did not show a claimant exceeding restrictions imposed by his doctor or that he failed to accurately report his condition to the doctor, and the deputy commissioner made no determination as to claimants credibility based on his demeanor, the Commission properly reversed the deputys order terminating benefits. Argenbr ight Sec., Inc. v. Jackson, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 8, 2005). Failure to have full commiss ion hear review.  Decision reviewing the award of benefits to a claimant was reversed on appeal as the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission lacked authority to review the e mployers appeal of that decision as a result of having only two out of three statutorily required Commissioners hear the review due to a vacancy existing on the Commission. The employer had not waived the issued since it had raised the same in a moti on to reconsider or vacate the decision. Hitt Constr. v. Pratt, 53 Va. App. 422, 672 S.E.2d 904, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2009). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Administrative agencies, like trial courts, speak through their orders. The Commissions orders determine whether a claim is dismissed, regardless of what the parties intended. Where no order was entered by the Commission dismissing Stellute, he is still a party to the proceedings. Eliason v.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Use of funds.  The Commission is not authorized under current law to use funds in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund to purchase a new office building in which to house the headquarters of the Commission and the Director of CICF and her staff. There is no constitutional or other legal impediment to the introduction of future legislation that would enable the Commission to utilize the Fund for such purposes. Effective July 1, 2013, the Commission is permitted to locate its headquarters outside the City of Richmond, provided the facility remains within the Commonwealth.

The Commiss ion may create an Ombudsman program and appoint an ombudsman to administer such program. The purpose of the Ombudsman program shall be to provide neutral educational information and assistance to persons who are not represented by an attorney, including those persons who have claims pending or docketed before the Commission. The ombudsman shall be an attorney licensed by the Virginia State Bar, in active status, and in good standing. The ombudsman and any Ombudsman program personnel shall carry out thei r duties with impartiality and shall not serve as an advocate for any person or provide legal advice. B. All memoran da, work products, and other materials contained in the case files of the ombudsman or Ombudsman program personnel shall be confidential. Any communication between the ombudsman or Ombudsman program personnel and a person receiving assistance as provided by this section that is made during or in connection with the provision of Ombudsman program services, including screening, intake, and scheduling, shall be confidential.Confidential materials and communications are not subject to disclosure and shall n ot be admissible in any judicial or administrative proceeding except where (i) a threat to inflict bodily injury is made; (ii) communications are intentionally used to plan, attempt to commit, or commit a crime or conceal an ongoing crime; (iii) a compla int is made against Ombudsman program personnel by a person receiving assistance to the extent necessary for the complainant to prove misconduct or the Ombudsman program personnel to defend against such complaint; or (iv) communications are sought or off ered to prove or disprove a claim or complaint of misconduct or malpractice filed against the legal representative of a person who received assistance from the Ombudsman program.Confidential materials and communications as described in this section are n ot subject to mandatory disclosure under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (§ 2.2-3700 et seq.).

Every emplo yer and employee, except as herein stated, shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of this title respectively to pay and accept compensation for personal injury or death by accident arising out of and in the course of the employmen t and shall be bound thereby. Except as otherwise provided herein, no contract or agreement, written or implied, and no rule, regulation or other device shall in any manner operate to relieve any employer in whole or in part of any obligation created by this title. B. An executiv e officer may reject coverage under this title for injury or death by accident, but not with respect to occupational disease, if prior to such accident, notice is given to the employer and filed with the Commission in the manner described herein.The noti ce shall be in substantially the form prescribed by the Commission and shall be given by the executive officer by sending the same in a registered letter, addressed to the employer at his last known address or place of business, or by giving it personall y to the employer or any of his agents upon whom a summons in a civil action may be served under the laws of the Commonwealth. A copy of the notice in prescribed form shall also be filed with the Commission.

D. An executiv e officer who has rejected coverage under this title may nevertheless by notice revoke such rejection and thereby accept coverage under the provisions of this title. A notice revoking such rejection shall be given to the employer and a copy filed with th e Commission in the manner provided for rejecting such coverage. Coverage under this title shall not be extended to injuries that occur within five days of the giving of such notice. History History.

Raven Red Ash Coal Co., 179 Va. 790, 20 S.E.2d 530, 1942 Va. LEXIS 275 (1942) (decided under prior law). Participation in the Virginia system is mandatory for all employees and employers covere d by the act. Dillard v. Industrial Comm'n, 416 U.S. 783, 94 S. Ct. 2028, 40 L. Ed. 2d 540, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 143 (1974) (decided under prior law). Exempted employers must give employees notice of intention to come under act.  It is the manifest purpose of the rules of the Commission promulgated pursuant to the authority granted by former § 65.1-18 (see now § 65.2-201) to require an employer of the class excluded by this section, including farmers, desiring to come within the purview of the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act, to so notify his employees, either by posting notices of his intention in a place or places where they are likely to be seen by the employees, or, where such posting is not practicable, to give such employees actual notice of his intention. Any employee then has the right to reject the Act by so notifying the Commission, and in the absence of s uch notification the employees are presumed to have elected to be bound by the act. Dey v. Logan, 175 Va. 68, 7 S.E.2d 102, 1940 Va. LEXIS 147 (1940) (decided under prior law). Dece dent did not suffer identifiable compensable injury.  Where Workers Compensation Commission denied benefits after claimants husband suffered from sudden cardiac arrest while he was exposed to radar waves at w ork and died, claimant failed to establish that the husband suffered an identifiable compensable injury because claimants alleged identifiable incident, three weeks of exposure for six to eight hours per workday, was an example of repeated exposures over weeks, not a single, definite occasion of exposure. Johnson v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 61 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 8, 2022). Contractual releases.  Employees waiver of travel expenses and potential liability claims during transit did not run afoul of subsection A, which precluded contractual releases of s tatutory benefits except where permitted by statute, because such a stipulation, in form and substance, served as a partial compromise of an existing or potential claim, and was a binding and enforceable obligation that protected the employer against any exposure to travel reimbursement costs or to liability claims arising out of the transit to and from his treatment with the Virginia physician. Apple Constr. Corp. v. Sexton, 44 Va. App. 458, 605 S.E.2d 351, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 587 (2004). A truck drivers remedies against a statutory employer were limited to those exclusively provided under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-10 0 et seq., regardless of the contractual employment relationship between the driver and the statutory employer. Meredith v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 245 Fed. Appx. 325, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 20099 (4th Cir. 2007). Insurance contracts should not be interpreted by referencing the Workers Compensation Statute.  In the insurers declaratory action suit, the insured asserted that because Virginia Courts have concluded that sexual assault did not occur out of and in the course of employment under the Workers Compensation Statute, the court should have found that the identical language in the insurance policies did not extend to the employees claims for sexual assault and harassment; however, Virginia Courts inte rpreted insurance contracts according to their plain meaning, not by referencing the Workers Compensation Act. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. One Stop Cellular, Inc., No. 4:05-CV-00067, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63435 (W.D. Va. Sept. 6, 2006). No duty to take exclusive possession of parking lot.  Employer did not violate this section by failing to undertake maintenance of a parking lot, or by failing to take exclusive possession of the parking lot by its c ontract with its landlord because the statute clearly requires only that an employer not attempt to contract out of his or her duties and obligations under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act. It does not require that an employer make agree ments that would effectively extend its liability beyond the bounds of its own premises. Campbell v. Food Lion LLC, #835, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 364 (Va. Ct. App. July 27, 2004). Route carriers injuries sustained when she was shot while waiting at night to pick up newspapers to be delivered arose out of and in the course of her employment and her only remedy was under the act. Plummer v. Landmark Communications, Inc., 235 Va. 78, 365 S.E.2d 739 (1988) (decided under prior law). Squatting in front of machine no t covered.  Plaintiff was injured while engaged in an activity that is required and carried out in everyday life in many circumstances. In her own words, she described the sq uat in front of a machine as normal, and of the type you would make if you had to bend to pick up something at home, pick up around the house or whatever. Plaintiff was not holding anything at the time of the squat and conducted the motion in an unobstructed area. Where, as here, there was not significant exertion, the action of squatting involved no awkward position, and no condition peculiar to the workplace caused the injury, the injury cannot be said to have arisen out of the employm ent. Plaintiffs injury did not arise out of her employment, and therefore, it is noncompensable under this section. Bassett-Walker, Inc. v. Wyatt, No. 1002-96-3 (Ct. of Appeals March 4, 1997).

Williams v. City of Norfolk, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 73 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 1995). Enactment of section did not alter definition of injury by accident.  The General Assembly, in enacting this section, did not alter the definition of injury by accident found in Virginia case law as it relates to intentional act of sexual assault as coming within, rather than excluded from, the purview of the Act.

Injuries resulting from a sexual assault by a co-employee of police department.  Commission correctly determined that employee did not suffer an injury arising out of her employment; credible evidence supported the commissions dete rmination that the sexual assault on employee by co-employee was personal and not directed against her as an employee or because of her employment. In addition, credible evidence supported the Commissions conclusion that employees employment at t he police department did not substantially increase the risk of sexual assault. Carr v. City of Norfolk, 15 Va. App. 266, 422 S.E.2d 417, 9 Va. Law Rep. 435, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 266 (1992). The record failed to show an injury by accident arising out of the employment where employee was raped at work and the assailant, a customer, was personally acquainted with the employee, and on the day of the assault, his first inquiry was whether he and his intended victim were alone and he did not mention money; his first act was to shove her at knifepoint into the bathroom and there, behind a closed door, he forced her to submit to sexual relations and after taking money from his victims purse, he repeated the sexual assault, threatened to kill her and her children if she reported t he offenses to the authorities, and required her to remain in the bathroom when he left. Not until then did the rapist take time to steal the employers money from the petty cash box. Reamer v. National Serv. Indus., Inc., 237 Va. 466, 377 S.E.2d 627, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2035, 1989 Va. LEXIS 47 (1989) (decided under prior law). Proving requisite causal connection.  In order to prove the requisite causal connection between an employees sexual assault and the conditions under which the employer required the work to be perf ormed, the evidence must show that the attack was directed against the claimant as an employee or because of the employment. Moreover, the statutory presumption of this section applies only when it appears that the nature of the employment substantially increased the risk of sexual assault. Williams v. City of Norfolk, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 73 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 1995). A sexual assault on a police woman by her co-worker was personal and not directed against her as an employee or because of her employment. In addition, her employ ment at the central police desk did not substantially increase the risk of sexual assault. Carr v. City of Norfolk, 15 Va. App. 266, 422 S.E.2d 417, 9 Va. Law Rep. 435, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 266 (1992). The plaintiff was precluded by the Acts exclusive remedies provision under this sect ion, from seeking redress in court for her personal injuries which were sustained when her employer fired her and forcibly removed her from the place of employment. Sutter v. First Union Nat'l Bank, 932 F. Supp. 753, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10985 (E.D. Va. 1996). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Claimant, a female correctional officer, was found to have sustained a compensable injury after she was grabbed by a nude inmate in a bear hug around her arms, an d the inmate later pled guilty to the charge of aggravated sexual battery. Claimant would also have been entitled to compensation for a purely psychological injury, even in the context of a prison environment, because the confrontation by a naked convict ed rapist was a sudden shocking or frightening event.

When any pe rson (referred to in this section as owner) undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (referred to in this section as subcontractor) for the executio n or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay to any worker employed in the work any compensation under this title which he would have been liable to pay if the worker had been immediately employed by him. B. When any pe rson (referred to in this section as contractor) contracts to perform or execute any work for another person which work or undertaking is not a part of the trade, business or occupation of such other person and contracts with any other person (re ferred to in this section as subcontractor) for the execution or performance by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such contractor, then the contractor shall be liable to pay to any worker employed in th e work any compensation under this title which he would have been liable to pay if that worker had been immediately employed by him. C. When the su bcontractor in turn contracts with still another person (also referred to as subcontractor) for the performance or execution by or under such last subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by the first subcontractor, then the liability of the owner or contractor shall be the same as the liability imposed by subsections A and B of this section. D. 1. Liability for compensation pursuant to this section may not be imposed against any p erson who, at the time of an injury sustained by a worker engaged in the maintenance or repair of real property managed by such person, and for which injury compensation is sought: a.

Did not engage in and had no employees engaged in the same trade, business or occupation as the worker seeking compensation; and c. Did not seek or obtain from such propertys owners, or from any other property owners for whom such person rendered property management services, profit from the services perfo rmed by individuals engaged in the same trade, business or occupation as the worker seeking compensation. 2. For purposes of this subsection, the business of property management means the oversight, supervision, and care of real property or improvements to real property, on behalf of such propertys owners. 3. For purposes of this subsection, property owners or propertys owners means (i) owners in fee of such property or (ii) persons having legal entitlement to the use or occupation of such property at the time of the injury for which liability is sought to be imposed pursuant to this section.

I.General Consideration. Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former §§ 65.1-29, 65.1-30, and 65.1-31 or prior law. Purpose.  The purpose of former §§ 65.1-29 through 65.1-34 is to bring within the operation of the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act all persons engaged in any work that is a part of the trade, business or occupation of the original party who undertakes as owner, or contracts as contractor, to perform that work, and to make liable to every employee engaged in that work every such owner, or contractor, a nd subcontractor, above such employee. Sykes v. Stone &amp; Webster Eng'r Corp., 186 Va. 116, 41 S.E.2d 469, 1947 Va. LEXIS 135 (1947); Anderson v. Thorington Constr. Co., 201 Va. 266, 110 S.E.2d 396, 1959 Va. LEXIS 221 (1959); Turnage v. Northern Va. Steel Corp., 336 F.2d 837, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4303 (4th Cir. 1964); Vandergrift v. United States, 500 F. Supp. 237, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8325 (E.D. Va. 1979), aff'd, 634 F.2d 628 (4th Cir. 1980); Smith v. Horn, 232 Va. 302, 351 S.E.2d 14, 3 Va. Law Rep. 126 5, 1986 Va. LEXIS 257 (1986). The legislative intention in enacting this section was to impose the obligations of the Act upon an owner in every case in which the work being done is a kind of work which employees of the owner usually or appropriately do, though, in the particular instance, some or all of the work is being accomplished through independent contractors. Walker v. United States Gypsum Co., 270 F.2d 857, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 5062 (4th Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 363 U.S. 805, 80 S. Ct. 1240, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1148, 1960 U.S. LEXIS 1084 (1960). The purpose of this section is to bring within the operation of the Workers Compensation Act all persons engaged in any work that is a part of the trade, busi ness, or occupation of the owner which is customarily done by the owners employees. Southeastern Tidewater Area Manpower Auth. v. Coley, 221 Va. 859, 275 S.E.2d 589, 1981 Va. LEXIS 220 (1981); Pearman v. United States, 528 F. Supp. 598, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16545 (W.D. Va. 1981). This section is to prevent employers from escaping coverage of the Workers Compensation Act by doing, through independent contractors and subcontractors, what they normally would do through employees. Vess v. Davis Elec. Constructors, Inc., 613 F. Supp. 1047, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17775 (W.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 818 F.2d 30, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 5600 (4th Cir. 1987). The central purpose of this section is to bring within the operation of the compensation act all persons engaged in any work that is a part of the trade, business or occupation of the original party who undertakes as owner, or contracts as contractor, to perform that work, and to make liable to every employee engaged in that work every such owner, contractor and subcontractor above the employee. Vess v. Davis Ele c. Constructors, Inc., 613 F. Supp. 1047, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17775 (W.D. Va. 1985), aff'd, 818 F.2d 30, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 5600 (4th Cir. 1987). Former § 65.1-30, as well as the parallel provisions contained in former §§ 65.1-29 and 65.1-31, were designed to assure employees of protection under th e Act. Together these provisions imposed liability on an owner, contractor or subcontractor who subcontracted work which was a part of his trade to another person or a subcontractor who in turn subcontracted with another person. All were liable to pay co mpensation to any worker employed in the work that each undertook. Smith v. Weber, 3 Va. App. 379, 350 S.E.2d 213, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1114, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 372 (1986). This provision is meant to prevent an owner from escaping liability under the Workers Compensation Act by the simple expedient of subcontracting away work whi ch is part of its trade, business, or occupation. Such an owner will remain liable under the Act to the extent the work subcontracted is part of that owners trade, business, or occupation. Henderson v. Central Tel. Co., 233 Va. 377, 355 S.E.2d 596, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2494, 1987 Va. LEXIS 203 (1987). The primary purpose of this section is to protect the employees of subcontractors who are not financially responsible and to prevent employers from relieving them selves of liability (for compensation) by doing through independent contractors what they would otherwise do through direct employees. Oakwood Hebrew Cem. Assn v. Spurlock, No. 1978-91-2 (Ct. of Appeals Aug. 18, 1992). The purpose of the statute is to expand the popular definition of employer in order to bring within the Virginia Workers Compensation Act independent contractors and subcontractors who are engaged in work that is part of the trade, business, or occupation of the owner. McCotter v. Smithfield Packing Co., 849 F. Supp. 443, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5164 (E.D. Va. 1994). Purpose of this section is to insure compensation coverage for employees of independent contractors and subcontractors, not the subcontractor himself. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Coleman, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 662 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 7, 1999). The plain meaning of this section is to hold the statutory employer liable to pay compensation as if the worker were his own immediate employee, and the posture of the statutory employer, once he is established as such, is thus one of direct liability. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Coleman, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 662 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 7, 199 9). Former § 65.1-104.2 (see now § 65.2-802) does not remove right to proceed under this s ection.  The fact that all members of the Virginia Coal Producers Group (VCPG) are jointly and severally obligated to each other under former § 65.1-104.2 does not remo ve from an injured employee the right to proceed against a statutory employer under this section, but rather, the joint and several liability of the members of the VCPG under former § 65.1-104.2 si...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-303"><akn:num>§ 65.2-303</akn:num><akn:heading>Recovery from subcontractor; proceedings against owner or contractor</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Nothing in §§ 65.2-302 and 65.2-304 shall be construed as preventing a worker from recovering compensation under this title from a subcontractor (as described in § 65.2-302) instead of from the principal contractor (as described in § 65.2-302) but he sh all not collect from both. B. When compen sation is claimed from or proceedings are taken against the owner or contractor (as described in § 65.2-302), then, in the application of this title, reference to the owner or contractor shall be substituted for reference to the subcontractor (as desc ribed in § 65.2-302), except that the amount of compensation shall be calculated with reference to the earnings of the worker under the subcontractor by whom he is immediately employed. History History. Code 1950, §§ 65-29, 65-31; 1968, c. 660, §§ 65.1-32, 65.1-34; 1991, c. 355. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 21 M.J. Workers Compensation, § 10. CASE NOTES Owner becomes statutory employer of contractors employees.  Former §§ 65.1-29 through 65.1-32 (now § 65.2-302 and this section) required the owners of a project to accept responsibility for the compensation of inj ured employees of contractors hired by the owner. The owner thus became the statutory employer of the contractors employees who, in turn, were the statutory employees of the owner. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 722 F.2d 74, 1983 U.S . App. LEXIS 14855 (4th Cir. 1983) (decided under former § 65.1-32). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Nothing in this section provides an exception to the Workers Compensation exclusivity provision.  Employees claim brought under § 65.2-303 alleging his employers failure to provide him with medical attention following an eye injury at work, leading to an infection and permanent loss of vision, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the Workers Compensation Act applied exclusively.

NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION The employees of an uninsured sub-subcontractor may look to the subcontractor, and to the general contractor, for workers compensation coverage, although reco very is not permitted from both.

A principal contractor when sued by a worker of a subcontractor shall have the right to join that subcontractor or any intermediate contractor as a party. History History. Code 1950, § 65-30; 1968, c. 660, § 65.1-33; 1991, c. 355. Annotations CASE NOTES Cancellation of subcontractors insurance without notice to contractor did not impose liability on it as a statutory employer without due process of law; contractors liability arose from its employment of subcontractor and, vicariously, subcontractors employee; its liability as a statutory employer existed without reference to in surance; furthermore, if it were obliged to pay benefits to employee, it was entitled to seek indemnity from subcontractor, and therefore, this was a circumstance which did not fix liability on contractor. Girdley Constr. Co. v. Widger, 1990 Va. App. LEX IS 241 (Va. Ct. App. May 29, 1990) (decided under former § 65.1-33). Indemnity action against subcont ractor.  Trial court did not err in granting the subcontractors demurrer in the general contractors indemnity action against the subcontractor after the injured em ployee of the subcontractor obtained workers compensation benefits from the general contractor; the general contractor in its indemnity action had to show that the subcontractor was liable to pay the workers compensation benefits, but the general contractor failed to plead facts showing that the subcontractor, which had a principal place of business in Maryland, was subject to the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-100 et seq., as the general contractor did not show that the subcon tractor had at least three employees regularly in the service of the Commonwealth, as was required pursuant to § 65.2-101 to subject an employer to the Act. Mark Five Constr., Inc. v. Castle Contr., 274 Va. 283, 645 S.E.2d 475, 2007 Va. LEXIS 80 (2007 ). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Where an owner undertakes to perform work with his own employees and contracts part of work to another, such owner makes such work part of his trade, business or occupation and is liable to injured employee of contractor, but is entitled to indemnity from contractor for payment to contractors employee. Allen v. Sage, 47 O.I.C. 1 (1965) (appeal denied). Immediate employer and statutory employer both liable for compensation but the latter may have right of indemnification against the former. Sheets v. Blevins, 55 O.I.C. 313, 316 (1973); Scott v. Wilkins, 50 O.I.C. 292 (1968). If the immediate employer of injured workman has the required number of employees and can comply with an award for compensation he, rather than the owner or other intervening contractor, will be directed to make the payments, the liability under § 65.1-29 to § 65.1-31 (now § 65.2-302) of persons other than the immediate employer being secondary only. Possin v. Eubank, 12 O.I.C. 444 (1930). An employee is not required to file a claim against his immediate employer but may elect to file a claim against any statutory employer in the ascending employmen t hierarchy who receives timely notice of the accident as required by statute.

Insurer of statutory employer paid compensation to employee, entitled to award against immediate employer. Harland v. Lake Edward Corp., 55 O.I.C. 156 (1973). Insurer of statutory employer paid compensation to employee; immediate employer did not have five [now three] employees, had not elected to be bound by Act; insur er not entitled to indemnity.

No compensa tion shall be awarded to the employee or his dependents for an injury or death caused by: 1. The e mployees willful misconduct or intentional self-inflicted injury; 2. The employees attempt to injure another; 3. The employees intoxication; 4. The employees willful failure or refusal to use a safety appliance or perform a duty required by statute; 5.

The employees use of a nonprescribed controlled substance identified as such in Chapter 34 (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.) of Title 54.1. B. The person or entity asserting any of the defenses in this section shall have the burden of proof with respect thereto. However, if the employer raises as a defense the employees intoxication or use of a nonprescribed controlled substance identified as such in Chapter 34 of Title 54.1, and there was at the time of the injury an amount of alcohol or nonprescribed controlled substance in the bodily fluids of the employee which (i) is equal to or greater than the standard set forth in § 18.2-266, or (ii) in th e case of use of a nonprescribed controlled substance, yields a positive test result from a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) certified laboratory, there shall be a rebuttable presumption, which presumption shall not be a vailable if the employee dies as a result of his injuries, that the employee was intoxicated due to the consumption of alcohol or using a nonprescribed controlled substance at the time of his injury.

Safety Rules, Regulations, etc. II. Intoxication, Nonprescribed Controlled Substance. I.Intentional Acts. Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-38 or prior law. A.Willfulness genera lly. Willful imports something more than a mere exercise of the will in doing the act . It imports a wrongful intention, an intention to do an act that the employee knows, or ought to know, is wrongful, or forbidden by law. It involves the idea of premeditation and determination to do the act, though known to be forbidden. There cannot be a willful failure to perform an unknown duty. The language used in this section covers something more than negligence, however gross. King v. Empire Collieries Co., 148 Va. 585, 139 S.E. 478, 1927 Va. LEXIS 257 (1927). Willful misconduct is a question of fact.  The question of whether an employee was guilty of willful misconduct is a question of fact to be resolved by the commission. Watford v. Colonial Williamsburg Foun dation, 13 Va. App. 501, 413 S.E.2d 69, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1662, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 2 (1992) (decided under former § 65.1-38). This claim was denied on the ground that the employee who died in an industrial accident had engaged in willful misconduct. Adams ex rel. Boysaw v. Hercules, Inc. , 21 Va. App. 458, 465 S.E.2d 135, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 931 (1995). The questions of whether an employee is guilty of willful misconduct and whether such misconduct is a proximate cause of the employees accident are issues of fact. Brockway v. Easter, 20 Va. App. 268, 456 S.E.2d 159, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 452 (1995). Willful misconduct in abstract mixed question of fact and law.  Whether employees conduct in the abstract constitutes willful misconduct is a mixed question of fact and law and is reviewable by Court of Appeals. Buzzo v. W oolridge Trucking, Inc., 17 Va. App. 327, 437 S.E.2d 205, 10 Va. Law Rep. 578, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 560 (1993). It signifies with deliberate intent.  The meaning of the word willful in this connection is with deliberate intent. If the employee knows the rule, and yet intentionally does the forbi dden thing, he has willfully failed to obey the rule. Riverside &amp; Dan River Cotton Mills, Inc. v. Thaxton, 161 Va. 863, 172 S.E. 261, 1934 Va. LEXIS 311 (1934). Willful misconduct requires something more than negligence.  Willful . . . imports something more than a mere exercise of the will in doing the act. I t imports a wrongful intention. One of the salutary purposes of workers compensation acts is to provide specified benefits for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment regardless of fault of the employer or employee, except instanc es of willful misconduct or intentional injury. The common law defense of contributory negligence is abolished by the act. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Keppel, 1 Va. App. 162, 335 S.E.2d 851, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 78 (1985). Negligence, regardless how gross, does not bar recovery for workers compensation ben efits. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Keppel, 1 Va. App. 162, 335 S.E.2d 851, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 78 (1985). Where it was unclear whether an employees failure to stop at a stop sign was willful disobedience or negligence, the employee was improperly denied workers  compensation benefits for his injures in an accident arising from his failure to stop; willful misconduct requires something more than negligence. Finney v. Mason, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 344 (Va. Ct. App. July 13, 2004). Proof of negligence, even gross negligence, alone will not support the defense, for will ful misconduct imports something more than a mere exercise of the will in doing the act; it imports a wrongful intention. Buzzo v. Woolridge Trucking, Inc., 17 Va. App. 327, 437 S.E.2d 205, 10 Va. Law Rep. 578, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 560 (1993). Proof of negligence will not support the defense of willful misconduct; willful miscondu ct requires something more than negligence. Phipps v. Rann Indus., Inc., 16 Va. App. 394, 429 S.E.2d 886, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1342, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (1993). Notice and bur den of proof.  This section and Rule 4 of the Rules of the Industrial (now Workers Compensation) Commission merely require the giving of notice if the employer intends to in terpose an affirmative defense to bar an otherwise meritorious claim. Neither provision relieves the claimant of the burden of proving his case. Anderson v. East Coast Fish &amp; Scallop, 10 Va. App. 215, 391 S.E.2d 347, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2306, 1990 Va. App. LE XIS 69 (1990). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly found that a workers compensation benefits claimants evidence established an injury by accident beca use there were no inconsistencies in the claimants testimony; because a credible claim was established, evidence of self-inflicted injury under § 65.2-306 could only be admitted to contradict the claim upon notice that the defense would be raised, and an employer failed to give such notice. Jenkins v. Webb, 52 Va. App. 206, 662 S.E.2d 633, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (2008). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly awarded a workers compensation claimant benefits because an employer offered no excuse or explanation fo r its failure to comply with the notice requirements of Va. Workers Comp. Commn R. 1.10; the employer never asserted a self-inflicted injury defense under § 65.2-306, and the failure to give proper notice deprived the claimant of the opportuni ty to subpoena witnesses and gather evidence in response to the defense. Jenkins v. Webb, 52 Va. App. 206, 662 S.E.2d 633, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (2008). Suicide may be compensable.  Where injury and its consequences directly result in workers loss of normal judgment and domination by a disturbance of the mind causing the suicide, his suic ide is compensable. A suicide committed by worker suffering from this degree of disturbance is not considered willful or an intentional injury even though the action is volitional since the suicide relates back to the original injury rath er than existing independently of the injury. Food Distribs. v. Estate of Ball, 24 Va. App. 692, 485 S.E.2d 155, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 311 (1997). Fa ilure to report OSHA violation.  Evidence was not sufficient to show that complainant was guilty of willful misconduct by failing to report an Occupational Safety &amp; Health Act (OSHA) violation. W yle v. Professional Services Industries, 12 Va. App. 684, 406 S.E.2d 410, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2961, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 142 (1991). Facts not showing willful misconduct.  Where a member of the national guard, while returning to camp with an intoxicated companion, suffered injury when struck by an electric car while attempting to re cover his companion from the track, it was held that the fact that claimant might have dozed while sitting on the track was not such misconduct as precluded recovery under this section. Globe Indem. Co. v. Forrest, 165 Va. 267, 182 S.E. 215, 1935 Va. LEX IS 295 (1935).

The rights and remedies herein granted to an employee when his employer and he have accepted the provisions of this title respectively to pay and accept compensation on account of injury or death by accident shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such emplo yee, his personal representative, parents, dependents, or next of kin, at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury, loss of service, or death. B. If a court of the Commonwealth makes a finding in a final unappealed order based on an evidentiary hearing or a factual stipulation of the parties and participants thereto that the cause of action relating to an accident, injury, disease, or death is barred by this section, that finding shall be res judicata between those same parties and estop them and any employer, uninsured employers fund, guarantee fund, responsible entities, or statutory employer from arguing before the Commission that the accident, injur y, disease, or death did not arise out of and in the course of such employees employment. If the Commission or a court on appeal from the Commission makes a finding in a final unappealed order based on an evidentiary hearing, hearing on the record, o r a factual stipulation of the parties that the claims relating to an accident, injury, disease, or death did not arise out of or in the course of such employees employment, then that finding shall be res judicata and estop those same parties from ar guing before a court of the Commonwealth that the accident is barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Act. However, except in the case of a self-insured employer or business entity closely related to a party to the court proceeding, in order for the court finding to be res judicata as to a non-party, notice shall be provided in the same manner as allowed in subsection F of § 38.2-2206 or § 8.01-288 to any employer, uninsured employers fund, guarantee fund, responsible entities, or statutor y employer sought to be bound. In addition, any such entities so notified shall be given the same opportunity to be heard in that court proceeding as a party to the same, but limited to the issue of whether the accident, injury, disease, or death arose o ut of and in the course of the employees employment. Failure to provide notice to any party to the court proceeding shall not affect the rights, privileges, or obligations of said parties thereto but shall affect only the applicability of this subsec tion and only as stated herein. Furthermore, the findings by either the Commission or the court under this subsection shall not prevent the parties and participants to those proceedings from raising or relying upon any and all other available defenses. C. Notwithstan ding this exclusion, nothing in the Act shall bar an employer from voluntarily agreeing to pay an employee compensation above and beyond those benefits provided for in the Act. Nothing herein, however, shall be deemed to affect or alter any existing righ t or remedy of the employer or employee under the Act. History History.

Practice and Procedure. VI. Contractors. VII. Illustrative Cases. I.Legislative Intent. Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-40 or prior law. This section should be interpreted in the light of the purpose of the Act as a whole and its other provisions. Griffith v. Raven Red Ash Coal Co., 179 Va. 790, 20 S.E.2d 530, 1942 Va. LEXIS 275 (1942). The purpose of the Virginia statute as interpreted by its highest court is to limit the recovery of all persons engaged in the business under consideration to compensation under the Act, and to deny an injured person the right of recovery against any other person unless he be a stranger to the business. Doane v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. , 209 F.2d 921, 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 3683 (4th Cir. 1954); Rea v. Ford, 198 Va. 712, 96 S.E.2d 92, 1957 Va. LEXIS 129 (1957); Bristow v. Safway Steel Prods., 327 F.2d 608, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 6723 (4th Cir. 1964); Turnage v. Northern Va. Steel Corp., 33 6 F.2d 837, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4303 (4th Cir. 1964); Jennings v. Franz Torwegge Mach. Works, 347 F. Supp. 1288, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12098 (W.D. Va. 1972). Act defines relations between employer and employee.  The provisions of this section, construed with the entire Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act, define the relations existing between an employee and a n employer. The relations of an employee to other parties are not mentioned. Noblin v. Randolph Corp., 180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209, 1942 Va. LEXIS 176 (1942). And not relations between employee and stranger.  It was the legislative intent to make the Act exclusive in the industrial field so that, in the event of an industrial accident, the rights of all those engaged i n the business would be governed solely thereby. The remedies afforded the employee under the Act are exclusive of all his former remedies within the field of the particular business, but the Act does not extend to accidents caused by strangers to the bu siness. If the employee is performing the duties of his employer and is injured by a stranger to the business, the compensation prescribed by the Act is available to him, but that does not relieve the stranger of his full liability for the loss, and if h e is financially responsible, there is no reason to cast this loss as an expense upon the business. Feitig v. Chalkley, 185 Va. 96, 38 S.E.2d 73, 1946 Va. LEXIS 183 (1946); Fauver v. Bell, 192 Va. 518, 65 S.E.2d 575, 1951 Va. LEXIS 199 (1951). Intent of the General Assembly in enacting uninsured motorist protection provisions.  Where the employee of an employer which self-insured its motor vehicles was allowed to recover under the uninsured motorist statute, such application of the Worke rs Compensation Act, the uninsured motorist protection provision, § 38.2-2206, and the motor vehicle code, § 46.2-368, as they relate to an employee, was consistent with the language of the statutes and the intent of the General Assembly in ena cting uninsured motorist protection provisions. William v. City of Newport News, 240 Va. 425, 397 S.E.2d 813, 7 Va. Law Rep. 854, 1990 Va. LEXIS 129 (1990). In binding partners to the provisions of this section by way of former § 65.1-4.2 (no w § 65.2-101), the General Assembly considered that any insurance premiums paid by a partnership for individual coverage of its partners would ultimately be reflected in the cost of doing the various jobs on which the partners might be injured. Counts v. Stone Container Corp., 239 Va. 152, 387 S.E.2d 481, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1109, 1990 Va. LEXIS 8 (1990). An employee going to or from his or her place of employment is not performing a service arising out of and incidental to the employment. Ramey v. Bobbitt, 250 Va. 474, 463 S.E.2d 437, 1995 Va. LEXIS 128 (1995). II.Exclusivity. Exclusive remedy.  When an employee in Virginia is injured in the performance of her duties for her employer, the Virginia Workers Compensation Act provides her sole and exclusi ve remedy against the employer. McCotter v. Smithfield Packing Co., 849 F. Supp. 443, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5164 (E.D. Va. 1994). This section declares an employees right to compensation to be his exclusive remedy. Evans v.

CASE NOTES Right to jury trial.  Where a plaintiff has chosen only to seek actual damages and attorney fees for the defendants alleged violation of this section, a jury should determine wheth er he is entitled to such relief. Warner v. Buck Creek Nursery, Inc., 149 F. Supp. 2d 246, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7025 (W.D. Va. 2001). Alternative pleading permissible.  Although it may be true that in order to prevail on a claim under this section, a discharged employee must prove that workers compensation retaliation was the sole reason for his discharge, such an employee has the right to set forth alternative, inconsistent causes of action in his complaint, and the fact that the complaint alleges other grounds for the employees discharge does not require dismissal of a claim under this section. Warner v. Buck Creek Nursery, Inc., 149 F. Supp. 2d 246, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7025 (W.D. Va. 2001). Claim against employer and individual who discharged employee.  In light of the plain language of this section stating that no employer or person shall discharge an employee in retaliation for the filing of a workers  compensation claim, a discharged employee may assert a claim for workers compensation retaliation against both his employer and the individual by whom he was discharged. Warner v. Buck Creek Nursery, Inc., 149 F. Supp. 2d 246, 2001 U.S. Dist. LE XIS 7025 (W.D. Va. 2001). Action brought by an employee under this section may not be removed to federal court. Gre en v. Hajoca Corp., 573 F. Supp. 1120, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11821 (E.D. Va. 1983) (decided under prior law). No right to a jury trial.  A cause of action under this section does not give rise to a right to a trial by jury. Dunn v. Bergen Brunswig Drug Co., 848 F. Supp. 645, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4 986 (E.D. Va. 1994). A right to a jury trial does not attach since there is no common-law cause of action for retaliatory discharge. Dunn v. Bergen Brunswig Drug Co., 848 F. Supp. 645, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4986 (E.D. Va. 1994). Evidence held sufficient to show that defendant was discharged for reason proscribed by section.  See Charlton v. Craddock-Terry Shoe Corp., 235 Va. 485, 369 S.E.2d 175, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2986, 1988 Va. LEXIS 95 (1988) (decided under prior law). Jury question found on particular facts.  Since the plaintiffs testimony, considered in its entirety, presented a question of fact concerning the employers motive for discharging her, she was enti tled to have that evidence weighed by the jury together with all the other evidence in the case. Mullins v. Virginia Lutheran Homes, Inc., 253 Va. 116, 479 S.E.2d 530, 1997 Va. LEXIS 6 (1997). No remedy of punitive damages.  The inconsistent treatment of punitive damages by the legislature indicates that a statutory provision prohibiting retaliatory discharge is not enough to establis h a remedy of punitive damages. Dunn v. Bergen Brunswig Drug Co., 848 F. Supp. 645, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4986 (E.D. Va. 1994). Evidence held insufficient to show that defendant was discharged for reason proscribed by section. See Cooley v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 257 Va. 518, 514 S.E.2d 770, 1999 Va. LEXIS 67 (1999). Where the only evidence in plaintiffs favor is that his termination was close in time to the date he notified his employer of his intention to file for worker s compensation, such evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to go to the jury. O'Connell v. Isocor Corp., 56 F. Supp. 2d 649, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10669 (E.D. Va. 1999). Former employee alleged that the former employer violated § 65.2-308 by discharging him solely in retaliation for filing his workers compensation claims, h owever the employee was not discharged following his claim for the 1999 injury; in addition, he did not have any evidence of retaliation for intending to file a claim for the 2002 injury. His claim of retaliation was based solely on the closeness in time between his 2002 injury, notice of his intention to file a claim, and his discharge and under Virginia law, closeness in time alone was insufficient to establish a prima facie violation of § 65.2-308. Taylor v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 376 F. Supp. 2d 653, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14040 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 158 Fed. Appx. 446, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 28200 (4th Cir. 2005). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Commission is not proper forum for action alleging employees discharge in violation of § 65.2-308(A). Employee may bring an action in a circuit court havin g jurisdiction over employer or person who allegedly discharged employee in violation of this section. Jamison v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., VWC File No. 167-09-30 (Dec. 9, 2003). Where an employees employment is terminated as a result of exercising rights under the Workers Compensation Act, an action at law may exist. Burnette v. H eilig Meyers Furn. Co., 62 O.I.C. 89 (1983).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-309"><akn:num>§ 65.2-309</akn:num><akn:heading>Lien against settlement proceeds or verdict in third party suit; subrogation of employer to employees rights against third parties; evidence; r ecovery; compromise</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. A claim aga inst an employer under this title for injury, occupational disease, or death benefits shall create a lien on behalf of the employer against any verdict or settlement arising from any right to recover damages which the injured employee, his personal repre sentative or other person may have against any other party for such injury, occupational disease, or death, and such employer also shall be subrogated to any such right and may enforce, in his own name or in the name of the injured employee or his person al representative, the legal liability of such other party. The amount of compensation paid by the employer or the amount of compensation to which the injured employee or his dependents are entitled shall not be admissible as evidence in any action broug ht to recover damages. B. Any amount collected by the employer under the provisions of this section in excess of the amount paid by the employer or for which he is liable shall be held by the employer for the benefit of the injured employee, his personal representative, or other person enti tled thereto, less a proportionate share of such amounts as are paid by the employer for reasonable expenses and attorneys fees as provided in § 65.2-311. C. No compromi se settlement shall be made by the employer in the exercise of such right of subrogation without the approval of the Commission and the injured employee or the personal representative or dependents of the deceased employee being first obtained. D. If an injur ed employee, his personal representative, or a person acting on behalf of the injured employee receives the proceeds of the settlement or verdict and the employers lien pursuant to subsection A has not been satisfied, the employer shall have the righ t to recover its lien either as a credit against future benefits or through a civil action against the person who received the proceeds. E. Any arbitra tion held by the employer in the exercise of such right of subrogation (i) shall be limited solely to arbitrating the amount and validity of the employers lien, (ii) shall not affect the employees rights in any way, and (iii) shall not be held un less: 1. Prior to the commencement of such arbitration the employer has provided the injured employee and his attorney, if any, with an itemization of the expenses associated with the lien that is the subject of the arbitration; 2. Upon receipt of the itemization of the lien, the employee shall have 21 days to provide a written objection to any expenses included in the lien to the employer, and if the employee do es not do so any objections to the lien to be arbitrated shall be deemed waived; 3. The employer shall have 14 days after receipt of the written objection to notify the employee of any contested expenses that the employer does not agree to remove from the lien, and if the employer does not do so any itemized expense objected to by the employee shall be deemed withdrawn and not included in the arbitration; and 4. Any contested expenses remaining shall have been submitted to the Commission for a determination of their validity and the Commission has made such determination of validity prior to t he commencement of the arbitration.

For history of this section and former §§ 65.1-40, 65.1-42 and 65.1-112 (see now §§ 65.2-307, 65.2-310 and 65.2-812), see Noblin v. Randolph Corp., 180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209, 1942 Va. LEXIS 176 (1942). Purpose.  This section and former § 65.1-42 (now § 65.2-310) have as their object the reimbursement of the employer when he is compelled to pay compensation as a dire ct result of the negligence of another. Fauver v. Bell, 192 Va. 518, 65 S.E.2d 575, 1951 Va. LEXIS 199 (1951) (commented on in 9 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 316 (1952)). The purpose of this section is to reimburse an employer who is compelled to pay compensation as a result of the negligence of a third party and to prevent an empl oyee from obtaining a double recovery of funds already paid to him by his employer. Gartman v. Allied Towing Corp., 467 F. Supp. 439, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13804 (E.D. Va. 1979). This section creates no new liability on or right against a third party. It merely assig ns to the employer such rights, and only such rights, as the injured employee may have against the third party, and authorizes the employer to enforce such rights by an action, either in its own name or that of the employee. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co . v. Blue Diamond Coal Co., 161 Va. 373, 170 S.E. 728, 1933 Va. LEXIS 327 (1933). This section and former §§ 65.1-42 and 65.1-112 (now §§ 65.2-310 and 65.2-812) did not give any new right to an injured employee. They did contain res trictions or limitations upon his right to compensation under the Act and upon his right to recover full damages for his injuries from a negligent third party. Feitig v. Chalkley, 185 Va. 96, 38 S.E.2d 73, 1946 Va. LEXIS 183 (1946). Under this section and former § 65.1-112 (now § 65.2-812), where an employee is injured by a third party, such third party is in no way liable to the employ ee under the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act. His liability is merely that of a tort-feasor, and under § 8.01-243 unless the injured employee brings his action against the third party within one year (now two years) from the time the i njury was inflicted, his right of action is barred. McKay v. Citizens Rapid Transit Co., 190 Va. 851, 59 S.E.2d 121, 1950 Va. LEXIS 175 (1950). It prevents the employee from acquiring two separate remedies.  The express inclusion of the subrogation provision prevents the employee from acquiring for a single injury two separate remediesthe one, in tort, against the third party tort-feasor, the other, in contract, under the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act; for it is quite generally held that, in the absence of such an express statutory grant to the employer, the employee retains the right to collect full damages from the third party tort-feasor, in addition to his right to collect compensation under the Act. Crab Orchard Imp. Co. v. C &amp; O Ry., 115 F.2d 277, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 4763 (4th Cir. 1940), cert. denied, 312 U.S. 702, 61 S. Ct. 807, 85 L. Ed. 1135, 1941 U.S. LEXIS 836 (1941). This section was designed to prevent an employee from acquiring two remedies for a single injury  one in tort against the third-party tort feasor, the other i n contract under the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act. Gartman v. Allied Towing Corp., 467 F. Supp. 439, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13804 (E.D. Va. 1979). He has no right to double recovery.  This section gave to the employer the right to recover from the wrongdoer whatever he had actually had to pay, and it took from the employee the right pro tanto t o a double recovery, but beyond this it left the employees right to recover as it was before. Noblin v. Randolph Corp., 180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209, 1942 Va. LEXIS 176 (1942) (see Stone v. George W. Helme Co., 184 Va. 1051, 37 S.E.2d 70 (1946); Fauver v. Bell, 192 Va. 518, 65 S.E.2d 575 (1951) (commented on in 9 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 316 (1952))). The purpose of this section is to reimburse an employer who is compelled to pay compensation as the result of the negligence of a third party and to prevent an em ployee from obtaining a double recovery of funds. Tomlin v. Vance Int'l, Inc., 22 Va. App. 448, 470 S.E.2d 599, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 377 (1996).

Section contemplates action by employee against third party.  This section clearly contemplates that the injured employee, after accepting certain benefits from the employer under the Workmens (now Workers) Compensat ion Act, may institute an action against a negligent third party. However, in such an action, it permits or authorizes the employer, who has paid the stated benefits, to join in the action for the purpose of recovering the amount he has already paid to h is employee or his beneficiary for injuries resulting from the same accident. Noblin v. Randolph Corp., 180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209, 1942 Va. LEXIS 176 (1942). Full recovery against the tort-feasor is permitted. Haw v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 180 F.2 d 18, 85 U.S. App. D.C. 86, 86 U.S. App. D.C. 86, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2359 (D.C. Cir. 1950). And determination of compensation benefits paid is mandatory only if requested.  While determination of compensation benefits paid is still provided for, it apparently is mandatory only when requested by the person who paid the compensation, b eing designed for his benefit. Haw v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 180 F.2d 18, 85 U.S. App. D.C. 86, 86 U.S. App. D.C. 86, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2359 (D.C. Cir. 1950). But it is mandatory to require the judgment debtor to pay medical expenses out of the judgment. Barnhart v. AMOCO, 237 F. Supp. 492, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9737 (E.D. Va. 1965), aff'd, 354 F.2d 659, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 7570 (4th Cir. 1966). Section does not affect insurance clause excluding coverage of employers statutory liability.  Reimbursement of the employer under this section did not affect the applicability of a clause in a group medical expense insurance policy which excluded coverage of expense occasioned by injury . . . to the extent it is the statutory liability of the employer. The exclusionary clause was effective notwithstanding the reimbursement of workmens (now workers) compensation payments. Cash v. American H ealth Ins. Corp., 203 Va. 719, 127 S.E.2d 119, 1962 Va. LEXIS 211 (1962). Express contract of indemnity would not be invalidated by the Virginia Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act. Burnette v. GE Co., 389 F. Supp. 1317, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13862 (W.D. Va. 1975). Employer entitled to reimbursement and release from future liability.  If an employee sues the person responsible for his injury, the employer is entitled to be reimbursed for compensation already paid and to be discharged from liabi lity for future payments to the extent that the judgment against the wrongdoer is sufficient to satisfy the compensation award. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 4 2 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). Balance of the award may be retained by the employee. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F .2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). Modifications of this section and former § 65.1-41 (now § 65.2-309) by the 1960 amendment are procedural. They are designed to ensure that the attorneys fees shall be apportioned in accordance with the substantive changes made in former § 65.1-43 (now § 65.2-311) when the proceeds of the judgment against the wrongdoer are disbursed. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). This section simply authorizes a deduction of a proportionate share of the fee from the reimbursement payable to the employer as provided in former § 65.1-43 (now § 65.2-311). Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 23 69 (1974). The plain language of former §§ 65.1-42 and 65.1-43 does not direct the trial court to apportion attorneys fees based only on the amount actually paid b y the employer at the time of apportionment. Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Bower, 243 Va. 183, 413 S.E.2d 55, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1891, 1992 Va. LEXIS 151 (1992). Thus, this section is not a limitation on former § 65.1-43 (see now § 65.2-300). I t does not deal expressly or by implication with the employers obligation for attorneys fees arising out of the release of future payments that would have been due under the compensation award were it not for the employees successful suit. Sh eris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). Scope of employers right of recove ry.  The language of §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310 does not restrict an employers right to obtain reimbursement of benefits paid to the amount that an individua l beneficiary has recovered in a third-party action. In the absence of statutory language to that effect, there is no basis for placing such limits on an employers right of recovery under the statutory lien created by § 65.2-309. Liberty Mut. I ns. Co. v. Fisher, 263 Va. 78, 557 S.E.2d 209, 2002 Va. LEXIS 15 (2002) (overruling ACB Trucking, Inc. v. Griffin, 5 Va. App. 542, 365 S.E.2d 334 (1988), to the extent that its holding is inconsistent). Despite the fact that an employers petition seeking subrogation was filed prior to a verdict in the employees third party lawsuit against the tortfeasor, at the time the employer filed its petition to enforce its right of subrogation, the employee had already entered into a compromise settlement of his claims in exchange for a complete and absolute release of third party from any liability on those claims ; thus, the employer no longer had a viable right to subrogation. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Courtaulds Performance Films, Inc., 266 Va. 57, 580 S.E.2d 812, 2003 Va. LEXIS 62 (2003). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly held that an employer was entitled to pay 30 percent towards a workers compensation claimants future entitlements until it recovered the claimants total settlement with a third party, even though the employer had not perfected its subrogation lien prior to the settlement with the third party, as the compensation and medical benefits for which the e mployer sought a credit had not yet accrued when the claimant received the distribution and they were not within the definition of employers compensation lien, but were further entitlements. Suggs v. Suggs Carpet Installation, 2006 Va . App. LEXIS 115 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2006). An employer may safeguard a statutory claim for benefits paid or anticipated under the w orkers compensation act by petitioning the court for a lien against the third-party judgment in the amount of the compensation and other benefits the employer has paid. Henry's Wrecker Serv. Co. v. Smoot, 35 Va. App. 365, 545 S.E.2d 551, 2001 Va. App . LEXIS 225 (2001). Trial court erred in barring an employer from recovering, under a workers compensati on lien, as part of settlement of third-party wrongful death action, benefits paid to persons who did not participate in the settlement of the wrongful death action. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Fisher, 263 Va. 78, 557 S.E.2d 209, 2002 Va. LEXIS 15 (2002). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No right of subrogation against legal malpractice suit proceeds.  Claimant settled a malpractice suit against his attorney, who failed to timely sue a tortfeasor for causing the injury that led to the claimants workers c ompensation award; neither §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310, nor principles of unjust enrichment entitled the carrier to subrogation from the settlement proceeds.

Text A.

B. If the empl oyer is required to institute an action against any party to recover some or all of its lien pursuant to subsection D of § 65.2-309, the employer shall not be required to pay any share of the reasonable expenses and reasonable attorneys fees assoc iated with that portion of its lien that is not preserved by the employee, his personal representative or other person.

Divorce and Alimony, §§ 35, 59, 72.2, 78; 14A M.J. Parent and Child, § 17. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-43 or prior law. This section is constitutional; it is not repugnant either to the contract clauses of th e federal and state Constitutions, or to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution.Stancil v. United States, 200 F. Supp. 36, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4117 (E.D. Va. 1961). And applies retroactivel y and prospectively.  The language of this section permits of no ambiguity and it is plain that it was intended to apply retroactively and prospectively as to all actions or claims for damages in which a recovery had not yet been effected, either by judgment or voluntary settlement. Stancil v. United States, 200 F. Supp. 36, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4117 (E.D. Va. 1961). While the right to institute an action against a third party may accrue to the employer as of the date of the injury, the method and manner of obtaining s uch recovery constitutes only a procedural right or, at best, a right affecting merely a form of the remedy. For these reasons the enactment of this section and the 1960 amendments to former §§ 65-38 and 65-39 (now §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310) m anifestly touched upon the rights of a compensation insurance carrier of an employer as to all cases pending when the changes became effective. Whatever rights the carrier had prior to 1960 were not protected from legislative abrogation. Stancil v. Unite d States, 200 F. Supp. 36, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4117 (E.D. Va. 1961). It merely places upon the employer the burden of the counsel fee payable for service ren dered in the third party action to his ultimate profit. The regulation of this incidental phase of the compensation statute cannot reasonably be said to impair the obligation of the basic contract. Stancil v. United States, 200 F. Supp. 36, 1961 U.S. Dis t. LEXIS 4117 (E.D. Va. 1961). Which was formerly not deductible from reimbursements to compensation carrier.  Prior to the enactment of this section, and the amendments to former §§ 65-38 and 65-39 (now §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310), on Feb. 25, 1960, reimbursemen t payments to the compensation carrier were not subject to deduction for reasonable expenses and attorneys fees incurred by any plaintiff in seeking a recovery against a third party. Stancil v. United States, 200 F. Supp. 36, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41 17 (E.D. Va. 1961). Amount of indemnity due employer.  Once the net third-party recovery of an employee was determined, she was entitled to payment of no further compensation or medical expenses after the date of the Commissions suspension order until she could establish that further benefit entitlements exceeded the net amount received from the third-party recovery. Thus, the Commission did not foreclose the payment of attorneys fees in increments as medica l expenses and compensation benefits accrued during the suspension period, and the suspension order did not allow the employee a double recovery. After the employer was reimbursed the money paid as compensation benefits to the date of the suspension, th e employer was excused from making payments during the suspension period to the extent the employee was otherwise entitled to continued medical or compensation benefits. 246 Va. 30, 431 S.E.2d 36 (1993) (decided under former § 65.1-43). This section apportions attorneys fees between the employer and employee as their re spective interests may appear regardless of who instituted the suit. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). An employer who benefits from an employees third-party tort settlement, by recouping or being relieved of paying workers compensation benefits, is require d to pay its pro rata share of a claimants reasonable expenses and attorneys fees in effecting the recovery. Wood v. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc., 18 Va. App. 391, 444 S.E.2d 3, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1373, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 293 (1994); Mich. Mut. Ins. Co. v. S moot, 183 F. Supp. 2d 806, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24839 (E.D. Va. 2001). Former § 65.1-42 (now § 65.2-310) is not a limitation on this section, since it do es not deal expressly or by implication with the employers obligation for attorneys fees arising out of the release of future payments that would have been due under the compensation award were it not for the employees successful suit. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). 1960 change in section implemented by modifications of former §§ 65.1-41 and 65.1-42 (now §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310).  To carry out the substantive change in this section made by the 1960 amendment, that amendment modified former §§ 65.1-41 and 65.1-42 (now §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310), dealing respectively with suits brought by the employer and suits brought by the employee. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). The procedural modifications of former §§ 65.1-41 and 65.1-42 (now §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310) made by the 1960 amendment to those sections are designed to ensure that the attorneys fees shall be apportioned in accordance with the substantive changes made in this section when the proceeds of the judgment against the tort-feasor are disbursed. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App . LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). Apportionment must be based on the full liability of the employer.  The compensation it has paid in the past and the amount that it would be required to pay in the future were it not for the employees successful suit. Sheris v . Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). There is no rational distinction between the benefit an employer enjoys from being reimbursed for compensation payments already made and the benefit of being rele ased from the obligation to make further compensation payments. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). There is nothing in this section to indicate that when the legislature directed proration of the fees as the interests of the parties may appear, it intended that only part of the interest of the compensation carrier should be taken into account. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974) . The plain language of former §§ 65.1-42 and 65.1-43 does not direct the trial court to apportion attorneys fees based only on the amount actually paid b y the employer at the time of apportionment. Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Bower, 243 Va. 183, 413 S.E.2d 55, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1891, 1992 Va. LEXIS 151 (1992). Trial court did not err where it ruled that the employers share of attorneys fees and expenses should be based on full 500-week award, rather than on the employers actual payments to claimant. Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Bower, 243 Va. 183, 413 S.E.2d 55, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1891, 1992 Va. LEXIS 151 (1992). Employees right to apportionment should not be defeated by modifying awards.  While some compensation awards may be modified with respect to future payments, the employees right of apportionment should not be defeated. Sheris v. Travele rs Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). Prospect of modification, however, is a factor that a court should consider in light of the contingency that may affect the award. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974).

NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION The claimant, in the country illegally, filed a claim using a false name, and also gave false answers under oath to discovery interrogatories as to his name, date of birth, and social security number. In a subsequent deposition, the claimant provided his real name and date of birth. The Commission upheld the Deputy Commissioners dismissal with prejudice of the claimants claim, holding the claimant knowi ngly used a false name and forged documents to work in the U.S. The Commission accepted as a new claim a letter subsequently filed by claimants counsel which contained the claimants real name, date of birth, and other identifying information nee ded to constitute a claim.

Text In any action or claim for damages by an employee, his personal representative or other person against any person other than the employer under § 65.2-310, or in any action brought, or claim asserted, by the employer under his right of subrogation provided for in § 65.2-309, if a recovery is effected, the employer shall pay to the employee a percentage of each further entitlement as it is submitted equal to the r atio the total attorneys fees and costs bear to the total third-party recovery until such time as the accrued post-recovery entitlement equals that sum which is the difference between the gross recovery and the employers compensation lien. In ord ering payments under this section, the Commission shall take into account any apportionment made pursuant to § 65.2-311. For the purposes of this section, entitlement means compensation and expenses for medical, surgical and hospital attention and funeral expenses to which the cla imant is entitled under the provisions of this title, which entitlements are related to the injury for which the third-party recovery was effected.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  Where an agreement between an employer and an employee did not deal with the unpaid medical bills, § 65.2-701 did not apply to determine whether the employer w as entitled to a credit for an unpaid medical bills. Emberton v. White Supply &amp; Glass Co., 43 Va. App. 452, 598 S.E.2d 772, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (2004). Sections §§ 65.2-311 and 65.2-313 did not apply where the workers compensation insurer did not benefit from a third-party settlement secured by the clai mant, but instead, the insurer exercised its lien, without any assistance or involvement of the claimant or her counsel. Williams v. Capital Hospice &amp; Companion Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 66 Va. App. 161, 783 S.E.2d 67, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 91 (2016). Total . . . Recovery and gross recovery are the same; this interpretatio n of the statute is consistent with the plain purpose of the statutory scheme providing the employer an offset for a third party recovery. Eghbal v. Boston Coach Corp., 23 Va. App. 634, 478 S.E.2d 732, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 787 (1996). Commission lacked authority to modify order where failure to meet time requirement.  Where commission awarded claimant temporary total disability benefits in 1989 but suspended that award in 1991 because of his third-party recovery, and in 1996, c laimant applied for a new offset calculation based on this section, if an application for review of a final order of the commission is not made within twenty days of the date of the order, the commission has no jurisdiction to review the matter unless th e petitioning party alleges fraud or mistake in the procurement of the award. Because claimant failed to meet this time requirement and had not alleged fraud or mistake, the commission correctly found that it lacked authority to modify the 1991 order. Ro binson v. Trego Stone Corp., 26 Va. App. 97, 493 S.E.2d 389, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 718 (1997). Extent of courts jurisdiction.  Under this section the courts jurisdiction extends only to the point where it determines the amount of compensation benefits, as opposed to attorneys fees and costs, actually paid by the employer. Hawkins v. Commonwealth/Southside Va. Training Ctr., 255 Va. 261, 497 S.E.2d 839, 1998 Va. LEXIS 53 (1998). This section does not permit apportionment of future benefits and expenses.  Circuit court, in ruling on employers petition for reimbursement of compensation benefits paid after employee 4recovered from a 3rd-party tortfeasor a sum gre ater than the amount of past benefits, did not have jurisdiction to apply the apportionment percentage to workers compensation benefits to be paid and medical expenses to be incurred in the future until such time as benefits and expenses equaled the difference between the gross third-party recovery and the employers lien on the amount of recovery. Hawkins v. Commonwealth/Southside Va. Training Ctr., 255 Va. 261, 497 S.E.2d 839, 1998 Va. LEXIS 53 (1998). Extent of permissible apportionment.  This section permits the circuit court to apportion attorneys fees and costs based on the amount of benefits paid in the past, and benefits to be paid in the future until the accrued post-recovery entitlement equals that sum which is the difference between the gross recovery and the employers compensation lien. Hawkins v. Commonwealth/Southside Va. Training Ctr., 255 Va. 261, 497 S.E.2d 839, 1998 Va. LEXI S 53 (1998). Where an employer had not paid an employees medical bill prior to the employees settlement with a liable third party, the employers lien did not encompass the unpaid medical bills, and the employer was entitled to an apportioned credit against the unpaid medical bills. Emberton v. White Supply &amp; Glass Co., 43 Va. App. 452, 598 S .E.2d 772, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (2004). Employer entitled to offset.  Workers compensation claimants employer was entitled to an offset for post-settlement indemnity and medical payments made on behalf of the claimant where a third-party settlement did not exceed the employers compensation lien prior to its compromise. Purpose of § 65.2-313 prevented claimant from acquiring for a single injury two separate remedies, one in tort against a third party tort-feasor, and another in contract under the Workmens Compensation Act. McKnight v. Work Env't Assocs. &amp; Travelers, 43 Va. App. 189, 596 S.E.2d 573, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (2004). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly held that an employer was entitled to pay 30 percent towards a workers compensation claimants future entitlements until it recovered the claimants total settlement with a third party, even though the employer had not perfected its subrogation lien prior to the settlement with the third party, as the compensation and medical benefits for which the e mployer sought a credit had not yet accrued when the claimant received the distribution and they were not within the definition of employers compensation lien, but were further entitlements. Suggs v. Suggs Carpet Installation, 2006 Va . App. LEXIS 115 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2006). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Health care provider not entitled to direct payments from insurer while claimants benefits offset due to a 3rd party settlement. Johnson v. Tidewater Communit y College, JCN 1991617 (March 30, 2019). Va. Code § 65.2-313 plainly contemplates reimbursement to the claimant after his entitlements are submitted. This interpretation fulfills the purpose of the st atute, its purpose, which was to allow reimbursement as workers compensation entitlements were incurred. If the legislature wanted the employer and claimant to pay their proportions of further compensation entitlements simultaneously, it would have s o stated. Dodson v. Page Cnty., JCN VA00000422711 (Sept. 15, 2017). Defendants entitled to breakdown of disbursements of third party settlement funds to allow calculation of their responsibilities under Act. Benson v. Abbit Mgmt., Inc., VWC File No. 192-08-58 (Aug. 2, 2006). The right to subrogation of previously paid benefits originates in §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310 and the separate right to reduction of future entitlements is fo und in § 65.2-313; adjudication of issues under the former is not res judicata as to remedy sought under the latter. Suggs v. Suggs Carpet Installation, VWC File No. 174-62-27 (May 18, 2005). Employer was entitled to credit under § 65.2-309.1 against future benefits to be paid to employee, who had received third-party recovery under an uninsured mot orists insurance policy; although §§ 65.2-311 and 65.2-313 did not mention § 65.2-309.1, employers right to credit derived from § 65.2-309.1 and not § 65.2-311 or 65.2-313. Pickel v. Department of State Police, VWC File No. 201-47-97 ( Aug. 12, 2003). Section 65.2-313 specifies the manner by which an employer shall obtain its offset credit from an employees third party recovery and apply it against future w orkers compensation entitlements, and also provides that the employer shall reimburse the employee for the third party litigation costs as it realizes the offset benefits. The gross recovery term used in § 65.2-313 is the total third party recovery before the deduction of attorneys fees or costs. The employers compensation lien is the total amount expended by the employer for compensation benefits without deduction for attorneys fees or costs. Eghbal v. Boston Coach Co rporation, 75 O.W.C. 147 (1996), affd, No. 1370-96-3 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 10, 1996). The employers subrogation rights to a structured settlement with payments to be made to the claimant over time is equivalent to the present value of the settl ement, i.e., the cost of an annuity that would guarantee payment of the full amount in the manner negotia ted by the parties to the third party litigation. Kern v. Logistics Express, Inc., 74 O.W.C. 106 (1995). After calculating the claimants future claim entitlement pursuant to § 65.2-313, the Commission noted that the carrier was entitled to a credit in that amo unt against the liability for additional compensation payments and medical expenses, after which responsibility to make payment would resume. The claimant must be incrementally reimbursed for the pro-rata share of attorneys fees and costs as the carr ier reduces the credit. Such reimbursement should be made directly to the claimant on a quarterly basis. Lance v. School for Contemporary Education, 73 O.W.C. 209 (1994). The Commission directed quarterly payments by the employer on its pro rata share of third party fees and costs to the extent the employer realized benefits each q uarter for credit taken in lieu of payment of compensation or other benefits for which it would be liable.

As used in this title, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term occupational disease means a disease arising out of and in the course of employment, but not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment. B. A disease s hall be deemed to arise out of the employment only if there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances: 1. A dir ect causal connection between the conditions under which work is performed and the occupational disease; 2. It can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment; 3. It can be fairly traced to the employment as the proximate cause; 4. It is neither a disease to which an employee may have had substantial exposure outside of the employment, nor any condition of the neck, back or spinal column; 5. It is incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of employer and employee; and 6. It had its origin in a risk connected with the employment and flowed from that source as a natural consequence, though it need not have been foreseen or expected before its contraction . C. Hearing los s and the condition of carpal tunnel syndrome are not occupational diseases but are ordinary diseases of life as defined in § 65.2-401. History History.

Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-46 or prior law. The legislature intended that the Industrial (now Workers Compensation) Commission decide these claims on a case by case basis, adhering to the strict proof that is required in this section. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Musick, 7 Va. App. 684, 376 S.E.2d 814, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1726, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (1989). Legislature did not intend by this chapter to provide a general system of health insurance. It provided compensation only for occupational diseases and carefully spelled out what was required to fill that description. Van Geuder v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 548, 65 S.E.2d 565, 1951 Va. LEXIS 202 (1951). To be compensable, condition must qualify as disease.  To be compensable as an occupational disease, a condition must first qualify as a disease. Vanity Fair Corp. v. Monger, 21 Va. App. 59, 461 S.E.2d 429, 12 Va. Law Rep. 182, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 683 (1995). A plain reading of this section requires that the condition for which compensation is sought as an occupational disease must first qualify as a disease. Merillat Industries, Inc. v. Parks, 246 Va. 429, 436 S.E.2d 600, 10 Va. Law Rep. 464, 1993 Va. LEXIS 139 (1993). Job-related impairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion, however labeled or however defined, are, as a matter of law, not compensable under the present provisions of the Workers Compensation Act. Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, 251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795, 1996 Va. LEXIS 30 (1996). An impairment resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion is an impairment which must be classified as an injury, not a disease, and is not compe nsable. Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, 251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795, 1996 Va. LEXIS 30 (1996). Definition of disease.  For purposes of the Workers Compensation Act, the definition of disease cannot be so broad as to encompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin.  Vanity Fair Corp. v. Monger, 21 Va. App. 59, 461 S.E.2d 429, 12 Va. Law Rep. 182, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 683 (1995). Just because a doctor opines that a particular impairment is a disease does not necessarily make it so. Whether a claimant suffers from a disease within t he contemplation of the Workers Compensation Act is a mixed question of law and fact. Whether a proper definition has been used to test the authenticity of a doctors opinion is strictly a legal question. Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, 251 Va. 186, 46 7 S.E.2d 795, 1996 Va. LEXIS 30 (1996). An employee has a compensable disease when he proves that his disease was, in fact, deve loped at work as a result of the usual conditions to which he was exposed by his employment and if the evidence shows a recognizable link between the disease and some distinctive feature of the claimants job or work environment, and if other qualific ations are met, the legislature intended recovery. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Musick, 7 Va. App. 684, 376 S.E.2d 814, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1726, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (1989). In considering whether to proceed under this section or § 65.2-401, the commission mu st determine whether the condition is one to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment. If the evidence shows that the general public is not exposed to traumatic stress reaction outside of the employment, this section applies. If, ho wever, traumatic stress reaction is a condition to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment, the condition must be reviewed under § 65.2-401. Marcus v. Arlington County Bd. of Supvrs., 15 Va. App. 544, 425 S.E.2d 525, 9 Va. Law Re p. 694, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (1993). An ordinary disease of life may be compensable as an occupational disease if the require ments of § 65.2-401 are satisfied. Marcus v. Arlington County Bd. of Supvrs., 15 Va. App. 544, 425 S.E.2d 525, 9 Va. Law Rep. 694, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (1993). Ordinary disease of life aggravated by work environment is not compensable. Perrin v. Bru nswick Corp., 333 F. Supp. 221, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10927 (W.D. Va. 1971); Genie Co. v. Hammer, 32 Va. App. 257, 527 S.E.2d 470, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (2000). Question of whether a condition or disease is an ordinary disease of life is essentially a medical issue to be decided by the trier of fact based on the evidence presented. Knott v. Blue Bell, Inc., 7 Va. App. 335, 373 S.E.2d 481, 5 Va. Law Rep. 795, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (1988). Disease caused by conditions peculiar to employment is medical issue.  Whether a condition or a disease is caused by conditions peculiar to employment of the claimant is essentially a medical issue to be decided by the trier of fact based on the evidence presented. Personnel v. Hillman, No. 1761-89-4 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 11, 1990). Sudden onset not prerequisite to occupational disease.  There is no language in this section requiring a sudden onset or manifestation as a condition of a disease being occupational. Knott v. Blue Bell, Inc., 7 Va. App . 335, 373 S.E.2d 481, 5 Va. Law Rep. 795, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (1988). The phrase peculiar to the employment means unique to the conditions in which th e claimant actually worked, not the normal working conditions to which other workers in the same industry were exposed. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Musick, 7 Va. App. 684, 376 S.E.2d 814, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1726, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (1989). Disease must be traced to employment.  While the claimant is not required to show the time, place and circumstances of her exposure, as if her claim was based on injury by accident, it is nevertheless required under this section that her evidence demonstrate to the rational mind that her disease is fairly to be traced to her employment as the proximate cause. Van Geuder v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 548, 65 S.E.2d 565, 1951 Va. LEXIS 202 (1951). Though it need not have originated in employment of employer who is made liable.  While this section requires that an employee establish that his occupational disease arose out of and in the course of his employment, yet he is not requi red to prove that its incipiency took place or that it originated while he was working for the employer who is made liable to him. This is true because former § 65.1-50 (now § 65.2-404) expressly limits his right of action to the employer in whose employment he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease. Pocahontas Fuel Co. v. Godbey, 192 Va. 845, 66 S.E.2d 859, 1951 Va. LEXIS 232 (1951). Where there is a direct causal connection between the employees several employments and his disability resulting from silicosis, so that the occupational dise ase is in effect a single injury caused in part at least by injuries incurred in employment of the several employers, the occupational disease is compensable as arising out of and in the course of employment. Pocahontas Fuel Co. v.

Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-46.1 or prior law. In considering whether to proceed under this section or § 65.2-400, the commission mu st determine whether the condition is one to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment. If the evidence shows that the general public is not exposed to traumatic stress reaction outside of the employment, § 65.2-400 applies. If, h owever, traumatic stress reaction is a condition to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment, the condition must be reviewed under this section. Marcus v. Arlington County Bd. of Supvrs., 15 Va. App. 544, 425 S.E.2d 525, 9 Va. Law Re p. 694, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (1993). An ordinary disease of life is one to which the general public is exposed outside of emp loyment, but it may be treated as a compensable occupational disease if it is established by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that it arose out of and in the course of employment as provided in § 65.2-400 and did not result from causes outside of the employment. Greif Cos. v. Sipe, 16 Va. App. 709, 434 S.E.2d 314, 10 Va. Law Rep. 83, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 245 (1993). Central question is whether condition was caused by the employment.  In determining whether a disease is compensable, the central question is whether the condition was caused by the employment. Marcus v. Arlington County Bd. of Sup vrs., 15 Va. App. 544, 425 S.E.2d 525, 9 Va. Law Rep. 694, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (1993). For ordinary disease of life to be compensable under this section, the claimant must est ablish by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty, that the disease: (1) arose out of and in the course of employment; (2) did not result from causes outside of the employment; and (3) follows as an incident of an occupational di sease, is an infectious disease or contagious disease contracted in the course of employment, or is characteristic of the employment, and was caused by conditions peculiar to the employment. Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, 6 Va. App. 1, 365 S.E.2d 782 , 4 Va. Law Rep. 1900, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 29 (1988). Under the Workers Compensation Act, an occupational disease is not compensable until a diagnosis of such has been communicated to the employee. The date of th e first communication of the diagnosis is treated as the happening of an injury by accident. The right to compensation in cases of accidental injury is governed by the law in effect at the time of the injury. In this case, employees injury occurred o n July 31, 1986, the date his occupational hearing loss was first communicated to him. The law in effect on that date was that an ordinary disease of life is compensable if sufficiently connected to a claimants employment. Island Creek Coal Co. v. Br eeding, 6 Va. App. 1, 365 S.E.2d 782, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1900, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 29 (1988). The purpose of this statute was to revert the law to its state prior to Western Elec. Co. v. Gilliam, 229 Va. 245, 329 S.E.2d 13 (1985). Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, 6 Va. App. 1, 365 S.E.2d 782, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1900, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 29 (1988). For an ordinary disease of life to be treated as a compensable occupational disease, claimant had to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable degr ee of medical certainty, that her asthma arose out of and in the course of her employment, did not result from causes outside of her employment, is characteristic of her employment, and was caused by the conditions peculiar to her employment. Marley Moul dings, Inc. v. Rotenberry, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 305 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 1996). In order to prove a compensable ordinary disease of life under this section, the claimant must establish by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty, that his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd. v. Cypress, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 304 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 25, 2000). For an ordinary disease of life to be treated as a compensable occupational disease, the claimant is required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the disease arose out of and in the course of the employment; did not result from causes outside of the employment; is characteristic of t he employment; and was caused by conditions peculiar to the employment. Beverly v. UPS of Am., 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 762 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 1994). The requirement that a claimant must establish the source of the disease means she must point not to a single source of the disease to the complete exclusion of all other sources, but to the primary source as determined by reasonable medical certainty. Such a determination must be based on evidence that it is at least more probable than no t that the disease arose out of and in the course of employment. Marcus v. Arlington County Bd. of Supvrs., 15 Va. App. 544, 425 S.E.2d 525, 9 Va. Law Rep. 694, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (1993). While this section does not require that a single source of the claimants disease be pinpointed, it does require that the primary source be determined by reas onable medical certainty. Chanin v. Eastern Va. Medical Sch., 20 Va. App. 587, 459 S.E.2d 523, 12 Va. Law Rep. 28, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 593 (1995). Section 65.2-401 does not require a claimant prove one single source for an ordinary disease of life, but instead must link the disease to a primary source arisin g out of working conditions. Lanning v. Va. DOT, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 81 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2003). This section does not require complete absence of other possible contributing causes. Ra ther, the work activity must be determined, by a reasonable degree of medical certainty, to be the primary source of the ordinary disease of life. First Am. Metro Corp./First Am. Bankshares v. Dredske, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 589 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 30, 1993) . Where the origin of an ordinary disease of life cannot be traced to the employment as it s proximate cause, aggravation of the disease is not compensable as an occupational disease. Beverly v. UPS of Am., 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 762 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 1994). Ordinary diseases of life compensable in same manner as occupational diseases.  This section makes ordinary diseases of life compensable in the same manner as occupational diseases if they are sufficiently connected to a claimants employm ent. Via v. Citicorp Mtg., Inc., 10 Va. App. 572, 394 S.E.2d 505, 7 Va. Law Rep. 47, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 128 (1990). Section not applied retroactively to certain diseases.  The legislature did not intend that this section be applied retroactively to ordinary diseases of life contracted and discovered prior to the effective date of th e statute but not previously litigated. Foster v. Smithfield Packing Co., Inc., 10 Va. App. 144, 390 S.E.2d 141 (1990). Burden of proof.  A claimant must prove the existence of an occupational disease by a preponderance of the evidence. Moreover, one seeking to establish that an ordinary disease of life is employment-related, and should be treated as an occupational disease, bears the burden of producing clear and convincing evidence in support of that claim. White v. Planters Peanuts/Nabisco Brands, Inc., No. 0313-92-1 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 13, 19 92). This section does not require that the claimant prove that the occupational activity caused her tendinitis to the complete exclusion of any other contributing out side factor. Greif Cos. v. Sipe, 16 Va. App. 709, 434 S.E.2d 314, 10 Va. Law Rep. 83, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 245 (1993). Where Workers Compensation Commission considered claimants condition an ordinary disease of life, claimant had the burden of producing clear and convincin g evidence that her ordinary disease of life was employment related. Piedmont Mfg. Co. v. East, 17 Va. App. 499, 438 S.E.2d 769, 10 Va. Law Rep. 681, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 642 (1993), disapproved, Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, 251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795, 199 6 Va.

B. An employee who has an occupational disease that is covered by this title shall be entitled to the same hospital, medical and miscellaneous benefits as an employee who has a compensable injury by accident, except that the period during which the employer shall be r equired to furnish medical attention, including reasonably necessary diagnostic services, shall begin fifteen days prior to the date of first communication of the diagnosis of the occupational disease to the employee.

Workers Compensation, § 41. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-49 or prior law. Law in effect at the time of the incapacity governs the rights of the parties, and not t he law effective at the time the award is made or on the date of the death of the employee. Blue Diamond Coal Company v. Pannell, 203 Va. 49, 122 S.E.2d 666, 1961 Va. LEXIS 219 (1961). Injury by accident and date of injury.  In enacting this section and former § 65.1-52 (now § 65.2-406), the legislature intended that the phrases injury by accident and date of injury  be used to determine when a claimants right to assert a claim begins and the time limit within which the application for benefits must be filed with the commission. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. Williams, 10 Va. App. 516, 392 S.E.2d 846, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2775 , 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (1990). Date of injury.  The date on which the diagnosis of an occupational disease is made and first communicated to the employee is treated as the date of injury and as the happening of an injury by accident. The rights and liabilities of the parties vest and accrue on that date. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. Williams, 10 Va. App. 516, 392 S.E.2d 846, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2775, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (1990). Claim made before diagnosis received.  The fact that employee made a claim before he received a diagnosis that his condition arose out of his employment was irrelevant so long as he filed his claim wit hin two years after that diagnosis. Lynchburg Foundry Co. v. Vest, No. 0848-92-3 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 5, 1993). Date of accident, standing alone, does not identify employer liable.  In a claim based upon a disease, the date of the accident (fixed by this section as the date of the first communication of the diagnosis), standing alone, does not identify the employer liable on the claim. It is otherwise provided in former § 65.1-50 (now § 65.2-404) which adds another criterion. Cooper v. Mary E. Coal Corp., 215 Va. 806, 214 S.E.2d 162, 1975 Va. LEXIS 230 (1975). Creation of injury date does not affect former § 65.1-52 (now § 65.2-406).  The creation of an injury date in this section was not intended to limit or otherwise affect the unambiguous provisions of former § 65.1-52. Those prov isions contain fixed starting points and must be applied as they are plainly worded. Dan River, Inc. v. Adkins, 3 Va. App. 320, 349 S.E.2d 667, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1042, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 367 (1986). No distinction between asbestosis and coal workers pneumoconiosis.  For purposes of an award of medical benefits for occupational diseases, the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-100 et seq., did not make a distincti on between asbestosis and the claimants occupational disease, coal workers pneumoconiosis, and, thus, medical benefits were available for both of those occupational diseases; as a result, the workers compensation commission did not err in awa rding medical benefits to the claimant. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, 40 Va. App. 69, 577 S.E.2d 538, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 123 (2003). Section 65.2-403 permitted an award of medical benefits to employees who have an occupational disease covered by the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 6 5.2-100 et seq., and, thus, the workers compensation commission did not err in awarding benefits to the claimant who proved that the claimant had coal workers pneumoconiosis. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, 40 Va. App. 69, 577 S.E.2d 538, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 123 (2003). Occupational disease need not qualify for permanent loss or disability compensation.  Since the claimants disease, coal workers pneumoconiosis, qualified as an occupational disease under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2- 100 et seq. (Act), the claimant was entitled to recover medical benefits since nothing in the Act required that the occupational disease qualify for permanent loss or disability compensation before such benefits could be awarded. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, 40 Va. App. 69, 577 S.E.2d 538, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 123 (2003). Occupational disease not compensable until diagnosis communicated to employee.  Under the Workers Compensation Act, an occupational disease is not compensable until a diagnosis of such has been communicated to the employee. The date of th e first communication of the diagnosis is treated as the happening of an injury by accident. The right to compensation in cases of accidental injury is governed by the law in effect at the time of the injury. In this case, employees injury occurred o n July 31, 1986, the date his occupational hearing loss was first communicated to him. The law in effect on that date was that an ordinary disease of life is compensable if sufficiently connected to a claimants employment. Island Creek Coal Co. v. Br eeding, 6 Va. App. 1, 365 S.E.2d 782, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1900, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 29 (1988). An occupational disease is compensable when a diagnosis of occupational disease is communicated to the employee. Tazewell County Sheriff's Office v. Owens, 1999 V a. App. LEXIS 405 (Va. Ct. App. June 29, 1999). Date complaint was filed governed where no communication was made.  Awarding a claimant disability benefits for heart disease before October 27, 1993 and medical benefits before October 12, 1993, was in contravention of § 65.2- 403, because the claimants complaint was filed on October 27, 1993, and no disability was established prior thereto. Amherst County Sheriff's Dep't v. Martin, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 253 (Va. Ct. App. June 1, 2004). Provisions in respect to inj ury by accident.  Evidence supported the Workers Compensation Commissions finding that a claimants depression was a compensable consequence of a compensable injury by a ccident where the claimants psychiatric symptoms developed after the work accident, as a consequence of his alleged back and neck injuries and his associated pain and distress. New Energy Bedrooms v. Flinchum, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 191 (Va. Ct. App. Ap r. 1, 2003). Credible evidence supported the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions determination that a workers compensation claimant sustained an identifiable , work-related injury by accident to her left middle finger where: (1) the claimant injured her left finger at work when she was moving hangers off a rack and they got caught on her finger, (2) she immediately reported the injury to her employer whose re cords showed that the workers finger was swollen and discolored, (3) the swelling was still present the day after the injury, and the employer applied ice and a splint before referring the worker to a doctor, (4) that evening, the worker was diagnose d with acute pain in her left middle finger of uncertain cause, (5) she reported that the injury occurred when they were hanging on my finger at work the previous day, and (6) no evidence disputed her testimony regarding when or how the i njury occurred or established a non-work-related cause. Marshalls, Inc. v. Deane, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 531 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2005). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Section 65.2-403 provides that the date on which an occupational disease is diagnosed and first communicated to the employee is treated as the date of injury and as the happening of an injury by accident. The rights and liabilities of the parties vest and accrue on that date. Turner v. Sky Chefs, 76 O.W.C. 356 (1997). Where the employee was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome on July 7, 1996, prior to amendment to Va. Code Ann. § 65.2-400, her claim for carpal tunnel syndr ome is noncompensable, because the law in effect on the date of accident [date of diagnosis of occupational disease] controls. Turner v. Sky Chefs, 76 O.W.C. 356 (1997). Where a claimant is not mentally competent to understand the rights and obligations imposed by the Workers Compensation Act, communication of an occupational disease by the treating physician to the claimants wife and next friend is sufficient to meet the notice requirement. Likewise, communication to the claimants counsel through medical reports is sufficient to meet the statutory requirement. Barnes v. Ivie Cleaners, Inc., 65 O.I.C. 176 (1986). An impression or tentative diagnosis will not trigger the running of the limitations period or commence the employers responsibility for medical treatment. At kins v. Arlington County Public Schools, 71 O.W.C. 171 (1992). Precise medical terminology is not required to communicate a diagnosis of...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-404"><akn:num>§ 65.2-404</akn:num><akn:heading>What employer and carrier liability</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. When an emp loyee has an occupational disease that is covered by this title, the employer in whose employment he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease and the employers insurance carrier, if any, at the time of the exposure, shall alone be l iable therefor, without right to contribution from any prior employer or insurance carrier. B. For the pur poses of this section, injurious exposure means an exposure to the causative hazard of such disease which is reasonably calculated to bring on the disease in question. Exposure to the causative hazard of pneumoconiosis for ninety work shifts shal l be conclusively presumed to constitute injurious exposure. C. The operato r of a coal mining business covered by this title who acquires the business or substantially all of the assets thereof is liable for, and must secure the payment of, all benefits which would have been payable by the prior operator under this section with respect to persons previously employed by such business if the acquisition had not occurred and the prior operator had continued to operate the business; and the prior operator of the business is not relieved of any liability under this section.

Workers Compensation, §§ 21, 51, 66. CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases annotated below were decided under former §§ 65.1-50, 65.1-52, or prior law. Legislative intent.  Nothing in this section is intended to release employers from the duty of keeping themselves insured as required by § 65.2-801 or to exempt the Uninsured Emplo yers Fund when the employer has breached its statutory obligation. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Mounts, 24 Va. App. 550, 484 S.E.2d 140, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 242 (1997), aff'd, 255 Va. 254, 497 S.E.2d 464, 1998 Va. LEXIS 42 (1998). This section has no relevance to a change in condition, that is, the aggravation of an e xisting occupational disease for which compensation has been previously awarded. Rather, this section applies to a case where no diagnosis of an occupational disease has been made and communicated to the employee before he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease. In such a case, it is uncertain when the employee contracted the disease and, consequently, uncertain which of successive employers or successive insurance carriers should be liable for compensation. The statute resolves the doubt by imposing liability upon the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of the last injurious exposure to the hazards of the disease and by imposing liability upon the insurer who was then underwriting the risk. Hawkeye-Security Ins. Co. v. McDaniel, 210 Va. 209, 169 S.E.2d 582, 1969 Va. LEXIS 225 (1969). Right of action limited to one employer and carrier.  Though an employee suffering from an occupational disease may have contracted it while in the employ of some other employer, or once contracted, the disease may h ave been augmented and aggravated while in the successive employ of several employers, yet this section restricts and limits his right of action to one employer and its insurance carrier. Pocahontas Fuel Co. v. Godbey, 192 Va. 845, 66 S.E.2d 859, 1951 Va . LEXIS 232 (1951) (decided prior to the 1972 amendment). Liability under this section attaches to the employer in whose employment a claimant was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of an occupational disease prior to first communication of the diagnosis. Cooper v. Mary E. Coal Corp., 215 Va. 806, 214 S.E.2d 162, 1975 Va. LEXIS 230 (1975). Under this section, the employer on the date of the accident may be the employer liable but only if he is also the employer in whose employment claimant was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease. Cooper v. Mary E. Coal Corp., 215 Va. 806, 214 S.E.2d 162, 1975 Va. LEXIS 230 (1975). Last injuriously exposed.  In the construction of the phrase last injuriously exposed, a rule is adopted fixing liability upon the employer in whose employment the claimant was last injuriously exposed prior to or at the time of disability, the date on which entitlement to benefits accrued. Cooper v. Mary E. Coal Corp., 215 Va. 806, 214 S.E.2d 162, 1975 Va. LEXIS 230 (1975). Critical date is the date of actual disability, the date entitlement to benefits accrues . Cooper v. Mary E. Coal Corp., 215 Va. 806, 214 S.E.2d 162, 1975 Va. LEXIS 230 (1975). Burden is on claimant to show employment at time of last exposure.  The burden is on the claimant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence in whose employment he was last injuriously exposed. Blue Diamond Coal Company v. Pa nnell, 203 Va. 49, 122 S.E.2d 666, 1961 Va. LEXIS 219 (1961). Burden of proof.  Employee was not entitled to workers compensation benefits because the employee failed to establish that the employees alleged occupational disease arose out of the employees exposure to a bat at work. Iglesias v. QVC Suffolk, Inc., 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 86 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 16, 2019). Commissions finding of last injurious exposure held binding on appeal. Blue Diamond C oal Company v. Pannell, 203 Va. 49, 122 S.E.2d 666, 1961 Va. LEXIS 219 (1961). Section supplants common-law definition of injurious exposure.  The definition of injurious exposure in Pocahontas Fuel Co. v. Godbey, 192 Va. 845, 66 S.E.2d 859 (1951) as an exposure or contact with the dangers of the disease which proximately causes the malady, or augments or aggravates the preexisting disease has been supplanted by the statutory definition of injurious disease, which is broader. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 1 93, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). Statutory definition of injurious exposure was intended to relieve claimants of the burden of establishing actual causation in cases where such proof is difficult, if not impossible. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). Not just any exposure to the causative hazards would be sufficient. Instead the claimant must show injurious exposure. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). How injurious exposure estab lished.  A claimant can meet the statutory standard for injurious exposure either by establishing actual causation or aggravation of the disease, or by showing tha t the exposure was of such duration and intensity that it generally causes the disease in question, even though actual causation or aggravation cannot be established in the claimants case. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193 (197 9); J.J. Henry Co. v. Justice, No. 0995-91-1 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 29, 1991). An employees exposure to asbestos was injurious in that it was reasonably calculated to bring on the disease in question, within the meaning of this section, where all the medical testimony indicated that being exposed to asbestos for one month could result in a disease such as that sustained by the employee, and the testimony of his fellow workers showed that he had been exposed for at least one month. Caudl e-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). The employees exposure was of such duration and intensity over the years that a reasonable and rational determination could readily be made that his employmen t exposure proximately caused the disease, and therefore the employees last day of employment was the date of his last injurious exposure for purposes of this section. Fairfax County v. Espinola, 11 Va. App. 126, 396 S.E.2d 856, 7 Va. Law Rep. 538, 1 990 Va. App. LEXIS 172 (1990). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Which Employer and Carrier is Liable: Operator acquiring coal mining business is liable for all benefits payable by prior operator. Lester v. Pigeon Branch Coal Co. Inc., 56 O.I.C. 198 (1974). The carrier who had coverage at the time of the communication of the occupational disease, rather than the carrier at the time of the disability, is responsible f or compensation and medical expenses provided the last injurious exposure occurred in that employment. Landers v. The Grief Companies/Genesco, Inc., 71 O.W.C. 174 (1992). The employee is restricted and limited in his right of action to the employer in whose employment he was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease. S hanahan v. Pocahontas Fuel Co., 194 Va. 303, 72 S.E.2d 639, 1952 Va. LEXIS 232 (1952); Pocahontas Fuel Co. v. Godbey, 192 Va. 845, 66 S.E.2d 859, 1951 Va. LEXIS 232 (1951). Though claimants hearing loss gradually developed due to exposure with many employers, this section explicitly imposes liability upon the employer in whose em ployment claimant was last injuriously exposed without right to contribution from any prior employer or carrier. Cyphers v. Chestnut Ridge Fuel Corp., 61 O.I.C. 121 (1982). Compensation was awarded for hearing loss, a portion of which occurred in other employment, when the last injurious exposure and diagnosis occurred in the current employment. Lee v. Norfolk Gen. Hosp., 57 O.I.C. 226 (1977). The carrier during last injurious exposure is liable for compensation. Lawhorne v. Riverton Lime &amp; Stone Co., 45 O.I.C. 139 (1963); Davis v. Bear Ridge Co al Co., 45 O.I.C. 61 (1...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-405"><akn:num>§ 65.2-405</akn:num><akn:heading>Notice to be given</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Within sixt y days after a diagnosis of an occupational disease is first communicated to the employee, he, or someone in his behalf, shall give written notice thereof to the employer in accordance with § 65.2-600, but in no case shall the failure to give notice d eprive the employee of his cause of action for an occupational disease, unless it be shown that such failure resulted in clear prejudice to the employer. B. The statute of limitations provided under subdivision A 1 of § 65.2-406 shall be tolled until the employer gives the employee notice in substantially the following form: NOTICE TO EMPLOYEE IN THE EVENT A DIAGNOSIS OF COAL MINERS PNEUMOCONIOSIS (INCLUDING BLACK LUNG, SILICOSIS, PNEUMOCONIOSIS, COAL WORKERS PNEUMOCONIOSIS, ROCK DUST, DUST, DUST ON YOUR LUNGS OR TERMS OF SIMILAR MEANING) IS COMMUNICATED TO YOU, YOU MAY HAV E A WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIM. HOWEVER, SUCH CLAIM MAY BE LOST IF YOU DO NOT FILE IT WITH THE VIRGINIA WORKERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT PROVIDED BY LAW. YOU MAY FIND OUT WHAT TIME LIMIT APPLIES TO YOUR CLAIM BY CONTACTING THE WORKERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION. THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TOLD THAT YOU HAVE COAL MINERS PNEUMOCONIOSIS WHICH HAS NOT REACHED THE COMPENSABLE LEVEL UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION OR THAT YOU ARE STILL ABLE TO WO RK OR ARE WORKING DOES NOT STOP THE TIME FROM RUNNING OR OTHERWISE RELIEVE YOU OF YOUR DUTY TO FILE YOUR CLAIM WITH THE WORKERS COMPENSATION COMMISSION. Such notice shall also include the address and telephone number which the employee may use to con tact the Commission.The employer shall post and keep posted, conspicuously, the above notice in, on, or about the mine operations in places usually frequented by employees. C. The provisi ons of subsection B shall apply only to claims arising on or after July 1, 1991. History History.

CASE NOTES Provisions of former § 65.1-85 (now § 65.2-600) applicable to occupational diseases.  By former § 65.1-49 (now § 65.2-403) the saving provisions of former § 65.1-85, relative to when written notice need not be given when accidental injury is suffered, are made applicable to occupational diseases. Pocahontas Fuel Co. v. Godbey, 192 Va. 845, 66 S.E.2d 859, 1951 Va. LEXIS 232 (1951) (decided under prior law). Effect of failure to give notice where employers physician knew of disease.  Where the employee failed to give written notice of his occupational disease within 30 days (now 60 days) as required by this section, it was held that this was n o bar to compensation, since the employers physician was fully aware of the fact within the required 30 days (now 60 days), and since under former § 65.1-85 (now § 65.2-600) the diseased is relieved of the necessity to give written notice when it is proved that an agent or representative of the employer had knowledge of the disease, and the Commission is satisfied that the employer has not been prejudiced by the failure to give written notice. Pocahontas Fuel Co. v. Godbey, 192 Va. 845, 66 S.E .2d 859, 1951 Va. LEXIS 232 (1951) (decided under prior law). Notice need not be given before treatment.  Where an employee gave notice within the time period specified by this section, such notice was sufficient even though the employee had already undergone surgery for the condition prior to giving notice. Dan River, Inc. v. Hairston, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2000). Notice given within time required.  See Pittston Co. v. Fulks, 201 Va. 128, 109 S.E.2d 387, 1959 Va. LEXIS 202 (1959) (decided under prior law). Notice not given within time required.  See Lewis v. Lynchburg Foundry Co., 204 Va. 303, 130 S.E.2d 429, 1963 Va. LEXIS 148 (1963) (decided under prior law). For cases construing former provisions of this section which required an employee to giv e notice after he experienced a distinct manifestation of an occupational disease, see Shanahan v. Pocahontas Fuel Co., 194 Va. 303, 72 S.E.2d 639, 1952 Va. LEXIS 232 (1952) (decided under prior law). Employ ers failure to show prejudice from lack of notice.  Even if there was merit to an employers argument that the claimant had not given timely notice where she gave notice within the time period permitted by this section but not before undergoing treatment, the employer could not claim that it was prejudiced by being deprived of its right to offer the claimant a panel of physicians since it had denied the claim and an employer who denies a claim is not entitled t o require a claimant to seek treatment from one of its panel physicians. Dan River, Inc. v. Hairston, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 277 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 11, 2000). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Communication/Diagnosis: Until a diagnosis is made, the nature of the disease determined, and the diagnosis communicated to employee, the statute of limitations does not begin to run. Goo d v. Great A &amp; P Tea Co., 52 O.I.C. 112 (1970). Precise medical terminology is not required to communicate a diagnosis of an occupational disease. It is sufficient if the physician advises the claimant that her condition is caused by her work, although he did not advise that it was a disease. Bell v. Sara Lee Knit Products, 74 O.W.C. 67 (1995). Once an employee seeks a physician he is chargeable only with advice given by the physician. If he is not advised of the occupational nature of his disease, he sh ould not be encouraged to override his physician and file claim for a compensable disease. Good v. Great A &amp; P Tea Co., 52 O.I.C. 112 (1970); Clifton v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp., 37 O.I.C. 151 (1955); Bowman v. Shenandoah Silica Co., 34 O.I.C. 499 (1952); Horton v. Raven Red Ash Coal Corp., 34 O.I.C. 448 (1952). Where a physician stated that toxic exposure was likely but indicated chronic viral infection had to be ruled out, a diagnosis of an occupational disease was not communicated to the claimant even if she believed that her problem was the result of exposure to solvents at work. Rice v. Virginia Beach General Hospital, 68 O.I.C. 128 (1989). Term impression does not constitute complete diagnosis. Hux v. Ukrops Super Market Inc., 53 O.I.C. 150 (1971). Verbiage employed in physicians report was such that a layman would not construe the report to be a diagnosis of a occupational disease. Compensation was awar ded based on a communication at a later date. Shelton v. Island Creek Coal Co., 57 O.I.C. 327 (1976). Medical certificate upon which waiver was based did not constitute communication of diagnosis. Cline v. Miller Creek Coal Co., 58 O.I.C. 63 (1978). Advice to change jobs and that a malady may be related to work is not a diagnosis. Sisler v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 44 O.I.C. 234 (1962). Statement some would call it silicosis is not sufficient to constitute diagnosis. Smith v. Westmoreland Coal Co., 53 O.I.C. 344 (1971). Communication Other Than to the Em ployee: Where a claimant is not mentally competent to understand the rights and obligations imposed by the Workers Compensation Act, communication of an occupational disease by the treating physician to the claimants wife and next friend is sufficient to meet the notice requirement. Likewise, communication to the claimants counsel through medical reports is sufficient to meet the statutory requirement. Barnes v. Ivie Cleaners, Inc., 65 O.I.C. 176 (1986). Notice of diagnosis to attorney does not constitute constructive notice of occupational disease to employee. Honaker v. Harman Mining Corp., 54 O.I.C. 181 (1972). Notice to Employer: Employee is relieved of necessity of giving written notice when agent or representative of employer has actual knowledge. Saving provisions of § 65.1-85 (now § 65.2-600) are applicable to occupational diseases. Pocahontas Fuel Co., Inc. v. Godbey, 192 Va. 845, 66 S.E.2d 859 (1951); Lawhorne v. Riverton Lime &amp; Stone Co., 45 O.I.C. 139 (1963). Lack of notice is not in itself sufficient for an employer to take advantage of this section; employer must show clear prejudice. Terrell v. White Packing Company , 61 O.I.C. 377 (1982). Claim will not be dismissed unless employer shows that failure to give notice resulted in clear prejudice to the employer. Purge v. White Packing Co., 59 O.I.C. 250 (1980). There is no prejudice to the employer resulting from a claimants failure to give prompt notice of an occupational disease [carpal tunnel syndrome] claim until after surgery is performed, where it subsequently denied the claim. Under such circumstances, the employer forfeits its right to require the claimant to choose a panel physician. It is of no moment that the employers disclaimer was after the treat ment was rendered. Hairston v. Dan River, Inc., 78 O.W.C. 204 (1999). It was not necessary for the employee to give notice since the employer was fully appraised of the probable existence of silicosis prior to the employee being adv ised of his condition. Gray v. Lynchburg Foundry Corp., 44 O.I.C. 105 (1962). Where the employer admits that the claimant complied with the technical requirements of the Act to give notice of her occupational disease [carpal tunnel syndrome] diagnosis within the time period prescribed therein, there is no basis to refuse medical coverage beginning 15 days before the diagnosis as set forth by the legislature, even if the claimant has already submitted to carpal tunnel surgery. Hairs ton v. Dan River, Inc., 78 O.W.C. 204 (1999).

The right t o compensation under this chapter shall be forever barred unless a claim is filed with the Commission within one of the following time periods: 1. For c oal miners pneumoconiosis, three years after a diagnosis of the disease, as category 1/0 or greater as classified under the current International Labour Office Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconiosis, is first communicated to the employee or the legal representative of his estate or within five years from the date of the last injurious exposure in employment, whichever first occurs; 2. For byssinosis, two years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee or within seven years from the date of the last injurious exposure in employment, which ever first occurs; 3. For asbestosis, two years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee; 4. For symptomatic or asymptomatic infection with human immunodeficiency virus including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, two years after a positive test for infection with human immun odeficiency virus; 5. For diseases directly attributable to the rescue and relief efforts at the Pentagon following the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, two years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee; 6. For cancers listed in subsection C of § 65.2-402, two years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee or within 10 years from the date of the last injur ious exposure in employment, whichever first occurs; or 7. For all other occupational diseases, two years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee or within five years from the date of the last injurious exposure in employment, whichever first occurs. B. If death re sults from an occupational disease within any of such periods, the right to compensation under this chapter shall be barred, unless a claim therefor is filed with the Commission within three years after such death. The limitations imposed by this section as amended shall be applicable to occupational diseases contracted before and after July 1, 1962, and § 65.2-601 shall not apply to pneumoconiosis. The limitation on time of filing will cover all occupational diseases except: 1. Catar act of the eyes due to exposure to the heat and glare of molten glass or to radiant rays such as infrared; 2. Epitheliomatous cancer or ulceration of the skin or of the corneal surface of the eye due to pitch, tar, soot, bitumen, anthracene, paraffin, mineral oil, or their compounds, products or residues; 3. Radium disability or disability due to exposure to radioactive substances and X-rays; 4. Ulceration due to chrome compound or to caustic chemical acids or alkalies and undulant fever caused by the industrial slaughtering and processing of livestock and handling of hides; 5. Mesothelioma due to exposure to asbestos; and 6. Angiosarcoma of the liver due to vinyl chloride exposure. C. A claim for benefits pursuant to subdivision A 6 made as a result of the diagnosis of a disease listed in subsection C of § 65.2-402 shall be barred if the employee is 65 years of age or older, regardless of the date of diagnosis, communication, or last injuriou s exposure in employment. D. When a clai m is made for benefits for a change of condition in an occupational disease, such as advance from one stage or category to another, a claim for change in condition must be filed with the Commission within three years from the date for which compensation was last paid for an earlier stage of the disease, except that a claim for benefits for a change in condition in asbestosis must be filed within two years from the date when diagnosis of the advanced stage is first communicated to the employee and no cla im for benefits for an advanced stage of asbestosis shall be denied on the ground that there has been no subsequent accident. For a first or an advanced stage of asbestosis or mesothelioma, if the employee is still employed in the employment in which he was injuriously exposed, the weekly compensation rate shall be based upon the employees weekly wage as of the date of communication of the first or advanced stage of the disease, as the case may be. If the employee is unemployed, or employed in anoth er employment, the weekly compensation rate shall be based upon the average weekly wage of a person of the same or similar grade and character in the same class of employment in which the employee was injuriously exposed and preferably in the same locali ty or community on the date of communication to the employee of the advanced stage of the disease or mesothelioma. The weekly compensation rates herein provided shall be subject to the same maximums and minimums as provided in § 65.2-500. History History.

Fi ve-year limitation of former section was constitutional.  The five-year limitation of former § 65.1-52 (3) (now this section) on occupational disease claims did not contravene any of claimants rights to due proces s and equal protection. Miller v. Locher Silica Corp., 12 Va. App. 1213, 408 S.E.2d 566, 8 Va. Law Rep. 623, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 223 (1991). General Assembly, in amending this section, recognized that asbestosis is a progressive disease which may manifest itself many years after the cessation of employment. Parris v. APCO, 2 Va. App. 219, 343 S.E.2d 455, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 262 (1986). Filing of a claim within the statutory period is jurisdictional. Anderson v. Clinchfield Coal Co., 214 Va. 674, 204 S.E.2d 257, 1974 Va. LEXIS 197 (1974); Hawks v. Henrico County School Bd., 7 Va. App. 398, 374 S.E.2d 695, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1131, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 129 (1988). The requirement that such claim be filed within the statutory period is jurisdictional. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Kincaid, 216 Va. 27, 215 S.E.2d 638, 1975 Va. LEXI S 245 (1975). Because the filing of a claim within the limitation period of this section is jurisdictional, the claimants failure to file within five years of his last inju rious exposure barred his claim. Musick v. Codell Constr. Co., 4 Va. App. 471, 358 S.E.2d 739, 4 Va. Law Rep. 144, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 200 (1987). Provisions of former § 65.1-65 (now § 65.2-512) are made subject to this section. W inston v. City of Richmond, 196 Va. 403, 83 S.E.2d 728, 1954 Va. LEXIS 234 (1954). Injury by accident and date of injury.  In enacting former § 65.1-49 (now § 65.2-403) and this section, the legislature intended that the phrases injury by accident and date of injury  be used to determine when a claimants right to assert a claim begins and the time limit within which the application for benefits must be filed with the commission. C &amp; P Tel. Co. v. Williams, 10 Va. App. 516, 392 S.E.2d 846, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2775 , 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 119 (1990). Creation of injury date in former § 65.1-49 (now § 65.2-403) was not inten ded to limit or otherwise affect the unambiguous provisions of this section. Those provisions contain fixed starting points and must be applied as they are plainly worded. Dan River, Inc. v. Adkins, 3 Va. App. 320, 349 S.E.2d 667, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1042, 19 86 Va. App. LEXIS 367 (1986). This section does not require that an employee receive communication from a physician th at his disease is work related; rather, the statute only requires that the employee, simultaneously with or sometime after the diagnosis of his condition, learn that the condition is an occupational disease for which compensation may be awarded. City of Alexandria v. Cronin, 20 Va. App. 503, 458 S.E.2d 314, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 525 (1995), aff'd, 252 Va. 1, 471 S.E.2d 184, 1996 Va. LEXIS 63 (1996). Claimant must show that his claim was timely filed, for filing within the statutory peri od is jurisdictional. Blue Diamond Coal Company v. Pannell, 203 Va. 49, 122 S.E.2d 666, 1961 Va. LEXIS 219 (1961). Burden is upon the claimant to prove that he complied with filing provisions of this section. Anderson v. Clinchfield Coal Co., 214 Va. 674, 204 S.E.2d 257, 197...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-407"><akn:num>§ 65.2-407</akn:num><akn:heading>Waiver</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. When an emp loyee or prospective employee, though not incapacitated for work, is found to be affected by, or susceptible to, a specific occupational disease he may, subject to the approval of the Commission, be permitted to waive in writing compensation for any aggr avation of his condition that may result from his working or continuing to work in the same or similar occupation for the same employer. B. The Commiss ion shall approve a waiver for coal workers pneumoconiosis and silicosis only when presented with X-ray evidence from a physician qualified in the opinion of the Commission to make the determination and which demonstrates a positive diagnosis of the pneumoconiosis or the existence of a lung condition which makes the employee or prospective employee significantly more susceptible to the pneumoconiosis. C. In consider ing approval of a waiver, the Commission may supply any medical evidence to a disinterested physician for his opinion as to whether the employee is affected by the disease or has the preexisting condition.

Vagueness of section does not have unconstitutional effect.  Any vagueness in the actual terms of this section relating to scope of waivers does not have an effect upon claimants so fundamentally unfair as to violate the du e process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. Supp. 1294, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). Purpose.  The evident purpose of this section is to provide conditional employment for those found to be affected by, or susceptible to a specific occupational dise ase and at the same time provide protection for the employer who is willing upon the execution of a waiver to employ such persons. As an added safeguard such waiver is subject to the approval of the Compensation Commission. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Van ce, 203 Va. 557, 125 S.E.2d 879, 1962 Va. LEXIS 185 (1962); Williams v. Clinchfield Coal Co., 213 Va. 445, 192 S.E.2d 751, 1972 Va. LEXIS 382 (1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 932, 93 S. Ct. 2761, 37 L. Ed. 2d 161, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 2240 (1973). The purpose of the waiver statute is to provide for conditional employment of workers found susceptible to occupational diseases while at the same time protecting the employer who is willing upon execution of a waiver to hire such a worker. UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. Supp. 1294, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). Waiver is of any aggravation of an existing condition and may or may not be a waiver of benefits for the specific occupational disease to which he is susceptible. Williams v. Clinchfield Coal Co., 213 Va. 445, 192 S.E.2d 751, 1972 Va. LEXIS 382 (1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 932, 93 S. Ct. 2761, 37 L. Ed. 2d 161, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 2240 (1973) ; UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. Supp. 1294, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). Waivers not limited to diseases compensable at time of signing.  Although an employer might see no need to obtain a waiver of benefits for a disease for which no benefits were required, there is no hint of any statutory limitat ion of waivers to diseases compensable at the time of signing. UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. Supp. 1294, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). There is no corresponding federal constitutional right to workmens (now workers) compensation benefits. UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. Supp. 1294, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). And no corresponding federal scrutiny of their waiver. UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. S upp. 1294, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). There is no heightened standard imposed by the Constitution of the United States by which waivers of workmens (now workers) compensation benefits must be judged. UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. Supp. 1294, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). The standard for judging the validity of a statutory provision of the nature of this sec tion is the rational relation to a legitimate legislative objective test. UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. Supp. 1294, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). Allowing employer to decide whether specific waiver is desirable is not arbitrary.  Absent a showing of resulting discrimination along suspect lines, it does not appear that allowing an employer to decide whether for his protection a waiver would be desirable in a specific case represents an arbitrary means of pursuing the objective of this section. Such a scheme is not without its potential for abuse, but neither is it without rational foundation. UMW v. Industrial Comm'n, 374 F. Supp. 1294, 19 74 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8799 (E.D. Va. 1974). Waiver held effective.  A waiver for fibro-nodose infiltration of lungs consistent with early silicosis, was held to be an effective bar to a claim for coal workers pneumocon iosis. Williams v. Clinchfield Coal Co., 213 Va. 445, 192 S.E.2d 751, 1972 Va. LEXIS 382 (1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 932, 93 S. Ct. 2761, 37 L. Ed. 2d 161, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 2240 (1973). Section adequately complied with.  The requirement of this section that the prospective employee be found to be affected by, or susceptible to, a specific occupational disease was adequatel y complied with where a waiver regarding silicosis was sought and obtained by the employer, and approved by the Commission, following a finding by the company doctor of diffuse fibrosis and a recommendation by the doctor that the employee mus t sign a waiver. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Vance, 203 Va. 557, 125 S.E.2d 879, 1962 Va. LEXIS 185 (1962). Statute of limitations.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in concluding that a claim was not barred by the statute of limitations because there was evidence to sup port the Commissions factual conclusion that no diagnosis of pneumoconiosis was communicated to the claimant when the claimant was presented by an employer with a waiver form pertaining to pneumoconiosis and nothing in the record compelled the opposi te conclusion. Four \\\ Mining Corp. v. Deel, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 158 (Va. Ct. App. June 27, 2017). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Purpose of Waiver: Claimant who had diffuse fibrosis was susceptible to the occupational disease of silicosis and would be unemployable were it not for this provision of the law all owing the employer to protect itself by obtaining a waiver of compensation right. Waiver valid and binding even though claimant could neither read nor write. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Vance, 203 Va. 557, 125 S.E.2d 879, 1962 Va. LEXIS 185 (1962). Effect: Employee voluntarily signed waivers on two separate occasions as precondition to employment; rights under Workmens Compensation Act never came into being. Due Process Clause of U.S. Constitution not violated by Commissions failure to provide a hearing before approving waivers. Williams v. Clinchfield Coal Co., 213 Va. 445, 192 S.E.2d 751, 1972 Va. LEXIS 382 (1972), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 932, 93 S. Ct. 27 61, 37 L. Ed. 2d 161, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 2240 (1973). Waiver was not a bar to claim against another employer. Owens v. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp., 55 O.I.C. 262 (1973); Honaker v. C &amp; F Coal Co., 54 O.I.C. 180 (1972); P erkins v. Beatrice Pocahontas Co., 57 O.I.C. 291 (1976). A waiver effectively bars claim against a defendant that merged with the company for which waiver was executed. Stidham v Westmoreland Coal Co., 56 O.I.C. 300 (19 73); Stiltner v. O &amp; G Gas Co., 59 O.I.C. 287 (1980). Condition same now as that existing at time waiver executed and aggravation of pre-existing condition was not subject to an award. Shepherd v. Clinchfield Coal Co ., 53 O.I.C. 329 (1971). Waiver for fibro-nodose infiltration of lungs is a bar to the present claim without regard to whether the condition is from coal dust or silica dust since both pr oduce pneumoconiosis. Reece v. Westmoreland Coal Co., 54 O.I.C. 312 (1972), (appeal denied); Shepherd v. Clinchfield Coal Co., 53 O.I.C. 329 (1971). Chapter 5. Compensation and Payment Thereof. -360§ 65.2-500.

Compensation for total incapacity; computation of average wage; exclusion of AmeriCorps members, certain Food Stamp Employment and Training Progra m participants, and certain Temporary Assistance for Needy Families participants. Text A. Except as p rovided in subsections E, F and G, when the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is total, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee during such total incapacity, a weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of his average weekly wages, with a minimum not less than 25 percent and a maximum of not more than 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined herein. In any event, income benefits shall not exceed the average w eekly wage of the injured employee. Any farm employer who continues to furnish benefits while the employee is incapacitated shall be given credit for the value of such benefits so furnished when computing the compensation due the employee. B. For the pur pose of this section the average wage in the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Commission as follows: On or before January 1 of each year, the total wages, excluding wages of United States government employees, reported on contribution reports to t he Virginia Employment Commission for the 12-month period ending the preceding June 30 shall be divided by the average monthly number of insured workers (determined by dividing the total insured workers reported for that 12-month period by 12). The avera ge annual wage thus obtained shall be divided by 52 and the average weekly wage thus determined rounded to the nearest dollar. The average weekly wage as so determined shall be applicable for the full period during which income benefits are payable, when the date of occurrence of injury or of disablement in the case of disease falls within the year commencing with the July 1 following the date of determination. C. The minimum or the maximum weekly income benefits shall not be changed for any year unless the computation herein provided results in an increase or decrease of $2 or more, raised to the next even dollar in the level of the minimum or the maximum weekly income bene fits. D. The weekly compensation on account of total and permanent incapacity as defined by subsection C of § 65.2-503 shall continue for the lifetime of the injured employee without limit as to total amount. E. AmeriCorps members as defined in subdivision r of § 65.2-101 shall not be eligible to receive weekly compensation for total incapacity, whether permanent or temporary, regardless of whether the injury results in death. F. Food Stamp recipients participating in the work experience component of the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program as defined in subdivision s of § 65.2-101 shall not be eligible to receive weekly compensation for total incapacity, whether permanent or tempo rary, regardless of whether the injury results in death. G. Temporary A ssistance for Needy Families recipients participating in the work experience component of the Virginia Initiative for Education and Work as defined in subdivision t of § 65.2-101 shall not be eligible to receive weekly compensation for total incapacit y, whether permanent or temporary, regardless of whether the injury results in death.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-54 or prior law. The Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act divides injuries into two general classes: (1) total incapacity, for which the maximum compensation is fixed by this section; (2) partial incapacity, for which compensation is fixed in former §§ 65.1-55 and 65.1-56 (now §§ 65.2-502 and 65.2-503).

This section and former §§ 65.1-55 and 65.1-56 (now §§ 65.2-502 and 65.2-503) compared.  This section exclusively provides for total incapacity, whether it be temporary or permanent, and it fixes the maximum and minimum amounts to be paid therefor. Fo rmer § 65.1-55 applies to partial incapacity, temporary or permanent, resulting from injury to every member of the body except those mentioned in former § 65.1-56. As former § 65.1-56 is an exception to former § 65.1-55, only as to members of the body mentioned in former § 65.1-56, and former § 65.1-55 deals only with partial incapacity, former § 65.1-56 must be held applicable to partial incapacity only. Former §§ 65.1-55 and 65.1-56 do not apply to the same state of facts. G obble v. Clinch Valley Lumber Co., 141 Va. 303, 127 S.E. 175, 1925 Va. LEXIS 409 (1925). Benefits awarded under this section and former § 65.1-55 (now § 65.2-502) cover losses occasioned by the impairment of claimants earning capacity. This section applies where the loss is total, and former § 65.1-55 applies where it is partial. Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Reeves, 1 Va. App. 435, 339 S.E.2d 570, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 220 (1986). Benefits awarded under both this section and former § 65.1-55 (now § 65.2-502) are for loss of earning capacity. One is applicable where the loss is total and the other where it is partial, but in both instances the extent of capacity is required to be evidentially ascertained. Nicely v. VEPCO, 195 Va. 819, 80 S.E.2d 529, 1954 Va. LE XIS 161 (1954). Benefits under this section are for loss of earning power; and that is not necessarily proportional to bodily functional disability, nor is medical evidence the s ole criterion. J.A. Foust Coal Co. v. Messer, 195 Va. 762, 80 S.E.2d 533, 1954 Va. LEXIS 155 (1954). Benefits awarded under § 65.2-503 constitute indemnity for the loss of or loss of use of a scheduled body member; such benefits are not awarded for loss of ear ning capacity, as are benefits provided for under this section. Cross v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 21 Va. App. 530, 465 S.E.2d 598, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 17 (1996). Res judicata did not b ar application.  Workers compensation claimants application to resume medical benefits for treatment by her physician was not barred by res judicata principles where her c hange-in-condition application for temporary total disability benefits was denied by the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission one month earlier as: (1) disability benefit claims were a distinct and separate remedy from medical benefits and there was no identity of remedies between ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-501"><akn:num>§ 65.2-501</akn:num><akn:heading>Incapacity after permanent loss</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text After compensation has been paid as provided in § 65.2-503, the employee may, within one year from the date compensation was last due under this section, file an app lication for compensation for incapacity to work, subject to the provisions of §§ 65.2-500 and 65.2-502. Such application shall be considered and determined as of the date incapacity for work actually begins or as of the date ninety days prior to t he date of filing, whichever is later. History History. Code 1950, § 65-53; 1964, cc. 116, 190; 1968, cc. 347, 660, § 65.1-56; 1970, c. 470; 1972, c. 229; 1975, cc. 446, 450; 1976, c. 655; 1982, c. 326; 1983, c. 287; 1987, c. 560; 1988, cc. 564, 596. Annotations CASE NOTES Applicability.  Section 65.2-501 applies when the worker has not had a change in condition and is at the same disability level before and after an award. Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. Crawford, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 680 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 11, 2001). Because a policemans entitlement to sick leave for routine medical appointments was not a change in condition, and because the policemans claim wa s filed over five months past the one-year statute of limitations in § 65.2-501, the Workers Compensation Commission properly denied the policemans applications for wage loss compensation as time-barred. Brightwell v. City of Richmond Police D ep't, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 122 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 2007). Two year limitation period of former § 65.1-99 (now § 65.2-708) applies to filing an application for additional workers compensation benefits pursuant to a change in condition as defined by former § 65.1-8 (now § 65.2-101). Conversely, the one-year limitation period of this section applies to filing an application for additi onal workers compensation benefits in a situation when the disability is at the same level both when the award begins and ends. Thus, the limitation period of this section is triggered by a cessation of payments and a continued incapacity to work. Ar mstrong Furn. v. Elder, 4 Va. App. 238, 356 S.E.2d 614, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2583, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 258 (1987) (decided under former § 65.1-56). The statute of limitations in this section does not begin to run until compensation for permanent loss was last due under § 65.2-503. Virginia International Terminals, Inc. v. Moore, 22 Va. App. 396, 470 S.E.2d 574, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 368 (1996), aff'd, 254 Va. 46, 486 S.E.2d 528, 1997 Va. LEXIS 55 (1997). The one-year statute of limitations contained in § 65.2-501 applied to bar the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission from considering a claim for additi onal disability benefits where a doctors deposition testimony refuted claimants assertion that her plantar fascitis was caused by a change in her compensable knee condition. Clay v. Tultex Corp., 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 12, 200 2). An employee seeking to terminate compensation benefits based on refusal of selective employment must establish a bona fide job offer suitable to the employees capacity, procured for the employee by the employer, and an unjustified refusal by the employee to accept the job. Gallahan v. Free Lance Star Publ'g Co., 37 Va. App. 114, 5 54 S.E.2d 685, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 628 (2001). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION One year statute of limitations of § 65.2-501 applies when disability is at same level before and after award of permanent partial disability. Section 65.2-708 s two-year limitation governed this claim because claimant proved her physical condition deteriorated since award for permanent partial disability was entered. Hernandez v. Mikes American Grill, JCN VA00000222973 (Sept. 11, 2014). There are two statutes of limitation that could apply after payments of an award for permanent partial disability. If the claimant has undergone a change in condi tion, the two-year statute of limitation in Code § 65.2-708 applies. If there has not been a change in condition and the claimant is at the same disability level after the award for permanent loss as before, the one-year statute of limitations in Code § 65.2-501 applies. Phelps v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 77 O.W.C. 138 (1998). The 1991 amendment added to the language of Code § 65.2-101 Change in condition the reference to awards that had been suspended, and employees thereafter were required to prove continuing disability as well as a cure of an earlier refusal in order to have benefits reinstated. Perrigan v. Clinchfield Coal Co., 75 O.W.C. 324 (1996); Kaya v. Northwest Airlines, 77 O.W.C. 108 (1998). Employee did not exercise reasonable diligence in seeking employment and was not entitled to reinstatement of temporary total disability benefits pursuant to this section, where during a period of almost six months, he filed only four or five written job applications and no resumes, and the evidence indicated that there were numerous jobs available that were appropriate for him in view of his education, work hist ory and physical restrictions, but he did not apply for any of these, seeking instead jobs for which he was not qualified by education and experience or which were not within the limitations placed upon him by his physician. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Bateman, 4 Va. App. 459, 359 S.E.2d 98, 4 Va. Law Rep. 168, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 199 (1987). A claimant who received compensation for a permanent loss of use and then files an application under § 65.1-56 (now in § 65.2-501) alleging continuing work incapacity, needs only to establish that he remains either totally or partially disabled from the industrial accident. It is not necessary that he establish any pathological change in condition. Ferguson v. Furman K. Barnes, Sr., 63 O.I.C. 111 (1984). After compensation for specific disability is paid, an employee is entitled to compensation for his continuing wage loss if such wage loss is attached to injuries suffered in the industrial accident. Holliday v. Bill Bull Electric, Inc., 62 O.I.C. 214 (1983). Where an employee is originally paid under the LHWCA without an award in Virginia and subsequently files for compensation benefits, it is an original claim and is not subject to the limitation period of § 65.2-501 or § 65.2-708. Moore v. Virginia International Terminals, Inc., 73 O.W.C. 46 (1994). A claimant who is laid off from light duty work for economic reasons must show marketing of remaining capacity when seeking temporary total. After receiving perma nent partial benefits, a claimant must show marketing of remaining capacity to receive additional temporary total benefits if released to light duty work. Smith v. Wells Fargo Guard Service, 73 O.W.C. 201 (1994).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-502"><akn:num>§ 65.2-502</akn:num><akn:heading>Compensation for partial incapacity; exclusion of AmeriCorps members, certain Food Stamp Employment and Training Program participants, and certain Temporary Assistance for Needy Families participants</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Except as o therwise provided in § 65.2-503 or 65.2-510, or as provided in subsections B, C and D, when the incapacity for work resulting from the injury is partial, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, as hereinafter provided, to the injured employee dur ing such incapacity a weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before the injury and the average weekly wages which he is able to earn thereafter, but not more than 100 percent of the average weekly w age of the Commonwealth as defined in § 65.2-500. For purposes of calculating an injured employees post-injury average weekly wage, the following rules shall apply to commissioned employees, self-employed income, and income derived from an employe r in which the injured worker or their immediate family has an ownership interest: if the period of partial incapacity exists for 13 weeks or less, the injured employees post-injury average weekly wage shall be computed by dividing the employees total earnings during the first two weeks of partial incapacity by two, subject to retroactive adjustments as provided hereinafter. If the period of partial incapacity exists for more than 13 weeks, the injured employees post-injury average weekly wa ge for each 13-week interval shall be computed by dividing the employees total earnings during the period of partial incapacity by the number of weeks included in such period; however, if an injured employees period of partial incapacity ends aft er the close of a 13-week interval but before the close of the next 13-week interval, the injured employees post-injury average weekly wage for such portion of the subsequent 13-week interval shall be calculated by dividing the employees total ea rnings during the period of partial incapacity by the number of weeks included in such period. When an injured employee is under a continuing award of temporary partial benefits, the employer or the employee shall be entitled to seek a retroactive adjust ment of the temporary partial rate for the 90 days preceding the application seeking such adjustment of the temporary partial rate computed in accordance with the above method of calculation. Any resulting amount due to the employee shall be paid to the employee. Any resulting credit due to the employer may be offset dollar for dollar against future compensation benefits due the injured employee, subject to the provisions of § 65.2-520. The employee is required pursuant to § 65.2-712 to immediatel y disclose increases in his earnings. For all other employments, the employees post-injury average weekly wage may, in the Commissions discretion, be calculated using the preceding formula or a week-to-week calculation. In case the partial incapa city begins after a period of total incapacity, the latter period shall be deducted from the maximum period herein allowed for partial incapacity. However, the employer shall not be required to pay, or cause to be paid, compensation under this section to any injured employee not eligible for lawful employment; nor shall any such injured employee not eligible for lawful employment who is partially incapacitated be entitled during partial incapacity to receive temporary total benefits under § 65.2-500. B. AmeriCorps members as defined in subdivision r of § 65.2-101 shall not be eligible to receive weekly compensation for partial incapacity, whether permanent or temporary, regardless of whether the injury results in death. C. Food Stamp recipients participating in the work experience component of the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program as defined in subdivision s of § 65.2-101 shall not be eligible to receive weekly compensation for partial incapacity, whether permanent or tem porary, regardless of whether the injury results in death. D. Temporary A ssistance for Needy Families recipients participating in the work experience component of the Virginia Initiative for Education and Work as defined in subdivision t of § 65.2-101 shall not be eligible to receive weekly compensation for partial incapac ity, whether permanent or temporary, regardless of whether the injury results in death.

Payments under this section not credited on payments under former § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503).  When an employee suffers injury to a member scheduled in former § 65.1-56 and is compensated for temporary partial disability under this section until such tim e as the injured employee attains maximum recovery, and the degree of permanent partial loss of use of the member can be determined, the employer is not entitled to a credit for the sums so paid against such award as must be made for such permanent parti al loss of use as is then found to exist. Nicely v. VEPCO, 195 Va. 819, 80 S.E.2d 529, 1954 Va. LEXIS 161 (1954).

Temporary interruptions do not extend five hundred weeks limit.  Under this section no compensation can be demanded after 500 weeks from the date of the injury. Temporary interruptions from time to time, during which no compens ation was owing or paid, would not operate to extend the period for payment of compensation beyond the 500 weeks limit.

Claimant suffered a wage loss because, if he desired to do so, he was no longer physically able to perform his pre-injury work. Claimants ability to earn a higher average weekly wage was impaired due to the compensable consequence injury and not to his voluntary resignation. Therefore, the Commission did not err in awarding compen sation benefits to claimant. Davey Tree Expert Serv. Co. v. Acuff, 20 Va. App. 320, 456 S.E.2d 544, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 424 (1995).

Benefits awarded under this section constitute indemnity for the loss of or loss of use of a scheduled body member; such benefits are not awarded for loss of earning capacity, as are benefits provided for under § 65.2-500. Cross v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 21 Va. App. 530, 465 S.E.2d 598, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 17 (1996). Benefits for loss of human capital.  Benefits paid pursuant to this section for the loss of use of a body member are not payments for loss of wages but for loss of what might be termed human capi tal; they are in no way contingent upon or related to a workers capacity to work or income earned after return to work. Morris v. Virginia Retirement Sys., 28 Va. App. 799, 508 S.E.2d 799 (1999). Occasioned by permanent injuries of a particular character.  This section is the only one which provides for partial disabilities occasioned by permanent injuries of the particular character therein set forth; neither this nor the preceding section in any wise purports to deal with the subject of total disabilities. Noblin v. Randolph Corp., 180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209, 1942 Va. LEXIS 176 (1942). Conflicting medical evidence will be resolved by commission.  Generally, great weight should be given to the evidence of an attending physician; an attending physicians opinion is not binding on the commissio n. The probative weight to be accorded such evidence is for the commission to decide; and if it is in conflict with other medical evidence, the commission is free to adopt that view which is most consistent with reason and justice. Hayes v. 4 E Corp. , 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 194 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 1, 1997). It is an exception to former §§ 65.1-54 and 65.1-55 (now §§ 65.2-500 and 65.2-502).  This section is clearly an exception to former §§ 65.1-54 and 65.1-55, which cover total and partial incapacity. The benefits under such sections are predic ated upon the incapacity to work produced by the accident. The benefits provided by this section are based upon the loss, or loss of use of the members scheduled therein, irrespective of the future incapacity to work which may have resulted from the loss , or loss of use, of such member or members as are covered in the various schedules. Noblin v. Randolph Corp., 180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209, 1942 Va. LEXIS 176 (1942); J.A. Foust Coal Co. v. Messer, 195 Va. 762, 80 S.E.2d 533, 1954 Va. LEXIS 155 (1954). And must be read with former § 65.1-54 (now § 65.2-500).  This section and former § 65.1-54 must be read together. Owen v. Chesapeake Corp. of Va., 198 Va. 440, 94 S.E.2d 462, 1956 Va. LEXIS 227 (1956). Construction with § 65.2-504.1.  Section 65.2-504 must be construed according to its own language and is independent of this section. Chitwood v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 29 Va. App. 611, 5 13 S.E.2d 890, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 235 (1999). Remedy p rescribed is exclusive.  If additional compensation for permanent partial disability is recovered under this section for the loss or partial loss of a member therein desig nated, no additional compensation can be had for partial disability under former § 65.1-55 (now § 65.2-502), but the remedy prescribed therefor by this section is exclusive. Noblin v. Randolph Corp., 180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209, 1942 Va. LEXIS 176 ( 1942). But compensation may exceed sums mentioned.  That this section fixes the amounts to be paid for the permanent total disability of the members mentioned, and that the amounts recoverable by the worker can nev er exceed the sums mentioned in this section, is a misconception of the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act. Gobble v. Clinch Valley Lumber Co., 141 Va. 303, 127 S.E. 175, 1925 Va. LEXIS 409 (1925). Authorization for simultaneous payments.  The only reasonable construction of the language which provides that payments for a rating may be paid simultaneously with payments for temporary partial inca pacity, is that the Commission has discretion to order such payments. In cases where the Commission does not order such payments, employer would be free to make simultaneous payments voluntarily. Rusty's Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, 29 Va. App. 119 , 510 S.E.2d 255, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 67 (1999). The statute permits, but does not mandate, simultaneous payments of temporary and permanent partial disability payments. King, Jr. v.

An employee eligible for an award for coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits shall be compensated according to the following schedule: 1. For f irst stage coal workers pneumoconiosis medically determined from radiographic evidence and classified under the current International Labour Office Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconioses where there is no present impairment for work, 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly wage as defined in § 65.2-101, for fifty weeks, up to 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in § 65.2-500. 2. For second stage coal workers pneumoconiosis medically determined from radiographic evidence and classified under the current International Labour Office Classification of Radiogra phs of the Pneumoconioses where there is no present impairment for work, 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly wage as defined in § 65.2-101 for 100 weeks, up to 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in § 65.2-500. 3. For third stage coal workers pneumoconiosis medically determined from radiographic evidence and classified under the current International Labour Office Classification of Radiograp hs of the Pneumoconioses and involving progressive massive fibrosis or medically classified as being A, B or C under the International Labour Office (hereafter referred to as I.L.O.) classifications but where there is no apparent impairment for work, 66 2/3 percent of the average weekly wage as defined in § 65.2-101, for 300 weeks, up to 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in § 65.2-500. 4. For coal workers pneumoconiosis medically determined to be A, B or C under the I.L.O. classifications or which involves progressive massive fibrosis, or for any stage of coal worke rs pneumoconiosis when it is accompanied by sufficient pulmonary function loss as shown by approved medical tests and standards to render an employee totally unable to do manual labor in a dusty environment and the employee is instructed by competent medical authority not to attempt to do work in any mine or dusty environment and if he is in fact not working, it shall be deemed that he has a permanent disability and he shall receive 66 2/3 percent of his average weekly wage as defined in § 65.2-1 01 during the three years prior to the date of filing of the claim, up to 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in § 65.2-500 for his lifetime without limit as to the total amount. B. In any case where partial disability as mentioned in subsection A of this section later results in total disability, the employer shall receive credit on any permanent disability payments by being allowed to deduct 25 percent of each weekly payment until payments f or partial disability hereunder have been fully accounted for. C. In any case where there is a question of whether a claimant with pneumoconiosis is suffering from coal workers pneumoconiosis or from some other type of pneumoconiosis such as silicosis, it shall be conclusively presumed that he is suffering from coal worker s pneumoconiosis if he has had injurious exposure to coal dust. D. In the even t that any coal operator wishes to insure himself under standard workers compensation insurance rather than be self-insured against the risks and liabilities imposed by this section or by § 65.2-513, any such insurance issued in this Commonwealth covering such risks shall be rated separately for premium purposes and shall not affect workers compensation rates for any other employers not exposed to such risks. E. All members of any panel or committee required to interpret or classify a chest roentgenogram for purposes of diagnosing a coal workers pneumoconiosis shall be B-readers approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

Exclusive remedy.  This section provides the exclusive remedy for the compensation due to coal miners pneumoconiosis. Virginia Pocahontas #1 v. Musick, No. 1896-89-3 (Ct. of App eals Oct. 23, 1990). Words and if he is in fact not working in subdivision A 4 do not mean that the s tatute of limitations does not begin to run until a coal miner ceases work. This subdivision in no way prescribes the time period in which a claimant must file a claim after receiving a communication of a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. Ratliff v. Dominion Coal Co., 3 Va. App. 175, 349 S.E.2d 147, 3 Va. Law Rep. 737, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 349 (1986). An employer may credit awards for first- and second-stage pneumoconiosis against awards for second- and third-stage pneumoconiosis, respectively. To hold otherwis e would create an irrational windfall for claimants whose diseases advance from an early finding of first-state pneumoconiosis as opposed to claimants who are initially determined to suffer from second- or third-stage pneumoconiosis. Chitwood v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 29 Va. App. 611, 513 S.E.2d 890, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 235 (1999). This section must be construed according to its own language and is independent of § 65.2-503. Chitwood v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., 29 Va. App. 611, 513 S.E.2d 890, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 235 (1999). Physician's opinion properly rejecte d.  Workers Compensation Commission rejected a physicians opinion because it conflicted with the previously determined diagnosis that the claimant suffered fr om pneumoconiosis, and thus the Commission did not err in rejecting the physicians opinion and accepting the other doctors opinion. Dickenson-Russell Coal Co., LLC v. Kiser, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2021). Consideration of non-radio graphic evidence.  The provision of this section requiring that the diagnosis be based upon radiographic evidence does not proscribe or restrict consideration by the medical expert of other evidence also relevant and appropriate to the radiograpic studies. Cox v. Oakwood Mining, Inc., 16 Va. App. 965, 434 S.E.2d 904, 10 Va. Law Rep. 182, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 407 (1993). Unnecessarily narrow construction of this section.  By declining to permit consideration of the autopsy evidence in conjunction with the several conflicting opinions from the radiographic evidence, through both dir ect and cross-examination of the experts, the commission adopted an unnecessarily narrow construction of this section. Cox v. Oakwood Mining, Inc., 16 Va. App. 965, 434 S.E.2d 904, 10 Va. Law Rep. 182, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 407 (1993). Erroneous use of former § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503) rather than this section was harmless error.  Even assuming that the commission erroneously used former § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503) rather than this section to determine the entitlement and amount of th e claimants award for coal miners pneumoconiosis, the error was harmless where the entitlement to compensation and amount of the award would have been the same for the initial level of the diseases progression. Virginia Pocahontas #1 v. Music k, No. 1896-89-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 23, 1990). Sufficiency of the evidence.  Because there was credible medical evidence to support the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions determination regarding a claimants pulmonary fun ction loss, its decision to award of lifetime wage benefits was binding on appeal. Four \\\ Mining Corp. v. Deel, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 158 (Va. Ct. App. June 27, 2017). Workers Compensation Commission properly awarded permanent total disability benefits to a miner because the miner established that he had coal workers  pneumoconiosis, obtained the restriction from work in a mine or dusty environment, and was, in fact, not working, the legislatures use of or separated the ways in which an individual could satisfy the requirements of the statute, and th ere was nothing to suggest that the legislatures obvious intention was for the statute to be read conjunctively. Paramont Coal Co. Va., LLC v. Vanover, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 101 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2018). Workers compensation claimant was entitled, based on the claimants pneumoconiosis, to permanent disability benefits because the claimant, who suffered los s of lung function due to exposure to coal dust over the course of the claimants employment in a coal mine, met the claimants burden of proving sufficient pulmonary function loss, as shown by approved medical tests and standards, due to the claim ants exposure to coal dust and that the claimants pneumoconiosis rendered the claimant unable to perform manual labor in a dusty environment. Paramont Coal Co. Va., LLC v. McCoy, 69 Va. App. 343, 819 S.E.2d 831, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (2018). Record supported both the conclusion that claimant had suffered a 15 percent loss of lung function and that he was totally unable to perform manual labor in a dus ty environment due to his pneumoconiosis; the doctor was not confined...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-505"><akn:num>§ 65.2-505</akn:num><akn:heading>Injuries in different employments; injury to employee with disability; subsequent permanent injury by accident in service to employer</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

B. Except for hearing or vision loss that has not reached a compensable level of disability, if an employee has a permanent disability or has sustained a permanent injury in service to his employer and receives a subsequent permanent injury by accident, such as specif ied in § 65.2-503, he shall be entitled to compensation only for the degree of incapacity which would have resulted from the later accident if the earlier disability or injury had not existed. History History. Code 1950, § 65-55; 1968, c. 660, § 65.1-58; 1991, c. 355; 1996, c. 448. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 21 M.J. Workers Compensation, §§ 38, 43. CASE NOTES Employer liable only for amount of injury sustained in his business.  The provisions of this section and former § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503) show that the legislature intended to hold the employer liable only for the amount of i njury sustained by the employee in the conduct of his particular business. Noblin v. Randolph Corp., 180 Va. 345, 23 S.E.2d 209, 1942 Va. LEXIS 176 (1942) (decided under former § 65.1-58). The legislative intent behind this section extends only to preexisting injuries that pla ce the employees disability at or above a defined level of compensability; where there was no dispute that defendants pre-employment hearing loss did not equal or exceed the 26 decibel loss required for compensation eligibility; he was entitled t o compensation in an amount proportional to his percentage of hearing loss without offset for his pre-employment level of disability. Virginia Fibre Corp. v. Moore, 17 Va. App. 691, 440 S.E.2d 432, 10 Va. Law Rep. 875, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 60 (1994), aff' d, 249 Va. 1, 452 S.E.2d 360, 1995 Va. LEXIS 4 (1995). Commission required to distinguish between disability from a preexisting injury and disability from a compensable aggravating injury.  Workers Compensation Commission erred in failing to distinguish between the impairment rating attributable to an employees 2005 total knee replacement (a preexisting, non-work-related condition) and the rating attributable to a compensable, work-related aggravation injury, as required by subsection A of § 65.2-505. Fairfax County Sch. Bd. v. Martin-Elberhi, 55 Va. App. 543, 687 S.E.2d 91, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 3 (2010). Evidence supported finding of new injury rather than aggravation of prior injury.  Where a claimants doctor opined that his second knee injury was an aggravation of one sustained while working for his first employer, whose medical expert opi ned that the second injury was a new injury sustained while the claimant was working for a second employer, substantial evidence supported the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions acceptance of the latter opinion. Interstate Truck Serv. v. R icketts, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 348 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2006). Pre-existing condition found.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in finding that half of the permanent disability rating of 50 percent of claimants right lower extrem ity was attributable to her pre-existing degenerative disease of the right hip, and thus claimant was entitled to compensation only for the degree of incapacity that would have resulted from the work-related accident if the earlier disability had not exi sted and appellees were entitled to a credit for claimants pre-existing arthritic condition. Clements v. Augusta Health &amp; Safety First Ins. Co., 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 3, 2021). By subtracting workers pre-existing vision acuity reading (20/80) from his post-inju ry vision acuity reading (20/300), the employer was given the benefit of the provision of this section and worker was given the benefit of the deviation from normal vision as required by Rule 13 of the Rules of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commi ssion. Accordingly, under a proper application of the rule and this section, workers loss of visual acuity resulting from the injury far exceeded the minimum threshold for industrial blindness and entitled him to one hundred percent permanent partial disability. Sinclair v. Shelter Constr. Corp., 23 Va. App. 154, 474 S.E.2d 856, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 593 (1996). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION This section does not mention temporary total incapacity; however, if the specific injury compensable under § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503), together with the previously existing permanent disability, result in temporary total incapacity for work, employee may claim under § 65.1-54 (now § 65.2-500) and then, upon returning to work under § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503) for the specific injury arising out of his employment.

History History. Code 1950, § 65-56; 1968, c. 660, § 65.1-59; 1991, c. 355. Annotations CASE NOTES Multiple conditions.  Although an employee suffered three work-related conditions when the employee was awarded workers compensation benefits, the employee was allowed to receive b enefits for only one condition, so payments which the employer made were credited against the 500-week limit established by § 65.2-518 only for that condition, and the employee was entitled to receive benefits for the other conditions after the first condition no longer existed. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Eggleston, 264 Va. 13, 563 S.E.2d 685, 2002 Va. LEXIS 75 (2002). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly found that carrier two was responsible for the claimants temporary total disability payments under § 65.2-506, which required that the later injury be paid first, since the workers compensation claimant was disabled in part from his compensable work injuries from the March 19, 2011, work accident  the claimants right arm neuropraxia, for whi ch carrier one was responsible  and in part from his compensable ordinary disease of life  the claimants bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, for which carrier two was responsible; both conditions were independently compensable. S&amp;S Elec., Inc. v. Markulik, 61 Va. App. 515, 738 S.E.2d 512, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 78 (2013). Second injury, sustained at home, was compensable consequence of first injury, which arose out of employment.  Credible evidence supported the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions finding that a claimants first injury, sustained when the claimant tripped o ver a sliding glass door frame, was caused by a risk or hazard of the workplace, and his second injury, sustained at home, was a compensable consequence of the claimants first injury. City of Poquoson Law Enforcement v. Hooks, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 732 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 10, 2002). Relationship to limitations period.  Subsection A of § 65.2-708 limitations period was not tolled by § 65.2-506 as that statute addressed only how wage benefits were to be paid if a claimant si multaneously was otherwise entitled to wage benefits for two separate injuries that occurred at different times and did not reference filings, filing deadlines, statutes of limitations, tolling, or subsection A of § 65.2-708. Morris v. Fed. Express Co rp., 70 Va. App. 571, 829 S.E.2d 578, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (2019). Section § 65.2-506 did not provide a basis for equitable tolling given that the General Assembly explicitly tolled or otherwise limited the operation of subsec tion A of § 65.2-708s limitations period in other provisions. Morris v. Fed. Express Corp., 70 Va. App. 571, 829 S.E.2d 578, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 167 (2019). The Commission erred in assessing liability for the employees compensation equally b etween the first and second insurance carriers. The Commission should have applied the rationale of this section and held the insurers liable in inverse order. Greif Cos./Genesco, Inc. v. Hensley, 22 Va. App. 546, 471 S.E.2d 803, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 437 (1996). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Second Accident While Claimant is Receiving Temporary Partial Benefits: When at the time of second injury employee is receiving compensation under § 65.1-55 (now § 65.2-502) for general partial incapacity he will be entitled to compensation for temporary total incapacity resulting from second injury and then compensation for increased loss of earnings under § 65.1-55 (now § 65.2-502) occasioned by additional general partial incapacity caused by second accident. Lambert v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., 28 O.I.C. 723 (1946). Where a claimant who was on temporary partial benefits suffered a second injury resulting in total disability, an award was made based on the wages earned prior t o the first accident. The carrier at the time of the first accident was responsible for a sum equal to that being received by the claimant on temporary partial and the carrier at the time of the second accident was responsible for the difference between the pre-injury wage and the temporary partial. Donahue v. Clark Electric Contractors, Inc., 68 O.I.C. 256 (1989). When at the time of second injury employee is receiving compensation under § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503) for specific injury such payments will be suspended wh ile employee is totally incapacitated for work as a result of the second accident. Butler v. Ballard Fish &amp; Oyster Co., Inc., 22 O.I.C. 478 (1940). In view of the provisions of § 65.1-60 (§ 65.2-507), if the second accident results in another specific injury compensable under § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2 -503), specific disability payments due to first injury will be suspended during temporary total incapacity for second; then specific resumed for first injury, followed by specific for second injury. Polson v. Gordonsville Industries, Inc., 55 O.I.C. 288 (1973). Other. Once disability from second accident ends, Commission has no authority to automatically reinstate or unsuspend award for total incapacity for first injury independent of proof of that incapacity. During period claimant was disabled from second accident, circumstances impacting claimants entitlement to disability for first may have changed. Crumpton v. City, JCN VA02000007014 (Oct. 1, 2018). Where a claimant is totally disabled as a result of two separate conditions, if the employees disability is related in part to the original work accident and in part to a second, subsequent compensable condition, ongoing compensation benefits may be assigned to the latter, second claim until disability abates. Markulik v. S &amp; S Electric, Inc., JCN VA02000007765, and VA00000433920 (Aug. 9, 2012). An employer is not entitled to a credit for workers compensation benefits paid in another state for an overlapping period but for a different accident. The ca rrier would be entitled to a credit for payments made in another state for the same accident and same injuries. Harris v.

This s ection supplements former § 65.1-54 (now § 65.2-500).  This section is not in conflict with former § 65.1-54, providing compensation for total incapacity, but is merely supplementary to it and must be read in conne ction with it. Morris v. Pulaski Veneer Corp., 184 Va. 424, 35 S.E.2d 342, 1945 Va. LEXIS 161 (1945). Limitation on amount and duration of payments.  In 1946 claimant sustained injuries and received compensation for 2071/2 weeks at $18 per week. In 1965 he was again injured, resulting in permanent and total dis ability. The Commission improperly awarded additional compensation at $39 per week but limited additional weeks so that overall weeks of compensation for both injuries were 400 or $39 divided into the then maximum statutory amount of $15,600. It was held that since claimant was compensated for the 1946 injury only at the rate of $18 per week, he should receive additional compensation for the 1965 injury on the basis of additional weeks up to 500 weeks as provided by statute. The 1946 injury compensation of $3,735 plus $11,407.50 for additional weeks for 1965 injury at $39 a week, amounting to a total of $15,142.50, was still within the then statutory maximum monetary limit.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-61 or prior law. Expressly does not imply requirement that contract be in writing.  Nothing in the common law or the provisions of the Workers Compensation Act requires a contract of employment to be in writing, and the word expressly as used in the proviso in this section does not imply such a requirement. In the context in which it was used, it connotes nothing more than a meeting of the minds upon the exclusive situs of the workplace. The legislative intent was to exclude coverage of the Act when the parties to the employment contract mutually understood that no part of the employees services was to be performed inside the Commonwealth. Sorrels v. Foreign Mission Bd., 227 Va. 6, 313 S.E.2d 370, 1984 Va. LEXIS 260 (1984). Contract not for services exclusively outside of commonwealth.  A coal miners employment contract was not exclusively for services outside of Virginia where the employer hired the claimant in Virginia approximately three y ears prior to his accident, the claimant worked in Virginia during that time for all but the week of his accident, the claimant testified that he was initially unaware that the position he was interested in was in Kentucky, and the employer testified tha t the employee was not exclusively a Kentucky employee and could be transferred between mines and shifts at any time, as had occurred in the past. Powell Mt. Coal Co. v. Mosko, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 2001). Foreign contract outsi de scope of Virginia Act.  Where the plaintiffs employment was under a Pennsylvania contract, with a Pennsylvania employer and embraced within the terms of the workmans compensation act of that state, his contract of employment was entirely foreign to the State of Virginia and clearly outside of the Virginia Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act. Soloman v. Call, 159 Va. 625, 166 S.E. 467, 1932 Va. LEXIS 222 (1932). Because an employee admitted multiple times that the contract at issue was only for work in Delaware, the last prong of subsection A of § 65.2-508 was not met; therefore, his application for workers compensation benefits was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Anagua v. Sosa, 59 Va. App. 506, 721 S.E.2d 14, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 21 (2012). Award under foreign statute does not bar tort action against third parties.  The acceptance by plaintiff of compensation under the workmans compensation act of the state of Pennsylvania does not preclude him from maintaining an action in Virginia, in tort, against the defendants, who are third parties. Soloman v. Call, 159 Va. 625, 166 S.E. 467, 1932 Va. LEXIS 222 (1932). Award made by Congress which is mere gift cannot be set off.  Where an award was made by the Commission to the widow of a city policeman who was killed outside the city while assisting state and federal officers in making an arrest, and Congress made an award to the widow in full settlement of all claims against the federal government, it was held that since the federal government was under no obligation to make provision for decedents family, provisions made were but a gift to the widow, which could not be set off as against a right to recover. City of Alexandria v. McClary, 167 Va. 199, 188 S.E. 158, 1936 Va. LEXIS 293 (1936). Contract made in Virginia with employer doing business in Virginia.  The evidence conclusively established that a coal miners contract for employment was made in the commonwealth with an employer doing business here where the c laimant testified he initially applied for and was interviewed for a transfer from a Virginia mine to a Kentucky mine at his employers place of business in Virginia and the employer testified that the claimant was hired in Virginia through its Virgin ia office, its place of business. Powell Mt. Coal Co. v. Mosko, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 164 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 27, 2001). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission had jurisdiction to hear a claim filed by a professional athlete who was traded to the Washington Redskins and injure d while playling in a game in Pennsylvania. Pro-Football Inc. v. Paul, 39 Va. App. 1, 569 S.E.2d 66, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 540 (2002). Employment contract did not exist.  Decedent had not completed all the steps necessary to enter into a valid employment contract with a farmer when he died en route to pick up a visa, and an employm ent contract, which was required under subsection A of § 65.2-508 for the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission to assert jurisdiction, did not exist; the decedent also had not filled out an I-9 form, actually gained entry to the United States, appeared at the job site, or signed an employment contract. de la Rosa Herrera v. Martin, 49 Va. App. 469, 642 S.E.2d 309, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 117 (2007). The mere fact that employer was incorporated in Maryland does not require a holding that employee, as an officer of the corporation, was hired in Maryland, rather than Virginia. CLC Constr., Inc. v. Lopez, 20 Va. App. 258, 456 S.E.2d 155, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 386 (1995). Place of business in Virginia shown.  Testimony coupled with the insurance documents, established that employer did not merely conduct business in Virginia, but that it actually maintained its place o f business in Virginia. The bookkeeping functions, which included taxes and payroll, were performed in Virginia. Employer rented a construction yard in Virginia, where it stored its equipment and where employees met on a daily basis to go to job assignme nts. Employee testified that employer performed many projects in Virginia. This credible evidence was undisputed. CLC Constr., Inc. v. Lopez, 20 Va. App. 258, 456 S.E.2d 155, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 386 (1995). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Jurisdiction: When all requirements of this section exist, namely, contract of employment made in this State and place of business of employer in this State, Virginia compensat ion benefits may be awarded even though the accident occurred in another state. Robinson v. Thompson &amp; Litton, 44 O.I.C. 216 (1962); Davis v. Baker, 40 O.I.C. 26 (1958); Brill v. Windle, 35 O.I.C. 299 (1953) (appeal denied); Smith v. Bristol Steel &amp; Iron Works, 22 O.I.C. 542, 592 (1940); Thigpen v. Gibbs &amp; Hill, 6 O.I.C. 1101 (1924); Jones v. American Railway Express Co., 3 O.I.C. 637 (1921); Cook v. Hearing Conservation Noise Control, Inc., 56 O.I.C. 60 (1975), (affd. on review). Note: prior to 7/1/76 there was also a residency requirement . If any or all of these elements are lacking the Virginia Commission has no jurisdiction. Ryals v. Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., 52 O.I.C. 220 (1970); Levier v. Littl e Reno, Inc., 41 O.I.C. 93, 96 (1959); Gustafson v. Stuart, 36 O.I.C. 99 (1954). Section 65.2-508(A)(2) clearly instructs that jurisdiction lies with the Workers Compensation Commission if the contract of employment was not expressly f or service exclusively outside of the Commonwealth. In other words, where the employee is assigned to perform any work in the Commonwealth, however de minimis, the Commission has jurisdiction. Flores v. D B &amp; A General Contractors, Inc., 79 O.W.C. 24 (2000). Commission lacks jurisdiction despite location of union headquarters in Norfolk where claimant resides and is hired in North Carolina to work in North Carolina by an employer with no place of business in Virginia. Waters v. Shook &amp; Fletcher, 60 O.I.C. 463 (1981). Section 65.2-508 provides for concurrent jurisdiction between States for a compensable injury, but not for double recovery. Cash v. Food Lion #179, 76 O.W.C. 476 (1997). The claimant sustained a compensable injury in Texas and received compensation benefits pursuant to Texas compensation law. He also filed a claim in Virginia, and his award here acknowledged the Texas payments and was entered For Record Purposes Only. The claimant subsequently reached maximum medical improvement and his Texas award was converted to one for whole body permanent partial disability, and he f iled a claim for penalties for late payment of his Virginia award. The Commission held that the employer was entitled to a dollar-for-dollar credit for moneys paid under the Texas Act, so no penalty was owed until the credit for the Texas award was exhau sted. Cash v. Food Lion #179, 76 O.W.C. 476 (1997). In denying compensation benefits to a circus performer, the Commission noted that while the employer had a place of business in Virginia, the contract of hire was made in Poland and the claimant never worked in Virginia. Since jurisdiction cannot be conferred, the fact that the contract stated that it would be governed by the laws of Virginia is irrelevant. The employer had the option to accept the claim under Vi rginia but declined to do so. Bodlas v. Ringling Brothers Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows, 73 O.W.C. 9 (1994).

CASE NOTES The Workers Compensation Act should be liberally construed.  Workers compensation commission did not err in construing the Virginia Workers Compensation Act (Act), § 65.2-100 et seq., liberally to allow the claim ants second claim for workers compensation benefits where the second claim was timely filed, but lacked an allegation that the claimant had been disabled in excess of the seven days required to receive compensation; the requirement that more than seven days be alleged was not jurisdictional, the claimant subsequently amended his claims by alleging additional days that did not involve the pleading of a new cause of action, and allowing the claimant to receive benefits under such circumstances fur thered the goal of liberally construing the Act in favor of a claimant. Hospice Choice, Inc. v. O'Quin, 42 Va. App. 598, 593 S.E.2d 554, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 101 (2004). Filing claim alleging seven days of disability not jurisdictional.  Pleading the seven days of disability that were statutorily required to pass before a workers compensation claimant could receive compensation on a claim cove red under the workers compensation law was not jurisdictional, and, thus, the claimants second claim, which was filed within the two-year limitations period for workers compensation benefits set forth in § 65.2-601, was not time barred for only alleging one date in support of his request for temporary total benefits, where the claimant subsequently amended his second claim to include additional dates that exceeded the seven-day disability requirement since those amendments did not raise a new cause of action but instead, related back to the timely filed second claim. Hospice Choice, Inc. v. O'Quin, 42 Va. App. 598, 593 S.E.2d 554, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 101 (2004). Res judicata.  Workers compensation benefits claimants argument that his period of disability was incorrectly calculated was barred by the principles of res judicata bec ause the Workers Compensation Commission issued a review opinion affirming the deputy commissioners opinion regarding the period of disability, and neither party appealed the Commissions review opinion. Wilson v. City of Chesapeake, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 5, 2019). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Benefits for First Seven Days Payable Af- ter Weeks of Disability: If the incapacity for work, whether total under § 65.1-54 (now § 65.2-500) or partial under § 65.1-55 (now § 65.2-502), shall continue beyond six (now three) weeks from date of accident, the employee is entitled to compensation for the first seven days of incapacity. Chesser v. Stonega Co., 3 O.I.C. 72 (1921). Because benefits paid under § 65.2-503 are not wage loss indemnity benefits paid to compensate a worker for his incapacity from work, benefits paid under this section should not be counted as payments for an incapacity that extends the claimants period of disability as contemplated in § 65.2-509. Thus, the Commission held that such benefits under § 65.2-503 cannot be counted to determine whether the employee is entitled to payment for the first seven days of disability under § 65.2-509. Boone v. Newport News Shipbuilding, 79 O.W.C. 133 (2000). Benefits under § 65.2-503 are fixed and payable, regardless of actual disability, and they are paid irrespective of continued employment, loss of wages, or oth er considerations. The benefits are payable for the loss of use of a body part based upon the statutory presumption that the employee will sustain a lifetime loss of economic benefit that would have derived from the injured body part. Boone v. Newport Ne ws Shipbuilding, 79 O.W.C. 133 (2000). An injured employees entitlement to compensation is not dependent on the economic or financial condition of the employer. Dawson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Com pany, 60 O.I.C. 132 (1981). A claim for initial disability benefits must be filed within two years of the work accident for compensable disability beginning within two years of that accident . The limitation period is not tolled where only medical benefits were initially awarded because disability did not exceed seven days. The change in condition claim for disability had to be filed within two years of the accident. Ashby v. West Point Scho ol Board, 74 O.W.C. 90 (1995). To be entitled to disability compensation, the claimant must not only file a timely application for hearing, he must also establish a basis upon which compensatio n may be awarded within the statutory time periods. Chisholm v. The Washington Post, 77 O.W.C. 85 (1998). Computing Time: This section refers to calendar days of incapacity. Therefore teacher who was injured on last day of school and returned to work on first day of Fall term was ent itled to compensation for summer disability. Busbee v. Falls Church School Board, 47 O.I.C. 57 (1965). Where claimant was normally employed on a standby basis during weekends and Sunday was first day of disability, compensation begins on Sunday. Walton v. Pargas, I nc., 50 O.I.C. 334 (1968). Where the alleged disability during the first two years after the claimants accident does not exceed the seven day waiting period of Code § 65.2-509, compe nsation cannot be awarded, even though the claimant is subsequently incapacitated for a longer period. Chisholm v. The Washington Post, 77 O.W.C. 85 (1998).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-510"><akn:num>§ 65.2-510</akn:num><akn:heading>Refusal of employment; compensation for partial incapacity</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. If an injur ed employee refuses employment procured for him suitable to his capacity, he shall only be entitled to the benefits provided for in §§ 65.2-503 and 65.2-603, excluding vocational rehabilitation services provided for in subdivision A 3 of § 65.2- 603, during the continuance of such refusal, unless in the opinion of the Commission such refusal was justified. B. If an injur ed employee cures his unjustified refusal by accepting employment suitable to his capacity at a wage less than that originally offered, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee during his partial incapacity pursuant to § 65.2 -502, a weekly compensation equal to 66 2/3 percent of the difference between his average weekly wages before his injury and the average weekly wage the employee would have earned by accepting the original proffered light duty employment. C. A cure of u njustified refusal pursuant to subsection A may not be established if the unjustified refusal lasts more than six months from the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension pursuant to this section; however, the six-month period may be ex tended by the number of days a claimant is totally disabled if the disability commenced during such six-month period. When an injured employee is precluded from accepting employment as a result of pregnancy, the six-month period for curing the refusal ma y be tolled during such period as a physician certifies medical disability.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-63 or prior law. Legislature intended to encourage injured employees to seek selective employment rather than to remain unemployed unless the employer finds such employment for them. Big D Quality Homebuilders v. Hamilton, 228 Va. 378, 322 S.E.2d 839, 1984 Va. LEXIS 314 (1984); Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth. v. Harrison, 228 Va. 598, 324 S.E.2d 654, 1 985 Va. LEXIS 151 (1985). The legislature intended to foreclose benefits only so long as the unjustified refusal continued, regardless of whether the procured selective employment was available at the time the refusal ceased. Thompson v. Hampton Inst., 3 Va. App. 668, 353 S.E.2d 316, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1800, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 155 (1987). This section permits an employee to cure a prior unjustified refusal to accept selective employment so that benefits may be resumed. Thompson v. Hampton Inst., 3 Va. App. 668, 353 S.E.2d 316, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1800, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 155 (1987). This section allows an employee to cure an unjustified refusal of selective employment by obtaining equivalent selective employment. Food Lion, Inc. v. Newsome, 3 0 Va. App. 21, 515 S.E.2d 317, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 320 (1999). Expiration of statutory period for cure bars future claim.  An employee who does not cure an unjustified refusal within the six months permitted by this section forever loses the right to additional temporary partial benef its; the restoration of partial disability benefits is barred even following an intervening period of compensable total disability. Hoy Constr., Inc. v. Flenner, 32 Va. App. 357, 528 S.E.2d 148, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 326 (2000). Clear mandate of this section is to permit the employer to suspend payment of benefits t o an employee who refuses selective employment procured for him which is within the employees capacity to perform. Thompson v. Hampton Inst., 3 Va. App. 668, 353 S.E.2d 316, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1800, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 155 (1987). Section does not require that employers make selective employment available. But the rel ief thereby afforded an employer when an employee unjustifiably refuses to accept or continue selective employment is limited to those cases in which the employer has provided or procured such employment. Big D Quality Homebuilders v. Hamilton, 228 Va. 3 78, 322 S.E.2d 839, 1984 Va. LEXIS 314 (1984). Section does not require that employers make selective employment available; it merely encourages employers to procure such work for partially incapacitated emplo yees. Transfer v. Dicks, 229 Va. 548, 331 S.E.2d 449, 1985 Va. LEXIS 230 (1985). In order to continue to receive benefits under the Act, a claimant who has been injured in a job-related accident must market his remaining capacity to work. A claimant must make a reasonable effort to find work suitable to his or her ability to perform. Herbert Brothers, Inc. v. Jenkins, 14 Va. App. 715, 419 S.E.2d 283, 8 Va. Law R ep. 3539, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 172 (1992). A claimant is not required to relocate in order to accept selective employment. Houlihan 's v. Slater, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 489 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 15, 1998). Probable cause for employer-requested hearing.  Workers Compensation Commission erred in refusing to hear an employers allegation that a claimant receiving temporary partial disability unjustifiably ref used selective employment under § 65.2-510 on the ground there was insufficient probable cause for a hearing under Va. Workers Comp. Commn R. 1.4 and 1.5 because the employer did not submit medical evidence. Because the only allegation was a c hange in the conditions under which compensation was awarded, not a change in the claimants physical condition or work capacity, the employer was not required to submit medical evidence; the open award for itself provided the requisite probable cause . Food Lion, LLC v. Dalton, 50 Va. App. 713, 653 S.E.2d 611, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 441 (2007). Commission may make discretionary judgments.  In any legislation as extensive as workers compensation, it is impossible to anticipate and legislate every potential event intended to be covered, therefore, phrases such as unless in the opinion of the Commission such refusal was justified are provided so that those appointed to implement the compensation laws may make discretionary judgments that carry out the legislative intent. DePaul Medical Ctr . v. Hamilton Brickhouse, 18 Va. App. 506, 445 S.E.2d 494, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1584, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 379 (1994). Employment suitable to [the employees] capacity means employment within the employees residual capacity resulting from the industrial accident. The Act is based upon the premise that an employer is liable for the condition of an employee resulting from an industrial accident. But an employer is not liable for conditions not causally related to the employees work. American Furn. Co. v. Doane, 230 Va. 39, 334 S.E.2d 548, 1985 Va. LEXIS 247 (1985). Employees are under no statutory duty to seek selective employment. When they do so, how ever, there are no statutory constraints inhibiting those who have found such employment for themselves. Big D Quality Homebuilders v. Hamilton, 228 Va. 378, 322 S.E.2d 839, 1984 Va. LEXIS 314 (1984). Failure of employer to offer suitable work.  Though this section does not require an employer to make selective work available to a disabled employee, the fact that an employer seeking modification of an awa rd for total incapacity did not offer such work may be considered on the question whether the employer had borne the burden of showing a change in claimants condition such as would enable him to do some kind of work. J.A. Foust Coal Co. v. Messer, 19 5 Va. 762, 80 S.E.2d 533, 1954 Va. LEXIS 155 (1954). Workers compensation commission did not err in finding that the claimant was entitled to temporary total disability benefits for a disability resulting from a n injury he sustained while making a delivery for the employer, despite the fact that the employer soon terminated him based on his chronic tardiness; the employer did not meet its burden of alleging that the employer would have had available to claimant , but for his termination for cause, employment suitable to his capacity. M &amp; S Auto Parts, Inc. v. Presgraves, 45 Va. App. 455, 611 S.E.2d 655, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 155 (2005). Employee e ntitled to benefits.  Because the record supported the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions determination that a claimants poor performance at work was attributable to a work injury and its residual involuntary effects (including memory problems and day-long headaches) and not attributable to purely voluntary misconduct, an award of post-termination partial disability benefits under subsection A of § 65.2-510 was p roper. Pier 1 Imps., Inc. v. Wright, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 177 (Va. Ct. App. May 29, 2012). Time limit for curing refusal irrelevant to change-in-condition application.  This section does not have any bearing upon a change-in-condition application for an employee who becomes totally disabled as a result of an industrial accident a nd who files an application for total disability benefits after the expiration of the period within which he could have cured his unjustified refusal of employment.

Workers Compensation, § 46. CASE NOTES Dependents entitlement to scheduled benefits not claimed during employees lifetime.  This section permits a deceased employees dependents to collect the scheduled permanent partial loss benefits to which the employee was entitled at the time o f his death, even though the employee had not made a claim for scheduled benefits and would also have qualified for permanent and total incapacity benefits. Thomas Refuse Serv. v. Flood, 30 Va. App. 17, 515 S.E.2d 315, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (1999). Employee not entitled to compensatio n.  Where the employees arm injury had not reached maximum medical improvement at the time of his death, the employee could not have been rated for benefits under former § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503), and he was not entitled to compensation for the injury within the meaning of this section. County of Spotsylvania v. Hart, 218 Va. 565, 238 S.E.2d 813, 1977 Va. LEXIS 292 (1977) (decided under former § 65.1-64). Widow not entitled to benefits.  Credible evidence supported the commissions factual finding that the widow was not a dependent as defined in subdivision A 1 of § 65.2-515 and was not enti tled to an award of death benefits because at the time of the decedents death, the widow was neither receiving nor relying upon any financial support from the decedent; § 65.2-511 only authorized an award to a statutory dependent, and did not auth orize the award of benefits to someone that did not fall into that category. The right of statutory dependents under § 65.2-511 to receive an award terminated if the decedents death was caused by a compensable injury and the statutory dependents h ad already received compensation, e.g., death benefits under § 65.2-512. Runyon v. CBS Constr. Co., 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 64 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2011). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Cross reference.  If death is due to a compensable cause survivors may be eligible f or benefits under § 65.2-512. Who is Eligible for Benefits: Commission dismissed estates claim for permanent partial disability benefits holding that the General Assembly specifically excluded workers compensation benefits from the general rules of descent and distribution under Title 64.2. § 65.2-511 does not create a right to benefits in someone other than a statutory dependent. Frankenberg v. Century Tile, Inc., VA0000048431 (Oct. 10, 2014). If an employee is entitled to compensation and dies from a cause other than the compensable injury, payment of the unpaid balance of compensation is made to his s tatutory dependents under the Workers Compensation Act. The right of a dependent to obtain unpaid compensation is determined by the facts as of the date of the work accident, not as of the date of death. Roberson v. Ice Follies, 75 O.W.C. 143 (1996). Child of deceased employee entitled to same conclusive presumption of total dependency under this section as if employee died as result of injury. Selph v. Univ. of Richmond, 56 O.I.C. 287 (1974). Award Under § 65.2-503 May Be Made Af- ter Death: Where employee was still drawing compensation for temporary total incapacity at the time of his death from another cause, or for any other reason his rights under § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503) were never determined, statutory dependents under workers compensation act may apply for a hearing to enforce their rights under this section. Stone v. Va. Lincoln Furniture Co., 24 O.I.C. 463, 589 (1942); Delph v. V a. Iron, Coal &amp; Coke Co., 23 O.I.C. 54, 166 (1941); Jarvis v. Gayle, 20 O.I.C. 274, 310 (1938); Phillips v. Benson-Phillips Co., Inc., 14 O.I.C. 197 (1932). Entitlement to permanent partial disability benefits survives the claimants death. That is, the employees dependents may receive the permanent partial ben efits to which the employee would have been entitled, had he not died. Flood v. Thomas Refuse Service, 77 O.W.C. 170 (1998). Benefits for permanent total disability do not survive the death of an employee from causes unrelated to his work accident. Such benefits only continue for th e lifetime of the injured employee. Flood v. Thomas Refuse Service, 77 O.W.C. 170 (1998). The employee was a total quadriplegic when he died, and therefore met the requirements for permanent and total disability under § 65.2-503 (C). However, althou gh the employee was eligible for benefits under § 65.2-503 (C)(2), he never was awarded those benefits, and the provision of § 65.2-511 limiting such benefits for the employees lifetime did not ap ply. Because the claimants award had not been converted to an award for permanent and total benefits before his death, his dependents are in the same legal posture as dependents of other employees who were receiving benefits for temporary total disab ility. If the employee was receiving compensation for temporary total disability at the time of his death from another cause, and for any reason his rights under § 65.2-503 were never determined, the dependent distributees could enforce their rights u nder § 65.2-511. Flood v. Thomas Refuse Service, 77 O.W.C. 170 (1998). Past Due Benefits Payable to Estate: A claimants estate may recover temporary total disability benefits to which the claimant was entitled before death. Estate of Giers v. Francis N. Sanders Nur sing Home, Inc., VWC File No. 200-72-25 (Jan. 30, 2008), affd, No. 0332-0801 (Ct. of Appeals, June 3, 2008, unpublished). A claim for temporary total benefits is not abated by the claimants intervening death. Any benefits accrued prior to the death are payable to the decedent s personal representative for the estate and not to dependents. Carr v. Inova Alexandria Hospital, VWC File No. 196-10-72 (June 5, 2007). Compensation payments due during the lifetime of employee but unpaid whether awarded under § 65.1-56 (now § 65.2-503) or otherwise, are payable to his perso nal representative. Watson v. Cannon Constr. Co., 55 O.I.C. 365 (1973); Hamilton v. Big Branch Coal Co., 52 O.I.C. 128 (1970). Section 65.2-511 permits a claim for permanent partial disability benefits to survive the death of a claimant, but the Act does not contain a specific provision a llowing a claim for unpaid temporary total benefits to survive the death of the injured worker. However, the Commission found that long-standing precedent allowed a claimants estate to recover temporary total disability benefits and related expenses to which the claimant was entitled before death.

Rite Aid Corporation, 78 O.W.C. 16 (1999).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-512"><akn:num>§ 65.2-512</akn:num><akn:heading>Compensation to dependents of an employee killed; burial expenses</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Children born long after the accident, are not dependent upon their father at the time o f his accident, within the meaning of this section. Hatton, Brown &amp; Co. v. Holbrook, 159 Va. 224, 165 S.E. 403, 1932 Va. LEXIS 184 (1932). Payments to widow and children begin from date of last payment to claimant.  Where an employee who is receiving compensation under the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act dies from injuries suffered in the accident for which he was receiving compensation under the Act, compensation to his widow and dependent children shall begin from the date of the last payment to the claimant himself prior to his death, and continue for the remainder of the period from the date of the injury . Payment to the dependents commences where payment to the claimant left off. Hatton, Brown &amp; Co. v. Holbrook, 159 Va. 224, 165 S.E. 403, 1932 Va. LEXIS 184 (1932). Citizens of Puerto Rico are citizens of United States.  Puerto Rico is one of the territories and is a part of the United States as defined by § 1-13.31 [see now § 1-255], and its citizens and res idents are citizens and residents of the United States within this section.

App. 600, 496 S.E.2d 107, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 91 (1998). While the wife and the decedent had entered into a written settlement agreement to resolve their respective rights and duties, the overwhelming, uncontroverted ev idence clearly demonstrated that the wife relied on the decedent for her reasonable necessaries at the time of his death; therefore, the wife was an actual dependent of the decedent under subdivision A 1 of § 65.2-515 who was entitled to death benefits under § 65.2-512. Sifford v. Sifford, 58 Va. App. 722, 716 S.E.2d 128, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 305 (2011). Fewer than three employees.  Dismissal of workers compensation claim brought under subsection A of § 65.2-512 was affirmed where the employer presented evidence in the form of corporat e minutes that it had fewer than three employees at the time of the claimants injury. Estate of Pelfrey v. Sorah, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 387 (Va. Ct. App. July 8, 2003). Appellate court did not have jurisdiction over the claim made by the decedents estate for death benefits pursuant to § 65.2-512 of the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-100 et seq.; in order for decedent to have been an employee whose estate was eligible for death benefits, the employer had to have had three employees regularly in service in the Commonwealth at the time of the death of decedent, pursuant to § 65.2-101, and the employer only had two such employees, including decedent himself.

App. 95, holding that evidence in the record did not support a finding that the Commission had jurisdiction.). No employment for 52 weeks prior t o death.  Statutory beneficiaries were not entitled to benefits under the statute where: (1) the deceased employee voluntarily retired in 1993, (2) he was not employed at t he time of his death in 1996, (3) he had not earned wages during the 52 weeks immediately preceding the communication of the diagnosis of his occupational disease or during the 52 weeks immediately preceding his death, and (4) he was not actively seeking employment at the time of his death.

If death re sults from coal workers pneumoconiosis or if the employee was totally disabled by coal workers pneumoconiosis at the time of his death and claim for compensation is made within three years after such death, the employer shall pay or cause to be p aid to the surviving spouse of the deceased employee until his death or remarriage or the minor dependents of the employee until such minor dependents reach the age of eighteen (or twenty-three, so long as they remain as full-time students in a generally accredited institution of learning) or such other legal dependents as the deceased employee might have had at the time of his death for the duration of such dependency, 66 2/3 percent of the employees average weekly wage during the last three years that he worked in the coal mines, up to 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in § 65.2-500 without any specific limit as to the number of such weeks. However, any claim for compensation of an employee who was totally disabled by coal workers pneumoconiosis at the time of his death shall be paid only to the extent required by federal law. B. The Commiss ion shall, by regulation duly drawn and published after notice and hearing, prescribe standards, not inconsistent with those prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, as amended, for determining whether the death or total disability of an employee was due to pneumoconiosis or any chronic occupational lung disease. C. In prescrib ing such standards the following factors shall be included: 1. If an employee who died from a respirable (respiratory) disease was employed for ten years or more in an environment where he was injuriously exposed to such a disease, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that his disease arose out of such employment, or if he became totally disabled from coal workers pneumoconiosis or if such disease significantly contributed to his death or disability, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that his death or disability was due to such disease. 2. Where there is clear evidence of exposure to an occupational lung disease, the Commission may make its determination whether compensation is payable to the dependents based on the desc ription of the employees symptoms, X-rays, and other competent medical evidence, and the opinion of experts as to whether those symptoms reasonably described the symptoms of such an occupational disease. 3. The statement as to the cause of death on a death certificate may be considered as evidence in any such cases but shall not be controlling on the Commissions findings. The Commiss ion may also, by regulation, establish standards, not inconsistent with those prescribed by the Secretary of Labor under the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act as amended, for apportioning liability for benefits under this section and under § 65.2-504 A 4 among more than one operator, where such apportionment is appropriate, provided that no apportionment shall operate to deprive an employee of the full benefits due him under this title.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-66 or prior law. One of the purposes of the 1973 amendments to this section was to make uniform the requi rements of dependency without regard to gender. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). Section eliminates conjecture as to status of persons enumerated.  By placing a wife, husband and designated children in a class to themselves, the legislature eliminated all conjecture concerning their status in regard to depend ency, and left only for investigation as to them the question of whether or not the death of the employee arose out of and in the course of the employment. VEPCO v. Place, 150 Va. 562, 143 S.E. 756, 1928 Va. LEXIS 335 (1928). This section ought not require an employer to await the possible destitution of a parent of a deceased employee. Roanoke Belt Inc. v. Mroczkowski, 20 Va. App. 60, 455 S.E.2d 267, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (1995). Dependency defined.  The definition of dependency established by the Supreme Court in interpreting former § 65.1-67 (now § 65.2-515) is equally applicable to this section. Depen dency means that the claimant looked to and relied on the contributions of the employee, in whole or in part, as a means of support and maintenance in accordance with his or her social position and accustomed mode of life. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 22 0 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). Status determined as of time of death.  Where a parent seeks to assert the conclusive presumption of dependency under subdivision A 4, the parents status is to be determined by the evidence viewed a t the time of the employees death. Clark v. Lawhorne Bros., Inc., 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 724 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2000). Credible evidence supported the commissions factual finding that the widow was not a dependent as defined in subdivision A 1 of § 65.2-515 and was not enti tled to an award of death benefits because at the time of the decedents death, the widow was neither receiving nor relying upon any financial support from the decedent; § 65.2-511 only authorized an award to a statutory dependent, and did not auth orize the award of benefits to someone that did not fall into that category. The right of statutory dependents under § 65.2-511 to receive an award terminated if the decedents death was caused by a compensable injury and the statutory dependents h ad already received compensation, e.g., death benefits under § 65.2-512. Runyon v. CBS Constr. Co., 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 64 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2011). The crucial inquiry is whether evidence proved actual dependency upon the decedent for s upport even though she and the decedent had separated and were living apart when he died. To show actual dependency, claimants had to prove that the decedent contributed money to her with some degree of regularity and such contributions must have been re lied upon by her for reasonable necessaries consistent with her station in life. Tharp v. City of Norfolk, 19 Va. App. 653, 454 S.E.2d 13, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 140 (1995). Here the evidence of the mothers financial position at the time of her sons death was inadequate to classify her as financially vulnerable, and upon the r ecord the Workers Compensation Commission had insufficient evidence before it to determine that she was in destitute circumstances as defined by this section. Oil Transp., Inc. v. Jordan, 22 Va. App. 633, 472 S.E.2d 291, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 463 (1996 ). While the wife and the decedent had entered into a written settlement agreement to resolve their respective rights and duties, the overwhelming, uncontroverted ev idence clearly demonstrated that the wife relied on the decedent for her reasonable necessaries at the time of his death; therefore, the wife was an actual dependent of the decedent under subdivision A 1 of § 65.2-515 who was entitled to death benefits under § 65.2-512. Sifford v. Sifford, 58 Va. App. 722, 716 S.E.2d 128, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 305 (2011). Wife need not show she was who lly dependent.  Although the language of this section no longer presumes a wifes dependency upon her husband, it does not require the wife to establish that she was wholly de pendent upon her husbands earnings. It is highly unlikely that the General Assembly intended to restrict the conclusive presumption of total dependency to instances where the spouse had demonstrated that he or she was wholly dependent. Such a restric tion would nullify the purpose for the conclusive presumption. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). Pr esumption arises even if actual dependency only partial.  The conclusive presumption of this section arises once actual dependency, even though only partial, has been established. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495 , 260 S.E.2d 193, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). Evidence that claimant and her deceased husband had both contributed funds towards the purchase of a new home, that they had commingled their funds, and that her husbands salary enabled them to live a little bit above the standard of living otherwise attainable sufficiently demonstrated that, in actuality, she was at least partially dependent upon her husband; consequently, under the language of this section, she was conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent upon him. Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, 220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193, 1979 Va. LEXIS 289 (1979). The presumption of this section arises once actual dependency, even though only partial, has been established. The spouse must, however, establish that she relied on the decedents contributions as a means of support in accordance with her accustomed lifestyle. Armada, Inc. v. Lucas, 2 Va. App. 414, 345 S.E.2d 14, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (1986). No exception because of family relationship between employer and employee.  The provisions of this section and former § 65.1-67 (now § 65.2-515) make no exception because of family relationship between the employer and employee. Thu s the fact that the employer is the husband of the claimant does not bar claimant from receiving death benefits payable to the dependents of a deceased employee. The rule that a wife may not sue her husband in tort does not bar such a recovery by the cla imant, because a proceeding under the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act is not based upon tort. Glassco v. Glassco, 195 Va. 239, 77 S.E.2d 843, 1953 Va. LEXIS 193 (1953). Volunt ary desertion means same thing as in divorce cases.  Voluntary desertion in this section means the same thing that it means in divorce cases. Defonis v. Clinchfield Coal Corp., 186 Va. 715, 43 S.E.2d 852, 1947 Va. L EXIS 192 (1947). Thus a for ced separation is not voluntary abandonment.  A wife who was forced to separate from husband because of his cruelty did not abandon her husband voluntarily within the meaning of this section. Hundley v. Hundl ey, 182 Va. 14, 27 S.E.2d 902, 1943 Va. LEXIS 125 (1943). And conduct of wife forcing husband to desert bars compensation.  When a wife voluntarily so behaves that her husband can no longer remain with safety in the marriage state, and is forced to go elsewhere for protection, the wife is guilty of desertion within the meaning of this section. And it matters no...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-516"><akn:num>§ 65.2-516</akn:num><akn:heading>Other cases of dependency</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In all other cases questions of dependency in whole or in part shall be determined in accordance with the facts as the facts are at the time of the accident; but no all owance shall be made for any payment made in lieu of board and lodging or services and no compensation shall be allowed unless the dependency existed for a period of three months or more prior to the accident.

Workers Compensation, §§ 47, 50. CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-67 or prior law. Liberally construed.  In determining questions of dependency the Act should be liberally construed. Glassco v. Glassco, 195 Va. 239, 77 S.E.2d 843, 1953 Va. LEXIS 193 (1953). This section does not define dependency or specify the indicia of that status. From the proof adduced upon the hearing, it is the province of the Commission to find as a fact whether the particular claimant is entitled to compensation and to determine the amount thereof. Dunivan v. Hunter, 197 Va. 194, 89 S.E.2d 44, 1955 Va. LEXIS 211 (1955 ). And dependency under this section rests neither upon relationship nor presumption, but w holly upon the facts as they exist at the time of the death of employee, and is subject to change by the Commission as the condition of economic dependence or independence of the beneficiaries may vary from time to time. VEPCO v. Place, 150 Va. 562, 143 S.E. 756, 1928 Va. LEXIS 335 (1928); Commonwealth ex rel. State Hwy. Comm'n v. McGuire, 188 Va. 444, 50 S.E.2d 284, 1948 Va. LEXIS 178 (1948); Dunivan v. Hunter, 197 Va. 194, 89 S.E.2d 44, 1955 Va. LEXIS 211 (1955). But upon proof in particular case.  Whenever it appears that claimants come within the classification designated by former § 65.1-66 (now § 65.2-515), they are conclusively presumed, as a matt er of law, to be dependent and no evidence is required to show the fact of such dependency. But the question of dependency under this section depends upon proof in the particular case. And by the language of this section a wide discretion is vested in th e Commission. From the proof adduced upon the hearing, it is the province of the Commission to find as a fact whether the particular claimant is entitled to compensation, and to determine the amount thereof. VEPCO v. Place, 150 Va. 562, 143 S.E. 756, 192 8 Va. LEXIS 335 (1928) (see Indemnity Ins. Co. v. Nalls, 160 Va. 246, 168 S.E. 346 (1933); Commonwealth ex rel. State Hwy. Commn v. McGuire, 188 Va. 444, 50 S.E.2d 284 (1948); Glassco v. Glassco, 195 Va. 239, 77 S.E.2d 843 (1953)). It is determined as of time of acciden t.  Under the terms of this section, questions of dependency must be determined as of the time of the accident. Holt v. Stone &amp; Webster Engr Corp., 179 Va. 625, 2 0 S.E.2d 498 (1942). But see VEPCO v. Place, 150 Va. 562, 143 S.E. 756 (1928) stating that dependency is determined at the time of death . Nature of contributions by employee.  In applying this section, the employee must have contributed with some degree of regularity, and such contributions must have been relied upon by the claimant for reasonable necessaries consistent with his or her station in life. Miller &amp; Long v. Frye, 215 Va. 591, 212 S.E.2d 258, 1975 Va. LEXIS 193 (1975). While proof of absolute dependency for lifes necessities is not required, it must be shown that the claimant looked to and relied on the contributions of the employee, in whole or in part, as a means of support and maintenance in accordance with his or her social position and accustomed mode of life. Miller &amp; Long v. Frye, 215 Va. 591, 212 S.E.2d 258, 1975 Va. LEXIS 193 (1975). Lack of reliance is illustrated by the fact that no change was demonstrated in the famil ys accustomed mode of living when employees contributions commenced before his death, or when they ceased as the result of his death. Miller &amp; Long v. Frye, 215 Va. 591, 212 S.E.2d 258, 1975 Va. LEXIS 193 (1975). Able-bodied grown child actually dependent on father not entitled to compensation.  In an appeal from an order of the Compensation Commission, claimant, the 26-year-old unmarried daughter of a deceased employee, contended that since this section, after the enumeration in former § 65.1-66 (now § 65.2-515) of the persons conclusively presumed to be dependent, states that In all other cases questions of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the facts as t he facts may be at the time of the accident, she was entitled to compensation irrespective of whether she was physically incapacitated from earning a livelihood, because she was wholly dependent upon her father for support at the time of the accident . The court held that there was no merit in this contention. Basham v. Lowe, 176 Va. 485, 11 S.E.2d 638, 1940 Va. LEXIS 268 (1940). Family relatio nship between employer and employee.  As to former § 65.1-66 (now § 65.2-515) and this section not making exceptions because of family relationship between employer and employee, see Glassco v. Glassco, 195 Va. 239, 77 S.E.2d 843, 1953 Va. LEXIS 193 (1953). Facts showing partial, not total, dependency of minor brother and sister.  Deceased and his minor brother and sister lived with an older sister and her husband and seven children. Deceased contributed to the expenses of the household, an d at the time of his death was paying $18.00 a week to his sister while her husband contributed $45.00. These funds were commingled and used for the support of the entire household. On these facts the dependency of the minor brother and sister upon decea sed was not total but partial, in the proportion that deceaseds contribution bore to the entire family income. Dunivan v. Hunter, 197 Va. 194, 89 S.E.2d 44, 1955 Va. LEXIS 211 (1955). Facts showing parent s partly dependent on child.  There was evidence that deceased and two of his brothers each contributed one third to the support of their father and mother; besides the sons, there were two da ughters who worked but contributed nothing to the support of the family. The parents had no income except that the father received retirement pay from the navy yard. It was held that the father and mother of the deceased employee were one-third dependent upon him within the meaning of this section. Wright Motor Co. v. Steinhilber, 157 Va. 793, 162 S.E. 192, 1932 Va. LEXIS 328 (1932). Evidence held sufficient to warrant the finding that the claimant was partially dependent upon her son, the deceased employee. Glassco v. Glassco, 195 Va. 239, 77 S.E.2d 843, 1953 Va. LEXIS 193 (1953). The fact that the deceased employee made gifts of money to the claimant from time to tim e is not a sufficient basis for finding a dependency under this section. The employee must have contributed with some degree of regularity and such contributions must have been relied upon by the claimant for reasonable necessaries consistent with his or her station in life. Glassco v. Glassco, 195 Va. 239, 77 S.E.2d 843, 1953 Va. LEXIS 193 (1953). Facts demonstrated mutual assistance, not unilateral reliance.  Where an adult son received at home free the benefits (food, housing, use of a telephone and use of a motor vehicle) which one regularly employed would ordinarily pay for when living away from home, and in return for these benefits the son voluntarily performed services and made payments to aid the father, who earned a substantial income, in the support of a large family, this is a situation of mutual assistance and not one of unilateral reliance. Miller &amp; Long v. Frye, 215 Va. 591, 212 S.E.2d 258, 1975 Va. LEXIS 193 (1975). No obligation to provide support.  Friend of an employee who died at work was not entitled to receive workers compensation benefits as a dependent because there was no showing that the friend a ctually needed the employees support or that the employee had a legal and moral obligation to provide that support. Dunnavant v. Newman Tire Co., 51 Va. App. 252, 656 S.E.2d 431, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 63 (2008). Where a friends testimony showed he had no more than the mere status of a housemate, a situation that arose under many circumstances, but did not indicate a d ependent relationship on an employee beyond the sharing of a household, that fact alone could not qualify the friend as the employees dependent for the purposes of attaining statutory dependency status. Dunnavant v. Newman Tire Co., 51 Va. App. 252, 656 S.E.2d 431, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 63 (2008). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION General: A person who is a total dependent in fact under this section may share equally with a person who is a statutory dependent under § 65.1-66 (now § 65.2-515). Jordan v. Roeder, 50 O.I.C. 218 (1968). The degree of dependency is based on the proportion of the sums contributed by the decedent to the claimants total income. Vong v. Waverly Textile Processing, Inc., 73 O.W.C. 135 (1994). Parents who are partial dependents do not share compensation with acknowledged illegitimate son, deemed by statute a total dependent. Gaddy v. Withers, 50 O.I.C. 148 (1968). Where minor brothers or sisters of deceased worker reside with their parents the presumption is that their father is carrying out his legal and moral duty to supp ort them. Harris v. Diamond Constr. Co., 184 Va. 711, 36 S.E.2d 573, 1946 Va. LEXIS 136 (1946); Clark v. Appalachian Power Co., 153 Va. 86, 149 S.E. 613, 1929 Va. LEXIS 243 (1929).

Benefits may be reapportioned when a recipients dependency has terminated due to: (1) death, (2) marriage, and (3) the attainment of 18 years of age. This section makes no provision for reapportionment upon a third party settlement whic h excludes some beneficiaries from further receipt of payments. ACB Trucking, Inc. v. Griffin, 5 Va.

Termination of dependency of child.  The former language of this section that the dependency of a child, except a child physically or mentally incapacitated from earning a livelihood, shall termi nate with the attainment of eighteen years of age (or minor dependent was added after child in the quoted phrase by the 1960 amendment note) applies to a daughter whose right to compensation accrues by reason of the death of a parent after she becomes 18 years of age as well as to one who reaches that age while she is receiving compensation. Both are placed on the same footing. Basham v. Lowe, 176 Va. 485, 11 S.E.2d 638, 1940 Va. LEXIS 268 (1940) (decided under prior law). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION The death of the dependent spouse of deceased employee does not preclude an award of compensation to the estate of the deceased spouse if a compensable claim is e stablished.

CASE NOTES Multiple conditions.  Although an employee suffered three work-related conditions when the employee was awarded workers compensation benefits, the employee was allowed to receive b enefits for only one condition, so payments that the employer made were credited against the 500-week limit established by § 65.2-518 only for that condition, and the employee was entitled to receive benefits for the other conditions after the first c ondition no longer existed. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Eggleston, 264 Va. 13, 563 S.E.2d 685, 2002 Va. LEXIS 75 (2002). Worker limited to one recovery.  Section 65.2-518 limits total compensation under this title to 500 weeks or the average weekly wage of the commonwealth for the applicable year multiplied by 500. Where a worker is covered by both the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. § 901 et seq., and the state act, the injured worker may proceed under either or both statutes but was entitled to only a single recovery fo r his injuries. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Holmes, 37 Va. App. 188, 555 S.E.2d 419, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 652 (2001). Cost-of-living payments paid under former § 65.1-99.1 (now § 65.2-707) are not compensation within the meaning of the Workers Compensation Act. Bishopric Prods. Co. v. Brock, No. 1481-86-1 (Ct. of Appeals June 22, 1987) (decided under former § 65.1-71). Limitation period not reached.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions finding that an employer had not paid a claimant 500 weeks of wage loss compensation benefits was affirmed as th e appellate courts previous decision that the employers payments to the claimant of benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.S. § 901 et seq., were voluntary, were not contemplated by § 65.2-518, and co uld only be recouped under § 65.2-520, was the law of the case. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Holmes, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 128 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 4, 2006). Permanent and total incapacity not proven.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in denying the claimant permanent total disability benefits beyond the maximum 500 weeks she had already received and that were the most allowed as she did not meet her burden of proving permanent and total incapacity in both legs because the deputy commissioner never made a specific finding of fact at a hearing regarding whether the work-related accident c aused any right leg disability; no treating physicians testified at the hearing before the deputy commissioner; and the deputy commissioners opinion stated that the claimant met with a doctor on July 25, 2013, who felt she had morbid obesity and that she had multiple MRIs of the lumbar spine which revealed degenerative disease. Roane v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 263 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 27, 2020).

Most of the cases below were decided prior to the 2007 amendment to this section, which provided that payments made to injured employee under federal Longshore an d Harborworkers Compensation Act are deductible. This section does not authorize employer to ignore provisions of former § 65.1-93 (now § 65.2-701). Rather, it merely provides that payments voluntarily made prior to the rendition of an award may be deducted from the total amount of compensation due pursuant to the award subsequently entered. National Linen Serv. v. McGuinn, 5 Va. Ap p. 265, 362 S.E.2d 187, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1075, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 239 (1987) (decided under former § 65.1-72). This section does not distinguish between types of voluntary payments; rather, it includ es any type of payment not required under Act, whether payment is an overpayment as a result of mistake by employer, or a payment of benefits pursuant to another statute. Dodson v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 493 (Va. Ct. Ap p. Aug. 10, 1999). Payment of wages to the claimant based upon sick and annual leave may be credited to the department under the provisions of this section. Dyson v. Commonwealth/Department of Transp., No. 1554-88-3 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 24, 1989) (decided under former § 65.1-72). Sick leave p ay equivalent to payment of compensation.  Portion of a teachers sick leave pay was the equivalent of the school boards payment of compensation on the teachers original workers compensation claim, pursuant to the terms of the parties stipulated order. Augusta County Sch. Bd. v. Humphreys, 53 Va. App. 355, 672 S.E.2d 117, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 52 (2009). Overpayment not voluntary.  If the average weekly wage is miscalculated and the employer voluntarily has paid the claimant sums that were not due, the employer may recoup the sums; here, the claim had advanced beyond the provisions of this code section. An award based on an agreed memorandum had been made by the commission, and the overpayment was made pursuant to that award, not voluntarily. Collins v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Cont rol, 21 Va. App. 671, 467 S.E.2d 279, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 128 (1996). Approval of commission required.  The statute permits recoupment by an employer of voluntary excess payments only with the approval of the Workers Compensation Commission. Childress, Jr. v. Ap palachian Power Co., 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 673 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 22, 1998). Applying the Holmes standard, the appellate court held that § 65.2-520 facilitated an employers right to collect Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensat ion Act credits by deductions from compensation due an employee under the Act, but expressly restricted such offsets to one-fourth of the weekly payment, and created no alternative or exception to the collection mechanism to redress circu mstances that could result in a diminished recovery by the employer; while the pre-1998 version of the statute applied to the case, the outcome under the Holmes standard was the same. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Emerson, 2002 Va. App. LEX IS 139 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2002). Credit to employer allowed.  Here the employer was entitled to credit for the amount it had paid under the LHWCA that exceeded its obligation under the Workers Compensation Act. Virginia International Terminals, Inc. v. Moore, 22 Va. App. 396, 470 S.E.2d 574, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 368 (1996), aff'd, 254 Va. 46, 486 S.E.2d 528, 1997 Va. LEXIS 55 (1997). Credit to employer improper.  Employer improperly took credit for payments made to injured employee under federal Longshore and Harborworkers Compensation Act, and employer was therefore r equired to pay twenty percent penalty for payments not paid within two weeks of becoming due. Dodson v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 493 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 10, 1999). When an employer sought a credit for workers compensation benefits it paid to a claimant after she returned to light-duty work, the employer was not entitled to such a credit, under § 65.2-520, because the payments the employer made to the claimant were pursuant to an open award of workers compensation and, thus, were due and payable when made, so the employer was not entitled to a credit against futur e compensation. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Bailey, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 681 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 23, 2003). Express provisions of §§ 65.2-708 and 65.2-712 governing the termination of an award based on a change in condition controlled the issue of whether the empl oyer was entitled to a credit for workers compensation benefits it paid to the claimant for nearly nine months following his return to work after he had sustained a compensable injury and since those provisions did not dictate that the employer was e ntitled to a credit for the payments it made to the claimant despite its knowledge that he had returned to full-duty work, the workers compensation commission erred in finding that under § 65.2-520, the employer was entitled to a credit for having made such payments, as that statutory interpretation thwarted the legislatures intention, as set forth in the other two statutes, that an award of benefits only be altered prospectively. McFadden v. Carpet House, 42 Va. App. 302, 591 S.E.2d 708, 200 4 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (2004). Conventional meaning of compensation included only wage loss compensation, also known as indemnity payments; voluntary payments made to a claimant pursuan t to an unapproved out-of-state settlement were not credited against an employers liability to provide medical benefits. Uninsured Emplrs. Fund v. Wilson, 46 Va. App. 500, 619 S.E.2d 476, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 366 (2005). Employer was entitled to a credit under the § 65.2-520 for benefits paid under the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. S. § 901 et seq., as benefits paid under LHWCA were voluntary, and a de facto state workers compensation award existed during the same period of time as the LHWCA benefits were being paid, since the employer conceded, in a writing filed with the V irginia Workers Compensation Commission, the compensability of the claimants disability under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act for that period. Lyons v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 532 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2005). Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions finding that an employer had not paid a claimant 500 weeks of wage loss compensation benefits was affirmed as th e appellate courts previous decision that the employers payments to the claimant of benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C.S. § 901 et seq., were voluntary, were not contemplated by § 65.2-518, and co uld only be recouped under § 65.2-520, was the law of the case. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Holmes, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 128 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 4, 2006). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in finding that the employer had not reinstated a claimants leave where the employer had been ordered to pay the claimant temporary total disability benefits for the agreed disability period, and the purely ceremonial reinstatement of her lost 2016 leave, which she could not use, had not restored her to her former position of having that amount of leave available for use. Since the Commissions factual finding that the leave was not simultaneously reinstated was supported by credible evidence, the employer was required to pay the claimant the dollar value of the leave she had used. N. Va. Cmty. Coll . v. Easwarachandran, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 209 (Va. Ct. App. July 21, 2020). Approval from Workers Compensation Commission not required before taking credit.  This section does not require that an employer seek approval from the Workers Compensation Commission before taking a credit for voluntary payments made to a claimant. Brackett v. Chesapeake Public Schools, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 465 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 25, 1998). Error in refusal to offset benefits by Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act monies.  Commission erroneously refused to offset permanent partial disability benefits awarded claimant pursuant to the Virginia Workers Compensation Act by the tempo rary total disability monies previously paid under the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act.

Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Workers compensation awards ex empted.  All matters falling within the purview of the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-100 et seq., were the exclusive province of the Virginia Worker s Compensation Commission, and a clear meaning of the words used exempted lump sum workers compensation awards from the Virginia Structured Settlement Protection Act, § 59.1-475 et seq.; a workers petition seeking approval of a transfer of a s tructured settlement payment rights relating to a workers compensation award in a circuit court was dismissed. In re Moore, 68 Va. Cir. 139, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 67 (Portsmouth June 9, 2005). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION In order for a lump sum settlement to be approved, the Commission must be furnished sufficient information to determine if it is in the best interest of the emplo yee. The information must include evidence that the employees injuries are stabilized, permanency exists, evidence of the employees capabilities to handle the funds, and a detailed plan of how the proceeds will be used or invested.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-75.1 or prior law. Legislative intent.  While penalty statutes are to be narrowly construed, the legislature clearly and unambiguously has imposed a penalty for nonpayment of benefits within 14 days fro m the date that payment was due without consideration for good cause or good faith. Weston v. B.J. Church Constr. Co., 9 Va. App. 283, 387 S.E.2d 96, 6 Va. Law Rep. 892, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (1989). Applicability of section.  The penalty provisions of this section are inapplicable to a lump-sum compromise settlement for which no payment date has been fixed in the approving order. Once a payment date has been set, the penalty statute will apply, and the two-week period within which payment must be made to avoid the penalty will begin to run from that date. Absent a payment date specified in or approved by the order, however, the employ er was entitled to a reasonable time after entry of the order to make the required payment. Koppers Co. v. Brockenborough, 225 Va. 58, 300 S.E.2d 755, 1983 Va. LEXIS 191 (1983). Where the employer paid under a compromise settlement with no specified payment date within three days after its counsel was notified that payment had not been ma de, payment was made within a reasonable time. To hold otherwise would be to construe the penalty statute broadly, contrary to general principles, and to change the terms of the compromise agreement which the parties freely negotiated. Koppers Co. v. Bro ckenborough, 225 Va. 58, 300 S.E.2d 755, 1983 Va. LEXIS 191 (1983). The commission approved a compromise settlement between the claimant and employer by order entered December 1, 1994. On December 12, 1994, employer mailed the set tlement check to the claimant at her last known address. The claimant received the settlement check on December 15, 1994. Upon deposit of the settlement check, the claimants bank advised her that it would take seven to eleven business days for the ch eck to clear. Between December 16, 1994 and December 23, 1994, several checks written by the claimant on her account were returned for insufficient funds. Employer complied with its obligation pursuant to this section when it mailed the settlement check to the claimant eleven days after entry of the commissions order approving the settlement. Contrary to the claimants assertions on appeal, no evidence before the commission indicated that the funds available in the insurers account of the pay ee bank were insufficient to pay the settlement check. Thus, the commission did not err in refusing to assess a twenty percent penalty against the employer. Sangster v. Triple H Properties, Ltd., 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 334 (Va. Ct. App. May 7, 1996). Workers compensation commission erred in denying the claimants request for a penalty award against the employer and its insurer for their late payment of attorney fees; where the workers compensation commission ordered the attorney fee to be paid out of the claimants accrued compensation, the fee remained compensation within the meaning of the penalty statute, and that was true even where the workers compensation commission ordered the employer to pay a particular portion of the penalty to the claimants attorney as a reasonable fee pursuant to § 65.2-714. Roman v. Ondeo Degremont, Inc., 47 Va. App. 773, 627 S.E.2d 539, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 108 (2006). Employer was required to pay compensation pursuant to an award of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, and assessed a 20 percent penalty on unpaid co mpensation pursuant to § 65.2-524 because the employer unilaterally ceased paying an employee benefits due and owed under an open award. The employer stopped paying the employee compensation benefits when he returned to full-duty work, and did not fil e appropriate paperwork or an application to terminate the award until well outside the two-year period provided for doing so under § 65.2-708, and in violation of Va. Workers Comp. Commn R. 1.4. Washington Post v. Fox, 49 Va. App. 692, 644 S. E.2d 105, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 185 (2007). The consequence of the penalty provision of this section is to impose on the employer an d carrier the duty to monitor the entry of an order or award by the commission. Weston v. B.J. Church Constr. Co., 9 Va. App. 283, 387 S.E.2d 96, 6 Va. Law Rep. 892, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (1989). There is no savings provision or escape clause in this section. Weston v. B.J. Church Con str. Co., 9 Va. App. 283, 387 S.E.2d 96, 6 Va. Law Rep. 892, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (1989). For the purposes of this section, compensation is due on the date of the award.  This interpretation of when payment becomes due is reasonably related to a proper purpose, is not arbitrary or discriminatory and does not violate the constitutio nal rights of equal protection and due process. The fact that because of geographic location, some employers and insurers receive notice of an award by mail sooner than others, and thereby have more time to issue payment, does not constitute a denial of equal protection. Audobon Tree Serv. v. Childress, 2 Va. App. 35, 341 S.E.2d 211, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 239 (1986). The workers compensation statute is a remedial statute, its purpose being the prompt payment of compensation to injured workers and the purpose of the penalty provision of this section is to compel prompt payment, by requiring compensation to be paid within 14 days after it becomes due and this 14-day time limit is designed to discourage slow and circuitous payment of benefits due and to discourage in action or inattention to a claim. Weston v. B.J. Church Constr. Co., 9 Va. App. 283, 387 S.E.2d 96, 6 Va. Law Rep. 892, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 153 (1989). Under this section a benefit is paid when payment is mailed directly to the claimant, at his current residential address, within two weeks after it becomes due. Audobon Tree Serv. v. Childress, 2 Va. App. 35, 341 S.E.2d 211, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 239 (1986). Computation of time.  Section 1-13.3 [see now § 1-210] is applicable to payments made pursuant to the Workers Compensation Act, and the day following the award is the first day to be counted in computing the time allowed for making payments pursuant to an award. Audobon Tree Serv. v. Childress, 2 Va. App. 35, 341 S.E.2d 211, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 239 (1986). Claimant was not entitled to 20 percent statutory penalty that the claimant requested, because payment of compromise settlement agreement was not late; § 65.2- 524 allowed for 20 percent penalty for payment not made within two weeks after it became due, but the two week period did not apply if the employer could request review by the full workers compensation commission pursuant to § 65.2-705, in which c ase the two week time period was extended by the 20-day time period the employer had for requesting review by the full workers compensation commission and the payment was made to the claimant within the two weeks plus that additional 20-day time peri od. Ratliff v. Carter Mach. Co., 39 Va. App. 586, 575 S.E.2d 571, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 21 (2003). Where claimants check was not mailed directly to him, but instead, the insurer maile d it to his counsel, and claimant did not actually receive his check within the specified time period, the employer violated the provisions of this section. Audobon Tree Serv. v. Childress, 2 Va. App. 35, 341 S.E.2d 211, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 239 (1986). Workers Compensation Commission erred in vacating 20% late payment penalty for payme nts made more than 2 weeks after Court of Appeals affirmation of benefit award, there being nothing in the statute permitting an inference that the legislature intended further relief from the statutory penalty to cover the appeal period to the Supreme C ourt. Cousar v. Peoples Drug Store, 26 Va. App. 740, 496 S.E.2d 670, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 140 (1998).

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the reference to 37.2-1000 was changed to 64.2-2000 to conform to the recodification of Title 64 .1 by Acts 2012, c. 614, effective October 1, 2012.

The 2002 amendment by c. 301, in subsection A, in the first sentence, substituted spouse or parent for spouse in two places and substituted or the use of a minor child and such payments are made in the form of periodic weekly, monthly or quarterly payments for or children, and added the second sentence; substituted lump sum payment amounting to not more than $15,000 for sum amounting to not more than $10,000 in the aggregate in the second sentence of subsection B; and substituted lump sum payment greater than $15,000 for payment of over $10,000 in the aggregate in subsection C.

CASE NOTES Guardian.  The legislature clearly envisioned the need for a guardian with a legal obligation to protect the minors property and pursue his claims when the minor depende nt is entitled to sums exceeding $300 (now a lump sum payment greater than $15,000).

Payment to guardian or trustee.  Under subsection C of § 65.2-525, wherever payment of compensation over $300 (now a lump sum payment greater than $15,000) is due to a minor, the payment shoul d be made to the guardian of the property of the minor or to such suitable person appointed by the circuit court as trustee.

Wyche v. Colonial Pine Co., 30 O.I.C. 162 (1948). The employer or his insurer are not entitled to credit for a payment due the employee before his death where the payment is not made to a proper personal represen tative of the deceased. Eley v. Spire, 5 O.I.C. 89 (1923). Continued payment of benefits to the widow after her remarriage, does not relieve the carrier from paying the total amount of compensation accruing after the date of the remarriage to the infant children of the deceased worker. The responsiblity of paying compensation to the proper parties when benefits are terminated by operation of law is on the employer. Therefore the employer is responsible for any diversions of funds to the incorrect party. Finney v. Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co., 11 O.I.C. 252 (1929); Phillips v. Va.

For related discussion, see 21 M.J. Workers Compensation, § 58. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-79 or prior law. Construction with other law.  Existence of specific tolling provisions in this section and § 65.2-602 precluded Commission from applying § 8.01-229 A 1, a statute of general application, to toll limitation period in workers compensation proceeding. Whetzel v. Waste Management of Virginia, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 496 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 10, 1999). Guardian.  The definition of guardian in the decision of Ingram v. Marvel Poultry Co., 58 O.I.C. 192 (1978) affords the level of protection needed for infants who unknowingly possess compensable claims. The guardian should have a legal duty to pursue the minors wo rkers compensation claim. Where an infant had no such guardian from the time of his fathers death until the date he filed for compensation benefits, the statute of limitations delineated in former § 65.1-87 (now § 65.2-601) did not run agai nst him. ACB Trucking, Inc. v. Griffin, 5 Va. App. 542, 365 S.E.2d 334, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1860, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (1988), overruled in part, Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Fisher, 263 Va. 78, 557 S.E.2d 209, 2002 Va. LEXIS 15 (2002). Mental incompetency to toll running of statute.  A claimant is not required to show that he or she was continuously mentally incompetent during the entire limitations period in order to toll the running of the s tatute, nor is the claimant required to be committed to a hospital in order to prove mental incompetency. Rather, the claimant must prove by credible evidence that he or she did not have sufficient mind or reasoning powers to comprehend the ordinary aff airs of life, or that he or she had lost control of his or her mental power to such a degree as to deprive him or her of sane and normal action during the alleged period or periods of incompetency. Via v. Citicorp Mtg., Inc., 10 Va. App. 572, 394 S.E.2d 505, 7 Va. Law Rep. 47, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 128 (1990). Proof of mental incompetency.  The burden of proving mental incompetency so as to toll the running of the statute, is upon the injured employee. It is not necessary that it be proven that he is a lunatic or that he has been confined in a mental institution, but it must be proven by credible evidence that the injured employee did not have sufficient mind or reasoning powers to comprehend the ordinary affairs of life, or that he had lost control of his mental power to such a degree as to deprive him of sane and normal action. Rust Eng. Co. v. Ramsey, 194 Va. 975, 76 S.E.2d 195, 1953 Va. LEXIS 166 (1953) (holding that the proof in the case did not measure up to this test). The burden of proving mental incompetency so as to toll the running of the statute of limitations is on the claimants. Winston v. City of Richmond, 196 Va. 403, 8 3 S.E.2d 728, 1954 Va. LEXIS 234 (1954). Mental incompetency not proven.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions finding that a claimant failed to prove that he was incapacitated during the time period in which he was require d to file his application so as to toll, under § 65.2-528, the statute of limitations provided in subsection A of § 65.2-708 for a change-in-condition application was supported by credible evidence where: (1) The claimants treating physician op ined after the fact that the claimant was incapacitated, but his contemporaneous treatment notes did not reflect an incapacity; (2) The treating physician conceded that his after-the-fact opinion letter might have been a little overstated; and (3) The em ployers expert opined that the claimant had not been incompetent or incapacitated during the relevant period. Walker v. General Shale Prods. Corp., 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 411 (Va. Ct. App. July 22, 2003). Incarceration.  Incarceration was not an incapacity tolling statute of limitations under this section. Whetzel v. Waste Management of Virginia, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 496 (V a. Ct. App. Aug. 10, 1999). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION General: The burden to prove incompetency so as to toll the statute of limitations is on the claimant. He must prove insufficient mind or reasoning powers to comprehend th e ordinary affairs of life, or that loss of mental power deprived him of sane and normal action. Thomas v. Southwestern Virginia Mental Health Institute, 74 O.W.C. 219 (1995) (see also Rust Eng. Co. v. Ramsey, 194 Va. 975, 76 S.E.2d 195 (1953); Harriman v. Jackson Motel, 54 O.I.C. 158, 161 (1972); (appeal denied) Jackson v. New Jersey Zinc Company, 61 O.I.C. 221 (1982)). An employee seeking to set aside a settlement award on the grounds of incompetency has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was incompeten t at the time of the agreement. The law presumes competency, and it is not enough that the employee proves weakness of mind, absence of experience, or immaturity of reason. Where the claimant was found in a psychotic state only 19 days after meeting with a Deputy Commissioner and the carrier, and where the medical evidence showed that he was schizophrenic for a year before the settlement meeting and was not capable of independently contracting on a sophisticated legal question during the month prior to the date he was found in the psychotic state, it was proper to vacate the settlement award. Pretlow v. Tidewater Construction Corp., 75 O.W.C. 115 (1996). Statute of Limitation: In the case of an injured employee under eighteen years of age, the time limitation begins to run as of the date such employee attains the age of eighteen. Floren ce v. Petersburg Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 49 O.I.C. 106 (1967); Wilson v. Hall Products, Inc., 40 O.I.C. 174 (1958). Statute does not run against minor dependent without guardian though review not timely requested. Claim on behalf of adopted son filed less than a year from appoi ntment of guardian. Anz v. Fairfax Constr. Corp., 49 O.I.C. 10 (1967). Statute of limitations is tolled as to persons under disability until such time a guardian is appointed. Ingram v. Marval Poultry Co., 58 O.I.C. 192 (1978). The Virginia Workers Compensation Act has its own independent tolling provisions in Va. Code Ann. §§ 65.2-528 and 65.2-602. The presence of these speci fic provisions included as part of this statutorily-created remedy precludes application of the general tolling provisions of Title 8.01. Furthermore, because the claimant was not incarcerated at the time of his work-related injury, the alleged incapacit y would not have existed at the time of the accrual of the right to the remedy, thus rendering Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-229(A)(1) expressly inapplicable. Whetzel v. Waste Management of Virginia Blue Ridge, 78 O.W.C. 12 (1999), affd, No. 0352-9 9-3 (Va.

It shall hold such amount free of any person drawing against such funds whether by check against such account or otherwise.

CASE NOTES Construction.  General Assemblys use of all to modify compensation and even if in this section must be read and considered together. Additionally: (i ) the use of all demonstrates that the General Assembly intended for all workers compensation to be exempt from creditors claims, (ii) the phrase even if, in its normal convention, indicates that, despite the usage of the funds in either of the delineated examples, the totality of the funds will remain exempt, and (iii) the wording of the statute and the well-established principle of liberal statutory construction regarding exemption statutes indicate the General Assembly did not intend for its enumerated examples to signal an exclusion of other similar possibilities. In re: Apfel, 565 Bankr. 349, 2017 Bankr. LEXIS 445 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2017). Child support order.  When workers compensation carriers received an administrative order from the Department of Child Support Enforcement stating a claimant owed a child support a rrearage in the amount of $22,784.46 and the carriers paid that amount from the claimants $30,000 settlement proceeds, the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly determined it lacked authority to invalidate the Department of Child Supp ort Enforcement administrative support order because the validity of the order was not a question arising under or otherwise provided for the Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-700. Minor v. Aramark/VCU &amp; Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 5 9 Va. App. 622, 721 S.E.2d 818, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (2012). Mobile home and lot.  A mobile home and lot upon which the same is located is exempt property where it was purchased by workmens compensation benefits. In re Nelson, 179 Bankr. 811 , 1994 Bankr. LEXIS 1321 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1994). Use of proceeds to mak e business loan was proper.  Debtors use of his workers compensation proceeds to make a business loan was proper, and debtor could properly exempt the asset, scheduled as a business l oan, under § 65.2-531. A literal reading of the statute necessitated this determination. In re: Apfel, 565 Bankr. 349, 2017 Bankr. LEXIS 445 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2017). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Mandated member contribution toward retirement or other deductions elected by the employee.  The term regular payroll check refers to both the timing of the check and the amount of the check, so that the proposed legislative change to § 65.2-52 4 adequately defines regular payroll payment to avoid any penalty. It makes no difference whether the deduction for the new retirement contribution begins before or after the injured employee is injured. See opinion of Attorney General to Sara Re dding Wilson, Director, Department of Human Resource Management, and David Von Moll, State Comptroller, 11-113, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 6 (2/7/12). Because neither the new 5 percent mandated member contribution toward retirement or other deductions elected by the employee, including health-care premiums and f lexible reimbursement account deductions, constitute an assignment of benefits or a claim of a creditor, they are not prohibited by § 65.2-531 and may be deducted in appropriate circumstances. See opinion of Attorney General to Sara Redding Wilson, Di rector, Department of Human Resource Management, and David Von Moll, State Comptroller, 11-113, 2012 Va. AG LEXIS 6 (2/7/12). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Where a Virginia court has held that Virginia did not have the authority to disturb, modify, or dismiss a child support Order entered in Minnesota, the Commission entered an Order to the insurer to deduct amounts from the disability compensation of the claimant until the Minnesota child support arrearage was satisfied. Graham v. Roanoke Valley Resource Authority, 78 O.W.C. 107 (1999). Compensation is not assignable. Claimants agreement to make an equal division with Aetna of all sums received from Standard Accident Insurance Company under t he Workers Compensation Act may be null and void under this section. Horne v. Superior Life Ins. Co., 203 Va. 282, 123 S.E.2d 401, 1962 Va. LEXIS 140 (1962). Advance or loans made to employee not in lieu of compensation, but while he was receiving compensation, create only a debtor-creditor relationship and the Commiss ion may not direct a deduction from compensation to satisfy this debt. Francis v. McKimmie Motor Co., Inc., 44 O.I.C. 95 (1962). The carrier is entitled to a credit against its obligation to pay compensation benefits for all sums paid to the Division of Child Enforcement pursuant to a valid Order to Withhold. Section 65.2-531 A specifies that an injured workers compensation benefits shall be subject to claims for spousal and child support payment. Because the Divisions administrative orders have the force and effect of a court-issu ed support order, and workers compensation benefits are specifically encompassed by the Divisions statutory jurisdiction, the employer and carrier are legally bound to comply with Order to Withhold. No Commission action is necessary, as it is wit hout power to review or modify the Divisions withholding orders. Quinn v. Flowers Transport, Inc., VWC File No. 197-02-82 (September 17, 2002).

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former §§ 65.1-85, 65.1-86, or prior law. Filing of claim invokes jurisdiction of Commission.  The jurisdictional nature of a filing under former § 65.1-87 (now § 65.2-601) is not affected by any notice that may previously have been given to the emplo yer. Thus, while this section requires that the employer be promptly notified of an accident, it is the filing of a claim under former § 65.1-87 that invokes the jurisdiction of the Industrial Commission to award compensation. Garcia v. Mantech Int'l Corp., 2 Va. App. 749, 347 S.E.2d 548, 3 Va. Law Rep. 333, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (1986). In this section and former § 65.1-94 (now § 65.2-702) the legislature used the word employer in a generic sense to describe whichever employer, actual or statutory, from whom the worker seeks workers compensation benefits. Race Fork Coal Co. v. Turner, 237 Va. 639, 379 S.E.2d 341, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2382, 1989 Va. LEXIS 70 (19 89). Claim must inclu de certain information.  A claim for employees right to compensation must identify the employer, the date of the accident, the location of the accident, and the injuries suffered; als o, it must fairly apprise the Workers Compensation Commission that a claim is being made. Cheski v. Arlington County Pub. Schs., 16 Va. App. 936, 434 S.E.2d 353, 10 Va. Law Rep. 157, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 373 (1993). Information submitted did not constitute a claim.  Neither the material employee gave to her employer nor copies of two letters about the employees injuries written to the employee by the employers risk ma nagement agent that were sent to the Workers Compensation Commission were sufficient to constitute a claim where the two letters did not identify the location of the accident or the injuries suffered, and more importantly, they did not apprise the co mmission that a claim on behalf of the employee was being made. Cheski v. Arlington County Pub. Schs., 16 Va. App. 936, 434 S.E.2d 353, 10 Va. Law Rep. 157, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 373 (1993). Notice required for actual and statutory employers.  If a claim is made against both actual and statutory employers, notice to each employer is required. Wagner Enterprises, Inc. v. Brooks, 12 Va. App. 890, 407 S.E. 2d 32, 8 Va. Law Rep. 213, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 159 (1991) (decided under former § 65.1-85). Statutory employer s right to notice.  The legislative, administrative and judicial history of this section clearly suggests that the legislature intended that the potential responsibility of a statuto ry employer for a claim under the act, absent timely notice of the related accident, be resolved upon considerations different from those applicable to actual employers and, while mandating notice of an accident within thirty days of the occurrence to bo th statutory and actual employers, this section fashioned a threshold inquiry specific to a determination of responsibility under the act upon a statutory employer without timely notice of the accident. Under such circumstances, the statutory employer mu st have received at least sixty days notice of the hearing to ascertain compensability of the accident and suffered no prejudice from lack of notice. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Edwards, 32 Va. App. 814, 531 S.E.2d 35, 2000 Va. App. LEXI S 527 (2000). Section 65.2-600 A requires an employee to immediately on the occurrence of an accident or as soon thereafter as practicable, give or cause to be given to the emp loyer a written notice of the accident, and § 65.2-600 B, requires that the notice state the nature and cause of the accident and the injury; § 65.2-600 D sets a 30-day time limit for the required notice. Allyn v. Hanover County Soc. Servs., 2003 V a. App. LEXIS 73 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2003). Notice to insurer not required.  The Commission properly rejected appellants argument that this section required defendant to give notice to the insurer; this section requires notice to the e mployer. Solid Gold Corp. v. Wang, 18 Va. App. 66, 441 S.E.2d 643, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1070, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 126 (1994). The legislature did not contemplate that registered agents, directors, and shareholders of corporations must give notice to the insurance carrier. Solid Gold Corp. v. Wang, 18 Va. App. 66, 441 S.E.2d 643, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1070, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 126 (1994). The phrase prejudiced thereby in subsection D of this section does not encompass a statutory employers economic loss from the inability to obtain indemnification. Batal Bldrs., Inc. v. Hi-Tech Concrete, Inc., 18 Va. App. 401, 444 S.E.2d 555, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1406, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 331 (1994). Employ er must show prejudice from late notice.  Compensation will not be barred for failure to give timely notice unless the employer can prove it was prejudiced by such lack of notice. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber C o. v. Harris, 35 Va. App. 162, 543 S.E.2d 619, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (2001). Employer not prejudiced by delay in receiving written notice.  Commission correctly found that the employer was not prejudiced by the delay in receiving written notice from employee; no testimony or other medical evidence was presented to establish that employees injury would have been less severe had medical attention been sought prior to August 1988, or that employees continuing to work aggravated his condition from a medical standpoint; furthermore, employees failure to give timely notice did not hinder the employers investigation or preparation of the case since all witnesses were available for examination. Barnhill Constr. Corp. v. Martin, No. 0470-89-3 (Ct. of Appeals May 15, 1990). Burden of proof.  While the burden of showing a reasonable excuse for delay in giving notice of an accident is upon the claimant, after this is shown to the satisfaction of the Com mission the burden is upon the employer to show that he has been prejudiced by the delay. In the instant case notice was given as soon as practicable, the excuse for the delay was fully explained, and the employer was not prejudiced. Maryland Cas. Co. v. Robinson, 149 Va. 307, 141 S.E. 225, 1928 Va. LEXIS 367 (1928). While the burden of showing a reasonable excuse for a delay in giving notice is upon the claimant, after this is shown to the satisfaction of the Commission then the burden is upon the employer to show that he has been prejudiced by the delay. Lucas v. Research Analysis Corp., 209 Va. 583, 166 S.E.2d 294, 1969 Va. LEXIS 146 (1969). The burden of showing a reasonable excuse for delay in giving notice is on the employee; on the other hand, the burden of showing prejudice caused by the delay is upon the employer. Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Coffey, 13 Va. App. 446, 412 S.E.2d 209, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1616, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 325 (1991). An employers burden of proving prejudice caused by a claimants delay in giving timely notice is not applicable until the claimant has established a reason able excuse for the delay to the satisfaction of the Commission and, where a claimant does not establish a reasonable excuse for failing to give an employer notice of his work-related accident within thirty days of its occurrence, the employer is not req uired to show prejudice. Lawhorne v. Tri-State Cable Communs./ T.W. Fanch One Co., 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 574 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 2000). In applying this section, the principles are well established that the burden of showing a reasonable excuse for delay in giving notice is upon the employee and t hat the burden is upon the employer to show that the employer has been prejudiced by the delay. Smith v. Augusta Med. Ctr., 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 259 (Va. Ct. App. May 15, 2001). Workers Compensation Commission erred in finding that the employers filing of an accident report beyond the two-year statute of limitati...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-601"><akn:num>§ 65.2-601</akn:num><akn:heading>Time for filing claim</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The right to compensation under this title shall be forever barred, unless a claim be filed with the Commission within two years after the accident.

In General. II. Illustrations. A. Applicability. B. Notice. C. Timeliness. D. Estoppel. E. Imposition. I.In General. Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-87. Purpose of section.  It is the intent of this section that within the time prescribed by this section from the date of an accident, an employee must assert against his employer any cl aim that he might have for any injury growing out of an accident. Shawley v. Shea-Ball Construction Co., 216 Va. 442, 219 S.E.2d 849, 1975 Va. LEXIS 312 (1975). The intent of the Act is that the injured employee assert, within the limitation period, the existence of a claim growing out of a compensable injury by accident. Hungerford Mechanical Corp. v. Hobson, 11 Va. App. 675, 401 S.E.2d 213, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1582, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 23 (1991). The purpose of § 65.2-601 is to provide the parties with notice of the potential issues in a case; proper notice enables an employer to determine whether an em ployee has in fact been injured, the nature of the injury, whether it arose out of and in the course of the employees employment, whether permanent or temporary, and whether compensable or not. Hardee's of Clintwood v. Robinson, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 7 0 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2003). The special limitation under this section is part of the right as well as the remedy, as integral part of the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act, and a condition precedent to maintenance of the claim. Barksdale v. H.O. Engen, Inc., 218 Va. 496, 237 S.E.2d 794, 1977 Va. LEXIS 279 (1977). The right to compensation under the workmens compensation law is granted by statute, and in giving the right the legislature had full power to prescribe the t ime and manner of its exercise. Thus the time limitation is a part of the new substantive right. Barksdale v. H.O. Engen, Inc., 218 Va. 496, 237 S.E.2d 794, 1977 Va. LEXIS 279 (1977). And is jurisdictional.  The limitation provision of this section is jurisdictional and failure to file within the prescribed time will bar a claim. Barksdale v. H.O. Engen, Inc., 218 Va. 496, 237 S.E.2d 794, 1977 Va. LEXIS 279 (1977). The jurisdictional nature of a filing under this section is not affected by any notice that may previously have been given to the employer. Thus, while former § 65.1-85 (now § 65.2-600) requires that the employer be promptly notified of an accident, it is the filing of a claim under this section that invokes the jurisdiction of the Compensation Commission to award compensation. Garcia v. Mantech Int'l Co rp., 2 Va. App. 749, 347 S.E.2d 548, 3 Va. Law Rep. 333, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (1986). The time limitation provided in this section is jurisdictional. The jurisdictional effect of the statute on a filing is not affected by any notice that may have been previously given to an employer; it is not the fact of prior notice, but rather the filing of a claim that invokes the jurisdiction of the commission to award compensation. Broadus v. Shields Sec. Serv. &amp; Clark Enter., Inc., No. 1275-89-4 (Ct. of Ap peals Apr. 24, 1990). Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award medical benefits for injuries for which no claim was filed until more than fifteen years after compensable accident. Safeway Stores, Inc. v. McGowan, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 140 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 29, 2000). To perfect a claim for benefits under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-100 et seq., an employee must file notice of the claim with the commiss ion within two years of the accident, including all specific injuries an employee contends are compensable; timely filing of an original claim is jurisdictional, and a claimant bears the burden of proving his claim is timely filed. Johnson v. Paul Johnso n Plastering, 37 Va. App. 716, 561 S.E.2d 40, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 183 (2002), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 265 Va. 237, 576 S.E.2d 447, 2003 Va. LEXIS 28 (2003). When a workers compensation claimant did not seek permanent and total disability benefits for a brain injury within two years of the accident which allegedly caused the injury, the fact that he had been awarded benefits for the treatment of that injury did not preclude his employers denial of responsibility for this latest claim because the award for medical treatment was made more than two years after th e accident and, thus, without jurisdiction, so it could have no preclusive effect. Weikle v. Southland Corp., 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 126 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 11, 2003). The language of this section is clear. Binswanger Glass Co. v. Wallace, 214 Va. 70, 197 S .E.2d 191, 1973 Va. LEXIS 257 (1973). And the reason for the limitation prescribed by this section is a compelling one. Shawley v. Shea-Ball Construction Co., 216 Va. 442, 219 S.E.2d 849, 1975 Va. LEXIS 312 (1975). No direc tive as to which party must mail claim.  Workers compensation claimant was found to have timely filed a claim for benefits, pursuant to § 65.2-601 and Va. Workers Commn R. 1.1, where she e xecuted a memorandum of agreement and forwarded it to her employer for purposes of mailing to the Workers Compensation Commission; there was no directive as to who had the obligation of mailing the memorandum, and although an award based on the memor andum had been vacated, the actual memorandum itself had not been withdrawn or dismissed. Fairfax County Sch. Bd. v. Humphrey, 41 Va. App. 147, 583 S.E.2d 65, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 396 (2003). A timely claim for benefits, standing alone, fulfills the purpose of this section and th e supporting medical documentation and the request for a hearing may be filed at a later date. Metro Mach. Corp. v. Sowers, 33 Va. App. 197, 532 S.E.2d 341, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 591 (2000), overruled in part, King William Cnty. v. Jones, 66 Va. App. 531, 789 S.E.2d 133, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (2016) (applying an economic loss test as opposed to loss of earning capacity analysis). In the absence of an order from the commission dismissing claim for failure to prosecute, the commission has jurisdiction to hear the pending case. Kennedy v. Aceves Constr. &amp; Maintenance Co., 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 3, 1995). Withdrawal of Application for Hearing did not constitute withdrawal of claim.  Withdrawal of an Application for Hearing, where the application did not serve to file the claim, does not constitute withdrawal of the cla im, for purposes of applying the statutory time limitation. Keenan v. Westinghouse Elevator Co., 10 Va. App. 232, 391 S.E.2d 342, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2276, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 75 (1990). Insufficient claim terminati on.  Where the commission, responding to a claimants request, entered an order withdrawing an application for hearing, that order was insufficient to terminate the fact of the claim having been filed. Kennedy v. Aceves Constr. &amp; Maintenance Co., 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 3, 1995). Claim must name correct empl oyer.  Although the statute does not give a definition of claim, in order to have any legal effect a claim filed pursuant to this section must name the correct e mployer. This conclusion is aided by consideration of the function served by the notice requirement of this section. Garcia v. Mantech Int'l Corp., 2 Va. App. 749, 347 S.E.2d 548, 3 Va. Law Rep. 333, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (1986). A claim under this section must be directed against the correct employer. By requiring an initial claim under this section to state the correct employer, the Comm ission was not adding a requirement, but was merely stating that which is implicit in the language of the statute. Garcia v. Mantech Int'l Corp., 2 Va. App. 749, 347 S.E.2d 548, 3 Va. Law Rep. 333, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (1986). The filing of a claim which does not name the correct employer does nothing to accomplish the purposes of the notice. Since the Commission has no authority to awa rd benefits against an employer having no employment relationship with a claimant, the filing of a claim naming the wrong employer cannot set in motion the machinery for determining the merits of the case. In addition, such a claim does not provide notic e to the actual employer that the claimant is seeking an award from the Commission. Garcia v. Mantech Int'l Corp., 2 Va. App. 749, 347 S.E.2d 548, 3 Va. Law Rep. 333, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (1986). Letter o f counsel may be regarded as a claim.  A letter from counsel for the employer, written within a year from the time of the injury and after a verdict had been returned in favor of the employee in an act ion at law against the employer, requesting a hearing under former § 65.1-94 (now § 65.2-702), could be denominated a claim by the employer and was sufficient to stop the running of the statute of limitations set up by this section, so that a claim filed by the employee after reversal of the judgment ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-602"><akn:num>§ 65.2-602</akn:num><akn:heading>Tolling of statute of limitations</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In any case where an employer has received notice of an accident resulting in compensable injury to an employee as required by § 65.2-600 and, whether or not an awar d has been entered, the employer has paid compensation or wages to such employee during incapacity for work, as defined in § 65.2-500 or 65.2-502, resulting from such injury or the employer has failed to file the report of said accident with the Virgi nia Workers Compensation Commission as required by § 65.2-900, or otherwise has under a workers compensation plan or insurance policy furnished or caused to be furnished medical service to such employee as required by § 65.2-603, the statut e of limitations applicable to the filing of a claim shall be tolled until the last day for which such payment of compensation or wages or furnishment of medical services as described above is provided and that occurs more than six months after the date of accident. However, no such payment of wages or workers compensation benefits or furnishment of medical service as described above occurring after the expiration of the statute of limitations shall apply to this provision. In the case where the emp loyer has failed to file a first report, the statute of limitations shall be tolled during the duration thereof until the employer filed the first report of accident as required by § 65.2-900. In the event that more than one of the above tolling provi sions applies, whichever of those causes the longer period of tolling shall apply. History History. 1984, c. 608, § 65.1-87.1; 1989, c. 539; 1991, cc. 216, 355; 2 019, c. 470. Annotations Editors note. Acts 2019, c. 470, cl. 2 provides: That the provisions of this act shall apply with respect to any claim under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act (§ 65.2-100 et seq. of the Code of Virginia) that arises with respect to an injury as defined in § 65.2-101 of the Code of Virginia occurring on or after July 1, 2019. The 2019 amendments. The 2019 amendment by c. 470 rewrote the section. For applicability clause, see Editors note. Law Review. For 2003/2004 survey of the law of workers compensation, see 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. 475 (2004). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 21 M.J. Workers Compensation, §§ 57, 58, 71. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-87.1. Construction with other law.  Existence of specific tolling provisions in § 65.2-528 and this section precluded Commission from applying subdivision A 1 of § 8.01-229, a statute of gener al application, to toll limitation period in workers compensation proceeding. Whetzel v. Waste Management of Virginia, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 496 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 10, 1999). Compensation.  The phrase and although no award has been entered as used in former § 65.1-87.1 evinced a legislative intent that the word compensation applied to cases where payments were made in lieu of an award to which the employee would have been entitled under the Virginia Act. Bowden v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 11 Va. App. 683, 401 S.E.2d 884, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1588, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (1991). There was nothing in former § 65.1-87.1 to indicate that the legislature intended the term compensation to apply to payments other than those mandated by Chapter 5, i.e., lost wages or a percentage thereof paid in lieu of an award by the Commission. The lack of an expressed contrary intent was evidence of the legislatures intent not to broaden the statute to include payments made outside the requir ements of the Virginia Act. Bowden v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 11 Va. App. 683, 401 S.E.2d 884, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1588, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (1991). Error in retro active application of 1991 amendment.  Because the statute created a new substantive right through the use of the 1991 amending language, the commission erred in applying this section as retroactively amended. B.E. &amp; K. Constr. Co. v. Stanley, No. 1863-94-2 (Ct. of Appeals April 4, 1995). Payments from companys health and accident policy were not compensation.  Payments which employee received from the companys health and accident policy were payments outside the requirements of the Virginia Act and as such were not compensation under this section; accordingly, the provisions of this section were not applicable to this case for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations. Hervey v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 12 Va. App. 88, 402 S.E.2d 688, 7 Va. La w Rep. 1916, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (1991) (decided prior to the 1989 amendment). The doctrine of imposition empowers the commission in appropriate cases to render decisi ons based on justice shown by the total circumstances even though no fraud, mistake or concealment has been shown; the doctrine prevents an employers use of its superior knowledge of, or experience with, the workers compensation act or its use of economic advantage to cause an unjust deprivation to the employee of benefits provided by the act. Strong v. Old Dominion Power Co., 35 Va. App. 119, 543 S.E.2d 598, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 141 (2001). Under the doctrine of imposition, unlike estoppel, a claimants receipt of the standa rd blue letter from the commission does not create a de jure bar to a finding that claimant suffered prejudice. Rather, receipt of the blue letter is simply one circumstance among others to be considered. Odom v. Red Lobster #235, 20 Va. App. 228, 456 S.E.2d 140, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 371 (1995). The fact that the employer voluntarily paid the benefits to the employee following injur y does not as a matter of law operate to toll the statute of limitations or estop the employer from availing itself of the limitation provided by former § 65.1-87 (now § 65.2-601). Bowden v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 11 Va. App. 683 , 401 S.E.2d 884, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1588, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 27 (1991). An employer is not estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense merely because it voluntarily paid medical bills, wages or benefits; the employer s payment of benefits and medical bills and its participation in the employees medical care for two years are not sufficient conduct upon which the employee can rely to excuse his failure to file a claim. Strong v. Old Dominion Power Co., 35 Va. App. 119, 543 S.E.2d 598, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 141 (2001). Voluntary payment of compensation.  An employers voluntary payment of compensation estops the employer from asserting the statute of limitations if the employer makes representations to the empl oyee that induce the employee to refrain from filing a claim with the Workers Compensation Commission. Cheski v. Arlington County Pub. Schs., 16 Va. App. 936, 434 S.E.2d 353, 10 Va. Law Rep. 157, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 373 (1993). Blue letter or guide sent for one injury does not trigger the statuto ry per se lack of prejudice for second injury.  Blue letter or workers compensation guide sent for one injury does not trigger the statutory per se lack of prejudice for a second injury, even if it is recei ved after the incident that caused the second injury. Absence of prejudice as a matter of law is triggered only when a claimant receives a workers compensation guide or blue letter relating to the specific injury at issue after that injury occurs. To trigger a per se absence of prejudice, each injury requires its own timely blue letter. Falls Church Cabinetry v. Jewell, 60 Va. App. 134, 724 S.E.2d 236, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 134 (2012). No prejudice from late f iling of injury report.  Record was insufficient to warrant applying tolling provision of this section, where claimant failed to provide any evidence that he was prejudiced by employer s two-month delay in filing report of injury. Page v. Lynchburg Foundry Co., 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 158 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 7, 2000). Improper standar d applied to determine prejudice.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission used an incorrect standard to find that an employers delay in reporting an accident did not prejudice a claimant because the Commission found there was no prejudice when: (1) the claimant did not allege that the employer told the claimant not to file a claim; and (2) nothing showed the employer purposefully misled the claimant or acted inappropriately toward the cl aimant to persuade the claimant not to file a claim, but no authority required such an act to show prejudice that tolled the statute of limitations, under § 65.2-602. Jones v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd., 53 Va. App. 760, 675 S.E.2d 220, 2009 Va. App . LEXIS 177 (2009). Employer not estopped from raising statute of limitations as defense.  Where the Employers First Report of Accident was filed before the limitations period expired, this section could not serve as a basis to estop the employer fr om raising the statute of limitations defense. Cumbie v. Dining &amp; Wall Sys., No. 0550-92-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 1, 1992). Record supported f inding that statute was tolled.  Statute of limitations for filing claim was tolled by this section, where employers first report of accident was not timely and employer paid either wage loss benefits or wages in lieu of compensation for time claimant was unable to work; moreover, claimants receipt of guide did not retrospectively eliminate tolling of statute of limitations, which had already occurred. Fairfax Hosp. v. Post, 2000 Va. App . LEXIS 39 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2000). Because an employer failed to file an accident report with the Workers Compensation Commission, and because the employer had been paying benefits to the emplo yee for over two years, the employee was actually prejudiced; therefore, pursuant to § 65.2-602, the two-year statute of limitations period was tolled. Metl-Span 1, Ltd. v. Carter, 49 Va. App. 685, 644 S.E.2d 101, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 183 (2007).

Text A. Pursuant to this section: 1. As lo ng as necessary after an accident, the employer shall furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the injured employee, a physician chosen by the injured employee from a panel of at least three physicians selected by the employer and such other n ecessary medical attention. Where such accident results in the amputation or loss of use of an arm, hand, leg, or foot or the enucleation of an eye or the loss of any natural teeth or loss of hearing, the employer shall furnish prosthetic or orthotic app liances, as well as wheelchairs, scooters, walkers, canes, or crutches, proper fitting and maintenance thereof, and training in the use thereof, as the nature of the injury may require. In awards entered for incapacity for work, under this title, upon determination by the treating physician and the Commission that the same is medically necessary, the C ommission may: a. Require that the employer either (i) furnish and maintain modifications to or equipment for the employees automobile or (ii) if there is a loss of function to either or both feet, legs, hands, or arms and if the Commission determines tha t modifications to or equipment for the employees automobile pursuant to clause (i) are not technically feasible, will not render the automobile operable by the employee, or will cost more than is available for such purpose after payment for any item s provided under subdivision b, order that the balance of funds available under the aggregate cap of $55,000 be applied towards the purchase by the employee of a suitable automobile or to furnish or maintain modifications to such automobile; and b. Require that the employer furnish and maintain bedside lifts, adjustable beds, and modification of the employees principal home consisting of ramps, handrails, do orway alterations, or any appliances prescribed by the treating physician, except for appliances or medical equipment required to be furnished by the employer pursuant to subdivision A 1. The aggregate cost of all such items and modifications required to be furnished pursuant to subdivisions a and b on account of any one accident shall not exceed $55,000 . This limit shall be increased on an annual basis at the same rate as provided in subsection C of § 65.2-709. The employee shall accept the attending physician, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, and in addition, such surgical and hospital service and supplies as may b e deemed necessary by the attending physician or the Commission. 2. The employer shall repair, if repairable, or replace dentures, artificial limbs, or other prosthetic or orthotic devices damaged in an accident otherwise compensable under workers compensation, and furnish proper fitting thereof. 3. The employer shall also furnish or cause to be furnished, at the direction of the Commission, reasonable and necessary vocational rehabilitation services; however, the employer shall n ot be required to furnish, or cause to be furnished, services under this subdivision to any injured employee not eligible for lawful employment. Vocational rehabilitation services may include vocational evaluation, counseling, job coaching, job development, job placement, on-the-job training, education, and retr aining. Those vocational rehabilitation services that involve the exercise of professional judgment as defined in § 54.1-3510 shall be provided by a certified rehabilitation provider pursuant to Article 2 (§ 54.1-3510 et seq.) of Chapter 35 of Titl e 54.1 or by a person licensed by the Boards of Counseling; Medicine; Nursing; Optometry; Psychology; or Social Work or, in accordance with subsection B of § 54.1-3513, by a person certified by the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (CRCC) as a certified rehabilitation counselor (CRC) or a person certified by the Commission on Certification of Work Adjustment and Vocational Evaluation Specialists (CCWAVES) as a Certified Vocational Evaluation Specialist (CVE). In the event a dispute arises, any party may request a hearing and seek the approval of the Commission for the proposed services. Such services shall take into account the employees preinjury job and wage classifications; his age, aptitude, and level of education; the likelihood of success in the new vocation; and the relative costs and benefits to be derived from such services. B. The unjusti fied refusal of the employee to accept such medical service or vocational rehabilitation services when provided by the employer shall bar the employee from further compensation until such refusal ceases and no compensation shall at any time be paid for t he period of suspension unless, in the opinion of the Commission, the circumstances justified the refusal. In any such case the Commission may order a change in the medical or hospital service or vocational rehabilitation services. C. If in an em ergency or on account of the employers failure to provide the medical care during the period herein specified, or for other good reasons, a physician other than provided by the employer is called to treat the injured employee, during such period, the reasonable cost of such service shall be paid by the employer if ordered so to do by the Commission. D. As used in this section and in § 65.2-604, the terms medical attention, medical service, medical care, and medical report shall be deemed to include chiropractic service or treatment and, where appropriate, a chiropractic treatmen t report. E. Whenever an employer furnishes an employee the names of three physicians pursuant to this section, and the employer also assumes all or part of the cost of providing health care coverage for the employee as a self-insured or under a group health insurance policy, h ealth services plan or health care plan, upon the request of an employee, the employer shall also inform the employee whether each physician named is eligible to receive payment under the employees health care coverage provided by the employer. F. If the inju red employee has an injury which may be treated within the scope of practice for a chiropractor, then the employer or insurer may include chiropractors on the panel provided the injured employee.

Any health care provider attending an injured employee shall, upon request of the injured employee, employer, insurer, or a certified rehabilitation provider as provided in Article 2 (§ 54.1-3510 et seq.) of Chapter 35 of Title 54.1 providing services to the inj ured employee, or of any representative thereof, furnish a copy of any medical report to the injured employee, employer, insurer, or a certified rehabilitation provider as provided in Article 2 (§ 54.1-3510 et seq.) of Chapter 35 of Title 54.1 providi ng services to the injured employee, or to any representative thereof, or to each of them upon request for such medical report. B. Whenever an y health care provider attending an injured employee refers the employee or transfers responsibility for his care to another health care provider, the referring or transferring provider, upon receipt of a request therefor, shall promptly transfer or caus e to be transferred to the new or succeeding provider, or to the employee or someone acting on behalf of the employee, copies of all diagnostic test results, x-ray photographs, and other medical records pertaining to the employees injury for which fu rther treatment is to be sought from the succeeding provider.In the event of such referral or transfer, the succeeding provider, if given any such diagnostic test results, x-ray photographs and other medical records pertaining to the employees injury which were performed or recorded within the preceding 60 days by a referring or transferring provider, shall not repeat any such diagnostic tests or procedures previously conducted without making a good faith attempt to use them unless there is a medica l necessity to do so as certified by a qualified physician on behalf of the succeeding provider. If the succeeding health care provider violates the requirements of this paragraph, such succeeding provider shall not be entitled to compensation or reimbur sement from the injured employees employer or the employers insurer for any repeated test or procedure not so certified to be medically necessary, nor may the succeeding provider require the employee to bear any cost associated with the repeated test or procedure which would have been the responsibility of the employer or his insurer but for the provisions of this subsection.

CASE NOTES Independent expert witness selected by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of this section together with his work product, such as X-rays or other tests and records, is subject to the same discoveries, examinations and views as any other witness in the cause being heard. Moreover, if X-rays are admitted into the record together with a n experts report  regardless of whether such evidence results from the efforts of a party or the Commission  then the reports of other experts should be admitted and considered by the Commission together with the other evidence in the record. Lynchburg Foundry v. Goldies Tune, 1 Va. App. 295, 338 S.E.2d 645, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 198 (1986) (decided under former § 65.1-88.1). Claimant bore the burden of proving that the physicians medical treatment was reasonable, necessary, and causally related to his industrial injury. Neither the physician nor claimant produced any medical records related to the physicians treatment of claimant from which it could be determined that such treatment was reasonab le, necessary, and causally related to claimants industrial injury. Therefore, claimants evidence failed to sustain his burden of proof. Mika v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 100 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 18, 1997). Ac cess by employer to X-rays relied on by independent expert.  The Commission should have allowed the employer access to X-rays on which the independent expert selected by the Commission relied, since it was necessary to effe ctive cross-examination of this expert to have the benefit of employers expert advice prior to the examination. Lynchburg Foundry v. Goldies Tune, 1 Va. App. 295, 338 S.E.2d 645, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 198 (1986) (decided under former § 65.1-88.1). Excuse for refusing medical attentio n.  The evidence was convincing that the claimant refused the medical attention offered him and urged upon him, without any excuse for doing so other than his notion that he could take care of himself. This was not a legal excuse. Stump v. Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Corp., 187 Va. 932, 48 S.E.2d 209, 1948 Va. LEXIS 280 (1948) (decided under prior law). Notice sufficient.  Finding that the employee was entitled to ongoing workers compensation benefits was appropriate because evidence of prejudice from the settlement as to injuri es other than the compensable brain injury did not justify termination of the award for that injury. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, established that claimant suffered no exacerbation of his compensable 2004 brain injury in the 2006 auto accident and continued to be temporarily and totally disabled as a result of the 2004 brain injury after the 2006 auto accident. United Airlines, Inc. v. Hayes, 58 Va. App. 220, 708 S.E.2d 418, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 163 (2011). Credible evidence showed that the treating physicians refused to produce claimants m edical records to the employer and insurer pursuant to their statutory duty. Wiggins v. Fairfax Park Ltd. Partnership, 22 Va. App. 432, 470 S.E.2d 591, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 355 (1996). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Submission of diagnosis.  Plaintiff alleged that a doctor was mistaken in her diagnosis, but the diagnosis, however erroneous, it was an expression of opinion, it was necessary for the doc tor to submit this form to the insurer, since the plaintiff was pursuing a workers compensation claim; it was appropriate for the third-party administrator to alert the chief of police to the diagnosis, and the communication of the diagnosis was not defamatory as a matter of law. Shumate v. City of Martinsville, 90 Va. Cir. 122, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 25 (Martinsville Mar. 25, 2015), aff'd, No. 151285, 2016 Va. Unpub. LEXIS 21 (Va. Sept. 22, 2016). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION The language of § 65.2-604, and the § 32.1-127.1:03 C exclusion of information governed by the Workers Compensation Act, applies to all medical records, not just those records which are or may be related to a claimants injury by accident. The health care provider is not allowed to determine which of its records possibly relate to an employees workplace injury before responding to a subpoena duc es tecum. Scarafino v. CVS Drugs, VWC File No. 206-30-17 (July 8, 2004), appeal rejected as interlocutory, No. 1844-04-2 (Ct. App. Va., Feb. 10, 2005). Subpoenas duces tecum are requests under § 65.2-604. The requirements of § 32.1-172.1:03 H do not apply to subpoenas duces tecum served in the conte xt of workers compensation proceedings. A claimant waives his or her medical privacy rights upon filing a workers compensation claim. Randall v. SHS, VWC File No. 214-26-37 (March 29, 2004). Deputy Commissioner correctly refused to quash subpoena for non-partys medical records, which was resisted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accounta bility Act of 1996; HIPAA does not preclude issuance of a subpoena of non-partys medical records and also does not apply to workers compensation provisions allowing production of such records. Goodwin v. Sentara Norfolk Genl Hosp., VWC File N o. 208-72-40 (Aug. 6, 2003). Commission Rule 4.2 provides that a medical care provider attending an injured employee shall furnish a copy of required reports to the employer or employee. The physician-patient privilege as to all physicians is waived in all proceedings under the Act. Hassell v. Arlington County Human Services, 79 O.W.C. 141 (2000). The Commission may require reports not requested by other federal and state agencies and medical codes are not sufficient to report medical diagnosis and medical services. A properly executed Attending Physicians Report meets this obligation. Martin v. Saunders B. Moon Community, 71 O.W.C. 198 (1992). The treating physician is required to provide the employer information regarding the treatment and status of the claimant, and the employer is entitled to have th e attending physician complete a physical capacities form for the purpose of evaluating work capacity, even if he has not been released to work.

There is nothing within the language of this section which limits the Industrial (now Workers Compensation) Commissions fact finding authority. Island Creek Coal Co. v. Honaker, 9 Va. App. 336, 388 S.E.2d 271, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1218, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (1990). Rule authorizing appointment of physician applies to claimant who is not employee.  The statutory rule embodied in this section authorizing the Commission to appoint a disinterested physician to make a medical examination applies to the e xamination of a claimant who is not an employee. Basham v. Lowe, 176 Va. 485, 11 S.E.2d 638, 1940 Va. LEXIS 268 (1940) (applying section to dependent claiming compensation). Request for an examination must be timely. Basham v. Lowe, 176 Va. 485, 11 S.E.2d 638, 19 40 Va. LEXIS 268 (1940). A motion for an examination made five days after the trial was denied. C.D. Kenny Co. v. Solomon, 158 Va. 25, 163 S.E. 97, 1932 Va. LEXIS 237 (1932) (see Basham v. Lowe, 176 Va. 485, 11 S.E.2d 638 (1940)). Examination should be made by a physician selected by the Commission, and who is in that sense disinterested or impartial. Basham v. Lowe, 176 Va. 485, 11 S.E.2d 638, 1940 Va. LEXIS 268 (1940). And appointment of physician is left to discretion of the hearing commissioner.  Gale v. Zaban's Mattress &amp; Box Spring Co., 191 Va. 610, 62 S.E.2d 19, 1950 Va. LEXIS 244 (1950). Court of Appeals of Virginia sees no indication that the legislature intended the word may contained in § 65.2-606 to be interpreted as shall or must; therefor e, the court gives the word may its ordinary meaning. Ordinarily, may is a permissive word. It follows that if the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission is permitted to take certain action, the commission is also permitted not to do so. Pittsylvan ia Cty. Bd. of Supervisors v. Hall, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (Va. Ct. App. June 12, 2018). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in denying the employers request for appointment of a disinterested physician for a medical examinati on under § 65.2-606 where nothing indicated that the legislature intended that the word may be interpreted as mandatory, and the commission exercised its discretion not to appoint. Pittsylvania Cty. Bd. of Supervisors v. Hall, 2018 Va. App. LE XIS 161 (Va. Ct. App. June 12, 2018). A physician selected, employed and paid by either party is not disinterested or impartial within the meaning of this section. Basham v. Lowe, 176 Va. 485, 11 S.E.2d 638, 1940 Va. LEXIS 268 (1940). And his testimony should be excluded.  Since the Commission had no authority to require claimant, over her objection, to submit to an examination by physicians selected by the insurance carrier, the co urt erred in permitting these physicians to testify as to the result of their examinations. Basham v. Lowe, 176 Va. 485, 11 S.E.2d 638, 1940 Va. LEXIS 268 (1940). Who may require em ployee to see another physician.  An employer can require an employee to select an attending physician from its panel of three, but only an attending physician or the Commission may require an emp loyee to see another physician. Richmond Mem. Hosp. v. Allen, 3 Va. App. 314, 349 S.E.2d 419, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1023, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 366 (1986). Section permits Commission to consider evidence not adduced before hearing commissioner.  The agreement of litigants to submit a case upon the evidence adduced before the hearing commissioner did not conclusively preclude the Commission from hearing an d considering other evidence if that be deemed necessary to a correct determination of the issues before it. That procedure is permitted by this section. Pittston Co. v. Fulks, 201 Va. 128, 109 S.E.2d 387, 1959 Va. LEXIS 202 (1959). Employer may examine expert on whose report Commission relies.  Where the Commission gave the employer no opportunity to examine the expert upon whose report it relied, the award was set aside and the case remanded. Pittston C o. v. Fulks, 201 Va. 128, 109 S.E.2d 387, 1959 Va. LEXIS 202 (1959). Exam ination may be ordered after evidence taken by deputy.  Under this section the hearing commissioner could properly order claimant to appear for examination after evidence had been taken by a deputy, since the matter wa s still pending before him and there had been no adjudication thereon. Walsh Constr. Co. v. London, 195 Va. 810, 80 S.E.2d 524, 1954 Va. LEXIS 160 (1954). The opinion of an independent medical expert, selected by the Commission pursuant to thi s section, is subject to the same examination and challenge as that of any other witness and to hold otherwise would result in a transfer to the independent medical examiner of the commissions role as finder of fact and such a holding would contradic t former § 65.1-96 A (now § 65.2-704 A), which assigns the commission responsibility to decide all issues presented before it. Island Creek Coal Co. v. Honaker, 9 Va. App. 336, 388 S.E.2d 271, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1218, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (1990). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Va. Code § 65.2-606 authorizes the Commission to appoint a disinterested physician or surgeon to make a necessary medical examination. This authority is exerci sed to help the Commission resolve a conflict in the medical opinions or to prevent the perpetration of a fraud on the Commission. Code § 65.2-606 is not intended to provide a means through which a claimant may use the Commission and its resources to develop evidence for her case where there is no conflict in the medical evidence, or where there is only such conflict as requires that the Commission make a reasonable choice as to which of the medical opinions are more persuasive. Pollard v. First Gen eral Services, 77 O.W.C. 259 (1998). The Commissions appointment of a disinterested physician is unnecessary when the medical evidence is without conflict. Gale v. Zabans Mattress Co., 191 V a. 610, 62 S.E.2d 19; Chafin v. Burton Ford Coal Co., 47 O.I.C. 68 (1965); Keene v. Jewell Ridge Coal Co., 61 O.I.C. 259 (1982). The findings of an independent medical expert selected by the Commission are subject to examination and challenge by the parties. Lynchburg Foundry v. Goldies Tun e, 1 Va. App. 295, 338 S.E.2d 645, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 198 (1986). The Commission is not bound by the opinion of an expert it obtained pursuant to Code § 65.1-90 (now § 65.2-606). Island Creek Coal Co. v. Honaker, 9 Va. App . 336, 388 S.E.2d 271, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1218, 1990 Va.

After an in jury and so long as he claims compensation, the employee, if so requested by his employer or ordered by the Commission, shall submit himself to examination, at reasonable times and places, by a duly qualified physician or surgeon designated and paid by t he employer or the Commission. However, no employer may obtain more than one examination per medical specialty without prior authorization from the Commission, based upon a showing of good cause or necessity. The employee shall have the right to have pre sent at such examination any duly qualified physician or surgeon provided and paid by him. No fact communicated to, or otherwise learned by, any physician or surgeon who may have attended or examined the employee, or who may have been present at any exam ination, shall be privileged, either in hearings provided for by this title, or any action at law brought to recover damages against any employer subject to the provisions of this title. B. If the empl oyee refuses to submit himself to or in any way obstructs such examination requested by and provided for by the employer, his right to compensation and his right to take or prosecute any proceedings under this title shall be suspended until such refusal or objection ceases and no compensation shall at any time be payable for the period of suspension unless in the opinion of the Commission the circumstances justify the refusal or obstruction. C. The employe r or the Commission may in any case of death require an autopsy at the expense of the party requesting the same. Such autopsy shall be performed upon order of the Commission, and anyone obstructing or interfering with such autopsy shall be punished for c ontempt. History History.

Justification for refusal must be from claimants viewpoint.  Justification for an employees refusal to submit to a medical examination must be determined from the viewpoint of the claimant. R. G. Moore Building Corp. v. Mullins, 10 Va. App. 211, 390 S.E.2d 788, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1997, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 61 (1990). Refu sal to be examined justified where notice inadequate.  Should an employee refuse to cooperate in an examination, his right to compensation is suspended until his refusal ceases. However, where employer did not inform claimant of the appointment with the ophthalmologist until 30 minutes before the time of the appointment, claimant had no time or opportunity to arrange to have his own physician present, and claimants counsel was never informed of the appointment, t he Commissions finding that claimants refusal to be examined was justified due to inadequate notice of the appointment was clearly supported by the evidence. Volvo White Truck Corp. v. Hedge, 1 Va. App. 195, 336 S.E.2d 903, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (1985). Claimant justified in refusing to submit to stress test.  Evidence supported the commissions finding that the claimant was justified in refusing to submit to a stress test because she was genuinely in fear of the testing. R. G. Moore Building Corp. v. Mullins, 10 Va. App. 211, 390 S.E.2d 788, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1997, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 61 (1990). Inability to coo perate with examination requests.  Employer did not establish that injured employee refused to cooperate with examining physician, where the physician reported that while the employee did not compl y with certain examination requests the employee seemed unable to cooperate with the requests. Buchanan Gen. Hosp. v. Hunt, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 602 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 30, 2001). Claimant not justified in refusing independent psychiatric examination.  The Workers Compensation Commission did not err in suspending claimants compensation for his refusal to undergo an independent psychiatric examination, wh ere claimant received appropriate notice of the examination, but refused to go through with the examination without his attorney being present. Elliott v. Neighbors, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. May 12, 1998). Claimant must cure refusal in order to receive benefits.  In the absence of other mitigating factors, suspension of benefits for refusal of medical services will continue until a claimant actually meets with a physician and cures a refusal. Tageldin v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 118 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 1995). Refusal to complete forms.  When a worker who appeared for an independent medical examination at a clinic refused to fill out the medical history portions of a form provided by the clinic, d espite the fact that the form had been sent to his attorney to review, this was an obstruction of the examination, which did not proceed because of the workers refusal to complete the form. The fact that the worker was justified in not completing the portion of the form that obligated him to pay any balance due did not justify him in refusing to complete the medical history. Sherwin Williams Co. v. England, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 25, 2006). Right to have doctor present.  Although claimant had a right under subsection A to have her doctor present at the examination, this right may not be used to obstruct the employers right to have a medical examination take place. Tageldin v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 118 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 1995). Release.  Whether a treating physician has released or abandoned his patient generally is determined by the express intent of the physician. In some cases, the total circum stances must be analyzed in order to determine whether discharge, release, or abandonment of a patient was intended. This is a factual determination which must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Locklear v. Equifax Servs., 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 17 9 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 1995). This section waives the physician-patient privilege as to all physicians and in all proc eedings under the Workers Compensation Act. Wiggins v. Fairfax Park Ltd. Partnership, 22 Va. App. 432, 470 S.E.2d 591, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 355 (1996). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Exacerbated inju ry during vocational evaluation.  Where an employee filed a workers compensation claim and allegedly exacerbated an injury during a second functional capacity evaluation, a settlement agreemen t barred the employees negligence claim against the workers compensation insurer because: (1) the injuries were properly treated as an extension of the employees original workers compensation claim; and (2) the insurer and its agents enjo yed the same immunity from liability that the employer did under the Workers Compensation Act, since Virginia did not recognize the dual capacity doctrine. Mathes v. Davis, 74 Va. Cir. 411, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 298 (Norfolk Dec. 3, 2007). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION General: Deputy Commissioner correctly refused to quash subpoena for non-partys medical records, which was resisted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accounta bility Act of 1996; HIPAA does not preclude issuance of a subpoena of non-partys medical records and also does not apply to workers compensation provisions allowing production of such records. Goodwin v. Sentara Norfolk Genl Hosp., VWC File N o. 208-72-40 (Aug. 6, 2003). Employee not required to execute authorization for examination by employer-paid physician that contained hold-harmless provision; Act requires employees to submit to examination but does not require execution of hold- harmless releases. Wright v. Paramount Parks, Inc., VWC File No. 208-70-26 (Mar. 18, 2003). Although the common law recognizes no physician-patient privilege in either criminal or civil proceedings, Code § 8.01-399 provides a limit privilege in civil actions. However, Code § 65.2-607 grants no such privilege to a party in workers compensation proceedings. Morgan v. Eastern State Hospital, 78 O.W.C. 192 (1999). Commission Rule 4.2 provides that a medical care provider attending an injured employee shall furnish a copy of required reports to the employer or employee. The physician-patient privilege as to all physicians is waived in all proceedings under the Act. Hassell v. Arlington County Human Services, 79 O.W.C. 141 (2000). Even if a claim is found to be compensable, the employer is not responsible for the cost of a physicians treatment if the physician declines to produce the re cords of treatment. Hassell v. Arlington County Human Services, 79 O.W.C. 141 (2000). Code § 65.2-607(A) waives the physician/patient privilege as to all physicians and in all proceedings under the Act. It is not limited to facts learned or comm unicated during an independent medical examination. Wiggins v. Fairfax Park Ltd. Partnership, 22 Va. App. 432, 470 S.E.2d 591, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 355 (1996). Code § 65.2-607(A) waives the physician/patient privilege as to all physicians and in all proceedings under the Act. It is not limited to facts learned or comm unicated during an independent medical examination. Wiggins v. Fairfax Park Ltd. Partnership, 22 Va. App. 432, 470 S.E.2d 591, 1996 Va.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Statutory grant of authority to the Workers Compensation Commission includes the pow er to enforce its orders and to resolve coverage and payment disputes. Combustion Eng'g, Inc. v. Lafon, 22 Va. App. 235, 468 S.E.2d 698, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (1996). The determination of jurisdiction is the first order of business. James v. Arlington Coun ty Bd. of Supvrs., 226 Va. 284, 307 S.E.2d 900, 1983 Va. LEXIS 317 (1983). Jurisdiction over claims.  Pursuant to § 65.2-700, all questions arising under the Virginia Workers Compensation title, if not settled by agreements of the parties interested therein with the approval of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, shall be determined by the Commission. Lanning v. Va. DOT, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 81 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2003). Deputy commissioners order directing the employer and/or the guaranty fund to pay the employees treating physician was within the deputy commissioners subject matter jurisdiction since the employees claim involved treatment for a work accident. Furthermore, the workers compensation commission could not rule on the merits of that order because the guaranty fund did not timely appeal the order o nce it was entered. Miller v. Potomac Hosp. Found., 50 Va. App. 674, 653 S.E.2d 592, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 437 (2007). In a workers compensation case in which a deputy commissioner made the determination that an insurer did not provide coverage under the circumstances, the Vir ginia Uninsured Employers Fund argued unsuccessfully that the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission abused its discretion in declining to take further evidence or remand the issue to the deputy commissioner for further evidence. Under § 65. 2-700 and subsection A of § 65.2-705, the Commission had the authority to decide the issue of coverage without remanding to the deputy commissioner for further evidence. Chester v. Redifer, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 519 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 24, 2009). Although a claimant argued his due process rights were violated when he was not served with a Department of Child Support Enforcement administrative support order prior to workers compensation carriers paying the claimants child support arrearage to the Department of Child Support Enforcement from a settlement award, the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission lacked jurisdiction to interpret the ser vice requirements for Department of Child Support Enforcement administrative support orders because interpretation of the service requirements for Department of Child Support Enforcements administrative support orders was not a question arising u nder the Workers Compensation Act. Minor v. Aramark/VCU &amp; Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 59 Va. App. 622, 721 S.E.2d 818, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (2012). When workers compensation carriers received an administrative order from the Department of Child Support Enforcement stating a claimant owed a child support a rrearage in the amount of $22,784.46 and paid that amount from the claimants $30,000 settlement proceeds, the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly determined it lacked authority to invalidate the Department of Child Support Enforceme nt administrative support order because the validity of the order was not a question arising under or otherwise provided for in the Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-700. Minor v. Aramark/VCU &amp; Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 59 Va. App. 622, 721 S.E.2d 818, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (2012). Workers Compensation Commission properly found that it had jurisdiction to award compensation to a claimant because, the insurer agreed to pay compensation, t he claimant did not have to establish coverage, nothing in the record established that employer failed to comply with the statutory requirements, and there was no merit to the insurers assertion that the Uninsured Employers Fund was responsible f or paying compensation where the policy was not cancelled or not renewed. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Estate of Harrison, 64 Va. App. 110, 765 S.E.2d 154, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 396 (2014). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in exercising jurisdiction over a health care providers application because the Commission had before it a dispute among a medical care provider, an employee, and an employer concerning whether the employer was responsible, pursuant to a settlement order, for payment of the employees medical expenses. Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Wardell O rthopaedics, P.C., 67 Va. App. 420, 796 S.E.2d 469, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 51 (2017). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in ruling that a stipulated order permitted an employer to unilaterally terminate attendant care benefits because the stipulated order stated only that the employer would pay benefits until conditions justified a change, with no requirement that any change be pursuant to the parties agreement or Commission order; the case was settled by the statutes antecedent clause, notwithstanding the ambiguity that resulted from the agreement. Grizzard v. Sonny's Auto. Racing, Inc., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 60 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 13, 2018). Claims clearly outside act need not be submitted to Commission.  Where it is clear on the face of the pleadings that a claim is not within the purview of the workers compensation act, it is not necessary for plaintiffs to s ubmit their claims to the Commission. Adams v. Alliant Techsystems, Inc., 261 Va. 594, 544 S.E.2d 354, 2001 Va. LEXIS 57 (2001). Commis sion not authorized to apply laws of another state.  Although a Virginia court is free to recognize the perhaps paramount interests of another state by choosing to apply that states law in a particular case, the Compensation Commission does not have that power. Its jurisdiction is limited under this section to questions arising under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act. Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 100 S. Ct. 2647, 65 L. Ed. 2d 757, 1 980 U.S. LEXIS 54 (1980). Jurisdiction of Commission does not extend to litigation between two insurance carriers.  While the Compensation Commission has jurisdiction to do full and complete justice in each case, which includes the power and authority not only to make and enfor ce its awards but to protect itself and its awards from fraud, imposition and mistake, its jurisdiction does not extend to the litigation and resolution of issues between two insurance carriers which do not affect an award of the Commission. Generally, t he Commissions jurisdiction is limited to those issues which are directly or necessarily related to the right of an employee to compensation for a work-related injury. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Tucker, 3 Va. App. 116, 348 S.E.2d 416, 3 Va. Law Rep. 6 68, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 343 (1986). Questions between the insurer and the employer or another insurer do not arise under the act except insofar as they affect the rights of an injured employ ee. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Tucker, 3 Va. App. 116, 348 S.E.2d 416, 3 Va. Law Rep. 668, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 343 (1986). Question concerning insurance policys coverage of other partner properly invoked Commissions jurisdiction.  Where an application for workers compensation coverage was completed by a partner on behalf of the partnership, the application contained an express election to include both partners as employees under the workers compensation coverage of the partnership as allowed by former § 65.1-4.2 (now § 65.2-101), a policy was then issued to the partnership, and the question before the commission concerned whe ther the insurance policy covered the other partners stipulated, compensable injury, the commissions jurisdiction was properly invoked. Ace Metal Fabricators v. Counts, No. 0613-87-2 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 26, 1988). Litigants left to their common-law remedies when claimants rights not at stake.  When the rights of the claimant are not at stake, the act clearly leaves the litigants to their common-law remedies, with the pleading requirements, broader disco very and the more stringent rules of evidence not applicable under the act. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Tucker, 3 Va. App. 116, 348 S.E.2d 416, 3 Va. Law Rep. 668, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 343 (1986). Generally, the Commissions jurisdiction is limited to those issues which are directly or necessarily related to the right of an employee to compensation for a work-related injury; when the rights of the employee in a pending claim are not at stake, the Commission disavows jurisdiction and sends the parties to the courts for relief. Henry's Wrecker Serv. Co. v. Smoot, 35 Va. App. 365, 545 S.E.2d 551, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (2001). Commission was justified in requiring insurer to deal directl y with pharmacy where insured was dilatory in paying bills.  Upon the finding that the carrier was dilatory in payment of the pharmacy bill and was obstinate in its dealing with the pharmacy, the Commission was justified in taking appropriate measures to resolve the difficulty, even if it meant requiring the insurance carrier against its wishes to pay and deal directly with the pharmacy, and to pay such pharmacy, or other suppli...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-701"><akn:num>§ 65.2-701</akn:num><akn:heading>Agreement as to compensation; penalty</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. If after in jury or death, the employer and the injured employee or his dependents reach an agreement in regard to compensation or in compromise of a claim for compensation under this title, a memorandum of the agreement in the form prescribed by the Commission shal l be filed with the Commission for approval. The agreement may be prepared by the employee, the employer or the compensation carrier. If approved, the agreement shall be binding, and an award of compensation entered upon such agreement shall be for all p urposes enforceable as provided by § 65.2-710. If not approved, the same agreement shall be void. Such agreement may be approved only when the Commission, or any member thereof, is clearly of the opinion that the best interests of the employee or his dependents will be served thereby. The approval of such agreement shall bind infant or incapacitated dependents affected thereby. Any agreement entered into during the pendency of an appeal to the Court of Appeals shall be effective only with the approva l of the Commission as herein provided. B. An employer or insurance carrier which fails to file a memorandum of such agreement with the Commission within fourteen calendar days of the date of its complete written execution as indicated thereon may be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 and to any other a ppropriate sanctions of the Commission. C. Nothing her ein contained shall be construed so as to prevent settlements made by and between the employee and employer, but rather to encourage them, so long as the amount of compensation and the time and manner of payment are approved by the Commission. A copy of such settlement agreement shall be filed with the Commission by the employer. History History.

Construction with other laws.  Statutory scheme found in subsection C of § 65.2-701, subsection A of § 65.2-702 and subsection A of § 65.2-705, when read together, encourages agreement s by the parties to settle claims while also permitting either party to withdraw from an agreement and allowing the Workers Compensation Commission to decide the merits of the claim; unlike subsection A of § 65.2-705 there is no time constraint on when either party may request a hearing from the Commission under subsection A of § 65.2-702. Irby v. Lifepoint Health &amp; Safety Nat'l Cas. Corp., 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2020). De facto awards authorized by subsection A. Ryan's Family Steak Houses Inc. v. Gowan, 32 Va. App. 459, 528 S.E.2d 720, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 359 (2000). Power to correct mistake and vac ate award.  Workers Compensation Commission did not err in vacating its award because without the employers signature as required by the form, that award order was pr ocedurally deficient and entered by mistake; because of the Commissions mistake, it had the power to correct its mistake and vacate the award, even though the period for an application for review lapsed. Irby v. Lifepoint Health &amp; Safety Nat'l Cas. C orp., 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2020). Former § 65.1-72 (now § 65.2-520) does not authorize employer to ignore provisions of this section. Rather, it merely provides that payments voluntarily made prior to the rendition of an award may be deducted from the total amount of compensation due pursuant to the award subsequently entered. National Linen Serv. v. McGuinn, 5 Va. Ap p. 265, 362 S.E.2d 187, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1075, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 239 (1987). Employer not to ignore mandatory wording of statute to detriment of employees.  Although this section does not explicitly provide penalties for an employers failure to comply with its provisions, an employer cannot be permitted to ignore the mandatory wording of the statute to the detriment of its employees. National Linen Serv. v. McGuinn, 5 Va. App. 265, 362 S.E.2d 187, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1075, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 239 (1987). Employer obligat ed to file memoranda of agreement.  This section refers to agreements reached after injury and does not expressly state or imply that the employers obligation to file memoranda of agreem ent is limited to the initial award. Whether an agreement between the parties pertains to an initial award or a supplemental award following a change of condition, the employer is still obligated to file a memorandum of agreement with the commission. Hen rico Pub. Utils v. Taylor, 34 Va. App. 233, 540 S.E.2d 501, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (2001). Filing of memorandum of agreement satisfied claim filing requirements.  Memorandum of agreement, which was mailed by an employer to the Workers Compensation Commission, constituted a notice of claim pursuant to the requirements of § 65.2-701, where an award that had been entered thereon was vacated, but the actual memorandum was not withdrawn or dismissed; the court noted that the memorandum contained the essential filing requirements of claims, pursuant to Va. Workers Com p. Commn R. 1.1(A). Fairfax County Sch. Bd. v. Humphrey, 41 Va. App. 147, 583 S.E.2d 65, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 396 (2003). Failure to promptly file memorandum of agreements is violative of the statute and frustr ates a primary purpose behind the Workers Compensation Act  to expedite the entry of awards in cases where the parties agree as to the compensability of the employees injury. National Linen Serv. v. McGuinn, 5 Va. App. 265, 362 S.E.2d 187, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1075, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 239 (1987). Employers failure to file a memorandum of agreement violated the statute, and it cou ld not use its failure to comply with the statute as a means of circumventing the burden it would otherwise face. EWC Constr. v. Payne, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 189 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 12, 1996). Failure to list injury in agreement to pay benefits.  As the parties agreement to pay benefits did not mention the employees hand injury, which prevented his cooperation with vocational rehabilitation, it was not the subject of an enforceable award. Therefore, the employer, which applied for a hearing to terminate benefits under subsection B of § 65.2-603, did not have the burden to show that the hand injury was not work-related. UPS v. Ilg, 54 Va. App. 3 66, 679 S.E.2d 545, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (2009). As an employees carpal tunnel syndrome was classified as an ordinary disease of life by § 65.2-401, he had to establish by clear and convincing evi dence, not merely by a preponderance, that the injury arose in the course of the employment. As the parties agreement to pay benefits did not mention this injury, the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission could not have exercised its equitable powers to alter the agreement that the parties actually made. UPS v. Ilg, 54 Va. App. 366, 679 S.E.2d 545, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (2009). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly denied a claimant additional benefits for a right shoulder injury allegedly suffered as a result of a workpl ace accident where the clear and specific terms of her Commission-approved settlement expressly provided that she would receive no benefits for her right shoulder, the claimant understood the terms of the settlement, and there was no evidence of fraud, m isrepresentation, mutual mistake, or imposition. Giles v. Prince George Cty. Pub. Sch., 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 3 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 8, 2019). Compromise settlement agreements are not binding until commission approves it, and eithe r party may withdraw its offer to settle before approval. Damewood v. Lanford Bros. Co., 29 Va. App. 43, 509 S.E.2d 530, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 41 (1999). Claimant and employers stipulation that compromise settlement agreement would be paid by a certain date did not supersede statutory time period for paying set tlement by private contract; the settlement agreement had to be approved by the workers compensation commission and, thus, the two-week time period for paying the settlement was extended by the employers 20-day time period for seeking review befo re the full workers compensation commission and no statutory penalty could be imposed because the employer paid the settlement within the two-week period plus the 20-day period for review. Ratliff v. Carter Mach. Co., 39 Va. App. 586, 575 S.E.2d 571, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 21 (2003). Approval by the Commission of memorandum of agreement is binding, and an award of compensation entered upon such agreement is as enforceable as an award entered in a contested proceeding. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Tucker, 3 Va. App. 116, 348 S.E.2d 416, 3 Va. Law Rep. 668, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 343 (1986). Filing of me morandum of agreement terminating award.  Because the parties agreed to terminate the award at the time claimant returned to work, and because the employer filed the executed agreement forms, it was not n ecessary for the employer to file an application for a hearing. Smith-Adams v. Fairfax Cnty Sch. Bd., 67 Va. App. 584, 798 S.E.2d 466, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (2017). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err by enforcing a termination agreement and by denying the claimants request for benefits and penalties pursuant to a June 2005 award because, the parties actually executed a termination agreement that was submitted to the Commission and then proceeded for eight years acting as though the award had been...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-702"><akn:num>§ 65.2-702</akn:num><akn:heading>Disagreement on compensation; venue</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. If the empl oyer and the injured employee or his dependents fail to reach an agreement in regard to compensation under this title, or if they have reached such an agreement which has been signed and filed with the Commission and compensation has been paid or is due in accordance therewith and the parties thereto then disagree as to the continuance of any weekly payment under such agreement, either party may make application to the Commission for a hearing in regard to the matters at issue and for a ruling thereon. B. Immediately after such application has been received the Commission shall set the date for a hearing, which shall be held as soon as practicable, and shall notify the parties at issue of the time and place of such hearing. The hearing shall be held in the city or c ounty where the injury occurred, or in a contiguous city or county, unless otherwise designated by the Commission. History History.

Workers Compensation, §§ 55, 58, 60, 62, 7 0. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-94 or prior law. Construction with other laws.  Statutory scheme found in Va. Code Ann. subsection C of § 65.2-701, subsection A of 65.2-702 and subsection A of 65.2-705, when read together, encourages agree ments by the parties to settle claims while also permitting either party to withdraw from an agreement and allowing the Workers Compensation Commission to decide the merits of the claim; unlike subsection A of § 65.2-705 there is no time constrain t on when either party may request a hearing from the Commission under subsection A of § 65.2-702. Irby v. Lifepoint Health &amp; Safety Nat'l Cas. Corp., 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2020). This section applies to disputes arising before an award is made, whereas former § 65 .1-99 (now § 65.2-708) applies to disputes arising after the award. Parker v. Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co., 201 Va. 328, 111 S.E.2d 453, 1959 Va. LEXIS 230 (1959). In former § 65.1-85 (now § 65.2-600) and this section the legislature used the word employer in a generic sense to describe whichever employer, actual or statutory, from whom the worker seeks workers compensation benefits. Race Fork Coal Co. v. Turner, 237 Va. 639, 379 S.E.2d 341, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2382, 1989 Va. LEXIS 70 (19 89). It is not imperative that the record show an ineffectual attempt to settle all the issues or the claim before filing it with the Commission under this section. Nor is provision as to failure of the employer and employee to reach an agreement jurisdictional. Chalkley v. Nolde Bros., 186 Va. 900, 45 S.E.2d 297, 1947 Va. LEXIS 208 (1947). Statute of limitations.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the case because an employers request was not t imely filed within the statute of limitations; thus, after the employees estate claims were dismissed, there was no timely filed claim for the Commission to consider. Intercept Youth Servs. v. Estate of Lopez, 71 Va. App. 760, 840 S.E.2d 25, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 99 (2020). Because the statute of limitations had run and, therefore, expired when the claims of an employees estate were withdrawn and dismissed by the Virginia Workers  Compensation Commission, the estate was forever barred from prosecuting a claim for the employees death under the Workers Compensation Act; consequently, the employer was not subject to liability under the Act for the employees death, an d its request that the Commission determine the compensability of the claim was moot. Intercept Youth Servs. v. Estate of Lopez, 71 Va. App. 760, 840 S.E.2d 25, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 99 (2020). Authority of Commission.  In the absence of a properly executed and approved agreement, subsection A clearly granted the Workers Compensation Commission the authority to decide the mer its of an employees claim for benefits, pursuant to the employers request for review. Irby v. Lifepoint Health &amp; Safety Nat'l Cas. Corp., 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2020). Workers Compensation Commission had the discretion to decline to impose any sanctions; because no valid award agreement between the employee and the employer was ever approved by the Commission, either party was permitted to make an application to the Commission for a hearing and ruling on the matters at issue. Irby v. Lifepoint Health &amp; Safety Nat'l Cas. Corp., 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2020). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Commission lacked jurisdiction.  There was no basis for jurisdiction by the workers compensation commission because the employee and the employer never had a disagreement about compensation, the employee was not under a disability at the time of his death, and no compensation could be awarded because the employee had no dependents. Neither the policy behind the Workers Compensation Act nor its jurisdictional basis provided a statutory fr amework for resolution of the claims under the Act. Skopic v. Tate, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 132 (Fairfax County Nov. 18, 2009). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Employer has no right to referral of application to docket where claim previously was dismissed with prejudice; the dismissal rendered issues of the employers liability under the Act moot. Demke v. DC Water &amp; Sewer Authority, JCN VA02000028399 (Oct. 19, 2017). Employer has the right to file claim, right to a hearing even though employee has not filed a claim and believes accident did not occur in the course of his emplo yment. Leavelle v. City of Roanoke, JCN VA00000901003 (June 17, 2014). Either party may file an application with the Commission for a hearing to determine the compensability of a claim. Silberman v. Prince William School Board, 76 O. W.C. 231 (1997). Code § 65.2-702 provides that either party to a claim may make application to the Commission for a hearing in regard to the matters at issue and for a ruling t hereon. Petty v. Duffie Graphics, Inc., 76 O.W.C. 306 (1997). There is no requirement that there be a pending claim for benefits before a hearing on the merits can be requested. It is an accident, not a claim, that triggers the employers right to request a hearing to determine contested issues. Petty v. Duffie Graphics, Inc., 76 O.W.C. 306 (1997). An employer has standing to file an Application For Hearing to establish its rights and obligations under the Virginia Act. Harrison v. City of Portsmouth School Bd., 75 O.W.C. 305 (1996). Where the claimant alleges and has presented evidence of a carpal tunnel syndrome condition, the employer is entitled to a determination of its rights and respons ibilities in regard to that condition, regardless of the fact that the claimant has since withdrawn her claim. Specifically, the employer has a right to an opportunity to depose the claimant, any potential witnesses, and the diagnosing physician regardin g the facts surrounding the claimed condition while the events are fresh in peoples memories and documentation is still available. In addition, the employer is entitled to a final determination regarding whether it will be responsible for indemnity a nd lifetime medical benefits causally related to the claimed condition, and the carrier is entitled to the opportunity to establish appropriate reserves. Petty v. Duffie Graphics, Inc., 76 O.W.C. 306 (1997) (see also Silberman v. Prince William School Bo ard, 76 O.W.C. 231 (1997)). Virginia Code Ann. § 65.2-702, which provides that either party may make application to the Commission for a hearing in regard to the matters at issue and for a ruling thereon, does not authorize a third party co-employee to file an application and compel a hearing, even though the co-employee could otherwise be liable for civil penalties. Randolph v. Southern States Coop., Inc., 76 O.W.C. 339 (1997). There is no requirement that an application from a health care provider be filed by a licensed attorney. Blevins v. Williamsburg Pottery, 75 O.W.C. 103 (1996). When a timely request is made by a party that the Claims Division not approve a previously tendered agreement and an issue arises as to whether the action of the Claims Division in not approving the agreement is proper, either party is entitled to a hearing on the issues involved. Greene v. Ward Company, Inc., 63 O.I.C. 149 (1984). Where either party withdraws its approval of a Memorandum of Agreement prior to the entry of an award, the award will not be entered and the case will be schedule d for a hearing. If, however, the request is made after the award has been entered, a request for Review must be made within twenty days in order for the award to be vacated without the necessity of establishing fraud, mutual mistake or imposition. If th e request for Review is not timely made, the only means for vacating the award is by establishing fraud, mutual mistake or imposition. Sovran Financial Corp. v. Nanney, 12 Va. App. 1156, 408 S.E.2d 266 (1991), 69 O.I.C. 55 (1990). The fact that an employer pays benefits under the laws of another state does not establish either directly or by inference that the parties have reached an agreem ent as to the payment of compensation under the Virginia Act. Payment of benefits in another state does not estop the employer from asserting the defense of failure to market remaining capacity. Johnson v. Associated Transportation Services, Inc., 69 O.I .C. 80 (1990).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-703"><akn:num>§ 65.2-703</akn:num><akn:heading>Interrogatories and depositions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

CASE NOTES Appeal not authorize d from discovery decisions.  As is clear by the plain language of the statute, § 65.2-703 does not provide an avenue of appeal from a Virginia Workers Compensation Commission decision to grant or deny discovery, which is separate and apart from a legal proceeding before that administrative body. Indeed, with the exception of provisions concerning appeals from fines and penalties levied by the Commission for failure to maintain evidenc e of compliance with the requirements of Title 65.2, the only provision concerning appeals from Commission action is found in § 65.2-706. Green v. Keil Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., 42 Va. App. 539, 593 S.E.2d 525, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 108 (2004). Failure to respond to discovery.  Failure to respond to discovery can be penalized, but not without clear authority for such a penalty; Virginia Workers Compensation Commission can choose, in some circumstances, to exclude evidence when a party fails to disclose information during its discovery responses; however, there is no authority for the proposition that a deficiency in discovery responses relieves a claimant of its burden of proof. Lan ning v. Va. DOT, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 81 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2003). Written answers.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission acted within its discretion in denying a claimant attorney fees or, at minimum, reimbursement for the cost of deposin g his treating physician because the Commissions decision was in keeping with its own prior decisions and reflected a reasonable interpretation of its own rules; the physician cooperated in every possible way and provided adequate information via wri tten answers to the questionnaires he was given, as well as extensive opinions. Wells v. Auto. Serv. Garage, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 20, 2018). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION General: Also see notes under Rule 1.8. A claimants on-going award of medical benefits constitutes a sufficient issue or proceeding to allow the defendants to propound discovery concerning medical t reatment. Greenwood v. B W I Distribution, VWC File No. 194-35-98 (May 13, 2005). Where the claimant is on an outstanding award there is a proceeding under the title such as to allow for discovery, and the Commission has the authority to requir e the production of documents and other things. Habina v. Jasper Construction, VWC File No. 173-22-55 (Aug. 26, 2005). The 21 day time frame contained in Rule 1.8 for providing answers to interrogatories also applies to request for production of documents. After a party has been p rovided the initial 21 days, it is within the discretion of the deputy commissioner to determine the time frame for responses to an Order to Compel. Habina v. Jasper Construction, VWC File No. 173-22-55 (Aug. 26, 2005). Section 65.2-703 asserts, inter alia, that all interrogatories, depositions, or any other discovery shall conform to rules governing discovery promulgated by the Commission, and that such rules shall conform as nearly as practicable to the Rules of the Virginia Supreme Court regarding discovery. The Commission has interpreted this Section to allow reasonable discretion to most efficiently administer the Act and to do justice for all parties, as may be suggested by the facts of a particular case. Magana v. Sosa , 79 O.W.C. 136 (2000). The scope of discovery in a Commission proceeding is determined not only by Commission Rule 1.8 but also by Supreme Court Rule 4:1(b)(1), which in part provides t hat, [p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party. Craft v. Commercial Courier Express, Inc., 78 O.W.C. 270 (1999). Claimants ongoing award for medical benefits constitutes an issue or proceeding pending before the Commission as those terms are used in Commi ssion Rule 1.8 and in Virginia Code § 65.2-703. Also, Virginia Code § 65.2-711 requires a claimant under an open award to inform the employer of his current residential address unless there is reasonable justification for refusing to do so. A resi dential address is not equivalent to a post office box address. Craft v. Commercial Courier Express, Inc., 78 O.W.C. 270 (1999). The employer is entitled to a determination of its rights and responsibilities in regard to a claimants condition even if the initial claim has been withdrawn . Specifically, the employer has a right to depose the claimant, any potential witnesses, and the diagnosing physician regarding the facts surrounding the accident while the events are fresh in peoples memories and documentation is still available. It is entitled to a final determination regarding its responsibility for indemnity lifetime and lifetime medical benefits and to establish appropriate reserves. Petty v. Duffie Graphics, Inc., 76 O.W.C. 306 (1997) (see also Silberman v. Prince William S chool Board, 76 O.W.C. 231 (1997)). An employees ongoing award of medical benefits constitutes a sufficient issue or proceeding before the Commission to allow the issuance of dis covery requests under Rule 1.8(A). The employer sought leave to issue a subpoena to a third party entity, on whose premises the accident occurred, seeking information regarding the accident and a possible claim against the third-party. The employee was u nder a medical award, but no other matter was pending before the Commission, and the third party argued that the subpoena exceeded the scope of discovery under Commission rules. The Commission disagreed, finding that the claim remained before it on the o pen medical award, noting the impact that the discovery could have on the award and subrogation rights under Code §§ 65.2-309 and 65.2-310. Johnson v. Laurel Trucking, Inc., VWC File No. 200-18-25 (August 29, 2001) see also Fields v. Labor Ready, I nc., VWC File No. 203-70-99 (November 16, 2001) (applying the same rule to demand for answers to interrogatories). Depositions: The deputy commissioner did not err in failing to admit claimants discovery deposition where employer objected, and claimant testified extensively at the hear ing regarding the events surrounding his injury. Thaxton v. United Parcel Service, Inc., VWC File No. 218-71-85 (Feb. 1, 2005). The moving party must pay cost of deposition. Hernandez v. The Alexandria Hospital, 57 O.I.C. 172 (1977). Interrogatories: Where a claimant fails to file answers to Interrogatories over two and one-half years after their approval and after being advised the claim would be dismissed if a response was not received by a specific time, the Commission may dismiss the application on the basis that the inaction was an abandonment of claim. Peoples v. Marriott Hotel, 67 O.I.C. 25 (1988). Dismissal of a claim, with a condition that a new claim will be accepted only if outstanding discovery interrogatories are answered, is an appropriate sanction wh ere there is chronic failure to file discovery responses. After a claim is dismissed without prejudice, it is treated as if no claim had been filed. Bryant v. Fieldcrest Cannon, Inc., 75 O.W.C. 184 (1996). A claimants inaccurate or incomplete answers to interrogatories concerning medical conditions which were unrelated to her carpal tunnel syndrome was not a bar to an award of compensation benefits. Davis v. Pannill Knitting Company, Inc., 66 O.I.C. 71 (1987). In workers compensation cases the parties will be required to provide upon request the identity and addresses of witnesses who may have knowledge of pertinent facts relating to the claim. Gary v. Thomas E. Gary Trucking, 69 O.I.C. 62 (1990). Where counsel fails to object or to provide the names, addresses and summary of facts and opinions of each witness as requested by interrogatories, it is appropri ate to exclude the testimony of any witness for whom the requested information was not provided. Johnson v. Blue Ridge Talc Co., 69 O.I.C. 66 (1990). So long as a claimant remains under an open award, the employer has the right to discover medical evidence relevant to the claimants physical and medical cond ition. Discovery is permissible while a claimant is under an open award even in the absence of a pending application for hearing. Craft v. Commercial Courier Express, Inc., 78 O.W.C. 270 (1999).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-704"><akn:num>§ 65.2-704</akn:num><akn:heading>Hearing; award or opinion by Commission</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-96 or prior law. Copies must be mailed to ind ividual parties.  Plain language of subsection A of § 65.2-704 makes it clear that copies of decisions must be mailed to the individual parties as well as to their counsel; if t his is not done, the time limit for seeking review does not begin to run. Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., 38 Va. App. 241, 563 S.E.2d 368, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 294 (2002). Commission has authority to hear case de novo and will not be bound by the findings of t he deputy. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, 5 Va. App. 374, 363 S.E.2d 433, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1457, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (1987). Failure to have full commiss ion hear review.  Decision reviewing the award of benefits to a claimant was reversed on appeal as the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission lacked authority to review the e mployers appeal of that decision as a result of having only two out of three statutorily required Commissioners hear the review due to a vacancy existing on the Commission. The employer had not waived the issued since it had raised the same in a moti on to reconsider or vacate the decision. Hitt Constr. v. Pratt, 53 Va. App. 422, 672 S.E.2d 904, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (2009). Commission is not empowered to make rulings on issues not presented by the application f or hearing and which the employer does not have notice that it will be required to defend. Fas Mart Convenience Stores, Inc. v. Tyndell, No. 1806-89-2 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 9, 1990). Subsection B does not limit chairmans authority.  Subsection B of this section empowers the chairman, individually, to name a deputy to act with the two members who are present and qualified but, in granting the chairman authority to act when the full Commission would not be available, the statute does not thereby limit the authority of the full Commission to act in other situations. Clinch Valley Med. Ctr. v. Hayes, 34 Va. App. 183, 538 S.E.2d 369, 2000 Va. App . LEXIS 835 (2000). Proceedings before the Commission are intended to be summary. Stonega Coke &amp; Coal Co. v. Sutherland, 136 Va. 489, 118 S.E. 133, 1923 Va. LEXIS 100 (1923). No strict conformity for hearings but minimal due process for review.  Hearings before the commission are not required to be held in strict conformity as are trials in common-law courts. However, the commissions authority to cons ider an application for original injury benefits as an application for review on change of condition is not without limitation. The procedure utilized must afford the parties minimal due process. Fas Mart Convenience Stores, Inc. v. Tyndell, No. 1806-89 -2 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 9, 1990). On the record  procedure satisfied due process.  Because no genuine controversy existed, the on the record hearing procedure utilized by the deputy commissioner met the requirements of due process. Dunca n v. ABF Freight Sys., 20 Va. App. 418, 457 S.E.2d 424, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 456 (1995). Witnesses no t necessary to prove matters agreed upon.  This section does not mean that witnesses must be heard in extenso to prove matters upon which the parties may agree. Harris v. Diamond Constr. Co., 184 Va. 711, 36 S.E.2d 573, 1946 Va. LEXIS 136 (1946). The opinion of an independent medical expert, selected by the Commission pursuant to for mer § 65.1-90 (now § 65.2-606), is subject to the same examination and challenge as that of any other witness and to hold otherwise would result in a transfer to the independent medical examiner of the commissions role as finder of fact and suc h a holding would contradict subsection A, which assigns the commission responsibility to decide all issues presented before it. Island Creek Coal Co. v. Honaker, 9 Va. App. 336, 388 S.E.2d 271, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1218, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (1990). Hearsay statements are admissible in evidence before Commission.  The Compensation Commission is not governed in its decisions by common-law rules of evidence, and hearsay statements are properly admissible in evidence before it . The Commission has the discretion to give probative weight to hearsay statements in arriving at its findings of facts. Williams v. Fuqua, 199 Va. 709, 101 S.E.2d 562, 1958 Va. LEXIS 116 (1958). Hearsay statements may be given probative weight.  Commissions broad statement that it could not rely on history taken from a claimant to determine how an accident occurred was contrary to the common law princ iples enunciated in appellate court decisions but more importantly, was contrary to Workers Compensation Rule 2.2 which gives the Commission the discretion to give probative weight to hearsay statements in arriving at its finding of facts. Pence Niss an Oldsmobile v. Oliver, 20 Va. App. 314, 456 S.E.2d 541, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 417 (1995). Relation of Commission to award.  After an award, and during the whole compensation period applicable to the injury in question, the relation of the Commission to the award is that of a court to a judgment during the term at which it is rendered. American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. v. Hamilton, 145 Va. 391, 135 S.E. 21, 1926 Va. LEXIS 399 (1926); Old Dominion Land Co. v. Messick, 149 Va. 330, 141 S.E. 132, 1928 Va. LEXIS 369 (1928). The Commission is not required to state the evidence on which it bases its findings of f act, but only its findings of fact. In the instant case the findings of fact of the Commission did set out some of the evidence upon which its findings were based, and this is the better practice, but the Commission was under no obligation to give the de tails of the evidence, and it cannot be gotten from any other source. Stonega Coke &amp; Coal Co. v. Sutherland, 136 Va. 489, 118 S.E. 133, 1923 Va. LEXIS 100 (1923) (see Berry v. F.S. Royster Guano Co., 161 Va. 442, 171 S.E. 519 (1933)). Deputy commissioners findings as to credibility not necessarily binding.  A specific, recorded observation of a key witness demeanor or appearance in relation to credibility is an aspect of the hearing that the Commission may not ar bitrarily disregard. However, the deputy commissioners findings as to credibility do not necessarily bind the Commission. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, 5 Va. App. 374, 363 S.E.2d 433, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1457, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (1987). Court rejected an employers contention that the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission erroneously deferred to the deputy commissioners findings, as the record showed that the Commission explicitly rejected any reliance upon the deputy commissioners credibility determination, reviewed the entire record, and made its own determination as to the credibility of the witnesses and the sufficiency of the evidence. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Bowman, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 706 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2003). Commission entitled to defer to deputy commissioners findings.  There was no error in the decision of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission to defer to a deputy commissioners findings and affirm the deputy commi ssioners decision, which found that a claimant failed to prove that he sustained an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, because: (1) the Commission reviewed and summarized the relevant testimony and medical records, and then noted the deputy commissioners findings, including his credibility determinatio...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-705"><akn:num>§ 65.2-705</akn:num><akn:heading>Review of award; rehearing</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. If an appli cation for review is made to the Commission within 30 days after issuance of an award, the full Commission, except as provided in subsection B of § 65.2-704 and if the first hearing was not held before the full Commission, shall review the evidence or , if deemed advisable, as soon as practicable, hear the parties at issue, their representatives, and witnesses. The Commission shall make an award which, together with a statement of the findings of fact, rulings of law, and other matters pertinent to th e questions at issue, shall be filed with the record of the proceedings. B. A rehearing convened under this section shall be a public proceeding and, upon proper request, may, in the discretion of the Commission, be video recorded for public broadcast at the expense of the requesting party, subject only to the same limitations and conditio ns as apply to court proceedings in the Commonwealth. C. Upon an app lication for review made pursuant to subsection A, the opposing party at issue shall have 14 days thereafter to make an independent application for review. D. When a vaca ncy on the Commission exists, or when one or more members of the Commission are absent or are prohibited from sitting with the full Commission to hear a review, the Chairman may appoint one or more deputy commissioners or recall one or more retired membe rs of the Commission to participate in the review. The retired member or members recalled shall be the member or members who occupied the seat for which such member or members are being recalled, unless the parties otherwise consent. If retired members o f the Commission are recalled as provided in this subsection, they shall be compensated as provided in § 17.1-327. History History.

For related discussion, see 21 M.J. Workers Compensation, §§ 51, 71, 76. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-97. Construction with other laws.  Statutory scheme found in subsection C of § 65.2-701, subsection A of § 65.2-702 and subsection A of § 65.2-705, when read together, encourages agreement s by the parties to settle claims while also permitting either party to withdraw from an agreement and allowing the Workers Compensation Commission to decide the merits of the claim; unlike subsection A of § 65.2-705 there is no time constraint on when either party may request a hearing from the Commission under subsection A of § 65.2-702. Irby v. Lifepoint Health &amp; Safety Nat'l Cas. Corp., 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2020). Scope of duty.  The Commission was not required to re-read each document in the historical record of the case. What is required of the Commission is that it not ignore relevant e vidence and base its findings of fact on credible evidence. Dynalectric Co. v. Ellis, 19 Va. App. 541, 452 S.E.2d 372, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 384 (1995). When a workers compensation claimant sought cost-of-living adjustment benefits because she began receiving Social Security retirement benefits, as opposed to Social Security disability benefits, the Workers Compensation Commission had to make adequate factual findings, under subsection A of § 65.2-705, supporting its award, and its failure to do so required that its award be vacated and the matter rema nded for adequate findings. Powhatan Corr. Center v. Mitchell-Riggleman, 40 Va. App. 491, 579 S.E.2d 696, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (2003). Commission has authority to hear case de novo and will not be bound by the findings of t he deputy. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, 5 Va. App. 374, 363 S.E.2d 433, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1457, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (1987). By statute, the workers compensation commission was entitled to hear the case de novo and since competent, credible evidence supported its finding that the cl aimant was disabled from his employment due to an injury at work that did not involve a pre-existing condition, that finding was affirmed on appeal. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Jordan, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 602 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2003). When an award of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission was appealed to the Virginia Court of Appeals, the employers obligation to pay benefits was suspended, under subsection C of § 65.2-706, and the Commissions decision that an appeal from a deputy commissioner to the Commission likewise suspended the employers obligation to pay benefits was not unreasonable, because the deputy commissi oners decision was not final if a timely request for review was filed, as, under § 65.2-705, a request for review empowered the Commission to hear the case de novo, so it left more to be done than to ministerially execute the award. Gallahan v. Fr ee Lance Star Publ'g Co., 41 Va. App. 694, 589 S.E.2d 12, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 607 (2003). Effect of findings of fact at initial hearing.  If review by the full Commission of an award at an initial hearing occurred pursuant to this section, the findings of facts by the initial hearing are not binding . Williams v. Auto Brokers, 6 Va. App. 570, 370 S.E.2d 321, 5 Va. Law Rep. 99, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 74 (1988). Deputies may be designated t o review awards.  This section does not limit the general powers of the Commission to delegate duties to deputies; a deputy commissioner can be designated to sit in place of a comm issioner when the Commission reviews a case by ore tenus hearing of the parties, their representatives and witnesses or when the review is a review of the record without an appearance by the parties, representatives and witnesses. Clinch Valley Med. Ctr. v. Hayes, 34 Va. App. 183, 538 S.E.2d 369, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 835 (2000). Deputy commissioners findings as to credibility not necessarily binding.  A specific, recorded observation of a key witness demeanor or appearance in relation to credibility is an aspect of the hearing that the Commission may not ar bitrarily disregard. However, the deputy commissioners findings as to credibility do not necessarily bind the Commission. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, 5 Va. App. 374, 363 S.E.2d 433, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1457, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (1987). When commissioner not bound by deputy commissioners findings.  Credible evidence supported the Virginia Workers Compensation Commissions decision that the employer failed to establish that employee was no longer disab led due to a work-related injury. Because the deputy commissioners finding was not based on the surgeons demeanor or appearance, the Commission was not bound by that finding and could make its own finding. Corestaff Corp. Servs. Group v. Carter, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 128 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 30, 2004). Commission entitled to defer to deputy commissioners findings.  There was no error in the decision of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission to defer to a deputy commissioners findings and affirm the deputy commi ssioners decision, which found that a claimant failed to prove that he sustained an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, because: (1) the Commission reviewed and summarized the relevant testimony and medical records, and then noted the deputy commissioners findings, including his credibility determinations; (2) the Commission implicitly recognized that those findings were based upon the substance of the witnesses testimony and the medical records considered by the deputy commissioner and the inconsistencies therein; and (3) the Commission was entitled to defer to the deputy commissioners findings when it did not hear the case de novo, under former § 65.1-96 (now § 65.2-704) and former § 65.1-97 (now § 65.2-705). Petraitis v. Prevent Blindness Am., 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 427 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2007).

The award o f the Commission, as provided in § 65.2-704, if not reviewed in due time, or an award of the Commission upon such review, as provided in § 65.2-705, shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact. No appeal shall be taken from the deci sion of one Commissioner until a review of the case has been had before the full Commission, as provided in § 65.2-705, and an award entered by it. Appeals shall lie from such award to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided in the Rules of the Su preme Court. B.

A copy of the notice of appeal shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the Court of Appeals as provided in the Rules of Court. C.

In case of an appeal from the decision of the Commission to the Court of Appeals, or from the decision of the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court, the appeal shall operate as a suspension of the award and no employer shall be required to make payment of the award involved in the appeal until the questions at issue therein shall have been fully determined in accordance with the provi sions of this title.

I.General Consideration. Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-98 or prior law. Validity of section has never been questioned.  The validity of this provision of the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act has never been questioned. Stonega Coke &amp; Coal Co. v. Sutherland, 136 Va. 48 9, 118 S.E. 133, 1923 Va. LEXIS 100 (1923); Town of Falls Church v. County Bd., 166 Va. 192, 184 S.E. 459, 1936 Va. LEXIS 181 (1936). When questions on appeal fully determined.  Where an employee had filed a petition for rehearing with the court of appeals, the earliest date that the court could have issued a mandate, which would have fully determined the issues on appeal and triggered the employers duty to pay benefits, was when it denied the employees petition. Childress v. Appalachian Power Co., 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 16, 2001). II.Conclusiveness of Findings. A.Findings of Commission. Supreme Court is bound by Commissions findings.  Under the provisions of the Virginia Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act, the Supreme Court is bound by the findings of fact of the Compensation Commi ssion. Scott County School Bd. v. Carter, 156 Va. 815, 159 S.E. 115, 1931 Va. LEXIS 234 (1931); Butler v. Nolde Bros., 189 Va. 932, 55 S.E.2d 36, 1949 Va. LEXIS 229 (1949); Stephens v. A.L.

App. 276, 348 S.E.2d 876, 3 Va. Law Rep. 856, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 362 (1986). The Supreme Court does not retry the facts before the Commission nor does it review the weight, preponderance of the evidence, or the credibility of witnesses. If there is evidence or reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence to support the Commissions findings, they will not be disturbed by the court on appeal, even though there is evidence in the record to support contrary findings of fact. C askey v. Dan River Mills, Inc., 225 Va. 405, 302 S.E.2d 507, 1983 Va. LEXIS 237 (1983).

LEXIS 188 (1983). The actual determination of causation is a factual finding that will not be disturbed on appeal if there is credible evidence to support the finding. Util ity Trailer Mfg. v. Prater, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 300 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 1996). An award of the Workers Compensation Commission is conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact. Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, 251 Va. 186, 467 S.E.2d 795, 1996 Va. LEXIS 30 (1996). In an appeal, it was determined that a workers compensation commission properly denied a worker claim for workers compensation benefits based on carpal tu nnel syndrome under subsection C of § 65.2-400 and § 65.2-401, as the worker failed to show that pre-existing blood disorders did not contribute to the development of the carpal tunnel syndrome. Leuthner v. Can. Dry Potomac Corp., 2005 Va. App. LEX IS 331 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 30, 2005). If supported by evid ence.  A finding of fact by the Commission is binding upon the Supreme Court if it is supported by the evidence. American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Summers, 183 Va. 428, 32 S.E.2d 673, 1945 Va. LEXIS 189 (1945); Rust Eng. Co. v. Ramsey, 194 Va. 975, 76 S.E.2d 195, 1953 Va. LEXIS 166 (1953); Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Bowman, 229 Va. 249, 329 S.E.2d 15, 1985 Va. LEXIS 199 (1985). When there is no conflict of evidence, then, if there is any evidence to support the findings of fact of the Commission, such findings are conclusive and binding. Humphries v.

Decisions of the commission as to questions of fact, if supported by credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on the court of appeals. The fact that contrary evidence may be found in the record is of no consequence if credible evidence supports the commissions finding. Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, 13 Va. App. 227, 409 S.E.2d 824, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 86 (1991). The Commissions finding on the issues of willful misconduct by an employee and proximate cause of an accident, these issues being issues of fact, is binding o n appeal if sustained by credible evidence.

Effective October 1, 2010, § 6.2-302 was substituted for § 6.1-330.54 to conform to the recodification of Title 6.1 by Acts 2010, c. 794. CASE NOTES Commission, and not the Court of Appeals, was the proper forum for a claimant to raise issue.  The Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, and not the Court of Appeals of Virginia, was the proper forum for a claimant to raise his request for interest on an award, pursuant to § 65.2-707. Clean Scape, Inc. v. Ramirez-Gutierrez, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 423 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2007). Payment from Uninsured Employer s Fund.  Remand to the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission was necessary to clarify which party was required to pay interest on an award to a benefits claimant; t he order did not specify the party responsible to pay the interest, and the text of the order did not indicate that the procedure in subsection A of § 65.2-1203 was followed. The Uninsured Employers Fund did not simply step into the shoes of the e mployer. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Carter, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2013). Claimant not entitled to interest.  Although a claimant was entitled to unpaid compensation and late payment penalties because the employer and insurer erroneously credited her wages upon her return to work against the temporary total disability award, the claimant was not entitled to interest thereon since the penalties were not paid pursuant to an award. Diaz v. Wilderness Resort Ass'n &amp; Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 56 Va. App. 104, 691 S.E.2d 517, 201 0 Va. App. LEXIS 148 (2010). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION An employers liability for interest is limited to the time the payment of compensation is delayed by the appeals process. There is no provision in the Act for interest on interest which is not promptly paid. Sauder v. The Times Journal Company, 71 O.W.C. 304 (1992). The Act does not provide for the assessment of interest on an award for previously contested medical cost. Martin v. Saunders B. Moon Community, 71 O.W.C. 198 (19 92). The employer and carrier are liable for judgment interest for payments not made pursuant to an award that is on review or subject to the review process, even if t he review was requested by the claimant.

Upon its ow n motion or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in condition, the Commission may review any award of compensation and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awar ded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this title, and shall immediately send to the parties a copy of the award. No application filed by a party alleging a change in condition shall be docketed for hearing by the Commission unless any medica l reports upon which the party is relying are submitted to the Commission. No such review shall affect such award as regards any moneys paid except pursuant to §§ 65.2-712, 65.2-1105, and 65.2-1205. No such review shall be made after 24 months from the last day for which compensation was paid, pursuant to an award under this title, except: (i) 36 months from the last day for which compensation was paid shall be allowed for the filing of claims payable under § 65.2-503 and certain claims under s ubsection B of § 65.2-406 or (ii) 24 months from the day that the claimant undergoes any surgical procedure compensable under § 65.2-603 to repair or replace a prosthesis or orthosis. B. In those ca ses where no compensation has been paid, the Commission may make an award under § 65.2-503 within 36 months from the date of the accident. C. All wages p aid, for a period not exceeding 24 consecutive months, to an employee (i) who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury work due to a compensable injury and (ii) who is provided work within his capacity at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-i njury wage shall be considered compensation paid pursuant to an award for compensation but shall not result in a reduction of the maximum number of weeks of compensation benefits as described in §§ 65.2-500 and 65.2-518.

Change in Condition. III. Limitations Period. IV. Imposition. V. Practice and Procedure. VI. Illustrative Cases. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-97. Applicability.  In a workers compensation case in which the claimant alleged that reflex sympathetic dystrophy in the claimants right arm related to a 1994 work injury ha d spread to her left arm, the statute of limitations that applied was § 65.2-708, which related to a claim based on a change of condition, rather than § 65.2-601, which related to original claims; because the employer did not base its argument on § 65.2-708, any argument regarding the statute of limitations was waived under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:20(e) for failure to discuss the relevant legal principles and under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 5A:18 because no statute of limitations argument was made before the Workers Compensation Commission. Mount Vernon Hosp. v. Devers, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 494 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 4, 2008). Employees claim regarding her spinal injuries was filed as an initial claim rather than as a change in condition, and thus she was not required to prove a cha nge in her condition since the entry of the award order, and the employers reference to review based on a change in condition was misdirected. Advance Auto &amp; Indem. Ins. Co. v. Craft, 63 Va. App. 502, 759 S.E.2d 17, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 250 (2014). Workers compensation claimants functional loss of use under § 65.2-503 was properly measured by the extent of his impairment before undergoing hip repl acement surgery where that interpretation acknowledged the irreplaceable loss of the natural joint, the nonmonetary costs associated with the corrective surgery, and the permanent restrictions on the claimants activities resulting from the work-relat ed injury. This construction did not create a windfall for claimants as §/ 65.2-708 reflected the General Assemblys recognition that an artificial joint replacement was an imperfect treatment for a compensable injury that often required subsequent revision surgeries. Loudoun Cty. v. Richardson, 298 Va. 528, 841 S.E.2d 629, 2020 Va. LEXIS 40 (2020). This section is procedural in nature, it affects remedy only and disturbs no vested or s ubstantive rights of the employer, and it was intended to apply retroactively. Cohen v. Fairfax Hosp. Ass'n, 12 Va. App. 702, 407 S.E.2d 329, 8 Va. Law Rep. 201, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (1991). This section empowers the commission with the discretionary authority to review a change in condition application and alter the initial award. Williams v. VEPCO, 18 Va. App. 569, 445 S.E.2d 693, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1598, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 398 (1994). This section is the only statutory authority for a review of an award of the Compensatio n Commission on the ground of change in condition. If the insurer or employer elect to make such application they must do so under this section. The claimant derives the same right from the same source. It is difficult to perceive why the same rule shoul d not apply alike to both applicants. Bristol Door &amp; Lumber Co. v. Hinkle, 157 Va. 474, 161 S.E. 902, 1932 Va. LEXIS 307 (1932). This section is the only statutory authority for a review on the ground of change of condition. Parker v. Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co., 201 Va. 328, 111 S.E.2d 453, 1959 Va. LEXIS 230 (1959). It a pplies to disputes after award.  Former § 65.1-94 (now § 65.2-702) applies to disputes arising before an award is made, whereas this section applies to disputes arising after the award. Par ker v. Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co., 201 Va. 328, 111 S.E.2d 453, 1959 Va. LEXIS 230 (1959). And provides procedure for review of such disputes.  Procedure for the review of disputes which may arise in connection with the Commissions award must be under this section. Parker v. Manchester Bd. &amp; Paper Co. , 201 Va. 328, 111 S.E.2d 453, 1959 Va. LEXIS 230 (1959). It applies to voluntary agreements approved by Commission.  Although this section refers specifically to awards, it has been interpreted as applying also to voluntary agreements that have been approved by the Commission. D illard v. Industrial Comm'n, 416 U.S. 783, 94 S. Ct. 2028, 40 L. Ed. 2d 540, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 143 (1974). Section 65.2-601 provides that compensation shall be forever barred, unless a claim is filed with the Commission within two years after an accident; during this p eriod an employee must assert against his employer any claim that he might have for an injury growing out of the accident. However here, claimant made an original claim for medical mileage and prescriptions which was satisfied voluntarily by the employer without an award, and then made a formal claim under § 65.2-503 in which a 36-month filing period is allowed pursuant to this section; thus claimant properly received permanent partial disability award. Lynchburg Foundry Co. v. McDaniel, 22 V a. App. 307, 469 S.E.2d 85, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 266 (1996). But provides no substitute for original hearing on new accident.  An application for compensation based on a change in condition cannot be used as a substitute for an original hearing on a new and separate accident. Leon ard v. Arnold, 218 Va. 210, 237 S.E.2d 97, 1977 Va. LEXIS 180 (1977); Board of Supvrs. v. Martin, 3 Va. App. 139, 348 S.E.2d 540, 3 Va. Law Rep. 707, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 346 (1986). Where the facts establish a new and separate compensable injury rather than a compensable change in condition, the time limitations of former § 65.1-87 (now § 65.2-601) are applicable and the claimant may not use a change in condition application to invoke the time limitations of this section. Bartholow Drywall Co., Inc. v. Hill, 12 Va. App. 790, 407 S.E.2d 1, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 152 (19 91). Provides incentive to suspend benefits.  As a consequence of this sections provisions denying an insurer the right to recoup benefits wrongly paid to an employee, the insurer has a clear incentive to suspend benefits whenever it believes it has cause. Fleming v. Workers' Comp. Comm'n, 878 F. Supp. 852, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3097 (E.D. Va. 1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 578, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 10634 (4th Cir. 1996). Subsection C supplements subsection A.  Virginia Workers Compensation Act, subsection C supplements subsection A, and the two subsections operate in conjunction with each other; because subsection C of § 65.2-708 is not a stand-alone provision but instead provides a definition for the tolling mechanism applied to subsection A, where a claimant has received wages (rather than compensation) as provided in subsection C, the subsection A statute of limitations runs anew under each successive award of compensation for a particular compensable injury and is triggered on the las...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-709"><akn:num>§ 65.2-709</akn:num><akn:heading>Cost of living supplements for total incapacity and dependents of deceased</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Cost of liv ing supplements shall be payable under this section if: 1. The c ombined disability benefit entitlement of a claimant or his dependents under this title and the federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program is less than 80 percent of the average monthly earnings of the claimant before disability or deat h; or 2. The claimant or his dependents are receiving disability payments under this title but not benefits under the federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program. Such cost of living supplements shall be payable, in addition to the other benefits payable under this title, in accordance with the provisions of this section to those recipients of awards resulting from occupational disease, accident, or death occurring on or after July 1, 1975, under § 65.2-500, subsection C of § 65.2-503, subdivision A 4 of § 65.2-504, and §§ 65.2-512 and 65.2-513. For purposes of de termining the monthly amount of combined disability entitlement received by a claimant pursuant to subdivision A 1, the claimant may deduct any monthly amounts paid for Medicare. B. The Commiss ion may require the claimant to present evidence of filing for federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits in order to establish eligibility under subdivision A 1 and also may require the claimant to furnish the employer with the decisi on on his claim for such federal benefits. C. The amounts of supplementary payments provided for herein shall be determined by using a compounding method of computation annually. The percentage of change shall be determined by reference to the increase, if any, in the United States Average Consumer Price Index for all items, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor, from its monthly average, from one calendar year to another. D. Amounts of supplementary payments shall be based on the percentage increase, if any, in the Average Consumer Price Index for all items adjusted annually. Any change in the cost of living supplement determined as of any determination date shall become effective as o f October 1 next following such determination date and, as the case may be, shall be added to or subtracted from any cost of living supplements previously payable; however, compensation paid the claimant under this section shall at no time exceed the the n current maximum weekly amount payable under § 65.2-500.

Workers Compensation, §§ 42, 58. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-99.1 or prior law. Purpose.  The manifest purpose of this section is to ensure, as much as possible, that the value of benefits paid under the Act does not diminish due to inflation. Commonwe alth Dep't of Hwys. &amp; Transp. v. Williams, 1 Va. App. 349, 338 S.E.2d 660, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 206 (1986). Purpose of 1981 amendment.  The 1981 amendment to this statute resulted, not from a desire to state an intention ex post facto, but from recognition of this phenomenon: In the 1978-79 period , the cost-of-living, for the first time since this section was enacted, rose at a greater rate than the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Anderson, 222 Va. 62, 278 S.E.2d 817, 1981 Va. LEXIS 275 (1981). Assessment of cost of living adjustments remedial in purpose.  The assessment of cost of living adjustments under former § 65.1-99 is remedial in purpose; it is designed to ensure that the value of the compensation award i s not lessened as a result of inflation. Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Bower, 243 Va. 183, 413 S.E.2d 55, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1891, 1992 Va. LEXIS 151 (1992). Cost-of-living payments are not compensation within meaning of Workers Compensation Act.  Cost-of-living payments paid under this section are not compensation within the meaning of the Workers Compensation Act. Bishopric Prods. Co. v. Brock, No. 14 81-86-1 (Ct. of Appeals June 22, 1987). Claimant was not required to reimburse carrier for the cost-of-living supplements paid between July, 1983 through February, 1984, on grounds that his receipt of s ocial security benefits disqualified him from receiving cost-of-living supplements. To permit such a reimbursement would in effect build into the Workers Compensation Act an offset provision, which to date the General Assembly has refused to enact. W oody's Auto Parts v. Rock, 4 Va. App. 8, 353 S.E.2d 792, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1822, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 160 (1987). Cost-of-living supplements are not compensation within meaning of Rule 13(B) of the Rule s of the Industrial (now Workers Compensation) Commission. Commonwealth v. Commonwealth Dep't of Hwys. &amp; Transp. v. Williams, 1 Va. App. 349, 338 S.E.2d 660, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 206 (1986). Rule 13(B) inapplicable to cost-of-living supplements.  Rule 13(B) of the Rules of the Industrial (now Workers Compensation) Commission does not apply to cost-of-living supplements, because of the distinctions whic h exist between such payments and the compensation paid for actual disability. Commonwealth Dep't of Hwys. &amp; Transp. v. Williams, 1 Va. App. 349, 338 S.E.2d 660, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 206 (1986). Supplements not determined by average weekly wage.  In a given year the availability of cost-of-living supplements is based upon a determination whether there has been an increase in the consumer price index, rathe r than a change in the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth and, further, once the supplement becomes available, eligibility therefor is tied to a formula in which the average wage of the claimant, rather than the average wage of Commonwealth, is the determinative factor; thus although a supplement has been allowed, it later may be reduced if the consumer price index falls, even though the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth may rise, in the determinative period. Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Anderson, 222 Va. 62, 278 S.E.2d 817, 1981 Va. LEXIS 275 (1981). Beneficiaries right to cost of living adjustment not limited to future economic conditions.  The beneficiaries right to receive a cost of living adjustment under former § 65.1-99.1 is dependent upon the formula set forth therein and is not limited simply to future economic conditions; several other factors must be considered in any computation of cost of living adjustments under former § 65.1-99: Those factors include whether the beneficiaries are eligible for the federal benefits referenced in § 65.1-99, the duration or contingencies to which any such entitlement is subject, and the present and projected amounts of any entitlement. Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Bower, 243 Va. 183, 413 S.E.2d 55, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1891, 1992 Va. LEXIS 151 (1992 ). Change of condition applicatio n required.  The statutory cost-of-living provision is not self-executing, and a claim for a cost-of-living supplement is cognizable only under the change-of-condition section s of the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, which require an application and a showing of eligibility by the claimant and an award by the Commission. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. Wright, 222 Va. 68, 278 S.E.2d 820, 1981 Va. LEXIS 276 (1981). When a workers compensation claimant sought cost-of-living adjustment benefits because she began receiving Social Security retirement benefits, as opposed to Social Security disability benefits, the Workers Compensation Commission had to make adequate factual findings, under subsection A of § 65.2-705, supporting its award, and its failure to do so required that its award be vacated and the matter rema nded for adequate findings. Powhatan Corr. Center v. Mitchell-Riggleman, 40 Va. App. 491, 579 S.E.2d 696, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (2003). But letter may be sufficient app lication.  In an action challenging a decision of the Commission which awarded a worker a cost-of-living supplement and attorney fees after he returned to work from a compen sable injury, the plaintiff was not entitled to reversal of the Commissions decision for the workers alleged failure to file an application for a cost-of-living supplement because during oral argument the plaintiff conceded that the worker had se nt a letter to the Commission stating that the plaintiff had failed to pay the cost-of-living increase and inquiring about the status of the matter; thus, the letter to the Commission constituted sufficient application for a cost-of-living supplement.

CASE NOTES Award of credits not reducible to an action at law.  Where claimant, through no fraud or misrepresentation, received sums from employer equal to his pre-injury wages while he also received the carriers disabilit y benefits, an award of credits against future compensation were not reducible to an action at law under §§ 65.2-710 and 65.2-712; the employers payments were made in the hope that the claimant would remain loyal and return to work and thus, th ey were not earnings within the meaning of § 65.2-712. Bay Concrete Constr. Co. v. Davis, 43 Va. App. 528, 600 S.E.2d 144, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 377 (2004). Commission has full authority to enforce its orders and protect itself from deception. W hile the language of this section is permissive and provides that a party may enforce an award in court, it must be read and considered in pari materia with the Commissions power pursuant to former § 65.1-20 (now § 65.2-202) to punish for disob edience of its orders. Hudock v. Industrial Comm'n, 1 Va. App. 474, 340 S.E.2d 168, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 226 (1986) (decided under former Title 65.1). Authority to iss ue certificate of authentication.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in finding that a certificate was not issued pursuant to § 65.2-710 because the certificate of authent ication was issued pursuant to the general authority of the commission under §§ 8.01-390 and 8.01-391, and the commission, which was acting pursuant to its legal authority when it entered the award for benefits to a workers compensation claiman t as the agency responsible for workers compensation awards, had authority to issue a certificate without relying on § 65.2-710; the interpretation of a Virginia Workers Compensation Commission document is not left to the desires of a claimant , and the commission determines the nature of its orders and rulings. Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., 58 Va. App. 244, 708 S.E.2d 429, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (2011). Because every agency of the Commonwealth has authority to authenticate its records, the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission, likewise, has this authority . Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., 58 Va. App. 244, 708 S.E.2d 429, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (2011). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in upholding the deputy commissioners decision to decline to recuse herself because the deputy commis sioner did not demonstrate bias by denying an employees request for § 65.2-710 certification. Urias v. Winkler's, Inc., 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 397 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 13, 2011). Authority to issue certificate for authentication purposes only.  As the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission is an agency of the Commonwealth, subsection A of § 8.01-390 provides authority for the commission to issue a certificate for authentication purposes only, rather than for enforcement purposes under § 65.2-710. Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., 58 Va. App. 244, 708 S.E.2d 429, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (2011). Court exercises ministerial function .  The state courts have construed the enforcement of awards of the Commission as purely ministerial. They do not inquire into whether a claimants condition cont inues to justify compensation. Rather, they simply enforce agreements and awards that have been approved and not formerly rescinded by the Commission. Dillard v. Industrial Comm'n, 416 U.S. 783, 94 S. Ct. 2028, 40 L. Ed. 2d 540, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 143 (1974 ) (decided under former Title 65.1). The order of the court, under former § 65.1-100, in rendering judgment so that execution might be had, was the exercise of a ministerial function. The court wa s vested with no discretion since the section was mandatory. Richmond Cedar Works &amp; Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Harper, 129 Va. 481, 106 S.E. 516, 1921 Va. LEXIS 111 (1921); Parrigen v. Long, 145 Va. 637, 134 S.E. 562, 1926 Va. LEXIS 422 (1926) (decided und er prior law). Interpretation.  Plain meaning of the second sentence of § 65.2-710, the sentence stating, The Commission shall certify such order or award upon satisfactory evidence of no ncompliance with the same, is that the commission can certify an award for enforcement purposes when satisfactory evidence of noncompliance with that award is presented to the commission. Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., 58 Va. App. 244, 708 S.E.2d 4 29, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (2011). Argument not preserved for review.  Where an employee argued that a claim for total disability benefits was erroneously characterized as one for additional compensation, implicating the Va. Workers  Comp. Commn R. 1.2(B)s 90-day deadline, rather than an enforcement action of an earlier award, the appellate court could not consider the employees claim, as the employee did not make argument to the Virginia Workers Compensation Com mission. Morissette v. Custom Tel. Serv., 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 82 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2003). Court of appeals could not consider the arguments of a workers compensation claimant that the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission misinterpreted its rules to allow suspension of an award pending an employers application for termination of benefits and that such suspension violates his due process rights because there was no commission ruling on those issues; the commission explicitly declined to rule on those issues, and thus, it did not err in interpreting its rules and did not violate claimants due process rights in relation to his award of benefits. Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., 58 Va. App. 244, 708 S.E.2d 429, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (2011). Court of appeals could not consider the argument of a workers compensation claimant that he presented satisfactory evidence of noncompliance so that the Virgi nia Workers Compensation Commission should have issued a certificate for enforcement pursuant to § 65.2-710 because there was no commission ruling to review on the issue of noncompliance since claimant did not ask the full commission to review the decision, and thus, the commission did not review the decision; also, claimant did not ask for reconsideration after the commission issued its opinion. Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., 58 Va. App. 244, 708 S.E.2d 429, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (2011). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS No right to subrogation against legal malpractice proceeds.  Employer and its workers compensation insurer were not entitled to a lien against the verdict that an employee obtained in a medical malpractice suit against a doctor because the employer and insurer were compelled to provide workers compensation benefits as a result of the on-the-job accident and not as a result of the doctors medical negligence; the employer was required to provide compensation bene fits to the employee or on his behalf, but the award orders of the Workers Compensation Commission conclusively established that those benefits were for the employees broken leg, not for damages caused by a third party. Thompson v. Alhadeff, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 137 (Roanoke Oct. 11, 2011). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION There is no requirement that the Clerk or Commission make a finding of noncompliance before a certified copy of an award is furnished by the Clerk. Any ch allenge to a judgment on the grounds of payment and satisfaction must be made in the Circuit Court after entry of judgment. Black v. A. F. B.

The failure to disclose or report such address or changes of address without reasonable justification may result in the suspension of compensation payments until the employee complies with thi s duty. When the Commission is properly notified of the change in the employees address, the Commission shall notify the employer when the employer is self-insured, or the employers insurer in all other cases. History History. 1983, c. 416, § 65.1-100.2; 1991, c. 355; 1996, c. 178. Annotations NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Where the claimant is not on an award but a claim has been filed though not adjudicated, there is no statutory duty to report a change in address or to provide a current residential address. Heiston v. Pittmans Tree &amp; Landscaping, Inc., VWC File No. 231-73-43 (May 16, 2007). When claimant failed to notify the Commission of a change of address, benefits were appropriately suspended as of date that Commission became aware of faulty addr ess, and not date that employer knew of faulty address; employer may not unilaterally suspend benefits without filing application with the Commission. Hakimi v. K-Mart Corp., VWC File No. 189-35-70 (June 5, 2003). Rule of the Commission 1.4(B) provides that each change in condition application filed by the employer under § 65.2-708 must be in writing and under oath. Rule 1.4(B) also states that the defendants shall state the grounds for relief as well as the date for which compensation was last paid. However, Rule 1.4(B) applies only to employers applications filed under § 65.2-708, not to those filed under § 65.2-711 for failure to report a change in address. Jones v. Goodwill Industries, 79 O.W.C. 1 (2000). The scope of discovery in a Commission proceeding is determined not only by Commission Rule 1.8 but also by Supreme Court Rule 4:1(b)(1), which in part provides t hat, [p]arties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party. Craft v. Commercial Courier Express, Inc., 78 O.W.C. 270 (1999). Claimants ongoing award for medical benefits constitutes an issue or proceeding pending before the Commission as those terms are used in Commi ssion Rule 1.8 and in Virginia Code § 65.2-703. Also, Virginia Code § 65.2-711 requires a claimant under an open award to inform the employer of his current residential address unless there is reasonable justification for refusing to do so. A resi dential address is not equivalent to a post office box address. Craft v. Commercial Courier Express, Inc., 78 O.W.C. 270 (1999). Failure of the claimant, without reasonable justification, to disclose to the Commission his current address and to report any change of address, may result in th e suspension of compensation benefits. Dowdy v. Nuscope, 63 O.I.C. 109 (1984); Anderson v. Shenandoahs Pride Dairy, 76 O.W.C. 255 (1997). When an employee fails to provide the Commission with a current residential address, compensation benefits are suspended until such information is provided. Since the employee is entitled to a notice of hearing, an employers change in condition application will not be heard until a current address is obtained. King v. Robert B. Heap, Inc., 69 O.I.C. 59 (1990). An employer mailed the payment to an employees last known address and filed an application to suspend benefits pursuant to § 65.1-100.2 (now § 65.2-711) . It is appropriate to accept the application and suspend benefits until such time as the employee provides a current address. At that time the case can be adjudicated on the merits with proper notice to the parties. Penner v. ESG Enterprises, Inc., 70 O .I.C. 72 (1991). The Commission has held that an employers application alleging the claimants failure to report a change of address under Code § 65.2-711 may be made wi thout payment of benefits to the date of application as required by Rule 1.4(C), since the essence of the defendants application is to complain that they are unable to locate the claimant in order to pay benefits. Jones v. Goodwill Industries, 79 O.W .C. 1 (2000). While an employer who files a change of condition application under § 65.2-708 must pay compensation within two years prior to the date of the filing, an alleg ation of failure to provide a current address pursuant to § 65.2-711 allows for the suspension of benefits until an address is provided and proper notice of adjudication of the claim on the merits can be given. Ross v. Pony Express, 71 O.W.C. 99 (1992 ). Rule 1.4(A) requires that a copy of the defendants application and supporting documentation must be sent to the employee, and a copy to the employees atto rney if the employee is represented. Logically, since the defendants do not know the employees address, they cannot possibly provide him with a copy of the application. However, because the employee was represented by an attorney at the time of the l ast hearing on this matter, and the defendants were certainly aware of that representation, the Commission held that the due process rights of the claimant had been violated, and the Commission rejected the Employers Application on that ground. Jones v. Goodwill Industries, 79 O.W.C. 1 (2000). Cure of a claimants failure to report a change in address is not self-executing, and is subject to the time limitations provisions of Code § 65.2-708. Atti a v. W9Y Construction Co., Inc., 76 O.W.C. 332 (1997). Va. Code Ann. § 65.2-712 requires a dependent to notify the Commission of her status as a student, but neither Code § 65.2-712 nor Code § 65.2-711, whic h requires the reporting of an address change by an employee, specifically requires that a dependent notify either the Commission or the employer of an address change. However, the dependent is required to provide a current residential address so that th e defendants can make the required payment. Higgins v. Inspection Enterprises, Inc., 77 O.W.C. 273 (1998). The employees open award of compensation benefits was suspended for failure to report a change in residential address. The Commission noted that Code § 65. 2-711 obligates the employee to disclose his current residential address and to advise of any changes in address as they occur. The Commission held that, to the extent that the employees failure to participate in the proceedings before Commission res ulted from failure to report his change of address to the Commission, the insurer and his attorney, the consequences of such neglect must, of necessity, fall upon him.

The Commission shall provide for notification to the statutory dependent of his obligation under this section. History History. 1985, c. 453, § 65.1-100.3; 1991, c. 355; 1992, c. 466; 1996, c. 570.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-100.3. This section is substantive in nature and should not be retroactively applied to acciden ts which occurred prior to its effective date. Brushy Ridge Coal Co. v. Blevins, 6 Va. App. 73, 367 S.E.2d 204, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2325, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1988). This section imposes a singular duty upon the employee: He shall have an obligation to i mmediately disclose to the employer and the insurer any return to employment or increase in his earnings. Brushy Ridge Coal Co. v. Blevins, 6 Va. App. 73, 367 S.E.2d 204, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2325, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1988). Former § 65.1-100.3 (now § 65.2-712) places the burden upon the employee to immediately inform the employer and insurer of any return to work or increase ea rnings. Once former § 65.1-100.3 (now § 65.2-712) was enacted, the burden to monitor the employees activity no longer fell upon the employer and insurer. Clark v. Otis Elevator Co., 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 416 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 1993). This section provides in part that so long as an employee receives payment of compensation such employee shall have a duty immediately to disclose to the empl oyer any incarceration, return to employment or increase in his earnings. Here claimant failed to give proper notice regarding her increase in net earnings over her pre-injury weekly wages, and thus claimants benefits award was suspended. Thomas v. Nordstrom Pentagon City/Nordstrom, Inc., 22 Va. App. 626, 472 S.E.2d 288, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 464 (1996). Although the purpose of this section is to place an affirmative duty on employees to dis close their employment status to an employer or insurer paying compensation, this duty exists only so long as an employee receives payment of compensation under this title. Pressure Concrete Constr. Co. v. Coburn, 21 Va. App. 629, 466 S.E.2d 761, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 99 (1996). This statute cannot be read to place on employees the duty to notify an employer of a re turn to employment subsequent to the period for which the employee seeks benefits. The employer simply has no stake in the employees changed circumstances after that point. Pressure Concrete Constr. Co. v. Coburn, 21 Va. App. 629, 466 S.E.2d 761, 199 6 Va. App. LEXIS 99 (1996). Section creates new substantive right in employer.  Since the effective date of this section, the Commission has held that, by reading former § 65.1-99 (now § 65.2-708) and this section together, it is clear that this section creates a new substantive right in the employer which could not be asserted before in the Commission. Brushy Ridge Coal Co. v. Blevins, 6 Va. App. 73, 367 S.E.2d 204, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2325, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1988). This statute creates a substantive right and cannot operate retroactively unless it by express language or necessary implication indicates that the legislature in tended a retroactive application. Brushy Ridge Coal Co. v. Blevins, 6 Va. App. 73, 367 S.E.2d 204, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2325, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1988). The statute grants a substantive right to the employer or insurer which did not exist previously. Any payment to such employee which is later determined by the co mmission to have been procured by the employee by fraud, misrepresentation or failure to report any return to employment or increase in earnings may be recovered from the employee by the employer or insurer by way of credit taken against future compensat ion payments due the claimant, or by action at law against the claimant. Brushy Ridge Coal Co. v. Blevins, 6 Va. App. 73, 367 S.E.2d 204, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2325, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (1988). Employer entitled to cre dit for benefits paid.  Employer was entitled only to a credit based on the excess amount that an injured employee received due to the employees increased earnings at a dissimilar jo b because the employee was not required to report the employees employment at a dissimilar job as it was not a change of circumstance to what existed when the award of temporary total benefits was entered. The employee worked as a bakery manager for the employer, which was a wholesale club, and concurrently as a custodian at a school. BJ's Wholesale Club, Inc. v. McCarron, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 97 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 4, 2017). Employer not entit led to credit for benefits paid.  Express provisions of §§ 65.2-708 and 65.2-712 governing the termination of an award based on a change in condition controlled the issue of whether the empl oyer was entitled to a credit for workers compensation benefits it paid to the claimant for nearly nine months following his return to work after he had sustained a compensable injury and since those provisions did not dictate that the employer was e ntitled to a credit for the payments it made to the claimant despite its knowledge that he had returned to full-duty work, the workers compensation commission erred in finding that under § 65.2-520, the employer was entitled to a credit for having made such payments, as that statutory interpretation thwarted the legislatures intention, as set forth in the other two statutes, that an award of benefits only be altered prospectively. McFadden v. Carpet House, 42 Va. App. 302, 591 S.E.2d 708, 200 4 Va. App. LEXIS 28 (2004). Commission determination that an employer was not entitled to a credit under § 65.2-712 for benefits paid to or on behalf of a worker was proper because the co mmission resolved any inconsistency in the testimony by crediting the charity motive as the driving force behind the benefits conferred on the worker, and was not persuaded that the allowances made to the worker were truly a substitute for wages. Fairfax Hosp. v. McKaveney, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 365 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2007). Award of credits not reducible to an action at law.  Where defendant claimant, through no fraud or misrepresentation, received sums from plaintiff employer equal to his pre-injury wages while he also received the ca rriers disability benefits, an award of credits against future compensation were not reducible to an action at law under §§ 65.2-710 and 65.2-712; the employers payments were made in the hope that the claimant would remain loyal and return to work and thus, they were not earnings within the meaning of § 65.2-712. Bay Concrete Constr. Co. v. Davis, 43 Va. App. 528, 600 S.E.2d 144, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 377 (2004). An award under this section is limited to the amount the employee receives in excess of that which he or she should have received had he or she reported the return to employment or the increase in earnings. City of Fairfax v. Massey, 11 Va. App. 238, 397 S.E.2d 679, 7 Va. Law Rep. 669, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 188 (1990). Relief limited to wh at requested on application.  An employer is limited to the relief stated in its application for change in condition; thus, where employers application for change of condition did not cont ain a request for modification of the outstanding award, the court would not infer a request for modification based on the forms printed language. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v. Pender, 14 Va. App. 100, 415 S.E.2d 239, 8 Va. Law Re p. 2344, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 75 (1992). St udent status provision applied to statutory dependents.  Workers compensation claimant was not required by § 65.2-712 to disclose her status as a full-time student to the Virginia Workers Compensation Commiss ion as § 65.2-712 applied to statutory dependents. Starbucks Coffee Co. v. Shy, 61 Va. App. 229, 734 S.E.2d 683, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 396 (2012). No restituti on authority in commission as to carrier.  Even if relief pursuant to this section were available on the ground the employee failed to give the requisite notice, the plain language of the statute limits th e available remedies to a credit against future compensation or for an action at law. The section does not give the commission authority to order restitution as requested by the carrier. Pressure Concrete Constr. Co. v. Coburn, 21 Va. App. 629, 466 S.E.2 d 761, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 99 (1996). Commission held that disability benefits were not earnings a nd employers claim that they were income was not considered.  Employers claim that a workers compensation claimant failed to report as income monies she received as disability benefits was not considered and the appellate court did not decide whether the employer was entitled to a credit pursuant to § 65.2-712 since the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not rule on whether the claimant failed to report income, but ruled that wh...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-713"><akn:num>§ 65.2-713</akn:num><akn:heading>Costs</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. If the Comm ission or any court before whom any proceedings are brought or defended by the employer or insurer under this title shall determine that such proceedings have been brought, prosecuted, or defended without reasonable grounds, it may assess against the emp loyer or insurer who has so brought, prosecuted, or defended them the whole cost of the proceedings, including a reasonable attorneys fee, to be fixed by the Commission. B. Where the C ommission finds that an employer or insurer has delayed payment without reasonable grounds, it may assess against the employer or insurer the whole cost of the proceedings, including a reasonable attorneys fee to be fixed by the Commission. In such a case where an attorneys fee is awarded against the employer or insurer, the Commission shall calculate and add to any award made to the claimant interest at the judgment rate, as set forth in § 6.2-302, on the benefits accrued from the date the C ommission determined the award should have been paid through the date of the award. C. Where the C ommission finds that an employer or insurer has filed an application for a hearing in bad faith, it shall assess against the employer or an insurer an amount up to ten percent of the total amount of the benefits accrued from the date the Commission deter mined the award should have been paid through the date of the award. This payment shall be in addition to any costs, fees, or awards as set forth in subsection B. History History.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-101 or prior law. Authority to award costs.  Subsection A of § 65.2-713 grants the appellate court the authority to assess against the employer the whole cost of the appellate proceedings, including a rea sonable attorneys fee, if it finds that the proceedings were brought, prosecuted, or defended without reasonable grounds; the actual calculation of such costs, if awarded, should be fixed by the workers compensation commission. Dinwiddie Custodia l v. Ferrell, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2003). Assessment of costs and attorneys fee is not required in every defense of a proceedi ng without reasonable grounds. Press v. Ale, 1 Va. App. 153, 336 S.E.2d 522, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 77 (1985); Volvo White Truck Corp. v. Hedge, 1 Va. App. 195, 336 S.E.2d 903, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (1985). Assessment of attorneys fe es held proper.  Although there may have been some initial confusion as to whether claimant was an employee of the employer in the instant case, that confusion did not exist after January 19, 1993. After the letter was sent establishing the employee-employer relationship on that day, the insurer had no reasonable grounds to defend against claimants claim on the basis that he was not an employee. Yet, the insurer continued to do so, delaying payment to claimant and forcing all parties to go through the expense of a lengthy hearing on January 28, 1994. Therefore, the commission did not abuse its discretion in assessing attorneys fees against the insurer. Joe's Home Imp. Co . v. Allen, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 139 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 1995). Trial court properly awarded attorneys fees to an employee pursuant to § 65.2-713 in relation to a workers compensation claim, where employer had denie d payment of the medical bills at issue, contending that the surgeries and treatment were not pre-authorized, while the Workers Compensation Act did not require the employee to obtain pre-authorization from the employer prior to undergoing treatment. Williams Equip. Corp. v. Register, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 235 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 16, 2002). Claimant was entitled to partial attorneys fees for the appeal under subsection A of § 65.2-713, as the employer contested the claimants post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosis, which had also been found by the employers psychiatrist. Dinwiddie Custodial v. Ferrell, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2003). When an employer unsuccessfully argued a claimants request for payment for treatment of traumatic brain injury was time-barred, it was not error to order the employer to pay the claimants attorneys fees incurred in an appeal of the decision of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission because the employer did not defend against the claim on reasonable grounds, since the employer presented no au thority supporting the employers defense. Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Mease, 62 Va. App. 190, 745 S.E.2d 155, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 206 (2013). When an employer unsuccessfully argued a claimants request for payment for treatment of traumatic brain injury was time-barred, it was not error to order the employer to pay the claimants attorneys fees because, after paying for treatment for the claimants traumatic brain injury, the employer unilaterally reduced the number of physical therapy sessions without supporting medical evidence, while th e claimants medical evidence recommended resumption of the prior number of sessions. Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Mease, 62 Va. App. 190, 745 S.E.2d 155, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 206 (2013). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not abuse its discretion in assessing fees and costs against an employer because the employer had ample time to i nvestigate the legitimacy of an employees claim, but the employers challenge came more than two full years after the employee filed a claim for benefits. Furthermore, employers primary evidence was a deposition and an affidavit of the claiman ts ex-wifes statements that were inherently in conflict and made by someone with an established agenda. Southern Tank Transp., Inc. v. Hoke, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 99 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2015). Discretion of Commission.  Assessment is left to the sound discretion of the Commission. Press v. Ale, 1 Va. App. 153, 336 S.E.2d 522, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 77 (1985); Volvo White Truck Corp. v. Hedge, 1 Va. App. 195, 336 S.E.2d 903, 1985 Va. App. LEXIS 84 (1985). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission is not required to assess costs and fees in every case where an employer delayed payment or defended a proceeding, an d whether to assess fees or costs rests in the sound discretion of the Commission and is reversed only for an abuse of that discretion; credible evidence supported the Commissions findings and order that the employer pay $3,000 of the claimants a ttorneys fees for unreasonably defending and delaying payment. Winchester Golf Club, Inc. v. Schenck, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 343 (Va. Ct. App. June 17, 2003). Appellate court awarded a claimant attorney fees and costs of the appeal with regard to his employer ceasing all medical and attendant care payments to him withou t notice as the court affirmed the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission award that concluded that the employer unreasonably defended its failure to pay outstanding medical benefits under an existing award after having the benefit of reviewing the entirety of the record on appeal, including the finding that the continuing defense by the employer on appeal of what clearly was an unreasonable delay in payment of medical benefits under an existing award. Va. Polytechnic Inst. v. Posada, 47 Va. App. 150, 622 S.E.2d 762, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 508 (2005). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission acted within its discretion in denying a claimant attorney fees or, at minimum, reimbursement for the cost of deposin g his treating physician because the Commissions decision was in keeping with its own prior decisions and reflected a reasonable interpretation of its own rules; the physician cooperated in every possible way and provided adequate information via wri tten answers to the questionnaires he was given, as well as extensive opinions. Wells v. Auto. Serv. Garage, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 20, 2018). Defense of claim held not unreasonab le.  Commission, as fact finder, was entitled to accept employers explanation for its delay in paying claimants medical bills, and thus there was no error in c ommissions refusal to assess attorneys fees and costs against employer for such delay. Anselmo v. Cherrydale Motors, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 260 (Va. Ct. App. May 4, 1999). Although the Workers Compensation Commission properly found that a claimant cured an earlier refusal of selective employment under subsection A of § 65.2-5 10, because a reasonable and honest difference of opinion existed as to what legally sufficed as a cure, the claimant was not entitled to attorneys fees and costs under subsection A of § 65.2-713 associated with the appeal. LPT, Inc./MSS, Inc. v. Voltaggio, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 165 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2007). Because the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in finding that an employers defense was reasonable, an employee was not entitled to atto rneys fees and costs; the employee failed to present any principles of law or authorities supporting his assignment of error. Grizzard v. Sonny's Auto. Racing, Inc., 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 60 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 13, 2018). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in declining to award a health care provider attorney fees because the Commission found that, in assertin g a lache...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-714"><akn:num>§ 65.2-714</akn:num><akn:heading>Fees of attorneys and physicians and hospital charges</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Fees of att orneys and physicians and charges of hospitals for services, whether employed by employer, employee, or insurance carrier under this title, shall be subject to the approval and award of the Commission. The Commission shall have exclusive jurisdiction ove r all disputes concerning such fees or charges and may order the repayment of the amount of any fee which has already been paid that it determines to be excessive; appeals from any Commission determinations thereon shall be taken as provided in § 65.2 -706. The Commission shall also retain jurisdiction for employees to pursue payment of charges for medical services notwithstanding that bills or parts of bills for health care services may have been paid by a source other than an employer, workers c ompensation carrier, guaranty fund, or uninsured employers fund. No physician shall be entitled to collect fees from an employer or insurance carrier until he has made the reports required by the Commission in connection with the case. B. If a contes ted claim is held to be compensable under this title and, after a hearing on the claim on its merits or after abandonment of a defense by the employer or insurance carrier, benefits for medical services are awarded and inure to the benefit of a third-par ty insurance carrier or health care provider, the Commission shall award to the employees attorney a reasonable fee and other reasonable pro rata costs as are appropriate. However, the Commission shall not award attorney fees under this subsection un less and until the employees attorney has complied with Rule 6.2 of the Rules of the Commission. The fee shall be paid from the sum that benefits the third-party insurance carrier or health care provider. In determining whether the employees atto rneys work with regard to the contested claim resulted in an award of benefits that inure to the benefit of a third-party insurance carrier or health care provider, and in determining the reasonableness of the amount of any fee awarded to an attorney under this subsection, the Commission shall consider only the amount paid by the employer or insurance carrier to the third-party insurance carrier or health care provider for medical, surgical, and hospital service rendered to the employee through (i) the date on which the contested claim is heard before the Deputy Commissioner, is settled, or is resolved by order of the Commission or (ii) the date the employer or insurance carrier provides written notice of its abandonment of its defense to the conte sted claim and shall not consider additional amounts previously paid to a health care provider or reimbursed to a third-party insurance carrier. For the purpose of this subsection, a contested claim is an initial contested claim for benefits and claims for medical, surgical, and hospital services that are subsequently contested and litigated or after abandonment of a defense by the employer or insurance carrier. C. Payment of any obligation pursuant to this section to any third-party insurance carrier or health care provider shall discharge the obligation in full. The Commission shall not reduce the amount of medical bills owed to the Commonwealth or its agencies without the written consent of the Office of the Attorney General. D. No physicia n, hospital, or other health care provider as defined in § 8.01-581.1 shall balance bill an employee in connection with any medical treatment, services, appliances, or supplies furnished to the employee in connection with an injury for which (i) a cla im has been filed with the Commission pursuant to § 65.2-601, (ii) payment has been made to the health care provider pursuant to § 65.2-605.1, or (iii) an award of compensation is made pursuant to § 65.2-704. For the purpose of this subsection, a health care provider balance bills whenever (a) an employer or the employers insurance carrier declines to pay all of the health care providers charge or fee and (b) the health care provider seeks payment of the balance from the employe e. Nothing in this section shall prohibit a health care provider from using the practices permitted in § 65.2-601.1. History History.

Workers Compensation, § 40. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-102 or prior law. Constitutionality.  The statute is not vague. Indeed, it could not be clearer. Thus, the statute does not violate plaintiffs rights under the Due Process Clause of the United Sta tes Constitution. Hudock v. Virginia State Bar, 233 Va. 390, 355 S.E.2d 601, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2511, 1987 Va. LEXIS 205 (1987). Former § 65.1-88 (now § 65.2-603) and this section did not impair hospitals contract with employee in violation of federal and state Constitutions since they were not intended to impair existing contract of hospital. Fairfax Hosp. Ass'n v. Sines, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 183 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 1995). Hospital was not deprived of property without due process of law under this section since hospital received notice, made appearance at hearing on attorneys fe es, and made claim that attorneys fees statute was unconstitutional; fact that attorneys fees were automatically granted was not denial of due process, but merely reflected legislative balancing of rights of claimants, insurers, health care provi ders, and attorneys. Fairfax Hosp. Ass'n v. Sines, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 183 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 1995). This section, which allows the Commission to award attorney fees by administrative process, did not violate Virginia Constitutions guarantee of trial by jury, since health care providers may preserve their right to jury trial by not accepting payment from workers compensation insurance carrier; however, once provider accepts payment from carrier, it waives its right to pursue civil action, and thus, jury trial. Fairfax Hosp. Ass'n v. Sines, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 183 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 1995). Applicability of section.  Workers Compensation Commission erred in denying the claimants request for a penalty award against the employer and its insurer for their late payment of attorney fees; where the Workers Compensation Commission ordered the attorney fees to be paid out of the claimants accrued compensation, the fees remained compensation within the meaning of the penalty statute, § 65.2-524, and that was true even where the workers compensation commission ordered the employer to pay a particular portion of the penalty to the claimants attorney as a reasonable fee pursuant to this section. Roman v. Ondeo Degremont, Inc., 47 Va. App. 773, 627 S.E. 2d 539, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 108 (2006). Exclusive jurisdiction with Comm ission.  The Workers Compensation Commission has exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes concerning the payment of fees and charges of physicians and hospitals. Combu stion Eng'g, Inc. v. Lafon, 22 Va. App. 235, 468 S.E.2d 698, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 249 (1996). Deputy commissioners order directing the employer and/or the guaranty fund to pay the employees treating physician was within the deputy commissioners subject matter jurisdiction since the employees claim involved treatment for a work accident. Furthermore, the Workers Compensation Commission could not rule on the merits of that order because the guaranty fund did not timely appeal the order o nce it was entered. Miller v. Potomac Hosp. Found., 50 Va. App. 674, 653 S.E.2d 592, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 437 (2007). Consent to Jurisdiction of Virginia Workers Compensation Commission.  Deputy commissioner had jurisdiction to assess an award of attorneys fees against an out-of-state hospital that provided medical care to a claimant because th e hospital, by accepting payment of the claimants medical bills from the insurer, consented to the jurisdiction of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission and the Virginia Workers Compensation law. Town Country Hosp., LP v. Davis, 64 Va . App. 658, 770 S.E.2d 790, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 138 (2015). Jurisdiction of Commission.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in exercising jurisdiction over a health care providers application because the Commission had before it a dispute among a medical care provider, an employee, and an employer concerning whether the employer was responsible,...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-715"><akn:num>§ 65.2-715</akn:num><akn:heading>Providing written information</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Whenever, in the course of proceedings in connection with awards, the Workers Compensation Commission issues any written notice, opinion, order or award regarding a specific case, the Commission shall provide copies to the employee, the employer and the compensation carrier, and, if represented, their counsel, at the same time.

Every emplo yer subject to the compensation provisions of this title shall insure the payment of compensation to his employees in the manner hereinafter provided. While such insurance remains in force he or those conducting his business shall only be liable to an e mployee for personal injury or death by accident to the extent and in the manner herein specified. B. To ensure t hat all employers who are required to have workers compensation insurance under this title have notice of such requirement, the appropriate official of a county, city, or town who licenses employers to conduct business under Chapter 37 (§ 58.1-370 0 et seq.) of Title 58.1 or the State Corporation Commission who charters employers to conduct business under § 12.1-12 shall provide employers requesting such licenses or charters on and after January 1, 1989, with information concerning statutory re quirements for such insurance coverage.

Insurance is mandatory.  It is mandatory upon every employer subject to the compensation provisions of the Act to insure the payment of compensation to his employees. McCann v. Newport Ne ws Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 177 F. Supp. 909, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2739 (D. Va. 1959). Exclusive remedy.  Where the accident sustained by plaintiff arose out of and in the course of his employment, and it allegedly was caused by the negligence of a fellow employee who at the time was acting within the course of his employment, plaintiffs rights and remedies were exclusively those provided under the Virginia Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act.

An employer is immune from suit at common law by employees engaged in work which is part of his trade, business or occupation, in accordance with this section and former § 65.1-40 (now § 65.2-307). Turnage v. Northern Va. Steel Corp., 336 F.2d 837, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4303 (4th Cir. 1964). The effect of former § 65.1-30 (now § 65.2-302) is to render the general contractor a statutory employer of all employees engaged in the work. If the genera l contractor is deemed a statutory employer, he is treated as an employer within the meaning of former § 65.1-40 (now § 65.2-307) and this section, and is therefore immune from a common-law action brought by an injured workman. Slusher v. Paramount Warrior, Inc., 336 F. Supp. 1381, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10776 (W.D. Va. 1971). The dual capacity doctrine, under which an employee eligible to receive worker s compensation benefits is also allowed to sue an employer in tort when the injury is caused by a defective product designed or manufactured by the employer, is inconsistent with the Workers Compensation Act. Kast v. PPG Indus., Inc., 664 F. Supp . 237, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6438 (W.D. Va. 1987). The treatment of compensatory injuries is not a part of the employers business. Henc e, the attending physician or surgeon does not fall within the category of those conducting his [the employers] business. Fauver v. Bell, 192 Va. 518, 65 S.E.2d 575, 1951 Va. LEXIS 199 (1951). Negligence action against one who is a stranger to employers normal work.  The language in former § 65.1-41 (now § 65.2-309) and this section has been uniformly interpreted to allow a common-law negligence action for injuries again st an other party, that, although performing work or providing services for the employer, is a stranger to the employers normal work. Farish v. Courion Indus., Inc., 722 F.2d 74, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 14855 (4th Cir. 1983). Merely being in a parking lot utilized by employees is not enough to impose coverage of the Virginia Workers Compensation Act. Painter v. Simmons, 238 Va. 196, 380 S.E.2d 663, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2915, 1989 Va. LEXIS 96 (1989). Where the accident occurred at a place and time where employer expected both employees to be for employment purposes, a route of egress and ingress to and between the employers facilities and the employee who injured the other employee in an auto accident, clearly was using the lane for no purpose other than to commence his work for t he day as anticipated by his employer, therefore the acts which gave rise to employees injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. Painter v. Simmons, 238 Va. 196, 380 S.E.2d 663, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2915, 1989 Va. LEXIS 96 (1 989). Statutory employer found.  Lawn care provider was not a statutory employer under subsection A of § 65.2-302 because a business owner who had subcontracted all of his lawn care business t o the provider and used the providers employees retained control of daily operations and oversaw the work to be done at the time of claimants accident. The business owner was claimants statutory employer and had to comply with its obligation to provide coverage under the Workers Compensation Act. Turf Care, Inc. v. Henson, 51 Va. App. 318, 657 S.E.2d 787, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 104 (2008). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not err in finding that the contractor had to maintain insurance per Va. Code Ann. § 65.2-800 where it failed to show that it did not have three qualifying employees. Mod. Renovations, LLC v. Espino, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 536 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 25, 2022). Employee found.  Where defendant was hired by employer to locate an ironer, supervise its disassembly, and monitor its installation at company, and where part of companys trad e or business in running its commercial laundry facility was purchasing, installing, operating and maintaining laundry equipment, the court concluded that defendant was a statutory employee and not an other party under the act. Buettner v. Super Laundry Mach., 857 F. Supp. 471, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14469 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd sub nom. Buettner v. R. W. Martin &amp; Sons, 47 F.3d 116, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 2801 (4th Cir. 1995). But see Reibold v. Simon Aerials, Inc., 859 F. Supp. 193, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10615 (E.D. Va. 1994). Civil penalty properly assessed.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly assessed a civil penalty on a cab company as: (1) the cab company employed four to six employees, and did no t have workers compensation insurance due to a dispute with its insurer, (2) § 65.2-800 required every employer subject to the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, § 65.2-100 et seq., to have workers compensation insurance, (3) subsection A of § 65.2-804 instructed employers to provide proof of that insurance to the Commission annually, or as often as might be necessary, (4) § 65.2-805 stated that employers who failed to comply with §§ 65.2-800 or 65.2-804 were to be assessed a civil penalty, and (5) neither the case law nor the Act included an exception to the insurance requirement based upon a dispute with an insurer. N. End Cab Co. v. Va. Workers' Comp. Comm'n, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 20, 2007). Virginia Workers Compensation Commission did not abuse its discretion in imposing a $25,000 fine against an employer for the employers failure to maintain workers compensation insurance coverage, as statutorily required, because the fine imposed by the Commission was below the statutory maximum and the deputy commissioner did not find credible the employers testimony that the employer did not beli eve that the employer was required to have coverage. Am. Transp. v. Mailloux, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 267 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 9, 2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Negligence action against one who is a stranger to employers normal work.  Businesss plea in bar asserting that an injured contractor was its statutory employee at the time of his injury, and thus, he was limited to a claim for worke rs compensation benefits in his personal injury action, was overruled because the work being performed by his direct employer, installing and repairing fire detection and sprinkler systems, was not part of the normal trade, business, or occupation of the business, which primarily involved meat processing; moreover, any plumbing work on the waterlines performed by the businesss 50 to 60 person maintenance team was a de minimis part of the businesss 500-contractor work force. Fose v. Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd., 67 Va. Cir. 347, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 47 (Portsmouth May 12, 2005).

Every emplo yer subject to this title shall secure his liability thereunder by one of the following methods: 1. Insur ing and keeping insured his liability in an insurer authorized to transact the business of workers compensation insurance in this Commonwealth; 2. Receiving a certificate pursuant to § 65.2-808 from the Workers Compensation Commission authorizing such employer to be an individual self-insurer; 3. Being a member in good standing of a group self-insurance association licensed by the State Corporation Commission; 4. Being a member in good standing of a local government group self-insurance pool licensed by the State Corporation Commission pursuant to § 15.2-2706 to offer workers compensatio n coverage; or 5. Entering into an agreement with a professional employer organization for professional employer services which includes voluntary market workers compensation insurance for coemploye es of the professional employer organization and the client company procured from an insurer authorized to transact the business of workers compensation insurance in this Commonwealth. A professional employer organization may obtain voluntary market workers compensation insurance in its own name for all coemployees which it shares or which are assigned or allocated to it pursuant to the agreement between the professional employer organization and the client company. The client company shall main tain separate voluntary market workers compensation insurance insuring any and all employees of the client company not insured through the policy obtained by the professional employer organization. B. An employer who satisfies the requirements of this section shall be certified by the Workers Compensation Commission as an individual self-insurer and permitted to pay direct the compensation in the amount and manner and when due as provided for in this title. The Commission shall not certify an employer as a self-insurer unless it receives in such form as it requires satisfactory proof of the solvency of such employer, the financial ability of the employer to meet his obligations and the ability of the employ er to pay or cause to be paid the compensation in the amount and manner and when due as provided for in this title. The Commission shall establish reasonable requirements and standards for approval of an employer as a self-insurer including, without limi tation, the quality and amount of security deposits, bonds or indemnity, the amount of advance payments and reserves required, the investment of such funds, and the form and content of financial information to be submitted by the employer and the frequen cy of such submissions. For the purposes of any debt/equity ratio (total liabilities to net worth) minimum standard, a ratio of less than 2.2:1 shall be deemed satisfactory. The Commission shall, after notice and hearing, embody such requirements and sta ndards and such other requirements as may be reasonably necessary for the purposes of this section in regulations. The Bureau of Insurance of the State Corporation Commission shall, at the request of the Commission, assist the Commission in establishing the reasonable requirements and standards for approval and certification of an employer as a self-insurer. The Workers Compensation Commission may in its discretion require the deposit of a financial instrument of a specified amount from an entity ap proved by the Workers Compensation Commission to secure the payment of compensation liabilities as they are incurred. The form of the instrument to be deposited shall be selected by the employer from the following list of acceptable financial instrum ents and may include any combination thereof so long as the amount specified by the Workers Compensation Commission is deposited and the actual value thereof maintained: corporate surety bonds, certificates of deposit, United States government obliga tions, letters of credit, and cash. C. The State T reasurer shall be the custodian of securities deposited by the employer under the requirements of this section, or under § 65.2-802, and for such services he shall receive a compensation of one-tenth of one percent per year of the amount of securities deposited with him, payable by or on behalf of such employers.

CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  Nothing in § 65.2-404 is intended to release employers from the duty of keeping themselves insured as required by this section or to exempt the Uninsured Emplo yers Fund when the employer has breached its statutory obligation. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Mounts, 24 Va. App. 550, 484 S.E.2d 140, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 242 (1997), aff'd, 255 Va. 254, 497 S.E.2d 464, 1998 Va. LEXIS 42 (1998). ERISA exemption.  Even if the challenged provisions of Virginias Workers Compensation statutes are interpreted to relate to an Employee Retirement Income Security A ct (ERISA)-covered plan, they are exempt from preemption under § 4(b)(3) of ERISA. Employers Resource Mgt. Co. v. James, 853 F. Supp. 920, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7312 (E.D. Va. 1994), aff'd, 62 F.3d 627, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 22126 (4th Cir. 1995). Where subcontractor was uninsured in Virginia for purposes of the Virginia Workers C ompensation Act, the statutory employer, the general contractor, was liable for claimants benefits. Falls Church Constr. Corp. v. Valle, 21 Va. App. 351, 464 S.E.2d 517, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 898 (1995). Liability of coal company fo r future claims.  Given the statutory mandate to insure and keep insured its liability, coal company, whose employees are susceptible to pneumoconiosis, was required to anticipate that such claims accrue in the future and therefore to secure its liability for such potential claims even when its insurer had been declared insolvent. Since coal company failed to keep itself insured, Uninsured Employers Fund was liable for occupat ional disease benefits of worker whose pneumoconiosis was diagnosed after employers insurance lapsed. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Mounts, 255 Va. 254, 497 S.E.2d 464, 1998 Va. LEXIS 42 (1998). Uninsured Employers Fund liable for benefits assessed against insolvent insurer.  Uninsured Employers Fund was liable for portion of lifetime benefits award originally assessed against insurance company that was solvent on the date coal wor ker was first awarded compensation benefits but became insolvent after the award was entered. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Flanary, 27 Va. App. 201, 497 S.E.2d 912, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (1998), aff'd, 257 Va. 237, 514 S.E.2d 147, 1999 Va. LEXIS 38 (19 99). Uninsured Employers Fund not liabl e.  Workers Compensation Commission properly found that it had jurisdiction to award compensation to a claimant because, the insurer agreed to pay compensation, t he claimant did not have to establish coverage, nothing in the record established that employer failed to comply with the statutory requirements, and there was no merit to the insurers assertion that the Uninsured Employers Fund was responsible f or paying compensation where the policy was not cancelled or not renewed. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Estate of Harrison, 64 Va. App. 110, 765 S.E.2d 154, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 396 (2014). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Section 65.2-800 A provides that every employer shall insure payment of compensation for his employees. Code § 65.2-801 (A) provides that the obligations of Co de § 65.2-800 (A) can only be accomplished by purchasing a workers compensation insurance policy issued through a private insurer, being certified by the Commission as an individual self-insurer, or by becoming a member of a group self-insurance a ssociation licensed by the State Corporation Commission.

There is no provision in the Act that permits one employer to satisfy its workers compensation insurance obligation by including its employees under another c ompanys policy. Thus, while a leasing company an...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-802"><akn:num>§ 65.2-802</akn:num><akn:heading>Requirements for licensure as group self-insurance association; annual assessment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Two or more employers having a common interest may be licensed by the State Corporation Commission as a group self-insurance association and permitted to enter into agreements to pool their liabilities under this title. The members of any such group self-insurance association may also enter into agreements to pool their liabilities for workers compensation benefits which may arise under the laws of any other jurisdiction and other types of employers liabilities for the death or disablement of, or injury to , their employees. Benefits payable by any such association for such members liabilities under the laws of any other jurisdiction shall extend only to employees otherwise eligible for coverage under the provisions of this title. B. The State C orporation Commission shall not license a group self-insurance association or grant authorization for an employer to become a member of such group unless it receives in such form as it requires satisfactory proof of the solvency of any such employer, the financial ability of each to meet his obligations as a member, and the ability of the group to pay or cause to be paid the compensation in the amount and manner and when due as provided for in this title and as may be agreed upon with respect to other t ypes of employers liabilities which may be authorized and provided hereunder. C. Members of a group shall execute a written agreement under which each agrees to jointly and severally assume and discharge any liability under this title of employers party to such agreement. Agreements among the members shall be subject to approval by the State Co rporation Commission; however, no such agreement nor membership in a group self-insurance association shall relieve an employer of the liabilities imposed by this title with respect to his employees. In addition to the rights of the association under suc h agreements, in the event of failure of the association to enforce such rights after reasonable notice to the association, the State Corporation Commission shall have the right independently to enforce on behalf of the association the joint and several liability of its members under this title and the liability of members for any unpaid contributions and assessments. The State Corporation Commission shall be entitled to recover its expenses and attorneys fees. D. Any person, firm, or corporation desiring to engage in the business of providing services for a group self-insurance association shall satisfy the State Corporation Commission of its ability to perform the services necessary to fulfill the employers obligations under this title before it undertakes to provide such services to any group self-insurance association. The State Corporation Commission may from time to time review and alter any decision approving an employer as a member of a group or its approval of a group or of an agency servicing a group. The State Corporation Commission may in its discretion require the deposit of an acceptable security, indemnity, or bond or the purchase of such excess insurance or the ceding of reinsurance on a specific or agg regate excess of loss basis as may be required by the circumstances. E. The State C orporation Commission may establish reasonable requirements and standards for the approval of a group self-insurance association and the administration of such associations including, without limitation, the quality, amount and accounting of security dep osits, bonds, excess insurance and reinsurance, the membership in any group self-insurance association, the amount of advance payments and reserves required of group self-insurance associations, the investment of such funds, the form and content of finan cial information to be submitted by a group self-insurance association and the frequency of such submissions, and the terms of agreements between members of a group self-insurance association. The State Corporation Commission may, after notice and hearin g, embody such requirements and standards and such other requirements as may be reasonably necessary for the purposes of this section in regulations; however, any group self-insurance association entering into a reinsurance transaction pursuant to the pr ovisions of this section shall be deemed an insurer for purposes of such transaction and shall be subject to Article 3.1 (§ 38.2-1316.1 et seq.) of Chapter 13 of Title 38.2. F. Notwithstan ding any provision of this title to the contrary, each licensed group self-insurance association shall be assessed annually by the State Corporation Commission in like manner and amount to that provided by Chapter 4 (§ 38.2-400 et seq.) of Title 38.2 and shall pay such assessment in accordance with the aforesaid provisions of law; however, for the purposes of such assessment direct gross premium income of a licensed group self-insurance association shall be the aggregate of the amounts determ ined to be subject to the tax imposed by § 65.2-1006 on each employer member of such association. G. Notwithstan ding the provisions of § 49-25, neither the State Corporation Commission nor any other entity or person, as obligee under any surety bond required under this section or any regulation adopted hereunder, shall be required to institute suit against an a ssociation as a condition precedent to the suretys performance under the bond.

CASE NOTES This section does not alter former § 65.1-29 (now § 65.2-302).  The fact that all members of the Virginia Coal Producers Group (VCPG) are jointly and severally obligated to each other under this section does not remove from an injured employee the right to proceed against a statutory employer under former § 65.1-29, but rather, the joint and several liability of the members of the VCPG under this section simply operates to give the statutory employer a broader base of poss ible indemnification, and it does not, and moreover cannot, alter the statutory employers obligations which are plainly set forth in former § 65.1-29.

History History. 1989, c. 662, § 65.1-104.3; 1991, c. 355. § 65.2-803.1. Requirements for registration as professional employer organization; annual assessment. Text A. Any busines s entity desiring to engage in the business of providing professional employer services shall register with the Commission before any such services may be provided. The Commission may require any business entity having a controlling ownership interest in or sharing common ownership with a professional employer organization providing professional employer services in the Commonwealth to guarantee, in a form prescribed by the Commission, performance of all obligations pursuant to this title, including the payment of workers compensation benefits. B. Each regist ered professional employer organization shall notify the Commission and the Bureau of Insurance of the State Corporation Commission within 30 calendar days of all new or terminated, in whole or in part, client companies. Upon registration and annually th ereafter, each registered professional employer organization shall notify the Commission and the Bureau of Insurance of the State Corporation Commission of all client companies. Such notice shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed to the public, provided that the Commission may respond to inquiries as to whether a client company has workers compensation coverage; however, nothing herein shall be interpreted to prohibit or limit the production of documents containing such information from the professional employer organization pursuant to an otherwise lawful subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each such notification shall indicate, by client company, if the professional employer organization will provide voluntary market wo rkers compensation insurance and whether the client company will obtain separate workers compensation insurance. The Commission may require such other information as it deems necessary for the administration of this section. C. All agreeme nts for professional employer services shall be in writing and shall provide a description of the respective rights and obligations of the professional employer organization and the client company. The professional employer organization shall provide a w ritten summary of such rights and obligations to each coemployee, including information concerning filing for workers compensation and unemployment benefits. No agreement for professional employer services shall alter or affect the terms and conditio ns of any collective bargaining agreement between the client company and its employees without the consent of the parties to such collective bargaining agreement. D. A professio nal employer organization that is registered with the Commission and operating in compliance with the requirements of this section shall be deemed to be an employer of its coemployees and may assume responsibilities as an employer of its coemployees for the term of its agreement with a client company. A professional employer organization may secure and provide all required voluntary market workers compensation insurance for its coemployees under a master workers compensation insurance policy in the name of the professional employer organization. E. A professio nal employer organization shall notify in writing the client company and coemployees of its intent to terminate any agreement for professional employer services with a client company at the time of or prior to termination. Such notice shall advise the cl ient company of its obligation to secure workers compensation coverage. The professional employer organization shall provide a copy of such notice to the Commission and the insurer at the time notice is given to the client company. Workers compen sation insurance coverage shall continue until termination or for fifteen calendar days after receipt of notice of termination by both the Commission and the client company, whichever is later. This section shall not alter the notice obligations of an in surer seeking to cancel workers compensation coverage pursuant to subsection B of § 65.2-804. If a professional employer organization has received notice that its workers compensation insurance policy will be cancelled or nonrenewed, the profe ssional employer organization shall notify the client companies within seven calendar days after receipt of the notice. Failure of the professional employer organization to provide such notice to the client companies subrogates the Commission, upon payme nt of a claim from the Uninsured Employers Fund to any coemployee of a client company that did not receive notice, to any right to recover damages which the injured coemployee or his personal representative may have against the professional employer organization. F. This sectio n shall not exempt a client company from any other license requirements imposed under federal, state, or local law, and a coemployee shall be recognized as an employee of the client company for all purposes. For purposes of licensing requirements, a prof essional employer organization shall not be deemed to be engaged in the occupation, trade or profession of the client company solely through the provision of professional employer services to that client company. G. Where a pro fessional employer organization or a staffing service has obtained workers compensation insurance to secure its obligations under this title with respect to compensation on account of injury or death by accident, the rights and remedies available to the employee or coemployee under this title shall be exclusive as to both the client company and the professional employer organization or staffing service in accordance with this title. H. A professio nal employer organization that fails to comply with the provisions of this title or with the regulations of the Commission shall be subject to the requirements of Chapter 9 (§ 65.2-900 et seq.) of this title. The Commission is authorized to revoke or suspend any registration hereunder if the professional employer organization fails to comply with the provisions of this title or with the regulations of the Commission. If a registration is revoked as herein provided, the Commission may allow the profes sional employer organization to reregister upon application therefor if, when and after the conditions upon which revocation was based have been corrected and the professional employer organization has complied with all provisions of this title and appli cable regulations. Whenever a registration is revoked or suspended the Commission may request the Office of the Attorney General to petition the circuit court of the jurisdiction in which the professional employer organization is located for an injunctio n to cause such professional employer organization to cease providing professional employer services. Suspension of a registration shall in all cases be for an indefinite time and the suspension may be lifted and rights under the registration fully or pa rtially restored at such time as the Commission determines that the rights of the registrant appear to so require and the interests of the public will not be jeopardized by resumption of operation. I. Notwithstan ding any provision of this title to the contrary, each registered professional employer organization shall be assessed annually by the Commission, in addition to any other assessments provided in this title, an assessment in an amount not to exceed the s ums necessary for the registration and supervision of all professional employer organizations. The assessment shall be apportioned and assessed and paid in proportion to the aggregate of the annual payroll of all coemployees shared by or assigned or allo cated to the professional employer organization.

Each employer subject to this title shall file with the Workers Compensation Com mission, in form prescribed by it, annually or as often as may be necessary, evidence of his compliance with the provisions of § 65.2-801 and all others relating thereto; however, if the employer secures his liability under this title pursuant to subd ivision A 1 of § 65.2-801 then the insurance carrier shall make a filing on behalf of the employer, and such filing shall be made electronically in the form as prescribed and to the agent as designated by the Commission, within 30 days of the inceptio n of the policy. Evidence of an employers compliance with the provisions of subdivision A 1 of § 65.2-801 shall be deemed to satisfy such provisions if it includes the name and address of the insured, the insureds federal employer identificati on number, his policy number, dates of insurance coverage, the name and address of his insurer, and the insurers identification number. Every employer who has complied with the foregoing provision and has subsequently cancelled his insurance or his m embership in a licensed group self-insurance association shall immediately notify the Workers Compensation Commission of such cancellation, the date thereof and the reasons therefor. Every insurance carrier or group self-insurance association shall i n like manner notify the Workers Compensation Commission immediately upon the cancellation of any policy issued by it or any membership agreement, whichever is applicable, under the provisions of this title, except that a carrier or group self-insura nce association need not set forth its reasons for cancellation unless requested by the Workers Compensation Commission. 2. Every employer who cancels his insurance or his membership in a licensed group self-insurance association shall, prior to cancelling his insurance or his membership, give 30 days w ritten notice to his employees covered. Every employer who receives the notice required under subsection B of this section shall immediately forward a copy to his employees covered. Where the employer is a mine owner or operator, the notice or copy of no tice required to be given by this subsection shall also be given to the Chief Mine Inspector. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply with respect to a cancellation incident to a change of insurance or membership where no lapse of coverage occu rs. B.

Workers Compensation, §§ 3, 10, 15. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-105 or prior law. Legislative intent of the notice and delay requirements of this section was to protect t he worker against a lapse in his employers insurance coverage. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc., 223 Va. 641, 292 S.E.2d 327, 1982 Va. LEXIS 248 (1982). The notice and delay requirements of this section serve two functions: They give the emp loyer an opportunity to acquire other insurance, and they make it possible for the Commission timely to invoke its enforcement authority under former § 65.1-106 (now § 65.2-805). Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc., 223 Va. 641, 292 S.E.2d 327, 1982 Va. LEXIS 248 (1982). Notice requirement is mandatory.  The requirement of this section that notice be given to the Commission is not just an administrative convenience, but a mandatory provision that must be complied with for a carrier to effectively cancel a workers compensation policy. American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Barlow, 4 Va. App. 352, 358 S.E.2d 184, 4 Va. Law Rep. 115, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 188 (1987). Workers Compensation Commission properly dismissed an insurer as a party defendant in an injured employees action against the employer because the insurer was not obligated to provide the employer coverage for the loss event where, while the Commission erred by holding that actual receipt of the notice of cancellation was not required, the employer did not establish that its reliance on an agents misr epresentations was justifiable, the employer was fully aware of its insufficient down payment, did not make a single premium payment, and actually received the notice of cancellation 36 days before the employee was injured. Full Circle Concepts II, LLC v . Cherry, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 32 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 3, 2015). This section demands that the notice be actually received by the Commission to constitut e an effective cancellation. American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Barlow, 4 Va. App. 352, 358 S.E.2d 184, 4 Va. Law Rep. 115, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 188 (1987). Thirty-day notice provision applies only where insurer cancels.  The thirty-day notice provision in subsection B applies only where insurance is cancelled by the insurer, not where the insurance is cancelled by the employer. Pe nnsylvania Mfrs. Ass'n Ins. Co. v. Waldron, 16 Va. App. 991, 434 S.E.2d 690, 10 Va. Law Rep. 175, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 412 (1993). Insurer not obligated to provide reasons for employer cancellation.  The plain language of this section does not require the insurer to set forth the reasons for cancellation where employer cancels the insurance policy. Pennsylvani a Mfrs. Ass'n Ins. Co. v. Waldron, 16 Va. App. 991, 434 S.E.2d 690, 10 Va. Law Rep. 175, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 412 (1993). Obligations between insurance carriers and other parties in collateral undertakings.  This section imposes insuring and reporting obligations on individual employers, and the notice requirement of subsection B addresses that regulatory concern; it does not concern obligations which may come into being between insurance carriers and other parties by virtue of collateral undertakings; therefore, subsection B did not require that general contractor be given notice of the cancellations of subcontracto rs insurance coverage. Girdley Constr. Co. v. Widger, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 241 (Va. Ct. App. May 29, 1990). Acceptance of premiums.  Statutes such as this section are designed to prevent employees from being left without compensation coverage. However, notification requirement statutes should n ot extend beyond the reason for their existence, and an insurer who accepted premiums should accept the loss, although strict technical cancellation by another carrier had not been accomplished. Franklin Mtg. Corp. v. Walker, 6 Va. App. 108, 367 S.E.2d 1 91, 4 Va. Law Rep. 2254, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 24 (1988). Failure to pay premium meant insurer not required to give notice.  Insurer was not required to comply with the notice provisions contained in subsection B of § 65.2-804 because the workers compensation and employers li ability insurance policies, which the insurer issued to two employers, were not non-renewed by the insurer as the employers did not pay the insurance premiums that were required to renew the policies. Thus, the insurance policies were not in effect when the employers employees were injured so that the insurer was not responsible for the payment of benefits to the employees. Travelers Prop. Cas. Co. of Am. v. Ely, 276 Va. 339, 666 S.E.2d 523, 2008 Va. LEXIS 98 (2008).

Text A. If such emp loyer fails to comply with the provisions of § 65.2-800 or 65.2-804, he shall be assessed a civil penalty of not more than $250 per day for each day of noncompliance, subject to a maximum penalty of $50,000. Such employer also shall be liable during c ontinuance of such failure to any employee either for compensation under this title or at law in a suit instituted by the employee against such employer to recover damages for personal injury or death by accident, and in any such suit such employer shall not be permitted to defend upon any of the following grounds: 1. That the employee was negligent; 2. That the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow employee; or 3. That the employee had assumed the risk of the injury. B. Any person who fails to comply with the provisions of § 65.2-803.1 shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $5,000 for each instance of noncompliance, in addition to any other penalties applicable under this title. C. The civil p enalties herein provided may be assessed by the Commission in an open hearing with the right of review and appeal as in other cases. Upon a finding by the Commission of such failure to comply, and after 15 days written notice thereof sent by certifie d mail to the employer, if such failure continues, the Commission may order the employer to cease and desist all business transactions and operations until found by the Commission to be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. D. Any civil p enalty assessed pursuant to this section shall be divided equally between and paid into the administrative fund established in Chapter 10 (§ 65.2-1000 et seq.) and the Uninsured Employers Fund established in Chapter 12 (§ 65.2-1200 et seq.). Th e Commission may add the costs of collection of such civil penalty to the aggregate civil penalty owed, in which event such costs shall be paid into the administrative fund established in Chapter 10 (§ 65.2-1000 et seq.).

The 2014 amendment by c. 204, in subsection A, deleted less than $500 nor following penalty of not and substituted $250 per day for each day o f noncompliance, subject to a maximum penalty of $50,000. Such employer also for $5,000, and he; and rewrote subsection D, which formerly read Any civil penalty assessed pursuant to this section shall be paid into the Uninsured Employer s Fund established in Chapter 12 (§ 65.2-1200 et seq.) of this title. Law Review.

Master and Servant, § 78. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-106 or prior law. Legislative intent.  This section expresses the overriding legislative intent that an uninsured employer shall be liable to his employee injured in an accident arising out of and duri ng the course of his employment. Virginia Used Auto Parts, Inc. v. Robertson, 212 Va. 100, 181 S.E.2d 612, 1971 Va. LEXIS 300 (1971). The notice and delay requirements of former § 65.1-105 (now § 65.2-804) serve two functions: They give the employer an opportunity to acquire other insurance, and they make it possible for the Commission timely to invoke its enforcement authority under this section. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwrite rs, Inc., 223 Va. 641, 292 S.E.2d 327, 1982 Va. LEXIS 248 (1982). Liberal construction.  Being part of the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act, this section is to be liberally construed in favor of the employee. Virginia Used Auto Parts, I nc. v. Robertson, 212 Va. 100, 181 S.E.2d 612, 1971 Va. LEXIS 300 (1971). This section allows the commission to impose a fine where, as here, the employer failed to comply with the requirements of § 65.2-804. Jim's Home Auto Serv., Inc. v. Nielsen, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 234 (Va. Ct. App. June 29, 1993). Similarity to Longshoremens Act.  This section contains almost the identical provision as set forth in § 905 of the Longshoremens Act. Biggs v. Norfolk Dredging Co., 237 F. Supp. 590, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7677 (E.D. Va. 1965), rev'd, 360 F.2d 360, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6654 (4th Cir. 1966). This section is penal in nature. Virginia Used Auto Parts, Inc. v. Robertson, 212 Va. 100 , 181 S.E.2d 612, 1971 Va. LEXIS 300 (1971). And it provides extraordinary advantages to an injured employee when his employer has fa iled or refused to comply with the Act. Virginia Used Auto Parts, Inc. v. Robertson, 212 Va. 100, 181 S.E.2d 612, 1971 Va. LEXIS 300 (1971). Every employer must insure employees.  This section, taken in conjunction with former § 65.1-103 (now § 65.2-800), former § 65.1-104 (repealed), and former § 65.1-105 (now § 65.2-804), d emands that every employer insure the compensation of employees. Thus, an injured employee of a subcontractor which had not obtained workmens (now workers) compensation insurance as required by law was entitled to bring an action for monetary dam ages against the subcontractor, even though the general contractor had compensation insurance which might be available to the employee. Baldwin v. Wrecking Corp. of Am., 464 F. Supp. 185, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15222 (W.D. Va. 1979). Employer, whose son was properly deemed his third employee, was appropriately assessed a fine, pursuant to § 65.2-805 for failing to carry workers compensa tion coverage; evidence showed that the son worked at the employers direction, was paid a wage, used the company vehicle to travel to various work sites, and the employer established quitting time and gave workers, including his son, their individual work assignments. Perkey v. Fridley, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 31 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 28, 2003). This section does not explicitly require the employee to make an election of remedies. Vi rginia Used Auto Parts, Inc. v. Robertson, 212 Va. 100, 181 S.E.2d 612, 1971 Va. LEXIS 300 (1971). But he is entitled to only one full recovery and can collect only one time. But where he has effected no recovery, he has not received the satisfaction that can come only with payment. Delp v. Berry, 213 Va. 786, 195 S.E.2d 877, 1973 Va. LEXIS 232 (1973). When employee may resort to civil action against employer.  Where an employer failed to comply with the provisions of the Act, notwithstanding it was subject thereto, and the employee-claimant has been unsuccessful in coll ecting the award decreed him by the Commission, the employee-claimant is not barred from resorting to a civil action to recover damages from the employer. Delp v. Berry, 213 Va. 786, 195 S.E.2d 877, 1973 Va. LEXIS 232 (1973). Unsuccessful resort to a civil action will not bar the employee from pursuing his remedy under the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act. Virginia Used Auto Parts, Inc. v. Robertson, 212 Va. 100, 181 S.E.2d 612, 1971 Va. LEXIS 300 (1971). Under a statute giving the employee the right to proceed either at law or under the Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act against an uninsured employer, the employee will not be barred by an unsuccessful action at law. Virginia Used Auto Parts, Inc. v. Robertson, 212 Va. 100, 181 S.E.2d 612, 1971 Va. LEXIS 300 (1971). Circuit court did not err in ruling that the injured employee could not pursue an action at law against his uninsured employer after obtaining a final collectible award of workers compensation benefits. Because the employee successfully obtained a final workers compensation award, had received some of that award from the employer, and was assured of recovering all the workers compensation benefits to which he was entitled, he received the recovery he sought under the Workers Compensation Act. Redifer v. Chester, 283 Va. 121, 720 S.E.2d 66, 2012 Va. LEXIS 6 (2012). Imposition of fine upon review of dismissal by deputy commissioner was not double jeopardy.  Where the deputy commissioner dismissed the show cause order against the employer, the Commissions later imposition of a fine when it reviewed the deputy comm issioners decision was not double jeopardy. This fine, imposed under this section for failure to obtain workers compensation insurance, is not a criminal penalty. It is a fine imposed because of an employers refusal or neglect to comply with the provisions requiring evidence of insurance. Smith v. Weber, No. 0873-85 (Ct. of Appeals Nov. 5, 1986). Civil penalty properly assessed.  Virginia Workers Compensation Commission properly assessed a civil penalty on a cab company as: (1) the cab company employed four to six employees, and did no t have workers compensation insurance due to a dispute with its insurer, (2) § 65.2-800 required every employer subject to the Virginia Workers Compensation Act to have workers compensation insurance, (3) subsection A of § 65.2-804 inst ructed employers to provide proof of that insurance to the Commission annually, or as often as might be necessary, (4) § 65.2-805 stated that employers who failed to comply with §§ 65.2-800 or 65.2-804 were to be assessed a civil penalty, and (5 ) neither the case law nor the Act included an exception to the insurance requirement based upon a dispute with an insurer.

For any violation of the provisions of this section, an employer shall be subject to a fine not exceeding $100 for each offense and shall re fund to the individual employee the amount or amounts deducted or contributed.

Annotations CASE NOTES Due process claim moot.  Where insurer was not a party to proceeding in which the full Commission concluded that claimant suffered from a progression of the injury sustained in a previous accident and not from a new accident, but in response to claimants request for payment of his medical bills, the insurer raised the due process issue and requested an opportunity to present evidence, which request was granted at a hearing at which t he insurer was given a full and fair opportunity to call witnesses, confront the claimant and present any new evidence it deemed relevant, the effect of this hearing was to make moot any argument by the insurer that it was denied due process of law. Ther efore, the insurers claim that this section and former § 65.1-111 (now § 65.2-811) are applicable to cases in which there is a community of interest between the employer and the insurer which sufficiently protects the rights of one where only t he other received notice of the proceeding, but that where the interests of the employer and the insurer are adverse, to bind the insurer to a decision resulting from a hearing of which it received no notice nor opportunity to be heard would offend tradi tional notions of fair play and substantial justice was without merit.

Pizza Hut, 75 O.W.C. 54 (1996)). A carrier may not avoid assessment of a fine for failure to file a First Report within ten days as required by § 65.1-124 (now § 65.2-900) by alleging that the employer failed to promptly provide the carrier with notice of the accident. Relying on § 65.1-109 (now § 65.2-809), the Commission held that notice to the employer of the claimants injury became constructive notice to the carrier on the sa me date. Sanderfur v.

Due process claim moot.  Where insurer was not a party to proceeding in which the full Commission concluded that claimant suffered from a progression of the injury sustained in a previous accident and not from a new accident, but in response to claimants request for payment of his medical bills, the insurer raised the due process issue and requested an opportunity to present evidence, which request was granted at a hearing at which t he insurer was given a full and fair opportunity to call witnesses, confront the claimant and present any new evidence it deemed relevant, the effect of this hearing was to make moot any argument by the insurer that it was denied due process of law. Ther efore, the insurers claim that former § 65.1-109 (now § 65.2-809) and this section are applicable to cases in which there is a community of interest between the employer and the insurer which sufficiently protects the rights of one where only t he other received notice of the proceeding, but that where the interests of the employer and the insurer are adverse, to bind the insurer to a decision resulting from a hearing of which it received no notice nor opportunity to be heard would offend tradi tional notions of fair play and substantial justice was without merit.

Agreement to pay compensation.  Workers Compensation Commission properly found that it had jurisdiction to award compensation to a claimant because, the insurer agreed to pay compensation, t he claimant did not have to establish coverage, nothing in the record established that employer failed to comply with the statutory requirements, and there no merit to the insurers assertion that the Uninsured Employers Fund was responsible for p aying compensation where the policy was not cancelled or not renewed.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under former § 65.1-112 or prior law. Effect of Act.  The Act permits an injured employee the right to recover from a negligent third party full damages for injuries inflicted on him by such party, and the Act furthe r gives to the employer and his insurance carrier the right to recover from such third party whatever amounts they actually had to pay for the benefit of the injured employee. It takes from the employee the right pro tanto to a double recovery, but beyon d this it leaves the employees right to recover as it was before. Sheris v. Sheris Co., 212 Va. 825, 188 S.E.2d 367, 1972 Va. LEXIS 278, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 878, 93 S. Ct. 132, 34 L. Ed. 2d 132, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 1673 (1972). Effect of proviso to this section.  When the entire Workmens (now Workers) Compensation Act is read as a whole, it is clear that the provision that nothing therein should be construed as conferring upon the insurance carriers any other or further rights than those existing in the employer at the time of the injury to his employee, anything in the policy of insurance to the contrary notwithstanding, was simply intended to limit the i nsurance carrier to its subrogated rights formerly vested in the employer, irrespective of any provision of the policy of insurance, which might seem to give to the carrier any other or further rights. Southern Ry. v. United States Cas. Co., 136 Va. 475, 118 S.E. 266, 1923 Va. LEXIS 99 (1923) (see also C &amp; O Ry. v. Palmer, 149 Va. 560, 140 S.E. 831 (1927)). The employers workmens (now workers) compensation insurance carrier stands in the shoes of the employer. Sheris v. Travelers Ins. Co., 491 F.2d 603, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10098 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 831, 95 S. Ct. 54, 42 L. Ed. 2d 56, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2369 (1974). And may sue third person whose negligence caused injury.  Under this section there can be no doubt of the fact that an insurance carrier who has paid compensation to an injured employee, or assumed the liability of the e mployer therefor, has a right to institute and conduct an action against a third person whose negligence caused the injury to the employee, either in its own name or in the name of the injured employee. Corrigan v. Stormont, 160 Va. 727, 170 S.E. 16, 193 3 Va. LEXIS 252 (1933). Insurer has no greater rights than injured employee against subcontractor.  An employer, or its insurance carrier as subrogee, after payment of the statutory compensation, may not hold a subcontractor or its servants in damages, as the em ployer and the carrier have no greater rights than the injured employee. Western Contracting Corp. v. Power Eng'g Co., 369 F.2d 933, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 4139 (4th Cir. 1966). Employer has rights at time of injury to employee.  It was contended in the instant case that at the time of the injury to the employee, the employer had no right to assert, as under former § 65.1-40 (now § 6 5.2-307) that right was not called into being until the employee had made claim for compensation, and therefore the insurance carrier, plaintiff in the instant case, had no right vested in him by this section, which subrogated him to all the rights a nd duties of the employer and not the employee. It was held that there was no merit in this contention. If the construction contended for was adopted, the result would be practically to annul this section which was clearly intended to give relief, by subrogation, to insurance carriers. Southern Ry. v. United States Cas. Co., 136 Va. 475, 118 S.E. 266, 1923 Va. LEXIS 99 (1923). Employee must not prejudice insurance carriers right of subrogation.  The insurance carriers statutory right of subrogation must not be prejudiced by the act of the employee, in order to preserve the latters right to compensation. Stone v. George W. Helme Co., 184 Va. 1051, 37 S.E.2d 70, 1946 Va. LEXIS 168 (1946). A claimant is not entitled to further compensation under the Workers Compensation Act when he settles a tort action, arising from the same work-related accide nt, without the knowledge or consent of his employer or its insurer. Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Van Hoy, 225 Va. 64, 300 S.E.2d 750, 1983 Va. LEXIS 192 (1983). Burden of proof on employer.  Where impairment of employers right of subrogation is claimed, to successfully be relieved of its liability to pay compensation benefits, the burden is on the employer to show that the employee prejudiced the employers right. Overhead Door Co. v. Lewis, 22 Va. App. 240, 468 S.E.2d 700, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 243 (1996). Agreement between employer and tort-feasor cannot affect rights of insurer and employee.  This was an action against a railroad company to recover for injuries to an employee of an independent contractor. The action was brought in the name of the emplo yee and an insurance carrier who had paid the employee compensation, under this section. There was a contract between the railroad and the independent contractor under which the independent contractor was to save harmless the railroad from any damages ar ising from injuries to mechanics, laborers, or other persons by reason of accidents or otherwise. It was held that in this action the contract under which the independent contractor agreed to save the railroad harmless need not be considered. The contrac tor and wrongdoer could not by private agreement deprive the employee of his major remedy, and make him bear the burden of an agreement that the contractor would save the railway harmless. C &amp; O Ry. v. Palmer, 149 Va. 560, 140 S.E. 831, 1927 Va. LEXIS 19 6 (1927). Employer and insurer as real parties in interest in claim against third-party tort- feasor.  An employer and, in turn, his workers compensation insurance carrier, are subrogated to the rights of an injured employee who receives workers compensatio n benefits, and they are thus entitled to seek recovery of the amount of the benefits from a third-party tortfeasor. As such, they should be considered real parties in interest within the meaning of F.R.C.P. Rule 17(a). Ingram v. Link Belt Power Shovel Co., 94 F.R.D. 196, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14023 (W.D. Va. 1982). Issue as to who was entitled to credits awarded not addressed.  Under § 65.2-812, plaintiff carrier stood in the shoes of plaintiff employer for purposes of seeking relief under the Virginia Workers Compensation Act, an d where the carrier and the employer sought review of a decision of the Workers Compensation Commission that held that overpayments of disability compensation to claimant entitled the carrier to a credit against any future compensation due and did no t entitle it to recover those overpayments from the claimant under §§ 65.2-710 and 65.2-712, and the Commission actually awarded the credit to the employer, but the procedural history of the case made it clear that it was the carrier that made the disability compensation payments and sought the relief at issue, for ease of reference, the court referred to the appellant as employer as it was unaware of any dispute between the carrier and the employer as to who was entitled to the credit and did not address any such dispute in the appeal. Bay Concrete Constr. Co. v. Davis, 43 Va. App. 528, 600 S.E.2d 144, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 377 (2004). Employees settlement with tortfeasor destroyed employers right to subrogation.  Benefits were properly terminated to workers compensation claimant when her injuries were aggravated by an automobile accident and she settled with and releas ed the tortfeasor, thereby destroying employers right to subrogation. Barnes v. Wise Fashions, 16 Va. App. 108, 428 S.E.2d 301, 9 Va. Law Rep. 1085, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 59 (1993). Carrier allowed deduct ion from attorneys fee.  Where the workmens (now workers) compensation insurance carrier benefited by the employees suit against the tort-feasor and must pay its share of the attorneys fee, but where the carrier also had to spend its own money when the employee assumed an adversary position on the issue of subrogation, the district court should allow as a deduction from the fee that the carrier would otherwise owe, the am ount it reasonably expended to perfect its right of subrogation to fulfill the mandate of former § 65.1-43 (now § 65.2-311) requiring consideration of the interests of both parties.

Workers Compensation, § 5. § 65.2-821.1. Payment and reimbursement practices; prohibitions. Text A. As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning:Contracting entity means (i) a pers on that enters into a provider contract with a provider or (ii) an intended beneficiary of the rights of such person under the provider contract.Employer means the employer; any insurance carrier, group self-insured association, or other person providing coverage for the employers obligation to provide medical service to a claimant under t his title; or any third-party administrator acting on behalf of the employer.PPO network means th e multiple provider contracts available to an employer pursuant to a PPO network arrangement.PPO network arrangement means an arrangement under which the PPO network arranger sells, conveys, or otherwise transfers to an employer the ability to discount payments or reimbursements to a provider pursuant to the terms of multiple provider contracts to which the PPO network arranger is a direct party.PPO network arranger means a person that operate s a PPO network arrangement.Provider, transition date, and Virginia fee schedule have the meaning assigned thereto in § 65.2-605. Provider includes a providers employer o r professional business entity.Provider contract means an agreement between a contracting entity and a provider pursuant to which the provider agrees to deliver medical services to a claimant under this title in exchange for payment or reimbursement of an agreed-upon amount. Third-party administrator means a person that administers, processes, handles, or pays claims to providers on behalf of an employer. B. On and afte r the transition date: 1. No em ployer shall pay or reimburse a provider for medical services provided to a claimant less than the amount provided for in the applicable Virginia fee schedule or other amount determined as provided in subdivision B 2 or 3 of § 65.2-605 unless: a. The employer has directly entered into: (1) A provider contract with the provider; (2) A contract with a contracting entity that has entered into a provider contract with the provider; or (3) A contract with a PPO network arranger that authorizes the employer to use a PPO network to derive a benefit from a provider contract; and b. The provider has agreed to provide medical services to the claimant for an agreed-upon reimbursement or contractual amount as set forth in a provider contract referenced in subdiv ision a. 2. A person with whom an employer has directly contracted as described in subdivision 1 a shall not sell, lease, or otherwise disseminate data regarding the payment or reimbursement amoun ts or terms of a provider contract without the express written consent and prior notification of all parties to the provider contract; however, the express written request from, and prior notification to, a provider shall not be required if the provider s identity has been redacted from such data. 3. If an employer uses or relies on a contract described in subdivision 1 a to discount a payment or reimbursement to a provider, the employer shall notify the provider, at the time it re mits the payment or reimbursement, of (i) the name of the provider, contracting entity, or PPO network arranger with whom the employer directly contracted and (ii) how, if other than by a direct contract between the employer and the provider, the employe r acquired the right to discount the payment or reimbursement to the provider. 4. If an employer uses or relies on a contract with a PPO network arranger described in subdivision 1 a (3) to discount a payment or reimbursement to a provider, the employer shall not sh op for the lowest discount for a specific provider among the provider contracts held in multiple PPO networks. This prohibition shall not bar an employer that has entered into a PPO network arrangement and selected a provider contract in the PPO network from availing itself of all discounts provided pursuant to the selected provider contract in the PPO network. C. Any person who suffers loss as a result of a violation of this section shall be entitled to initiate an action at the Commission to recover actual damages and interest from the date of the violation until entry of the final award.

Rev. 475 (2004). Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 21 M.J. Workers Compensation, § 57. CASE NOTES Voluntary payments of compensation benefits and filing of reports do not toll statute of limitations.  When the first report of accident is filed, and when there is no evidence of fraud or act by employer reasonably calculated to induce the employee from filing a c laim with the commission, voluntary payments of compensation benefits and filing of medical reports and records do not operate to toll the limitation. Barnes v. B T R Dunlop, Inc., 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 512 (Va. Ct. App. July 26, 1994). Actual prejudice must be shown.  Workers Compensation Commission erred in finding that the employers filing of an accident report beyond the two-year statute of limitations per se prejudiced the claimant who filed her application for benefits more than two years after she was injured at work. Instead, the claimant had the burden of proving that she was actually prejudiced by the employers filing of the accident report beyond the time for filing a claim itself, as the claimant had a previous claim barred on limitations grounds, and, thus, may have known of the need to file a claim within two years of the date the injury occurred. Hall v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 41 Va. App. 8 35, 589 S.E.2d 484, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 642 (2003). No prejudice shown.  Workers compensation claimants claim for a large herniated cervical disk was barred by the statute of limitations as: (1) the claimant was not prejudiced by the late filing of the employers first report of accident, but even if the limitations period was tolled until the date of the claimants first claim for benefits, the claim was filed more than two years later, (2) the doctrine of equitable est oppel did not apply as the employer did not misrepresent or conceal material facts that caused the claimant to refrain from filing her claim, and (3) the doctrine of imposition did not apply because the employer did not mislead the claimant or use superi or knowledge of or experience with the Virginia Workers Compensation Act to deprive the claimant of compensation. Tuck v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 47 Va. App. 276, 623 S.E.2d 433, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 527 (2005). Prejudice found.  Although a workers compensation claim was filed more than two years after the date of injury, the statute of limitations was tolled under § 65.2-602 becaus e the employer failed to file an accident report under § 65.2-900, and the claimant was unaware of the statute of limitations because no blue letter was sent under subsection D of § 65.2-201. Falls Church Cabinetry v. Jewell, 60 Va. App. 134, 724 S .E.2d 236, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 134 (2012). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION An Employer must file an Employers First Report of Accident with the Commission, even if it denies the compensability of the reported accident. Ellis v. City of Norfolk, 68 O.I.C. 47 (1989). Employer subject to fine for failure to file an Employers First Report of Accident form whenever an employee alleges that he or she sustained an accident, whe ther the employer contests the claim or not. Jones v. Holiday Inn, 61 O.I.C. 253 (1982). A deputy commissioner may use the Employers First Report of Accident sua sponte to corroborate the testimony of the claimant and his wife that notice of accident was timely communicated to the employer, and to impeach the contrary testimony of the employer. Bla nkenship v. K E T, Inc., 76 O.W.C. 68 (1997). While an Employers First Report of Accident is not used to determine how the accident occurred, it is probative as to whether and when an alleged accident was reported. Blankenship v. K E T, Inc., 76 O.W.C. 68 (1997). A carrier may not avoid assessment of a fine for failure to file a First Report within ten days as required by § 65.1-124 (now § 65.2-900) by alleging that the employer failed to promptly provide the carrier with notice of the accident. Relying on § 65.1-109 (now § 65.2-809), the Commission held that notice to the employer of the claimants injury became constructive notice to the carrier on the sa me date. Sanderfur v. United Parcel Service of America, 69 O.I.C. 198 (1990). An employer who refused to process a workers compensation claim because the employee did not report the incident within the time frame set by company policy, is subject to a fine for failure to file a First Report of Accident within the statutory period. Stiltner v. Hermes Abrasives, Ltd., 70 O.I.C. 250 (1991). Where an employer fails to furnish medical reports upon the filing of its application as required by Rule 13 (now Rule 1.4) and Rule 17 (now Rule 4.2), the applic ation is void ab initio. It is also appropriate to assess a penalty under § 65.1-75.1 (now 65.2-524) a nd a fine under § 65.1-124 (now § 65.2-900 and 65.1-127 (now § 65.2-902). Marrow v. Addington Beaman Lumber Company, Inc., 69 O.I.C. 195 (1990); Marrow v. Addington Beaman Lumber Co., Inc., 69 O.I.C. 195 (1990). Section 65.1-87.1 (now § 65.2-602) prevents the tolling of the statute of limitations when a First Report has been filed but does not mandate the tolling of th e statute where such a report has not been filed. The remedy for failing to file a First Report of Accident is a mandatory fine provided for in § 65.1-127. Hervey v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., 12 Va. App. 88, 402 S.E.2d 688, 7 Va. Law R ep. 1916, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (1991). Section 65.2-900 grants the Commission discretion to promulgate regulations governing the means by which employers report accidental injuries. Pursuant to 16 VAC 30-90-20, an employer must file an Employers Accident Report if the injury meets any of seven criteria. If the injury does not meet any of the criteria set out in the regulation, the injury is deemed minor and the employer may file the abbreviated Fo rm 45-A (Report of Minor Injuries). If the employer files either form, whether or not the employer filed the correct form, the statute of limitations is not tolled. Filing either form triggers the Commission to send the claimant an information brochure, informing the claimant about the statute of limitations and the need to file a claim within two years of the accident. Komrowski v. Stafford (County of) School Board, VWC File No. 204-36-96 (April 5, 2002). Absent evidence of fraud, concealment or false representation, an employers filing of Commission Form 45-A (Report of Minor Injuries) satisfies the requiremen ts of § 65.2-900, and the two-year statute of limitations for filing an original claim for benefits is not tolled under § 65.2-602.

Hampton Inn/Holiday Inns, VWC File No. 203-54-72 (January 23, 2002).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-901"><akn:num>§ 65.2-901</akn:num><akn:heading>Report of number of employees, hours of work, etc</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Every employer shall upon request of the Commission report the number of its employees, hours of their labor and number of days of operation of business.

The 2014 amendment by c. 203, in subsection A, inserted insurance carrier, self-insurer, group self-insurance association, or third party administrator ne ar the beginning of the first sentence and deleted the former last sentence which read In the event the employer has transmitted the report to the insurance carrier or third party administrator for transmission to the Commission, the insurance carrie r or third party administrator failing to transmit the report shall be liable for the civil penalty; and rewrote subsection B, which formerly read Any civil penalty assessed pursuant to this section shall be paid into the Uninsured Employers Fund established in Chapter 12 (§ 65.2-1200 et seq.) of this title. CASE NOTES Sanctions.  Court of appeals found no authority to support a claimants argument that he was entitled to an award of sanctions, pursuant to § 65.2-902, because a compan y that hired him failed to file a first report of accident after he was injured on the job. North Star Home Improvement, Inc. v. Heddings, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 81 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 17, 2004). Former employee contended that during the pendency of his workers compensation claims, the employers supervisors and administrators followed neither the e mployers internal policies nor Virginias workers compensation laws; the employees contention seemed to implicate § 65.2-902 because the employer was, in fact, late in filing a notice of the employees injury with the Workers Com pensation Commission. However, the statute itself specified a civil fine as the remedy for a violation. Taylor v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 376 F. Supp. 2d 653, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14040 (E.D. Va.), aff'd, 158 Fed. Appx. 446, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 28200 (4 th Cir. 2005). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION Note: Also see Rule 4 (previously Rule 17), Rules of the Commission. Medical Reports: Rule 4.2 of the Rules of the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission requires that legible copies of all medical reports shall be filed immediately with the Commission. All medical reports relevant to a claim are required reports. Eames v. Williamsburg Soap &amp; Candle Co., 76 O.W.C. 7 (1997). Where an employer fails to file a medical report, § 65.1-127 (now § 65.2-127) provides for the assessment of a fine. Meade v. Clinchfield Coal Company, 62 O .I.C. 311 (1983). The Commission may assess a fine for failure to file a medical report as required by Rule 17 (now Rule 4). A fine will not be assessed when the medical report in question has no specific bearing on the issues or the outcome of the case. Whitehair v. American Industrial Contracting, 67 O.I.C. 181 (1988). Penalty assessed for failure to file medical reports. Haney v. Thyssen Mining Co., 57 O.I.C. 155 (1977); Walker v. Alsage Mgt. Corp., 57 O.I.C. 363 (1976). First Reports: A carrier may not avoid assessment of a fine for failure to file a First Report within ten days as required by § 65.1-124 (now § 65.2-900) by alleging that the employer failed to promptly provide the carrier with notice of the accident.

Whenever, following due investigation of a claim for compensation benefits, the Comm ission determines that (i) the employer of record has failed to comply with the provisions of § 65.2-801 or that a self-insured employer or its surety as required by § 65.2-801 is unable to satisfy an award in whole or in part, and (ii) the claim i s compensable, the Commission shall make a provisional award of compensation benefits, or any unpaid balance thereof, without further delay. Thereafter, the Commission shall make a final award concerning such benefits or unpaid balance thereof, in accord ance with the provisions of this chapter and all applicable provisions of this title. The Commission shall order payment of any award of compensation benefits pursuant to this chapter from the Uninsured Employers Fund. 2.

CASE NOTES The legislative purpose in establishing the fund was to provide compensation for claiman ts, not to indemnify statutory employers or their carriers. A.G. Van Metre, Jr., Inc. v. Gandy, 7 Va. App. 207, 372 S.E.2d 198, 5 Va. Law Rep. 391, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (1988) (decided under former § 65.1-149). No awa rd against fund where statutory employer is liable.  This section makes no distinction between an immediate employer and a statutory employer in the ascending scale. The purpose of the fund is to insure that injured employees will be paid their compensation benefits even though their employer has breached his duty to secure compensation insurance. In most instances there will be no statutory employer and the employees remedy will be against the fund, as provide d by this section. But in those instances where a statutory employer is liable, a claimant has no right to an award against the fund. A.G. Van Metre, Jr., Inc. v. Gandy, 7 Va. App. 207, 372 S.E.2d 198, 5 Va. Law Rep. 391, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 110 (1988) ( decided under former § 65.1-149). Award unclear as to responsible party.  Remand to the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission was necessary to clarify which party was required to pay interest on an award to a benefits claimant; t he order did not specify the party responsible to pay the interest, and the text of the order did not indicate that the procedure in subsection A of § 65.2-1203 was followed. The Uninsured Employers Fund did not simply step into the shoes of the e mployer. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Carter, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2013). Uninsured Employers Fund liable for benefits without apportionment.  Workers Compensation Commission properly ruled that award of lifetime benefits to coal worker should be paid by Uninsured Employers Fund rather than being apportioned between the Fund and the Virginia Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association. The Fund exhibits the indicia of a governmental insurance or guaranty program and therefore falls within the statutory purview of those entities from whi ch recovery must be exhausted before the Guaranty Association is required to make payments. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Flanary, 27 Va. App. 201, 497 S.E.2d 912, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (1998), aff'd, 257 Va. 237, 514 S.E.2d 147, 1999 Va. LEXIS 38 (1999 ). Uninsured Employers Fund liable for benefits assessed against insolvent insurer.  Uninsured Employers Fund was liable for portion of lifetime benefits award originally assessed against insurance company that was solvent on the date coal wor ker was first awarded compensation benefits but became insolvent after the award was entered. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Flanary, 27 Va. App. 201, 497 S.E.2d 912, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (1998), aff'd, 257 Va. 237, 514 S.E.2d 147, 1999 Va. LEXIS 38 (19 99). Uninsured Employers Fund retroactively liable for benefits assessed against bankrupt insurer.  Workers Compensation Commission properly ordered a state fund to pay benefits to a worker after the workers self-insured employer went bankrupt; the commi ssion properly determined that the 1983 amended version of subdivision A 1 of § 65.2-1203 applied retroactively to require the fund to pay the benefits in question. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Duffner, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 299 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 2, 20 05). Uninsured Em ployers Fund not proper party to appeal.  Claimants failure to name a limited liability company (LLC) in his appeal was fatal to the involvement of the Uninsured Employers Fund because any involve ment of the Fund was predicated on an award entered against an employer for compensation benefits; the Fund was involved because the LLC did not have workers compensation insurance, and since no award had been entered against the LLC, it was not requ ired to pay the claimant and was not a proper party. Axelson v. Pifer Constr., Inc., 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 218 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2017). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION A Show Cause hearing is a proceeding independent from a claim brought by an injured worker. A decision to fine an employer for failure to have insurance is not bi nding on a non-party and thus is not res judicata as to those parties. The Uninsured Employers Fund c an raise a jurisdictional defense should a claim be filed and similarly claimant is not barred from bringing a claim if the Show Cause was dismissed. Bowser v. Michael Eugene Boggan, VWC File No. 223-95-20 (June 29, 2006). The 1983 amendment to § 65.1-147, now § 65.2-1201, did not change the substantive rights of the parties, and therefore can be applied retroactively to allow payment of benefits by the Uninsured Employers Fund for a 1978 accident. Duffner v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., VWC File No. 633-069 (Sept. 3, 2004). If the evidence produced at the hearing makes it obvious that the uninsured employer cannot satisfy the Commissions award, it is appropriate for an award to b e issued against the Fund at the same time that the award is entered against the employer. Lawson v. Joe &amp; Joyce Gunner, t/a Family Restaurant, 63 O.I.C. 215 (1984). Deputy Commissioner improperly entered award against Uninsured Employers Fund when only evidence of non-satisfaction of award was employer presidents test imony that employer could probably not pay award; claimant must demand payment from employer prior to Fund making payment on award. Crockett v. Wayne Seagle, VWC File No. 204-44-71 (May 23, 2003). Virginia Code § 38.2-1610 clearly provides that any person having a covered claim against an insolvent insurance carrier must first pursue his recovery through any other solvent carrier. In this case, the claim had been prorated between two employers and carriers. One employers self-insurance association later became insolvent, and its liability was assumed by the Uninsured Employers Fund. The other em ployers carrier also became insolvent, and its liability was assumed by the Guaranty Fund. Because the claimant was able to pursue his claim through other sources [the Uninsured Employers Fund], the Guaranty Fund becomes liable only in the event that the Uninsured Employers Fund does not fully satisfy the award. Flanary v. Moose Coal Co., 76 O.W.C. 119 (1997). There is no obligation on the Uninsured Employers Fund to seek out the bills of medical providers. It is the responsibility of such providers, or the employee or his counsel to submit medical bills as well as medical reports substantiating the treatment to the Fund. Lawson v. Joe &amp; Joyce Gunner, t/a Family Restaurant, 63 O.I.C. 215 (1984). The Uninsured Employers Fund is not subject to the penalty provision of § 65.2-524. Morton v. Henry Davis t/a Davis Asphalt, 71 O.W.C. 309 (1992). Proceedings by the Commission are exempt from the automatic stay in cases where the uninsured employer has filed for bankruptcy. An award was entered against the employer with direction to the Uninsured Employers Fund to pay any compensation and thereafter file a claim in Bankruptcy Court. Fisher v. G. &amp; G. Welding, 63 O.I.C. 119 (1984). Since the Uninsured Employers Fund was established for the sole purpose of insuring payment of compensation benefits to those employees whose employers have f ailed to purchase the required insurance and who are otherwise unable to pay the award, an insured statutory employer is not entitled to reimbursement from the Uninsured Employers Fund for any sums paid on behalf of its uninsured subcontractor.

History History. 1977, c. 345, § 65.1-150; 1991, c. 355. Annotations CASE NOTES Fund not in same position as employer.  Remand to the Virginia Workers Compensation Commission was necessary to clarify which party was required to pay interest on an award to a benefits claimant; t he order did not specify the party responsible to pay the interest, and the text of the order did not indicate that the procedure in subsection A of § 65.2-1203 was followed. The Uninsured Employers Fund did not simply step into the shoes of the e mployer. Uninsured Employer's Fund v. Carter, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 16 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2013). This section and § 65.2-309 .1 distinguished.  While § 65.2-309.1 expressly grants the employer the right of subrogation against proceeds recovered by the injured employee under the uninsured motorist cover age of a policy of insurance provided and paid for by the employer, this section, which defines the funds right of subrogation, makes no reference to claims arising from uninsured motorist coverage. Jeneary v. Commonwealth, 262 Va. 418, 551 S.E.2d 32 1, 2001 Va. LEXIS 106 (2001). Applicability of § 65.2-309.1.  The language of this section neither expressly nor by implication places the fund in the same position as an employer; rather, when the fund is ordered to pay com pensation benefits, its right of subrogation extends to claims the employee may have against the employer or any other party. Accordingly, § 65.2-309.1 is inapplicable to the funds subrogation rights under this section. Jeneary v. Commonwe alth, 262 Va. 418, 551 S.E.2d 321, 2001 Va. LEXIS 106 (2001). Uninsured employers fund was not entitled to a lien against uninsured motorist insur ance proceeds paid to estate administrator to settle wrongful death claim, since insurance company was not an other party, but instead was merely fulfilling a contractual obligation in paying insurance benefits to estate administrator. Jeneary v. Commonwealth, 262 Va. 418, 551 S.E.2d 321, 2001 Va. LEXIS 106 (2001). NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION The Uninsured Employers Fund is subrogated to any right to recover damages that the injured employee may have against his employer or any other party for such injury. Powell v. Up Front Painting, 76 O.W.C. 55 (1997). The limitation period of § 65.1-87 (now § 65.2-601) does not apply to the Commonwealth. Therefore, the Uninsured Employers Fund, as part of its subrogat ion and recoupment authority, may file a workers compensation claim against the direct employer or statutory employer more than two years after the date of the accident. McClanahan v. Liberty Coal Corp., 70 O.I.C. 31 (1991). Liability for compensation or indemnification as a statutory employer under § 65.2-302 exists without reference to its insured status. When both the immediate and the statutory employer are uninsured, a determination should be made as to the liability of each, and they may both be held jointly and severally liable to pay for compensation.

Up Front Painting, 76 O.W.C. 55 (1997).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_65.2-1205"><akn:num>§ 65.2-1205</akn:num><akn:heading>Notification of change in earnings; change in award</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The burden shall be upon the claimant to immediately notify the Commission in writing of any increase or decrease in his earnings.

Annotations NOTES FROM THE WORKE RS COMPENSATION COMMISSION While the Uninsured Employer Fund may seek a credit for payments based on fraud, mistake or unreported change in conditions from future medical costs it is not en titled to a credit against outstanding medical expenses. Morales-Perez v. David Mesemer/Great Falls Lawn &amp; Tree, Inc., VWC File No. 219-70-52 (Oct. 29, 2007). The provision of § 65.2-520 limiting an employers recovery of voluntary payments to a reduction of ongoing weekly benefits by one-fourth, does not apply to claims for recovery of mistaken payments made by the Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF). The General Assembly created § 65.2-1206, which allows the UEF to recover payments made to the employee procured through fraud, mistake or unreported cha nge in condition. The UEFs recovery of mistaken payments under § 65.2-1206 is not limited to a percentage reduction in weekly benefits, but is to be determined by the Commission. In this case, the Commission allowed the UEF to reduce weekly benefi ts by thirty percent until the overpayment was fully recovered. Bullington v.
