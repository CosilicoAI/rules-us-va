CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Request of agency records to calculate child support not allowed.  Because a husband was requesting confidential information from a county agency to help calculate the proper amount of child support payments, the confidentiality of the agencys records was tantamount; therefore, the agencys motion to quash the husbands subpoena duces tecum was granted. Tyson v. Tyson, 69 Va. Cir. 92, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 213 (Fairfax County Sept. 19, 2005). Materiality of information.  In a case in which the Commonwealths Attorney and the Department of Social Services jointly requested the court to quash a subpoena duces tecum filed by defen dant, the court ruled that defendants right to discover exculpatory evidence did not include unsupervised authority to search through the Commonwealths files and make determination as to materiality of information. Commonwealth v. Demchuck, 109 V a. Cir. 129, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 455 (Culpeper County Dec. 6, 2021). Subpoena duces tecum for Department of Family Services records to mitigate punishment quashed.  When defendant had a subpoena duces tecum issued for records of the Department of Family Services regarding abuse or neglect of defendant or defendants siblin gs as mitigating evidence should defendant be convicted of pending criminal charges, the subpoena was quashed because (1) the Department had a duty, under § 63.2-104, to keep the records confidential, and (2) defendants request did not outweigh th is duty, as the duty protected defendants minor siblings, and defendant could not claim a legitimate interest in the records simply because the records might assist defendant in defendants criminal case. Commonwealth v. Williams, 84 Va. Cir. 325, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Fairfax County Feb. 22, 2012). When defendant had a subpoena duces tecum issued for records of the Department of Family Services regarding abuse or neglect of defendant or defendants siblin gs as mitigating evidence should defendant be convicted of pending criminal charges, the subpoena was quashed because (1) defendant improperly requested the subpoenas issuance to obtain Brady material under Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:12, and (2) the Department had a compelling interest in protecting the confidentiality of information concerning social service s to or on behalf of the individuals it served. Commonwealth v. Williams, 84 Va. Cir. 325, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Fairfax County Feb. 22, 2012). Subpoena duces tecum request for forensic interview records.  Parent was not entitled to disclosure of a forensic interview conducted with a juvenile that formed the basis of an ex parte preliminary protective order issued b y a court because the disclosure was not in the childs best interest due to the sensitive nature of the questions and answers and the need to preserve confidentiality. The parents argument that the issuance of a protective order prohibited the pa rent from possession of a firearm in violation of U.S. Const. amend. II did not outweigh the childs best interest. Patton v. Patton, 108 Va. Cir. 175, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 126 (Culpeper County June 2, 2021). Subpoena granted in part and d enied in part.  Department of Social Services (DSS) was allowed to quash a portion of defendants subpoena duces tecum requesting all its records pertaining to the Child Prote ctive Services (CPS) investigation of the alleged victims in the case because, while defendant was not entitled to disclosure of confidential records and information and was barred from access to social services records until a final disposition in the c riminal proceeding, he was entitled to certain information under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act and the constitution pursuant to a protective order that would assure to the extent possible the confidentiality of CPS records and limit disseminati on of that information to its proper use in the defense of the case.

Persons having a legitimate interest in child-protective services records of local departments include, but are not limited to, (i) any person who is responsible for investigating a report of known or suspected abuse or neglect or for providing services to a child or family that is the subject of a report, including multidisc iplinary teams and family assessment and planning teams referenced in subsections J and K of § 63.2-1503, law-enforcement agencies and attorneys for the Commonwealth; (ii) child welfare or human services agencies of the Commonwealth or its political s ubdivisions when those agencies request information to determine the compliance of any person with a child-protective services plan or an order of any court; (iii) personnel of the school or child day program as defined in § 63.2-100 attended by the c hild so that the local department can receive information from such personnel on an ongoing basis concerning the childs health and behavior, and the activities of the childs custodian; (iv) a parent, grandparent, or any other person when such par ent, grandparent or other person would be considered by the local department as a potential caretaker of the child in the event the local department has to remove the child from his custodian; (v) the Commitment Review Committee and the Office of the Att orney General for the purposes of sexually violent predator civil commitments pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 37.2-900 et seq.) of Title 37.2; and (vi) the staff of (a) a court services unit, (b) the Department of Juvenile Justice, (c) a local community serv ices board, or (d) the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services who are providing treatment, services, or care for a child who is the subject of such records for a purpose relevant to the provision of the treatment, services, or care, i ncluding the immediate identification of children who may be receiving or who have received treatment, services, or care from the local agencies and the Department of Juvenile Justice, when the local agencies have entered into a formal agreement with the Department of Juvenile Justice to provide coordinated services to such children, provided that any court services unit or local community services board to which such records are disclosed in accordance with this paragraph shall not further disclose any information received unless such further disclosure is expressly required by law. The model memorandum of understanding developed in accordance with § 66-10.3 may serve as the formal agreement that is required pursuant to this subsection, but any formal agreement that is entered into by the local agencies and the Department of Juvenile Justice shall be reviewed by the Office of the Attorney General before such agreement may take effect. Whenever a local department exercises its discretion to release otherwise confidential information to any person who meets one or more of these descriptions, the local department shall be presumed to have exercised its discretion in a reasonable and lawful manner. B. Any person who has not been legally adopted in accordance with the provisions of this title and who was a child for whom all parental rights and responsibilities have been terminated, shall not have access to any information from a child-placing agency with respect to the identity of the biological family, except (i) upon application of the child who is 18 or more years of age, (ii) upon order of a circuit court entered upon good cause shown, and (iii) after notice to and opportunity for hearing by the applicant f or such order and the child-placing agency or local board that had custody of the child. An eligible person who is a resident of Virginia may apply for the court order provided for herein to (a) the circuit court of the county or city where the person resid es or (b) the circuit court of the county or city where the principal office of the child-placing agency or local board that controls the information sought by the person is located. An eligible person who is not a resident of Virginia shall apply for su ch a court order to the circuit court of the county or city where the principal office of the child-placing agency or local board that controls the information sought by the person is located. If the identity and whereabouts of the biological family are known to the agency or local board, the court may require the agency or local board to advise the biologica l parents of the pendency of the application for such order. In determining good cause for the disclosure of such information, the court shall consider the relative effects of such action upon the applicant for such order and upon the biological parents.

The parents argument that the issuance of a protective order prohibited the pa rent from possession of a firearm in violation of U.S. Const. amend. II did not outweigh the childs best interest.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Immunity from suit for damages.  In his official capacity the Director of the Department of Welfare (now Commissioner of Social Services) is not subject to any suit for damages because he is an o fficer of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Any judgment against him for monetary damages would necessarily have to be satisfied out of the Commonwealths treasury. Such suits against an unconsenting state are barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the Const itution. Wooldridge v. Virginia, 453 F. Supp. 1333, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16450 (E.D. Va. 1978). The Director of the Department of Welfare (now Commissioner of Social Services) was absolutely immune in his individual capacity from any damage action arising ou t of his recommendation regarding a petition for adoption where he was acting pursuant to a valid court directive in preparing and submitting his recommendation to the circuit court. Wooldridge v. Virginia, 453 F. Supp. 1333, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16450 (E.D. Va. 1978). The Commissioners adoption of guidelines interpreting the statute was within his statutory authority. Although the General Assembly did not grant the Commissioner the authority to enact regulations, it did authorize him to supervise the administration of the provisions of this title and . . . [to] see that all laws pertaining to the [DSS] are carried out to their true intent and spirit. The Commissioner has exercised his authority under this section by establishing guidelines to be applied by the local departments of social services throughout the Commonwealth in interpreting t he definitions of abuse and neglect provided by statute. Consequently, the guidelines were adopted pursuant to the Commissioners authority to administer the statute and give effect to its true intent and spirit. Jackson v. W., 14 Va. App. 391, 419 S.

CASE NOTES Mandamus imp roper remedy for discretionary removal.  Mandamus is a proper remedy for reinstating an officeholder wrongly deprived of his office, but mandamus will not lie to undo a discretionary act. Thus, where Cou nty Board of Supervisors exercised the discretion granted to it by the General Assembly in finding that cause existed to remove two members of the County Social Services Board, the trial judge erred in issuing the writ.

CASE NOTES Knowledge.  Because defendant knew that the cash in defendants bank accounts was available not only at the time defendant applied for public assistance benefits, but also during an entire disaster benefit period, defendant knew that a contrary answer to a question on the application was false. Mushaw v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 232 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 18, 2006). Evidence sufficient.  Because defendants address was required on the application for public assistance and required by Title 63.2, the false statement, that defendant resided at th e mothers address in Smithfield, fell squarely under § 63.2-502 and provided support for defendants conviction. Evidence that defendant admitted to living in Newport News rather than at the mothers, that address was listed on an applicatio n to lease furniture, and the phone and utilities were in defendants name supported the finding that defendant resided at the Newport News address. Burrell v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 72, 646 S.E.2d 35, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 243 (2007). Sufficient evidence supported defendants convictions for making a false application for public assistance and obtaining five hundred dollars or more of public assistance by means of false statement or false representation because the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant signed the two interim public assistance reports that were the basis of the convictions, given the trial courts explicit rulin g that the signature on the first interim report was the same as defendants acknowledged signature, along with the circumstantial evidence presented at trial.

C. In cases in which information obtained as a result of the investigation required by subsection A is inconsistent with information provided by the applicant at the time of application or otherwise suggests that the applicant may not be eligible for public assistance , the local director shall notify the applicant in writing and provide opportunity for the applicant to explain the discrepancy. If the applicant fails to respond within 10 days of the date of such notice, the local director shall deny the application fo r public assistance.

D. The Departm ent shall establish a means to obtain and provide the data necessary for the local departments to conduct the search required by subsection B in an automated electronic format. In doing so, the Department may use a third-party contractor.

The amount of public assistance any person receives under the provisions of this subtitle shall be determined according to Board regulations with regard to (i) the prop erty and income of the person and any support he receives from other sources, including from persons legally responsible for his support, and (ii) the average cost of providing public assistance statewide. It shall be sufficient to provide public assista nce that, when added to all other income and support of the recipient (exclusive of that not to be taken into account as hereinafter provided), provides such person with a reasonable subsistence. In determining the income of and support available to a pe rson, the amount of income required to be exempted by federal statute, or if the federal statute makes such exemption permissive, then such portion thereof as may be determined by the Board shall not be considered in determining the amount of assistance any person may receive under this subtitle.

CASE NOTES Evidence of prior conviction.  Evidence concerning the prior conviction of a defendant for a recent and similar offense in a prosecution under this section was admissible for the purpose of sho wing fraudulent intent. Brooks v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 405, 258 S.E.2d 504, 1979 Va. LEXIS 273 (1979) (decided under prior law). Evidence of welfare fraud.  Court of Appeals properly upheld defendants convictions for welfare fraud because applying an earned income deduction the income defendant failed to report wo uld not have reduced the total overpayment for each indictment period to less than $200, and a housing deduction would not have reduced the total overpayment for the first period to less than $200. Jefferson v. Commonwealth, 298 Va. 1, 833 S.E.2d 462, 20 19 Va. LEXIS 134 (2019). Evidence sufficient.  Convictions for making a false application for welfare under § 63.2-502, and welfare fraud under § 63.2-522, were supported by evidence that defendant did n ot reside at the mothers house, as shown by the fact that the phone and utilities at other address were in defendants name, and that defendant knew defendant was supplying a false address on the application for public assistance. Burrell v. Commo nwealth, 50 Va. App. 72, 646 S.E.2d 35, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 243 (2007). In a case in which defendant was convicted of two counts of felony welfare fraud, the trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to strike as the ev idence was sufficient to prove that she received overpayments of $200 or more during each of the periods covered by her two indictments because the Department of Social Servicess overpayment calculations reflected excess Supplemental Nutrition Assist ance Program (SNAP) benefits of $1,900 during the period covered by defendants first indictment, and $1,517 during the period covered by appellants second indictment; and defendants undisclosed income was not eligible to receive a 20% earned income deduction for purposes of calculating SNAP benefits. Jefferson v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 20, 2018), vacated in part, aff'd, 298 Va. 1, 833 S.E.2d 462, 2019 Va. LEXIS 134 (2019). Sufficient evidence supported defendants convictions for making a false application for public assistance and obtaining five hundred dollars or more of public assistance by means of false statement or false representation because the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant signed the two interim public assistance reports that were the basis of the convictions, given the trial courts explicit rulin g that the signature on the first interim report was the same as defendants acknowledged signature, along with the circumstantial evidence presented at trial.

A person sh all be eligible for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families if that person: 1. Has n ot attained the age of 18 years, or, if a full-time student in a secondary school or in the equivalent level of career and technical education, has not attained the age of nineteen years; 2. Is a resident of Virginia; 3. Is living with his father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, or niece in a residenc e maintained by such relative or is in placement under conditions specified by the Board; 4. Is in need of public assistance; and 5. If less than 18 years of age, is in compliance with compulsory school attendance laws (§ 22.1-254 et seq.) as described in § 63.2-606. Prior to imposing a sanction of benefits, t he local department shall make reasonable efforts to discuss with the parent or caretaker, by personal contact that may include direct telephone contact, a plan to return the child to school. If such efforts fail, the local department shall mail a writte n advance notice of proposed action to the parent or caretaker advising that benefits may be reduced if the parent or caretaker fails to contact the local department to develop a plan to return the child to school. B. An applican t for TANF shall: 1. Furni sh, apply for or have an application made on his behalf, and on behalf of all children for whom assistance is being requested, for a social security account number to be used in the administration of the program; 2. Assign the Commonwealth any rights to support from any other person such applicant may have on his own behalf or on behalf of any other family member for whom the applicant is applying for or receiving aid, except for any support that accrued prior to the execution of the assignment; 3. Identify the parents of the child for whom aid is claimed, subject to the good cause provisions or exceptions in federal law or regulations. However, this requirement shall not apply if the child is in a foster care placement or if the local department determines, based upon the sworn statement of the applicant or recipient or of another person with knowledge of the circumstances, that the child was conceived as the result of incest or rape; and 4. Cooperate in (i) locating the parent of the child with respect to whom TANF is claimed, (ii) establishing the paternity of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom TANF is clai med, (iii) obtaining support payments for such applicant or recipient and for a child with respect to whom TANF is claimed, and (iv) obtaining any other payments or property due such applicant or recipient for such child.Any applicant or recipient who in tentionally misidentifies another person as a parent shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. C. Unless an e xception to the requirement set forth in subdivision B 3 applies, the Departments Division of Child Support Enforcement shall proceed to determine parentage pursuant to Chapter 3.1 (§ 20-49.1 et seq.) of Title 20. If paternity is not established a fter six months of receipt of TANF, the case shall be reviewed to determine the reason that paternity has not been established. If paternity has not been established due to the caretaker relatives noncooperation, the local department may suspend the entire grant or the adult portion of the grant, subject to Board regulations. D. TANF shall be provided to two-parent families on the same terms and conditions that TANF is provided to single-parent families. History History.

For related discussion, see 14A M.J. Parent and Child, § 10. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Construction of provisions.  Former §§ 63.1-105 and 63.1-109 (see now §§ 63.2-504, 63.2-614, and this section) when read with portions of the 1981 biennial appropriations act, wer e not rendered ambiguous, but rather, were clear and unambiguous, thus precluding use of unpublished legislative history to construe the enactments, and invalidating a regulation of the State Board of Welfare (now State Board of Social Services) which th e Board felt implemented the supposed intent of the General Assembly to defund Aid to Dependent Children coverage for students between the ages of 18 and 21. Brown v. Lukhard, 229 Va. 316, 330 S.E.2d 84, 1985 Va. LEXIS 208 (1985). States are not free to arbitrarily exclude people under the state act who are covered under the federal act. Lawson v. Brown, 349 F. Supp. 203, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11602 (W.D. Va. 1972). State standard excluding persons eligible under federal standards is invalid.  A state eligibility standard that excludes persons eligible for assistance under federal standards violates the Social Security Act and is therefore invalid. Laws on v. Brown, 349 F. Supp. 203, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11602 (W.D. Va. 1972). State may refuse to grant aid for emancipated children.  An emancipated child is not included within the definition of a dependent child for welfare purposes. Therefore, a state may choose to refuse aid to the families of such children for the benefit of these children. Lawson v. Brown, 349 F. Supp. 203, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11602 (W.D. Va. 1972). Marriage of a minor child, even if not consented to by the parents, emancipates the minor child from his parents. Lawson v. Brown, 349 F. Supp. 203, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11602 (W.D. Va. 1972). Adequate notice and opportunity for prior hearing.  Welfare recipients must be given adequate notice of any proposed action affecting them adversely and an opportunity for a prior hearing on the matter. Where it is shown that the system designed to provide the opportunity for such hearing has purposely built into it a procedure intended to deter the exercise of that right and a sufficient possibility exists that undue influence might be used as the deterring facto r, due process is lacking. Burgoyne v. Lukhard, 363 F. Supp. 831, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12068 (E.D. Va. 1973). Federal court lacks jurisdiction of claim for restitution of retroactive welfare payments against defendant state officials in their representative capacities, since the suit would in effect be a suit against the state itself. Frye v. Lukehard, 364 F. Supp. 1379, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11852 (W.D. Va. 1973). In suit for retroactive payments, a federal court will be barred by the Eleventh Amendment from a decree of restitution, as such would necessitate a state appropriation and would be, in effect, an order to the state to take affirmative political action to which it has not consented.

However, if an eligible child has not received immunizations in accordance with § 32.1-46, verification shall be provided at the next sc heduled redetermination of eligibility for TANF after initial eligibility is granted that the child has received at least one dose of each of the immunizations required by § 32.1-46 as appropriate for the childs age and that the childs physici an or the local health department has developed a plan for completing the immunizations. Verification of compliance with the plan for completing the immunizations shall be presented at subsequent redeterminations of eligibility for TANF. If necessary, the local department shall provide assistance to the TANF recipient in obtaining verification from immunization providers. No sanction may be imposed unti l the reason for the failure to comply with the immunization requirement has been identified and any barriers to accessing immunizations have been removed. Failure by the recipient to provide the required verification of immunizations shall result in a reduction in the amount of monthly assistance received from the TANF pr ogram until the required verification is provided. The reduction shall be $50 for the first child and $25 for each additional child for whom verification is not provided.

The Departm ent shall establish and administer the Virginia Initiative for Education and Work (VIEW) to reduce long-term dependence on welfare, emphasize personal responsibility, and enhance opportunities for personal initiative and self-sufficiency by promoting the value of work. The Department shall endeavor to develop placements for VIEW participants that will enable participants to develop job skills that are likely to result in independent employment and that take into consideration the proficiency, experience , skills, and prior training of a participant. VIEW shall recognize clearly defined responsibilities and obligations on the part of public assistance recipients and shall include a written agreement of personal resp onsibility requiring parents to participate in work activities while receiving TANF, earned-income disregards to reduce disincentives to work, and a limit on TANF financial assistance. VIEW shall require all able-bodied recipients of TANF who do not meet an exemption to participate in a work activity. VIEW shall require eligible TANF recipients to par ticipate in unsubsidized, partially subsidized or fully subsidized employment or other allowable TANF work activity as defined by federal law and enter into an agreement of personal responsibility. B. To the maxi mum extent permitted by federal law, and notwithstanding other provisions of Virginia law, the Department and local departments may, through applicable procurement laws and regulations, engage the services of public and private organizations to operate V IEW and to provide services incident to such operation. C. All VIEW pa rticipants shall be under the direction and supervision of a case manager. D. The Departm ent shall ensure that participants are assigned to one of the following work activities within 90 days after the approval of TANF assistance: 1. Unsub sidized private-sector employment; 2. Subsidized employment, as follows: a. The Department shall conduct a program in accordance with this section that shall be known as the Full Employment Program (FEP). Persons who are otherwise eligible for TANF may participate in FEP unless exempted by this chapter. FEP shall assign particip ants to subsidized wage-paying private-sector jobs designed to increase the participants self-sufficiency and improve their competitive position in the workforce. b. Participants in FEP shall be placed in full-time employment when appropriate and shall be paid by the employer at an hourly rate not less than the federal or state minimum wage, w hichever is higher. Wages earned by a FEP employee during the period for which his employer receives a subsidy pursuant to subdivision c shall be disregarded in the calculation of TANF benefits. c. Every employer subject to the Virginia unemployment insurance tax shall be eligible for assignment of FEP participants, but no employer shall be required to utilize such participa nts. Pursuant to Board regulations, participating employers shall receive a subsidy of up to $1,000 per month for each FEP employee for a period not to exceed six months. Employers shall ensure that jobs made available to FEP participants are in conformi ty with § 3304(a)(5) of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act. FEP participants cannot be used to displace regular workers. d. FEP employers shall: (i) Endeavor to make FEP placements positive learning and training experiences; (ii) Provide on-the-job training to the degree necessary for the participants to perform their duties; (iii) Pay wages to participants at the same rate that they are paid to other employees performing the same type of work and having similar experience and employment tenure; (iv) Provide sick leave, holiday and vacation benefits to participants to the same extent and on the same basis that they are provided to other employees performing the sa me type of work and having similar employment experience and tenure; (v) Maintain health, safety and working conditions at or above levels generally acceptable in the industry and no less than those in which other employees perform the sam e type of work; (vi) Provide workers compensation coverage for participants; (vii) Encourage volunteer mentors from among their other employees to assist participants in becoming oriented to work and the workplace; and (viii) Sign an agreement with the local department outlining the employer requirements to participate in FEP.

Placements sh all be selected to provide skills and serve a public function. VIEW participants shall not displace regular workers. b. The number of hours per week for participants shall be determined by combining the total dollar amount of TANF and SNAP benefits and dividing by the minimum wage with a maximum of a work week of 32 hours, of which up to 12 hours of employment-related education and training may substitute for work experience employment; or 5. Any other allowable TANF work activity as defined by federal law. E. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsections A and D, if a local department determines that a VIEW participant is in need of job skills and would benefit from immediate job skills training, it may place the participant in a program preparing individuals for a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board of Education, a career and technical education program targeted at skills required for particular employment opportunities, or an apprenticeship program developed by the local department in accordance with requirements established by the Department. Eligible participants include those with problems related to obtaining and retaining employment, such as participants (i) with less than a high school education, (ii) whose reading or math skills are at o r below the eighth grade level, (iii) who have not retained a job for a period of at least six months during the prior two years, or (iv) who are in a treatment program for a substance abuse problem or are receiving services through a family violence tre atment program. The VIEW participant may continue in a high school equivalency examination preparation program, career and technical education program, or apprenticeship program for as long as the local department determines he is progressing satisfactor ily and to the extent permitted by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-193), as amended. F. Participant s may be reevaluated after a period determined by the local department and reassigned to another work component.

VIEW partic ipants shall not be assigned to projects that require that they travel unreasonable distances from their homes or remain away from their homes overnight without their consent. Any injury to a VIEW participant arising out of and in the course of community work experience shall be covered by the participants existing Medicaid coverage. If a community work experience participant is unable to work due to such an accident, his status shall be reviewed to determine whether he is eligible for an exemption from the limitation on TANF financial assistance. A community work experience participant who becomes incapacitated for 30 days or more shall be eligible for TANF financial assistance for the duration of the incapacity , if otherwise eligible. The Board shall adopt regulations providing for the accrual of paid sick leave or other equivalent mechanism for community work experience participants.

Children's Home Soc'y of Va., Inc., 158 Va. 406, 163 S.E. 399, 1932 Va. LEXIS 265 (1932). This section is one of many safeguards for the care of state wards committed to child-placing agencies, and applies only between the party receiving the temporary custody of such a ward from an agency and the agency. Turner v. Children's Home Soc'y of Va., Inc., 158 Va. 406, 163 S.E. 399, 1932 Va. LEXIS 265 (1932). And such an agency is not vested with sole discretion as to interests of child.  A former similar statute very similar to this section did not delegate to a child-placing agency the sole discretion of what is for the best interests of the chil d. The opinion of the agency was binding only in jurisdictions other than that of the committing court. The final determination of the welfare of a ward of the State is in the court under whose guardianship it remains. Turner v. Children's Home Soc'y of Va., Inc., 158 Va. 406, 163 S.E. 399, 1932 Va.

Whenever a local board accepts custody of a child pursuant to an entrustment agreement entered into under the authority of § 63.2-900, or a licensed child-placing agency accepts custody of a child pursuant to an entrustment agreement entered into under the autho rity of § 63.2-1817, in the city or county juvenile and domestic relations district court a petition for approval of the entrustment agreement (i) shall be filed within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 89 days after the execution of an entru stment agreement for less than 90 days, if the child is not returned to his home within that period; (ii) shall be filed within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days after the execution of an entrustment agreement for 90 days or longer or fo r an unspecified period of time, if such entrustment agreement does not provide for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child; and (iii) may be filed in the case of a permanent entrustment agreement which provi des for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child. B. For purpose s of §§ 63.2-900, 63.2-1817 and this section, a parent who is less than 18 years of age shall be deemed fully competent and shall have legal capacity to execute a valid entrustment agreement, including an agreement that provides for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities, and shall be as fully bound thereby as if such parent had attained the age of 18 years.

An entrustment agreement for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child shall be valid notwithstanding that it is not signed by the father of a child born out of wedlock if the identity of the fathe r is not reasonably ascertainable, or if such father is given notice of the entrustment by registered or certified mail to his last known address and fails to object to the entrustment within 15 days of mailing of such notice. An affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of this fact, provided there is no other evidence that would refute such an affidavit. The absence of such an affidavit shall not be deemed evidence that the ide ntity of the father is reasonably ascertainable. For purposes of determining whether the identity of the father is reasonably ascertainable, the standard of what is reasonable under the circumstances shall control, taking into account the relative intere sts of the child, the mother and the father.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Parental rights of natural father must be considered before adoption.  Subsection C of this section by its very terms recognizes that the unmarried natural father has parental rights, though limited, which must be considered and deal t with by means of due process before the child can be adopted. Augusta County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Unnamed Mother, 3 Va. App. 40, 348 S.E.2d 26, 3 Va. Law Rep. 386, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 332 (1986). Fathers rights cannot be terminated without notice.  Where the mother knows the identity of the father but refuses to reveal his identity, the fathers rights in the child attach and cannot be terminated without due process notice. Augusta County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Unnamed Mother, 3 Va. App. 40, 348 S.E.2d 26, 3 Va. Law Rep. 386, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 332 (1986). Order of publication to notify father who is not identified by mother.  Where unnamed mother entered into an entrustment agreement for the adoption of her child, but refused to reveal fathers identity, proper course for the circui t court was to enter an appropriate order of publication after granting the mother a reasonable opportunity to reveal the identity of the father so that notice of the entrustment agreement could be given to him pursuant to law.

Constructive notice not required.  Where the identity of the parent whose parental rights are to be terminated is unknown and not reasonably ascertainable, based on the statutory standard of this s ection, subsection C of § 16.1-283 does not require constructive notice to such parent. Rather, where the court finds upon clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interests of the child and that the child has been in foster care for a per iod of 12 months without contact by the unknown parent, the parental rights of such parent may be terminated.

Intervention by Commissioner; corrective action plans; assumption of temporary control. Text A. The Commiss ioner shall have the authority to create and enforce a corrective action plan for any local board that, in the Commissioners discretion, (i) fails to provide foster care services or make placement and removal decisions in accordance with this title o r Board regulations or (ii) takes any action or fails to act in a manner that poses a substantial risk to the health, safety, or well-being of any child under its supervision and control. The corrective action plan shall (a) include specific objectives t hat the local board must meet in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and ensure the health, safety, and well-being of all children in its supervision and control and (b) set the date by which such objectives must be completed, which shal l not extend beyond 90 days after implementation of the corrective action plan unless the Commissioner determines that the objectives of the corrective action plan cannot be reasonably accomplished within such time frame. During the time the corrective a ction plan is in effect, the Commissioner may direct Department staff to provide assistance to the local board, monitor its progress in meeting the objectives stated in the plan, and take any measures necessary to protect the health, safety, and well-bei ng of children in the local boards supervision and control. The Commissioner shall provide regular updates to the chairman of the Board, chairman of the local board, and local director regarding the local boards progress in meeting the objectives of the corrective action plan.Prior to implementing a corrective action plan, the Commissioner shall provide written notice of his intent to implement the corrective action plan and the reasons for which such plan was developed to the chairman of the Bo ard, chairman of the local board, and local director. Upon request by the chairman of the Board, chairman of the local board, or local director, the Commissioner shall hold a hearing to determine whether a corrective action plan is appropriate. B. If the loca l board fails to timely comply with the corrective action plan, the Commissioner shall have the authority to temporarily assume control over all or part of the local boards foster care services and associated funds. Upon assuming such control, the Co mmissioner may utilize Department staff or contract with private entities to provide foster care services in the locality served by the local board and manage funds appropriated for such purposes. For any period during which a local board is under the Co mmissioners control, the Commissioner shall work with the local board and local director to make any adjustments necessary to facilitate the local boards resumption of control over its foster care services and funds. The Commissioner shall remit control of such foster care services and funds to the local board upon determining that the local board has made all adjustments necessary to ensure that foster care services are provided in compliance with state and federal law and regulations and in a manner that adequately protects the health, safety, and well-being of all children in its supervision and control. C. Whenever th e Commissioner assumes temporary control over a local boards foster care services and funds pursuant to this section, the amount of local funding made available for such services shall remain equal to or greater than the amounts available immediately prior to the Commissioners assumption of temporary control. Additionally, the locality in which the local board is located shall be required to pay the local share of any costs associated with any services necessary to align the local boards fos ter care services with state and federal laws and regulations.

Permanent f oster care placement means the place in which a child has been placed pursuant to the provisions of §§ 63.2-900, 63.2-903 and this section with the expectation and agreement between the placing agency and the place of permanent foster care that the child shall remain in the placement until he reaches the age of majority unless modified by court order or unless removed pursuant to § 16.1-251 or § 63.2-1517. A permanent foster care placement may be a place of residence of any natural person or persons deemed appropriate to meet a childs needs on a long-term basis. B. A local dep artment or a licensed child-placing agency shall have authority pursuant to a court order to place a child who is 16 years of age or older over whom it has legal custody in a permanent foster care placement where the child shall remain until attaining ma jority or thereafter, until the age of 21 years, if such placement is a requisite to providing funds for the care of such child, so long as the child is a participant in an educational, treatment or training program approved pursuant to regulations of th e Board. No such child shall be removed from the physical custody of the foster parents in the permanent care placement except upon order of the court or pursuant to § 16.1-251 or § 63.2-1517. The department or agency so placing a child shall retai n legal custody of the child. A court shall not order that a child be placed in permanent foster care unless it finds that (i) diligent efforts have been made by the local department to place the child with his natural parents and such efforts have been unsuccessful, and (ii) diligent efforts have been made by the local department to place the child for adoption and such efforts have been unsuccessful or adoption is not a reasonable alternative for a long-term placement for the child under the circumsta nces. C. Unless modi fied by the court order, the foster parent in the permanent foster care placement shall have the authority to consent to surgery, entrance into the armed services, marriage, application for a motor vehicle and drivers license, application for admissi on into an institution of higher education, and any other such activities that require parental consent and shall have the responsibility for informing the placing department or agency of any such actions. D. Any child p laced in a permanent foster care placement by a local department shall, with the cooperation of the foster parents with whom the permanent foster care placement has been made, receive the same services and benefits as any other child in foster care pursu ant to §§ 63.2-319, 63.2-900 and 63.2-903 and any other applicable provisions of law. E. The Board s hall establish minimum standards for the utilization, supervision and evaluation of permanent foster care placements. F. The rate of payment for permanent foster care placements by a local department shall be in accordance with standards and rates established by the Board. The rate of payment for such placements by other licensed child-placing agencies shall be in accordance with sta ndards and rates established by the individual agency. G. If the chil d has a continuing involvement with his natural parents, the natural parents should be involved in the planning for a permanent placement. The court order placing the child in a permanent placement shall include a specification of the nature and frequenc y of visiting arrangements with the natural parents. H. Any change in the placement of a child in permanent foster care or the responsibilities of the foster parents for that child shall be made only by order of the court which ordered the placement pursuant to a petition filed by the foster parents, local department, l icensed child-placing agency or other appropriate party.

Virginia Forms (Matthew Bender). No. 5-290 Permanent Foster Care Placement Order. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. This section provides statutory scheme for permanent foster care placement. That scheme is intended to provide a more permanent placement for a child in a particular foster home than is generally obtained in regular foster care, and yet does not, as in the case of adoption proceedings, serve as a vehicle for terminating parental rights. Mar tin v. Pittsylvania County Dep't of Social Servs., 3 Va. App. 15, 348 S.E.2d 13, 3 Va. Law Rep. 359, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (1986). Permanent foster care is distinct and secondary alternative to adoption.  A petition for permanent foster care is not a less drastic alternative to termination of parental rights. The court can only consider permanent foster care after it has determined that adoption, upon termination of residual parental rights, is not an alternative in a given case. Given this statutory preference, permanent foster care is a distinct, and secondary, alternative to adoption. Stanley v. Fairfax Count y Dep't of Social Servs., 10 Va. App. 596, 395 S.E.2d 199, 7 Va. Law Rep. 59, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 129 (1990), aff'd, 242 Va. 60, 405 S.E.2d 621, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2823, 1991 Va. LEXIS 106 (1991). Other appropriate party includes the natural parent. Martin v. Pittsylvania Count y Dep't of Social Servs., 3 Va. App. 15, 348 S.E.2d 13, 3 Va. Law Rep. 359, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (1986). Court lacked jurisdiction ab sent petition.  The trial court lacked jurisdiction to order a placement in permanent foster care pursuant to this section where trial court had no petition before it seeking a p ermanent foster care placement. Martin v. Pittsylvania County Dep't of Social Servs., 3 Va. App. 15, 348 S.E.2d 13, 3 Va. Law Rep. 359, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (1986). Where the natural parent is not given specific notice by a petition seeking a specific placement, and where substantial parental rights are at stake, a trial cour t has no jurisdiction to enter sua sponte an order terminating or reducing those parental rights. Martin v. Pittsylvania County Dep't of Social Servs., 3 Va. App. 15, 348 S.E.2d 13, 3 Va. Law Rep. 359, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (1986). Burden of proof.  Statutory requirements of subsection A of former § 63.1-206.1 (see now subsection B of § 63.2-908) must be proved by a preponderance of evidence. Hash v. Ca mpbell County Dep't of Social Servs., 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 605 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 26, 1999). No change can occur in permanent foster care placement without order of the court which instituted the placement. A proper petition, filed by the foster parents, local department, licensed child-placing agency or other appropriate party, is required for such a change. Martin v. Pittsylvania County Dep't of Social Servs., 3 Va. App. 15, 348 S.E.2d 13, 3 Va. Law Rep. 359, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (1986). Permanent foster placement proper.  Trial court had little choice but to approve a permanent foster care plan placement for the minor child. The father was incarcerated and the mother was unfit, whi ch made the preferred placement with the natural parents as contemplated by subsection B of § 63.2-908 an impossibility, and the trial court could not order adoption under that statute since the minor child would have to be removed from the foster fam ily with whom the child was thriving. Rader v. Goochland County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 446 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 7, 2008). Order placing the mothers three sons in permanent foster care was supported by evidence of the mothers inability to adequately parent, and the fact that t he sons were doing well in a foster home that offered to have the sons remain until they each reached 18 years of age. Davila v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 434 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2010). Because a fathers history of mental illness, and his pattern of behavior indicated an unwillingness to ensure that his child was surrounded by responsible adu lt figures, termination of his parental rights and a permanent foster care placement with the goal of adoption under §§ 16.1-283 and 63.2-908 were appropriate. Mongold v. Harrisonburg Rockingham Soc. Servs. Dist., 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 73 (Va. Ct. Ap p. Mar. 1, 2011). Failure to comply with statutory requirements.  Fathers motion to change the foster care plans goal to adoption and terminate his parental rights did not comply with the statutory scheme to terminate hi s parental rights and approve a goal of adoption because the father only recited facts and argument as to why the court had to terminate his parental rights and change the foster care plan goal to adoption. Cisneros v. Arlington County Dep't of Human Ser vs., 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 11, 2016). Petition for termination of parental rights pursuant to § 16.1-283 does not encompass a petition for permanent foster care .  The latter is not a less drastic form of the former, but rather is a different and distinct alternative. Martin v. Pittsylvania County Dep't of Social Servs., 3 V a. App. 15, 348 S.E.2d 13, 3 Va. Law Rep. 359, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 329 (1986). Trial courts denial of a petition to terminate a mothers parental rights to be followed by adoption did not result in an impermissible de facto permanent foster care placement, since the division of social services never presented the court with a petition for permanent foster care.

At th e option of the local board, the child is being cared for by a relative; 2. The local board has determined that the filing of such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child and has documented a compelling reason for such determination in the c hilds foster care plan, such as (i) a relative has shown the will and ability to care for the child or (ii) the parents incarceration or participation in a court-ordered residential substance abuse treatment program constitutes the primary factor in the childs placement in foster care, and termination of parental rights is not in the childs best interests; or 3.

(b) The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compl iance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child. (c) The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis of which to evaluate a projected placement before it is ma de. (d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.As used in this compact: ARTICLE II. Definitions.

(a) No s ending agency shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein. (b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending age ncy shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain: (1) The name, date and place of birth of the child. (2) The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian. (3) The name and address of the person, agency or institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring, or place the child.

(c) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency wit hout relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof. ARTICLE VI. Institutional Care of Delinquent Children. A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact but no such placement shall be made unless the chi ld is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to his being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds that: 1.

Flanary, 185 Va. 409, 38 S.E.2d 4 33, 1946 Va. LEXIS 210 (1946); McFadden v. McNorton, 193 Va. 455, 69 S.E.2d 445, 1952 Va. LEXIS 154 (1952) (decided under prior law). Which is to be liberally construed.  Since the statutes relating to adoption confer a beneficial interest they are to be liberally construed, particularly in a contest between the adopted son and the estate of his intestate foster parents; to a less extent when the contest is between the adopted son and the estate of some remote ancestor by adoption. Fletcher v. Flanary, 185 Va. 409, 38 S.E.2d 433, 1946 Va. LEXIS 210 (1946) (decided under prior law ). Adoption statutes should be liberally construed to carry out the beneficent purposes of the adoption institution, and to protect the adopted child in the rights a nd privileges acquired by it as a result of the adoption. McFadden v. McNorton, 193 Va. 455, 69 S.E.2d 445, 1952 Va. LEXIS 154 (1952) (decided under prior law). Attorneys fees.  There was no statute specifically authorizing an award of attorneys fees in an adoption proceeding under Chapter 12; to the extent the trial court relied on a ny such specific statutory authorization in awarding attorneys fees to appellee, it erred. Pellek v. Byers, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 506 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 18, 2008). § 63.2-1200.1. Recognition of foreign adoption; issuance of birth certificates. Text A. Any adoptio n of a child who was born in a foreign country and who was not a citizen of the United States at the time of birth shall, subject to the provisions of subsection D of § 63.2-1201.1, be recognized by the Commonwealth and the rights and obligations of t he parties shall be determined as though the order of adoption was entered by a court of the Commonwealth if the adoption was finalized pursuant to the laws of the country from which the child was adopted, and the child was admitted to the United States with an IR-3 or IH-3 visa issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. In such cases, the adoptive parents shall not be required to readopt the child in Virginia. B. In cases in which an adoption of a child was finalized pursuant to the laws of a foreign country and the child was admitted to the United States with an IR-3 or IH-3 visa, the adoptive parents, if residents of the Commonwealth at the time the adoption was finalized , may submit a report of adoption to the State Registrar of Vital Records on a form furnished by the State Registrar, which shall (i) include evidence as to the date, place of birth, and parentage of the adopted person; (ii) provide information necessary to establish a new certificate of birth for the adopted person; (iii) include a certified or notarized copy of the final order of adoption entered by the foreign court, together with a certified translation or a notarized copy of a certified translation of the final order of adoption in cases in which the original order is not in English; and (iv) include an affidavit from the adoptive parents indicating that they are receiving supervision from a licensed or approved child-placing agency in the United States or have received supervision from a licensed or approved child-placing agency in the United States and have satisfied all post-adoption requirements as required by the foreign country from which the child was adopted. Upon receipt of a report purs uant to this subsection, the State Registrar shall establish a new certificate of birth for the adopted person, and such certificate of birth shall be registered in accordance with the provisions of § 32.1-261.

Such petition may be filed by any natura l person who resides in the Commonwealth, or who has custody of a child placed by a child-placing agency of the Commonwealth, or by an adopting parent of a child who was subject to a consent proceeding held pursuant to § 63.2-1233, or by intended pare nts who are parties to a surrogacy contract. The petition shall ask leave to adopt a minor child not legally the petitioners by birth and, if it is so desired by the petitioner, also to change the name of such child. In the case of married persons, o r persons who were previously married who are permitted to adopt a child under § 63.2-1201.1, the petition shall be the joint petition of the husband and wife or former spouses but, in the event the child to be adopted is legally the child by birth or adoption of one of the petitioners, such petitioner shall unite in the petition for the purpose of indicating consent to the prayer thereof only. If any procedural provision of this chapter applies to only one of the adoptive parents, then the court may waive the application of the procedural provision for the spouse of the adoptive parent to whom the provision applies. The petition shall contain a full disclosure of the circumstances under which the child came to live, and is living, in the home of th e petitioner. Each petition for adoption shall be signed by the petitioner as well as by counsel of record, if any. In any case in which the petition seeks the entry of an adoption order without referral for investigation, the petition shall be under oat h. A single petition for adoption under the provisions of this section shall be sufficient for the concurrent adoption by the same petitioners of two or more children who have the same birth parent or parents, and nothing in this section shall be construed as having heretofore required a separate petition for each of such children. The petition for adoption, except those filed pursuant to subdivisions 4 and 5 of § 63.2-1210, shall include an additional $50 filing fee that shall be used to fund the Virginia Birth Father Registry established in Article 7 (§ 63.2-1249 et seq.) of this chapter. A petition filed while the child is under 18 years of age shall not become invalid because the child reaches 18 years of age prior to the entry of a final order of adop tion. Any final order of adoption entered pursuant to § 63.2-1213 after a child reaches 18 years of age, where the petition was filed prior to the child turning 18 years of age, shall have the same effect as if the child was under 18 years of age at t he time the order was entered by the circuit court provided the court has obtained the consent of the adoptee.

CASE NOTES Ma n may adopt child born to wife by artificial insemination.  A man by proceeding in accordance with this section may adopt a child born to his wife by artificial insemination with a third party donors sperm. Welborn v. Doe, 10 Va. App. 631, 394 S.E.2d 732, 7 Va. Law Rep. 133, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 139 (1990) (decided under prior law). Jurisdiction over adoption petition.  Adoptive parents failure to timely appeal the juvenile courts visitation order was of no legal consequence because there was no need for them to file a se parate pleading to seek the termination of biological grandparents visitation when entry of the order of adoption divested the grandparents of any right to visitation; the petition for adoption necessarily implied a question of the grandparents o ngoing visitation, and the circuit court had jurisdiction to entertain the petition. Harvey v. Flockhart, 65 Va. App. 131, 775 S.E.2d 427, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 247 (2015). Because a juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) district court had no jurisdiction to hear a petition related to consent for adoption that was not a parental plac ement adoption, a circuit court had no subject matter jurisdiction at all to hear the appeal as the circuit court had no more subject matter jurisdiction than the JDR district court had in that courts original proceeding. Knight v. Ottrix, 69 Va. App . 519, 820 S.E.2d 411, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 312 (2018). Circuit court had jurisdiction to considered the foster parents petition for adoption because it was not a case of parental placement for adoption and neither biological parent consented to the adoption, and therefore adoption had to be instituted by petition to a circuit court of proper venue, and the foster parents properly filed their petition in the county circuit court in which they resided. Coward v. Jo seph, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 145 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 3, 2021). Court not divested of jurisdiction.  Revocation of consent to adoption after petition for adoption had been filed was ineffective to divest court of jurisdiction, which had attached as of the date of filing the petition for adoption. Szemler v. Clements, 214 Va. 639, 202 S.E.2d 880, 1974 Va. LEXIS 191 (1974) (decided under prior law). Petition must be joined by spouse.  The statute requires a trial judge to dismiss a petition for adoption if the spouse of a married petitioner does not join in the petition. Sozio v. Thorpe, 22 Va . App. 271, 469 S.E.2d 68, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 267 (1996) (decided under prior law). Standing to file adoption petition.  Circuit court erred by determining that former foster parents lacked standing to file adoption petition for their former foster child because the foster parents w ere natural persons residing in the Commonwealth; while the foster parents could or could not be successful on the merits of their adoption petition, they had standing to file their petition pursuant to the broad language of the statute. Yokshas v. Bristol City Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 286 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Waiver of consent.  Motion filed by a mother and father to dismiss foster parents adoption petition was granted because the case did not involve a parental placement within the m eaning of §§ 63.2-1230 to 63.2-1240 when the custody order did not mention any placement for the purpose of foster care or adoption, and neither birth parent placed the child with the foster parents for adoption, and subsection H of § 63.2-1202 did not apply; a petition for adoption must be filed in circuit court, § 63.2-1201, which can waive consent when an adoption petition has been filed and the birth parent has failed to contact or visit the child within the six months preceding the fili ng of the petition, but this section does not authorize the juvenile and domestic relations district court to waive consent based on the birth parent or parents failure to maintain contact, before any petition for adoption is filed. In re Terry, 78 V a. Cir. 25, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 272 (Henrico County Nov. 13, 2008). § 63...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_63.2-1202"><akn:num>§ 63.2-1202</akn:num><akn:heading>Parental, or agency, consent required; exceptions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. No petition for adoption shall be granted, except as hereinafter provided in this section, unless written consent to the proposed adoption is filed with the petition. Such consent shall be in writing, signed under oath and acknowledged before an officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments. The consent of a birth parent for the adoption of his child placed directly by the birth parent shall be executed as provided in § 63.2-1233, and the circuit court may accept a certified copy of an order entered pursuan t to § 63.2-1233 in satisfaction of all requirements of this section, provided the order clearly evidences compliance with the applicable notice and consent requirements of § 63.2-1233. B. A birth par ent who has not reached the age of 18 shall have legal capacity to give consent to adoption and perform all acts related to adoption, and shall be as fully bound thereby as if the birth parent had attained the age of 18 years. C. Consent sha ll be executed: 1. By th e birth mother and by any man who: a. Is an acknowledged father under § 20-49.1; b. Is an adjudicated father under § 20-49.8; c. Is a presumed father under subsection D; or d. Has registered with the Virginia Birth Father Registry pursuant to Article 7 (§ 63.2-1249 et seq.).Verification of compliance with the notice provisions of the Virginia Birth F ather Registry shall be provided to the court. 2. By the child-placing agency or the local board having custody of the child, with right to place him for adoption, through court commitment or parental agreement as provided in § 63. 2-900, 63.2-903, or 63.2-1221; or an agency outside the Commonwealth that is licensed or otherwise duly authorized to place children for adoption by virtue of the laws under which it operates; and 3. By the child if he is 14 years of age or older, unless the circuit court finds that the best interests of the child will be served by not requiring such consent. D. A man shall be presumed to be the father of a child if: 1. He an d the mother of the child are married to each other and the child is born during the marriage; 2. He and the mother of the child were married to each other and the child is born within 300 days of their date of separation, as evidenced by a written agreement or decree of separation , or within 300 days after the marriage is terminated by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, or divorce; or 3. Before the birth of the child, he and the mother of the child married each other in apparent compliance with the law, even if the attempted marriage is or could be declared invalid, an d the child is born during the invalid marriage or within 300 days of their date of separation, as evidenced by a written agreement or decree of separation, or within 300 days after its termination by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, or divor ce.Such presumption may be rebutted by sufficient evidence that would establish by a preponderance of the evidence the paternity of another man or the impossibility or improbability of cohabitation with the birth mother for a period of at least 300 days prior to the birth of the child. E. No consent shall be required of a birth father if he denies under oath and in writing the paternity of the child. Such denial of paternity may be withdrawn no more than 10 days after it is executed. Once the child is 10 days old, any executed denial of paternity is final and constitutes a waiver of all rights with respect to the adoption of the child and cannot be withdrawn. F. No consent shall be required of the birth father of a child when the birth father is convicted of a violation of subsection A of § 18.2-61, § 18.2-63, subsection B of § 18.2-366, or an equivalent offense of another state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction, and the child was conceived as a result of such violation. G. No notice o r consent shall be required of any person whose parental rights have been terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction, including foreign courts that have competent jurisdiction. No notice or consent is required of any birth parent of a child for whom a guardianship order was granted when the child was approved by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services for purposes of adoption. H. No consent shall be required of a birth parent who, without just cause, has neither visited nor contacted the child for a period of six months immediately prior to the filing of the petition for adoption or the filing of a petition to accept consent to an adoption. The prospective adoptive parent(s) shall establish by clear and convincing evidence that the birth parent(s), without just cause, has neither visited nor contacted the child for a period of six months immediately prior to the filing of the petition for adoption or the filing of a petition to accept consent to an adoption. This provision shall not infringe upon the birth parents right to be noticed and heard on the allegation of abandonment. For purposes of this section, the payment of child support , in the absence of other contact with the child, shall not be considered contact. I. A birth fat her of the child may consent to the termination of all of his parental rights prior to the birth of the child. J. The failure of the nonconsenting party to appear at any scheduled hearing, either in person or by counsel, after proper notice has been given to said party, shall constitute a waiver of any objection and right to consent to the adoption. K. If a birth parent, legal guardian, or prospective adoptee, executing a consent, entrustment, or other documents related to the adoption, cannot provide the identification required pursuant to § 47.1-14, the birth parent, legal guardian, or prospective adoptee ma y execute a self-authenticating affidavit as to his identity subject to the penalties contained in § 63.2-1217. L.

For related discussion, see 14A M.J. Parent and Child, § 27. CASE NOTES Childs best interest.  Where evidence clearly supported the trial courts finding that a fathers continued relationship with a child was detrimental where the father had abandone d and sexually abused the child; an adoption was in the best interests of the child and fathers consent to the adoption was being withheld contrary to the childs best interests. Starkell v. Geris, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 706 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 26, 20 02). Circuit court properly determined that the termination of a fathers parental rights on grounds that he was unfit as a parent was in the best interest of the c hild, and that the child should be placed for adoption, as sufficient evidence was presented of the fathers inability to provide for the welfare of his child due to his incarceration and status as a convicted felon, his lack of employment and a stabl e home, his past drug abuse, and a history of violence toward women. Wheless v. Commonwealth Catholic Charities, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 401 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 6, 2007). Circuit court in approving, over a mothers objection, the adoption of the mothers son under subsection A of § 63.2-1203 did not erroneously fail to mak e a specific finding that continuing the mothers parent-child relationship with the mothers son would be detrimental to the son because § 63.2-1205 required no such finding. Instead, § 63.2-1205 focused on the best interests of the child. G ooch v. Harris, 52 Va. App. 157, 662 S.E.2d 95, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 282 (2008). Adoption without the biological mothers consent violated her due process rights because there was no finding, as required by Virginia law, that the mother s continuing relationship with her child would be detrimental to the childs welfare. Todd v. Copeland, 55 Va. App. 773, 689 S.E.2d 784, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 91 (2010), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 282 Va. 183, 715 S.E.2d 11, 2011 Va. LEXIS 181 (20 11). Great-aunts petition for leave to adopt the mothers child was properly granted as the mother was withholding her consent to the adoption contrary to the b est interests of the child because, even from birth, there were periods when the mother was only minimally involved in the childs care; the mother was unable to assume full custody of the child based on her incarceration; the mother had a history of untreated mental health problems, continuing drug abuse, and violent behavior in the childs presence; the great-aunt had provided the child a safe and stable environment; and a change in physical custody would be extremely detrimental to the child s well-being. Tolley v. Tolley, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 67 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 20, 2018). Circuit court did not err in finding that the adoption was in the childs best interests and that mother had withheld her consent to the adoption contrary to t he childs best interests because the mother admitted that she was not in a position to assume custody of the child, given her current incarceration status and medical situation. The circuit court determined that the evidence established that mother w as a drug addict and that she lacked the ability to care for the child because she was currently incarcerated, and had been suffering through the medical process of addiction for years. Cousins v. Brandt, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 135 (Va. Ct. App. May 3, 2022). Circuit court made required findings.  Circuit court did not err by failing to make additional findings under § 16.1-283 because adoption petitions were brought by a couple seeking to adopt a child without the mothers consent pursuant to §§ 63.2-1242.2 and 63.2-1203. The circuit court made the findings required by §§ 63.2-1203 and 63.2-1205. Hughes v. Hughes, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 85 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 8, 2011). Procedures followed.  Trial court did not have the authority to grant the grandmothers petition to terminate the fathers parental rights, and the fact that the petition to term inate was attached to the grandmothers petition for adoption did not affect the trial courts ability to consider the petition for adoption; the trial court followed the statutory scheme when it granted the petition for adoption, and the trial cou rt did not err in proceeding with the adoption petition after granting the motion to strike on the termination petition. Hardy v. Poston, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 368 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 4, 2014). Subject matter jurisdiction.  Because a juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) district court had no jurisdiction to hear a petition related to consent for adoption that was not a parental plac ement adoption, a circuit court had no subject matter jurisdiction at all to hear the appeal as the circuit court had no more subject matter jurisdiction than the JDR district court had in that courts original proceeding.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Welfare of child is paramount concern.  In custody and adoption cases the welfare of the child is of paramount concern and takes precedence over the rights of parents. Malpass v. Morgan, 213 Va. 393, 19 2 S.E.2d 794, 1972 Va. LEXIS 373 (1972); Ward v. Faw, 219 Va. 1120, 253 S.E.2d 658, 1979 Va. LEXIS 220 (1979). In adoption cases the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration and the technical rights of the parents may be disregarded if the childs welfare wou ld best be served by denying custody to the parents. Szemler v. Clements, 214 Va. 639, 202 S.E.2d 880, 1974 Va. LEXIS 191 (1974). The welfare of a child is the guidepost in every custody and adoption proceeding. Frye v. Spotte, 4 Va. App. 530, 359 S.E.2d 315, 4 Va. Law Rep. 224, 1987 Va. App . LEXIS 210 (1987). To promote the best interests of a child is to advance or to contribute to his interest. Malpass v. Morgan, 213 Va. 393, 192 S.E.2d 794, 1972 Va. LEXIS 373 (1972). Withholding consent contrary to childs best interests explained.  When consent to adoption is withheld contrary to a childs best interests, it means that the person so withholding is obstinately self-willed in refusing t o concur and that he is acting prejudicially to the childs interests. Malpass v. Morgan, 213 Va. 393, 192 S.E.2d 794, 1972 Va. LEXIS 373 (1972). Comparative best interests rule inapposite to contests between parent and nonparent.  Rule of comparative best interests applied in child custody contests between parents is inapposite to contests between parent and nonparent. Rocka v. Roanoke Coun ty Dep't of Pub. Welfare, 215 Va. 515, 211 S.E.2d 76, 1975 Va. LEXIS 182 (1975). Failure to state on record that all elements mandated by statute have been considered.  Where trial court cited only two reasons for making its determination: fathers fulfillment of his financial obligations and his disinclination to separate blo od relatives. While these are important, relevant factors, they must be considered in light of all the elements mandated by this statute. Although the trial court may, in fact, have considered these elements, its failure to state on the record that they were considered constituted clear evidence that the proper standard was not applied, and the petition was prematurely denied. Sell v. Palmarini, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 628 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 23, 1997). Because the record did not include the circuit courts findings with respect to the statutory factors, the court of appeals was unable to determine why it held the evidence a biological mother and her husband presented did not prove the biological father was withholding his consent to the adoption contrary to the childs best interests; the evidence proved that the mother had sole legal and physical custody of the child, and the father had not filed any motions to modify custody or visitation. Graves v. Jones, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 124 (Va. Ct. App. May 9, 2017). Failure to hea r evidence or make findings.  The trial court denied the mothers due process rights when it failed to hear any evidence or make any findings regarding this section and § 63.2-1208, befo re concluding that the mothers withholding her consent to the adoption was contrary to the childs best interests. Gregory v. Martin, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 312 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 16, 2014). Court should act without hesitation once determination is made.  Once the considered determination is made that a childs welfare requires that the adoption be granted and the parents rights terminated, the trial court s hould act without hesitation in granting the petition, since the future well-being of the child lies in the balance. Mazzocco v. Miller, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 240 (Va. Ct. App. May 22, 1990). It does not automatically follow that the court should decide that the best interest of a child will be served by adoption, merely because the same evidence shows those interests will not be served by a custody transfer. Watson v. Shepard, 217 Va. 538, 229 S.E.2d 897, 1976 Va. LEXIS 318 (1976). Procedures followed.  Trial court did not have the authority to grant the grandmothers petition to terminate the fathers parental rights, and the fact that the petition to term inate was attached to the grandmothers petition for adoption did not affect the trial courts ability to consider the petition for adoption; the trial court followed the statutory scheme when it granted the petition for adoption, and the trial cou rt did not err in proceeding with the adoption petition after granting the motion to strike on the termination petition. Hardy v. Poston, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 368 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 4, 2014). Burden of proo f on proponents of adoption.  See Szemler v. Clements, 214 Va. 639, 202 S.E.2d 880, 1974 Va. LEXIS 191 (1974). Where proponents of adoption have satisfied the provisions of former § 63.1-225 (see now §§ 63.2-1202 to 63.2-1204), they are entitled to an interlocutor y order if the trial court, after hearing the evidence of both the proponents and the opponents of the adoption, finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed adoption would be in the childs best interests. Szemler v. Clements, 214 Va. 6 39, 202 S.E.2d 880, 1974 Va. LEXIS 191 (1974). Evidence held sufficient.  The evidence was sufficient to find that the adoption was in the childrens best interest and that a continuing relationship with their natural father would be detrimental to their welfare, where the father deserted his wife and daughters for another woman, taking all the food from the family home and disconnecting the electricity and water, intentionally leaving the family in necessitous circumstances; the mo ther was forced to apply for public assistance to help feed and support the children; the father demonstrated recurring incidents of spousal and child abuse, including sexual abuse; and the older child had made it known that she did not wish to maintain contact with her father. Frye v. Spotte, 4 Va. App. 530, 359 S.E.2d 315, 4 Va. Law Rep. 224, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (1987). Where the trial court found that clear and convincing evidence proved it was in the childs best interests to grant the petition for adoption, and that a conti nued relationship with her natural father was detrimental to her welfare, the adoption order was affirmed. Knight v. Laney, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 1996). Where the evidence revealed that adoption would be in the childs best interests and the continued relationship with the non-consenting parent would be detrime ntal, it followed that the failure to grant the adoption would be detrimental to the child; thus, where consent was withheld contrary to t...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_63.2-1206"><akn:num>§ 63.2-1206</akn:num><akn:heading>No parental presumption after revocation period expires</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If, after the expiration of the appropriate revocation period provided for in § 63.2-1223 or § 63.2-1234, a birth parent or an alleged birth parent attempts to ob tain or regain custody of or attempts to exercise parental rights to a child who has been placed for adoption, there shall be no parental presumption in favor of any party.

Mother not precluded from opposing adoption.  Where the mother revoked consent, she was not precluded from opposing the adoption. Szemler v. Clements, 214 Va. 639, 202 S.E.2d 880, 1974 Va. LEXIS 191 (1974). Revocation of consent after filing of petition did not divest court of jurisdiction.  Revocation of consent to adoption after petition for adoption had been filed was ineffective to divest court of jurisdiction, which had attached as of the date of filing the petition for adoption. Szemler v. Clements, 214 Va. 639, 202 S.E.2d 880, 1974 Va. LEXIS 191 (1974). Parties in adoption set aside pr oceeding.  Former section addressing how a parent could consent to the adoption of a child did not provide that an adoptive parents consent could be used in lieu of maki ng the parent a party in a proceeding to set aside an adoption. No provision allows a person to become a party to a proceeding without being served with process or by appearing before the court either in person or by some duly authorized agent.

Upon consid eration of the petition, the circuit court shall, upon being satisfied as to proper jurisdiction and venue, immediately enter either an interlocutory order referring the case to a child-placing agency to conduct a visitation and prepare a report of visit ation or an order of reference referring the case to a child-placing agency to conduct an investigation and prepare a report of investigation, unless no investigation is required pursuant to this chapter. In agency adoption cases for which an interlocuto ry order is entered, the petition shall contain the provisional consent of the child-placing agency. The court shall enter the interlocutory order or order of reference concurrently with the entering of an order of publication, if such is necessary. Upon entry of the interlocutory order or order of reference, the clerk shall forward a copy of the interlocutory order or order of reference, the petition, and all exhibits thereto to the Commissioner and the child-placing agency retained to provide investig ative, reporting, and supervisory services. If no Virginia agency was retained to provide such services, the interlocutory order or order of reference, petition, and all exhibits shall be forwarded to the local director of social services of the locality where the petitioners reside or resided at the time of filing the petition or had legal residence at the time the petition was filed. B. Upon receiv ing a petition and interlocutory order or order of reference from the circuit court, the applicable agency shall make a thorough investigation of the matter and report thereon in writing, in such form as the Commissioner may prescribe, to the circuit cou rt. In cases in which an order of reference was received, the agency shall file a report of investigation with the circuit court within 60 days after the copy of the petition and all exhibits thereto are forwarded. In cases in which an interlocutory orde r was received, the agency shall file a report of visitation within 30 days after the completion of all placement visits required pursuant to § 63.2-1212. In agency adoption cases, as long as the agency continues to recommend the adoption, the agency shall file its final agency consent with the report. A copy of the applicable report to the circuit court shall be served on the Commissioner by delivering or mailing a copy to him on or before the day of filing such report with the circuit court. On the applicable report to the circuit court there shall be appended either acceptance of service or certificate of the local director, or the representative of the child-placing agency, that copies were served as this section requires, showing the date of de livery or mailing. The circuit court shall expeditiously consider the merits of the petition upon receipt of the applicable report and enter a final order of adoption. C. If the appl icable report is not made to the circuit court within the periods specified, the circuit court may proceed to hear and determine the merits of the petition and enter such order or orders as the circuit court may deem appropriate. D. The visitat ion or investigation requested by the circuit court in an interlocutory order or order of reference shall include, in addition to other inquiries that the circuit court may require the child-placing agency or local director to make, inquiries as to (i) w hether the petitioner is financially able, except as provided in Chapter 13 (§ 63.2-1300 et seq.), morally suitable, in satisfactory physical and mental health and a proper person to care for and to train the child; (ii) what the physical and mental c ondition of the child is; (iii) why the parents, if living, desire to be relieved of the responsibility for the custody, care, and maintenance of the child, and what their attitude is toward the proposed adoption; (iv) whether the parents have abandoned the child or are morally unfit to have custody over him; (v) the circumstances under which the child came to live, and is living, in the physical custody of the petitioner; (vi) whether the child is a suitable child for adoption by the petitioner; (vii) what fees have been paid by the petitioners or on their behalf to persons or agencies that have assisted them in obtaining the child; and (viii) whether the requirements of subsections E and F have been met. Any report made to the circuit court shall inc lude a recommendation as to the action to be taken by the circuit court on the petition. A copy of any report made to the circuit court shall be furnished to counsel of record representing the adopting parent or parents. When the investigation reveals th at there may have been a violation of § 63.2-1200 or § 63.2-1218, the local director or child-placing agency shall so inform the circuit court and the Commissioner. E. The applica ble report shall include the relevant physical and mental history of the birth parents if known to the person making the report. The child-placing agency or local director shall document in the report all efforts they made to encourage birth parents to s hare information related to their physical and mental history. However, nothing in this subsection shall require that an investigation of the physical and mental history of the birth parents be made. F. The applica ble report shall include a statement by the child-placing agency or local director that all reasonably ascertainable background, medical, and psychological records of the child, including whether the child has been the subject of an investigation as the perpetrator of sexual abuse, have been provided to the prospective adoptive parent(s). The report also shall include a list of such records provided. G. The court m ay enter a final order of adoption under the following circumstances: 1. In ca ses in which an order of reference was entered and the report of investigation has been received, if (i) the child has been placed in the physical custody of the petitioner by a child-placing agency; (ii) the placing or supervising agency certifies to th e circuit court that the child has lived in the physical custody of the petitioner continuously for a period of at least six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition and has been visited by a representative of such agency at least three ti mes within a six-month period, provided that there are not less than 90 days between the first and last visit; and (iii) the court is of the opinion that entry of a final order of adoption would otherwise be proper. 2. In cases in which an interlocutory order was entered and both the report of visitation and final agency consent have been received, if (i) the child has been placed in the physical cus tody of the petitioner by a child-placing agency; (ii) the placing or supervising agency certifies to the circuit court that the child has been visited by a representative of such agency at least three times within a six-month period, provided that there are not less than 90 days between the first and last visit; and (iii) the court is of the opinion that entry of a final order of adoption would otherwise be proper. In cases in which the court entered either an interlocutory order or order of reference and the child was placed by a child-placing agency, the circuit court may, for g ood cause shown, omit the requirement that the three visits be made within a six-month period, provided that not less than three visits were made. H. If the spec ific provisions set out in §§ 63.2-1228, 63.2-1238, 63.2-1242 and 63.2-1244 do not apply, the petition and all exhibits shall be forwarded to the local director where the petitioners reside or to a licensed child-placing agency.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Purpose of interlocutory order.  The interlocutory order contemplated by statute is for the purpose of giving the department an opportunity to visit the home of the adopting parents, to see that the child is being properly cared for, thereby forming some opinion as to the childs future should it be permitted to remain in the home. Bidwell v. McSorley, 194 Va. 135, 72 S.E.2d 245, 1952 Va. LEXIS 214 (1952); Harmon v. D'Adamo, 195 Va. 125, 77 S .E.2d 318, 1953 Va. LEXIS 182 (1953). Absent an appealable order in an adoption proceeding, the Supreme Court may not determin e whether any of the requirements for adoption have been met. Where the order in a case was not a final or even an interlocutory order of adoption, nor appealable as an order adjudicating the principles of a cause, any finding made in the adoption procee ding was not yet appealable.

In such cases, the court may also omit the order of reference if the p etitioners meet the requirements set forth in § 63.2-1241. 2. If one of the petitioners is a stepparent of the child and the circuit court is of the opinion that the entry of an interlocutory order would otherwise be proper.

After receipt of the report of investigation, if the child was placed into Virginia from a foreign country in accordance with § 63.2-1104, the adoption was not finalized pursuant to the laws of that foreign country, and the child has been in the physical custody of the petitioner for at least six months immediately prior to the filing of the petition and has been visited by a representative of a licensed child-placing agency or of the local department three times within the six-month period with no fewer than 90 days between the first and last visits.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Purpose of section.  This section provides that the court may revoke its interlocutory order of adoption at any time prior to the entry of the final order for good cause shown.  The purpose of this section and the interlocutory order is to provide an opportunity for inquiring into and considering matters which may have developed during the pendency of the order and which may constitute good cause for its revocation and the dismissal of the adoption proceeding. Newton v. Wilson, 199 Va. 864, 102 S.E.2d 299, 1958 Va. LEXIS 134 (1958). Interest of child is paramount issue.  In proceedings to vacate interlocutory order of adoption the paramount issue is the best interests of the child. Bidwell v. McSorley, 194 Va. 135, 72 S.E.2d 245, 1952 Va. LEXIS 214 (1952). In adoption proceedings the prime consideration is the best interests of the child. Newton v. Wilson, 199 Va. 864, 102 S.E.2d 299, 1958 Va. LEXIS 134 (1958). For good cause shown.  The expression for good cause shown employed by this section means that the court may take into consideration matters discovered during the pendency of th e order, and if there is an unfavorable change in the situation and good cause is shown as to why the adoption should not be consummated, then the statute may be employed and the interlocutory order vacated. Bidwell v. McSorley, 194 Va. 135, 72 S.E.2d 24 5, 1952 Va. LEXIS 214 (1952). Good cause mea ns more than changing of mind by parent.  For good cause shown means more than the simple changing of the mind by the parent who has given consent to the adoption. Where the consent has been freel y and knowingly given, and where it has been acted upon, it cannot be arbitrarily revoked. Bidwell v. McSorley, 194 Va. 135, 72 S.E.2d 245, 1952 Va. LEXIS 214 (1952). Good cause shown means something more than a mere change of mind by the parent who has consented to the adoption. Newton v. Wilson, 199 Va. 864, 102 S.E.2 d 299, 1958 Va. LEXIS 134 (1958). Where no legal reason was established for disturbing an interlocutory order of adoption, it could not be set aside simply because the consenting mother had change d her mind. Bidwell v. McSorley, 194 Va. 135, 72 S.E.2d 245, 1952 Va. LEXIS 214 (1952). Consent of natural father becoming legal parent prior to final order.  The fact that during the pendency of an interlocutory order in an adoption proceeding the childs natural father became its legal parent and had not given his consent to the adoption was a legally sufficient ground for vacating the order. Harmon v. D'Adamo, 195 Va. 125, 77 S.E.2d 318, 1953 Va. LEXIS 182 (1953). Putative father had no standing to intervene in adoption proceeding.  Circuit court properly denied a putative fathers request to intervene in an adoption proceeding because the father had neither standing to intervene nor a rig ht to withhold his consent to the adoption since the record failed to establish his paternity; the putative father did not register as a putative father before the deadline for doing so expired under the Virginia Putative Father Registry. Chollette v. Ke eling, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 279 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 6, 2015). Refusal to hear additi onal evidence held error.  The refusal of the lower court to hear additional evidence on the issues raised by the petition and amended petition of the childs natural parents, alleging t hat they had withdrawn their consent and that the adoption would not be for the childs best interest, was error.

Except as h ereinafter provided, after the entry of an interlocutory order of adoption, (i) the licensed or duly authorized child-placing agency; (ii) if the child was not placed by an agency and the placement is not a parental placement, the local director; (iii) i f the placement is a parental placement, the child-placing agency that submitted the home study; or, (iv) if the child was placed by an agency in another state or by an agency, court, or other entity in another country, the local director or licensed chi ld-placing agency, whichever agency completed the home study or provided supervision, shall cause or have caused the child to be visited at least three times within a period of six months by an agent of such local board or local department or by an agent of such licensed or duly authorized child-placing agency. Whenever practicable, such visits shall be made within the six-month period immediately following the date upon which the child was placed in the physical care of the adoptive parents or of entry of the interlocutory order; however, no less than ninety days shall elapse between the first visit and the last visit. The agency that placed the child, the child-placing agency that submitted the home study, the local director or the licensed child-pla cing agency, as applicable, shall make a written report to the circuit court, in such form as the Commissioner may prescribe, of the findings made pursuant to such visitations. A copy of the report to the circuit court shall be furnished to the counsel o f record for the parties, which copy shall be returned by such counsel as is required by § 63.2-1246 for the return of the original report.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Finality of proceeding.  An order in an adoption proceeding cannot be treated as a finality when such proceeding has stopped short of a final decree. Harmon v. D'Adamo, 195 Va. 125, 77 S. E.2d 318, 1953 Va. LEXIS 182 (1953). To promote the best interests of a child is to advance or to contribute to his interest. Malpass v. Morgan, 213 Va. 393, 192 S.E.2d 794, 1972 Va. LEXIS 373 (1972). Absent an appealable order in an adoption proceeding, the Supreme Court may not determin e whether any of the requirements for adoption have been met. Where the order in a case was not a final or even an interlocutory order of adoption, nor appealable as an order adjudicating the principles of a cause, any finding made in the adoption procee ding was not yet appealable. Shortridge v. Deel, 224 Va. 589, 299 S.E.2d 500, 1983 Va. LEXIS 165 (1983). Adoption held not in best interests of child bitterly opposed to it.  Where it was shown that a child, 15 years old, was bitterly opposed to his adoption and wished to live with his parents, though ordinarily the attitude of a child is not controlling, adoption was held not to be in the childs best interests.

Except where a final order of adoption is entered pursuant to § 63.2-1241, any person whose i nterest in the child derives from or through the birth parent or previous adoptive parent, including but not limited to grandparents, stepparents, former stepparents, blood relatives and family members shall, by final order of adoption, be divested of al l legal rights and obligations in respect to the child including the right to petition any court for visitation with the child. In all cases the child shall be free from all legal obligations of obedience and maintenance in respect to such persons divest ed of legal rights. Any child adopted under the provisions of this chapter shall, from and after the entry of the interlocutory order or from and after the entry of the final order where no such interlocutory order is entered, be, to all intents and purp oses, the child of the person or persons so adopting him, and, unless and until such interlocutory order or final order is subsequently revoked, shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges, and subject to all the obligations, of a child of such pe rson or persons born in lawful wedlock.

Some of the cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Biological parent and adoptive parent of equal rank and responsibility.  When an order of adoption becomes final, the adoptive parent obtains all the legal rights and obligations of a natural parent; the adoptive parent, in a stepparen t adoption, becomes a joint guardian of the minor child along with the birth parent and is equally and jointly charged with the childs care, nurture, welfare, education and support. Once the adoption is final, there is no distinction in law between t he biological parent and the adoptive parent; they are parents to that child of equal rank and responsibility. Carter v. Carter, 35 Va. App. 466, 546 S.E.2d 220, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 263 (2001). The language of this section is very broad and inclusive. A child by adoption for al l intents and purposes is the child and heir at law of the adopting parent and entitled to all the rights and privileges of a child of such parent born in lawful wedlock. Dickenson v. Buck, 169 Va. 39, 192 S.E. 748, 1937 Va. LEXIS 154 (1937); Newsome v. Scott, 200 Va. 833, 108 S.E.2d 369, 1959 Va. LEXIS 175 (1959). Use of term heir in will.  When used in a will the term heir may include legal heirs under the statute of descent and distribution, or may include heirs of the body only, excluding heirs general and adopted children. Newsome v. Scott, 200 Va. 833, 108 S.E.2d 369, 1959 Va. LEXIS 175 (1959). Phrase but if she should die without heir held not to have been intended to include an adopted child. Newsome v. Scott, 200 Va. 833, 108 S.E.2d 369, 1959 Va. LEXIS 175 (1959). Phrase if he dies without heirs held under the circumstances not to include adopted child. Merson v. Wood, 202 Va. 485, 117 S.E.2d 661, 1961 Va. LEXIS 133 (1961). An adopted child is conclusively presumed to be the lawful child of the adopting parent in all litigation in which it may be involved, except in a suit specifically brought to set aside and annul such adoption. The truth of an allegation that such adoption is invalid and void, made in a collateral suit, is not taken as admitted on demurrer. Bell v. Jones, 9 Va. L. Reg. 1070 (1904). And is his legal heir.  Testator devised land to his son for life and at his death to the sons legal heirs. The adopted child of testators son contended that he was the l atters sole legal heir, while the daughter of the testator asserted that she answered that description. It was held that, considering the will and the former law together, the devise in remainder was to the legal heirs of testators son, and this section created the legal heir of the life tenant and placed the adopted son in that position. Dickenson v. Buck, 169 Va. 39, 192 S.E. 748, 1937 Va. LEXIS 154 (1937). When interpreting whether adopted children were direct lineal descendants under trusts executed prior to 1978, the language of § 63.2-1215 (§ 5333 a t the time the trusts were executed), providing that adopted children were heirs of their adopting parents, did not require a finding that the term direct lineal descendants in the trust instruments included adopted children, as the statute did n ot provide that an adopted child inherited from an adopting parents ancestor. McGehee v. Edwards, 268 Va. 15, 268 Va. 23, 597 S.E.2d 99, 2004 Va. LEXIS 96 (2004). Language does not acco mmodate open adoption.  Following adoption, the natural mother would be divested by statute of all legal rights and obligations in respect to the children and the children would be free from all legal obligations of obedience and maintenance in respect to her. The children would become, to all intents and purposes, children of the adoptive parents. Such language does not accommodate open adoption. Cage v. Harrisonburg Dep't of S ocial Servs., 13 Va. App. 246, 410 S.E.2d 405, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1162, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 287 (1991). Status acquired under foreign adoption proceedings will be recognized.  According to the great weight of authority, a status of adoption acquired under the law of one state will be recognized and given effect in another state provided that the foreign court had jurisdiction of the adoption proceedings, and that the recognition of status as fixed by the foreign decree is not inconsistent with, and will not offend, the laws of the public policy of the forum. Doulgeris v. Bambacus, 203 Va. 670, 127 S.E.2d 145, 1962 Va. LEXIS 204 (1962). Unless such pr oceedings offend local public policy.  Virginia refuses to recognize adoption proceedings of any foreign country which offend her public policy. Doulgeris v. Bambacus, 203 Va. 670, 127 S.E.2d 145, 1962 Va. LEXIS 204 (1962). As in case of adoption for parents convenience in disregard of childs welfare.  A Virginia court properly refused to recognize a Greek adoption where the record showed that the adoption was merely an arrangement for the convenience of the ado ptive parents, who were old and needed someone to care for them, and that it was effected without regard to the welfare of the child. Doulgeris v. Bambacus, 203 Va. 670, 127 S.E.2d 145, 1962 Va. LEXIS 204 (1962). Parents duty to provide for child only eradicated upon final order for adoption.  Under Virginia law, a parents legal duty to provide for support of his or her child is eradicated only upon the final order of adoption. Commonwealth v. Willi ams, No. 1328-87-1 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 17, 1989). Ch ild support arrearages nondischargeable in bankruptcy.  Where the record did not indicate that defendant consented to adoption in exchange for plaintiff asking the juvenile and domestic relations court to vacate child support payments, and there was no final adoption order and the court vacated only future child support payments nunc pro tunc, past payments missed by the defendant should have retained their character as child support payments. Thus, the arrearage of p ayments was for child support, nondischargeable in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5). Labelle v. Melton, 34 Bankr. 323, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 5083 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1983). Impa ct on former spouse amounted to termination of rights.  By statute the legal effect of proposed adoption would be to deprive mother and former wife of petitioner of all rights and obligations with respect to child sinc e the defendant was no longer married to the petitioner. Sozio v. Thorpe, 22 Va. App. 271, 469 S.E.2d 68, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 267 (1996). Natural parent is forever divested of legal rights when adoption becomes final.  In custody, visitation, and support proceedings, a trial court retains jurisdiction to modify or correct orders which future developments prove to have been ill a dvised; however, when an order of adoption becomes final, the natural parent is forever divested of all legal rights and obligations with respect to the child, and the adoptive parent obtains all the legal rights and obligations of a natural parent. Frye v. Spotte, 4 Va. App. 530, 359 S.E.2d 315, 4 Va. Law Rep. 224, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (1987). After the adoption of the mothers child by the family friends became final, the mother was divested of all legal rights regarding the child, and, thus, did no t have standing to petition a court for visitation with the child. Crockett v. McCray, 38 Va. App. 1, 560 S.E.2d 920, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 177 (2002). Order of adoption divested biological grandparents of right to visitation.  Adoptive parents failure to timely appeal the juvenile courts visitation order was of no legal consequence because there was no need for them to file a se parate pleading to seek the termination of biological grandparents visitation when entry of the order of adoption divested the grandparents of any right to visitation; the petition for a...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_63.2-1216"><akn:num>§ 63.2-1216</akn:num><akn:heading>Final order not subject to attack after six months</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text After the expiration of six months from the date of entry of any final order of adoption from which no appeal has been taken to the Court of Appeals, the validity there of shall not be subject to attack in any proceedings, collateral or direct, for any reason, including but not limited to fraud, duress, failure to give any required notice, failure of any procedural requirement, or lack of jurisdiction over any person, a nd such order shall be final for all purposes. History History. Code 1950, § 63-361; 1954, c. 489; 1968, c. 578, § 63.1-237 ; 1984, c. 703; 1995, cc. 772, 826; 2000, c. 830, § 63.1-219.23; 2002, c. 747. Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 12A M.J. Limitation of Actions, § 2. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  Trial court did not err by determining that this section was not unconstitutional as applied to the mothers case because the totality of the facts supported a finding that she did not lack an understanding of the nature and legal consequences of her consent and the adoption. The mother executed a form representing that she consented to the adoption of her son by her parents, the record indicated that she knew the adoption was not temporary, the adoption was sought to prevent the sons father from becoming involved with the son, and she did not challenge the adoption for seven years. Lively v. Smith, 72 Va. App. 429, 848 S.E.2d 620, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 252 (2020). Statute do es not extend circuit courts jurisdiction.  Grandparents argued that the statute was intended to extend the period of time in which a circuit court had jurisdiction over an adoption order beyond the 21-day period specified in the rule; however, because the plain language of the statute does not compel such a result and such an interpretation would limit rather than advance the statutes purpose to foster finality, the court declines to adopt it, and the rules finality provision applied to the adoption order in this case. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (2018). In the six months after entry of an adoption order, a person with standing may challenge an adoption order more than 21 days after its entry for any ground that w ould permit a challenge under the rule; after the six-month period has run, the statute prevents a person from challenging the adoption order even if one of the exceptions to the rule is present. This remains true even if the exception is based upon frau d, duress, failure to give notice, or lack of jurisdiction. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (2018). Finality of adoption order.  Grandparents were neither custodians nor guardians of the children at issue, and the father, through whom grandparents claimed their connection with the children, was alive and had his rights to the children terminated; neither the Constitution nor Virginia statutes required that the grandparents receive notice of the adoption proceeding, and thus the alleged lack of notice did not provide a basis to exempt the a doption order from the finality provisions of the rule. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (2018). Because both orders were entered more than 21 days before the grandparents filed their initial pleading, they had to show that some exception to the rules fin ality rule applied; absent an exception, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the grandparents challenges to the order terminating fathers parental rights or the order granting the adoption, and the circuit court correctly dis missed grandparents challenge to these orders. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (2018). Grandparents identified no statute or constitutional right that required they consent to the adoption; the only required consent was the consent of the department , which was the agency having custody of the children, and because all necessary consents were obtained and presented, the lack of consent by the grandparents did not provide a basis to exempt the adoption order from the finality provisions of the rule. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (2018). To set aside or reopen the final order in either the termination case or the adoption case, grandparents had to both allege and prove the orders were obtained by fraud; the failure to even allege that fraud occurred was fatal to their attempt to reopen either case. Nelson v. Middlesex Dep't of Soc. Servs., 69 Va. App. 496, 820 S.E.2d 400, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 319 (2018). Because maternal grandparents second challenge to an adoption order was filed more than a year after the adoption was completed, the statute precluded the cir cuit court from considering the arguments raised in the second challenge, rendering the circuit courts order denying the maternal grandparents petition to vacate a nullity; as a result, the court of appeals could not address the substance of the maternal grandparents arguments. Cook v. Jensen, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2020). Circuit court did not retain jurisdiction of a stepparent adoption proceeding when a grandparent filed a notice of appeal after the 21-day period had elapsed beca use the period of time within which an adoption order was permitted to be challenged was not statutorily extended. Bonanno v. Quinn, 299 Va. 722, 858 S.E.2d 181, 2021 Va. LEXIS 54 (2021). Non-English speaking father victim of fraud.  Although the state has a compelling interest in preserving stability in a family relationship, particularly when a young minor is involved, the application of the six-month statute of limitation was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of stability while simultaneously preserving a fathers fundamental right to continue the pre-existing relationship with his biological child where the father, who could not speak or read English, alleged that he had never abandoned the child, that he had been induced by the childs maternal grandmother to sign a form consenting to the adoption by intrinsic and extrinsic fraud, and that he had not discovere d that his parental rights had been terminated until after the six-month period had elapsed. F.E. v. G.F.M., 32 Va. App. 846, 531 S.E.2d 50, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 533 (2000) (decided under prior law). Construction with Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1.  Although the six-month period referenced in the statute is longer than the twenty-one-day period in Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1, it does not represent an extension of a c ircuit courts jurisdiction in adoption cases; the time periods contained in both Rule 1:1 and the statute are both triggered by a circuit courts entry of a final order. Cook v. Jensen, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 4, 2020). Error in holding that claims w ere untimely.  Although the trial court correctly denied a fathers request for an entry of default and properly refused to treat the factual allegations in his amended petit ion to vacate an adoption order as admitted, it erred in holding that 63.2-1216 barred claims filed more than six months from the discovery of the alleged fraud. McCallum v. Salazar, 49 Va. App. 51, 636 S.E.2d 486, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 504 (2006). No error in holding that claim was untimely.  Circuit court properly denied a biological mothers petition to set aside the adoption of her two children because, despite learning of the adoption in 2010, s he did not file a petition to set aside the adoption until 2016, she was statutorily prevented from attacking the final order of adoption, the trial court found that there was no evidence of fraud on the part of the adoptive mother, and the biological mo ther did not appeal that finding. Castillo v. Bell, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 282 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Adoption order vacated.  Granting of a motion to vacate an adoption order was appropriate because, although an attack upon validity of the adoption order was barred six months from the da te of entry of the final order of adoption, the order was not final so that an adoption might proceed without notice to the biological father and the father was entitled to a trial de novo on the fathers appeal.

Duress.  Trial courts finding that permanent entrustment agreements not revoked within 15 days could be invalidated because the mother who executed them did not feel h er consent in signing them was voluntary due to her continuing criminal proceedings and her husbands incarceration, erroneously failed to find that the mother had been subjected to fraud or duress, which were the only permissible grounds upon which t o invalidate the agreements.

For the pur poses of this section, a birth parent who is less than 18 years of age shall be deemed fully competent and shall have legal capacity to execute a valid entrustment agreement, including an agreement that provides for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities, and perform all acts related to adoption and shall be as fully bound thereby as if such birth parent had attained the age of 18 years. B. An entrustm ent agreement for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child shall be valid notwithstanding that it is not signed by the birth father of a child born out of wedlock if the identity of the birth father is not rea sonably ascertainable or such birth father did not register with the Virginia Birth Father Registry pursuant to Article 7 (§ 63.2-1249 et seq.) or the birth father named by the birth mother denies under oath and in writing the paternity of the child. An affidavit signed by the birth mother stating that the identity of the birth father is unknown may be filed with the court alleging that the identity of the birth father is not known or reasonably ascertainable. A birth father shall be given notice of the entrustment if he is an acknowledged father pursuant to § 20-49.1, an adjudicated father pursuant to § 20-49.8, a presumed father pursuant to § 63.2-1202, or a putative father who has registered with the Virginia Birth Father Registry pursua nt to Article 7 (§ 63.2-1249 et seq.). If the putative fathers identity is reasonably ascertainable, he shall be given notice pursuant to the requirements of § 63.2-1250. C. When a birt h father is required to be given notice, he may be given notice of the entrustment by registered or certified mail to his last known address. If he fails to object to the entrustment within 15 days of the mailing of such notice, his entrustment shall not be required. An objection to an entrustment agreement shall be in writing, signed by the objecting party or counsel of record for the objecting party and filed with the agency that mailed the notice of entrustment within the time period specified in § 63.2-1223. D. The executi on of an entrustment agreement shall be required of a presumed father except under the following circumstances: (i) if he denies paternity under oath and in writing in accordance with § 63.2-1202; (ii) if the presumption is rebutted by sufficient evid ence, satisfactory to the circuit court, which would establish by a preponderance of the evidence the paternity of another man or the impossibility or improbability of cohabitation of the birth mother and her husband for a period of at least 300 days pre ceding the birth of the child; (iii) if another man admits, in writing and under oath, that he is the biological father; or (iv) if an adoptive placement has been determined to be in the best interests of the child pursuant to § 63.2-1205. E. When none o f the provisions of subsections C and D apply, notice of the entrustment shall be given to the presumed father pursuant to the requirements of § 16.1-277.01. F. An entrustm ent agreement for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child shall be valid notwithstanding that it is not signed by the birth father of a child when the birth father has been convicted of a violation of subsect ion A of § 18.2-61, § 18.2-63, subsection B of § 18.2-366, or an equivalent offense of another state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction, and the child was conceived as a result of such violation. G. A birth fat her may execute an entrustment agreement for the termination of all of his parental rights prior to the birth of the child. Such entrustment shall be subject to the revocation provisions of § 63.2-1223. H. No entrustm ent shall be required of a birth father if he denies under oath and in writing the paternity of the child. Such denial of paternity may be withdrawn no more than 10 days after it is executed. Once the child is 10 days old, any executed denial of paternit y is final and constitutes a waiver of all rights with respect to the adoption of the child and cannot be withdrawn. I. A copy of t he entrustment agreement shall be furnished to all parties signing such agreement. J. When any ag ency outside the Commonwealth, or its agent, that is licensed or otherwise duly authorized to place children for adoption by virtue of the laws under which it operates executes an entrustment agreement in the Commonwealth with a birth parent for the term ination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child, the requirements of §§ 63.2-1221 through 63.2-1224 shall apply. The birth parent may expressly waive, under oath and in writing, the execution of the entrustment under t he requirements of §§ 63.2-1221 through 63.2-1224 in favor of the execution of an entrustment or relinquishment under the laws of another state if the birth parent is represented by independent legal counsel. Such written waiver shall expressly sta te that the birth parent has received independent legal counsel advising of the laws of Virginia and of the other state and that Virginia law is expressly being waived. The waiver also shall include the name, address, and telephone number of such legal c ounsel. Any entrustment agreement that fails to comply with such requirements shall be void.

CASE NOTES Timeliness of revocation.  As a mother had properly and timely executed written revocations of five permanent entrustment agreements with a charity, under subdivision C 2 of § 16.1-283, the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the charitys petitions requesting termination of the mothers residual parental rights as to her five children. Norton v. Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington, Inc., 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 407 (Va . Ct. App. Nov. 13, 2007). No written revocation provided.  Trial court properly relied on entrustment agreements to terminate the mothers residual parental rights where the mother failed to comply with a crucial requi rement of § 63.2-1223, that written revocation of the child-placing agency be provided. Butler v. Culpeper County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 48 Va. App. 537, 633 S.E.2d 196, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 388 (2006). Entrustment agreement was properly approved, because the mother did not deliver written revocation to the Department. Ferrell v. Alexandria Dep't of Cmty. &amp; Human Servs., 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 215 (Va. Ct. App. July 3, 2012). Stipulations properl y relied on at termination.  It was no error to rely, at termination, on stipulations related to a fathers revoked entrustment agreement because (1) such revocation did not revoke the sti pulations, (2) the father conceded the facts supported termination, and (3) the father did not add to the stipulation before the stipulation was entered.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Jurisdiction.  Motion filed by a mother and father to dismiss foster parents adoption petition was granted because the case did not involve a parental placement within the m eaning of §§ 63.2-1230 through 63.2-1240; the custody order did not mention any placement for the purpose of foster care or adoption, and neither birth parent placed the child with the foster parents for adoption. In re Terry, 78 Va. Cir. 25, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 272 (Henrico County Nov. 13, 2008). Parental placement adoption denied.  Petition did not meet the requirements for a parental placement adoption since neither birth parent consented to the placement, a consent hearing had not been con ducted, and the court could not certify compliance with § 63.2-1232, since the trial court did not make a determination regarding the home study and the Virginia Department of Social Services did not recommend the prospective parents for placement. In re Pruett, 87 Va. Cir. 68, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 80 (Roanoke County Aug. 15, 2013). CASE NOTES Subject matter jurisdiction.  Because a juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) district court had no jurisdiction to hear a petition related to consent for adoption that was not a parental plac ement adoption, a circuit court had no subject matter jurisdiction at all to hear the appeal as the circuit court had no more subject matter jurisdiction than the JDR district court had in that courts original proceeding.

The juvenil e and domestic relations district court shall not accept consent until it determines that: 1. The b irth parent(s) are aware of alternatives to adoption, adoption procedures, and opportunities for placement with other adoptive families, and that the birth parents consent is informed and uncoerced. 2. A licensed or duly authorized child-placing agency has counseled the prospective adoptive parents with regard to alternatives to adoption, adoption procedures, including the need to ad dress the parental rights of birth parents, the procedures for terminating such rights, and opportunities for adoption of other children; that the prospective adoptive parents decision is informed and uncoerced; and that they intend to file an adopti on petition and proceed toward a final order of adoption. 3. The birth parent(s) and adoptive parents have exchanged identifying information including but not limited to full names, addresses, physical, mental, social and psychological informati on and any other information necessary to promote the welfare of the child, unless both parties agree in writing to waive the disclosure of full names and addresses. 4. Any financial agreement or exchange of property among the parties and any fees charged or paid for services related to the placement or adoption of the child have been disclosed to the court and that all parties understand that no binding contract regarding placement or adoption of the child exists. 5. There has been no violation of the provisions of § 63.2-1218 in connection with the placement; however, if it appears there has been such violation, the court shall not reject conse nt of the birth parent to the adoption for that reason alone but shall report the alleged violation as required by § 63.2-1219. 6. A licensed or duly authorized child-placing agency has conducted a home study of the prospective adoptive home in accordance with regulations established by the Board and, in the case of home studies by local boards, in accordance with the Mutual Family Assessment home study template and any addenda thereto developed by the Department, and has provided to the court a report of such home study, which shall contain the agencys recom mendation regarding the suitability of the placement. A married couple or an unmarried individual shall be eligible to receive placement of a child for adoption. 7. The birth parent(s) have been informed of their opportunity to be represented by legal counsel. B. The juvenil e and domestic relations district court shall not accept the consent if the requirements of subsection A have not been met. In such cases, it shall refer the birth parent to a licensed or duly authorized child-placing agency for investigation and recomme ndation in accordance with §§ 63.2-1208 and 63.2-1238. If the juvenile and domestic relations district court determines that any of the parties is financially unable to obtain the required services, it shall refer the matter to the local director. C. In cases in which a birth parent who resides in the Commonwealth places his child for adoption with adoptive parents in another state and the laws of that receiving state govern the proceeding for adoption, the birth parent may elect to waive the execution of conse nt pursuant to § 63.2-1233 and instead execute consent to the adoption pursuant to the laws of the receiving state. Any waiver of consent made pursuant to this subsection shall be made under oath and in writing, and shall expressly state that the birt h parent has received independent legal counsel from an attorney licensed in the Commonwealth of Virginia advising him of the laws of the Commonwealth, the laws of the receiving state pursuant to which he elects to consent to the adoption, and the effect s of his waiver of consent pursuant to § 63.2-1233 and election to consent pursuant to the laws of the receiving state. Any waiver of consent and election to consent pursuant to the laws of a receiving state shall include the name, address, and teleph one number of such legal counsel. Failure to comply with this section shall render a waiver of consent pursuant to § 63.2-1233 and election to consent pursuant to the laws of the receiving state as authorized by this subsection invalid. D. When consen t to a parental placement adoption is sought pursuant to this article and the prospective adoptive parent(s) have had continuous physical and legal custody of the child for five or more years, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may, in it s discretion, accept consent without (i) a home study as required by subsection A of § 63.2-1231 and subdivision A 6 of this section and (ii) the meeting and counseling requirements, as they relate to the prospective adoptive parent(s), listed in subs ection A of § 63.2-1231 and subdivision A 2 of this section.

CASE NOTES Hearsay objection to home study report was without merit, where report was prepared and filed pursuant to this section. Peters v. Hagerman, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 365 (Va. Ct. App. June 22, 1999) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Parental placement adoption denied.  Petition did not meet the requirements for a parental placement adoption since neither birth parent consented to the placement, a consent hearing had not been con ducted, and the court could not certify compliance with this section since the trial court did not make a determination regarding the home study and the Virginia Department of Social Services did not recommend the prospective parents for placement.

LEXIS 80 (Roanoke County Aug. 15, 2013).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_63.2-1233"><akn:num>§ 63.2-1233</akn:num><akn:heading>Consent to be executed in juvenile and domestic relations district court; exceptions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When the juvenile and domestic relations district court is satisfied that all requirements of § 63.2-1232 have been met with respect to at least one birth parent and the adoptive child is at least in the third calendar day of life, that birth parent or both birth parents, as the case may be, shall execute consent to the proposed adoption in compliance with the provisions of § 63.2-1202 while before the juvenile a nd domestic relations district court in person and in the presence of the prospective adoptive parents. The juvenile and domestic relations district court shall accept the consent of the birth parent(s) and transfer custody of the child to the prospectiv e adoptive parents, pending notification to any nonconsenting birth parent, as described hereinafter. 1. a. The execution of consent before the juvenile and domestic relations district court shall not be required of a birth father if the birth father consents under oath and in writing to the adoption. b. The consent of a birth father who is not married to the mother of the child at the time of the childs conception or birth shall not be required if the putative father named by the birth mother denies under oath and in writing the paternity of the child or if the putative father did not register with the Virginia Birth Father Registry pursuant to Article 7 (§ 63.2-1249 et seq.) of this chapter. If the identity of the birth father is reasonably ascertainable, but the whereabouts of the birth father are not reasonably ascertainable, verification of compliance with the Virginia Birth Father Registry shall be provided to the court. c. When a birth father is required to be given notice, he may be given notice of the adoption by registered or certified mail to his last known address and if he fails to object to t he adoption within 15 days of the mailing of such notice, his consent shall not be required. An objection shall be in writing, signed by the objecting party or counsel of record for the objecting party and shall be filed with the clerk of the juvenile an d domestic relations district court in which the petition was filed during the business day of the court, within the time period specified in this section. When no timely objection is filed, no hearing on this issue is required. Failure of the objecting party to appear at any scheduled hearing, either in person or by counsel, shall constitute a waiver of such objection. d. The juvenile and domestic relations district court may accept the written consent of the birth father at the time of the childs conception or birth, provided that his identify ing information required in § 63.2-1232 is filed in writing with the juvenile and domestic relations district court of jurisdiction. Such consent shall advise the birth father of his opportunity for legal representation, shall identify the court in wh ich the case was or is intended to be filed, and shall be presented to the juvenile and domestic relations district court for acceptance. The consent may waive further notice of the adoption proceedings and shall contain the name, address and telephone n umber of the birth fathers legal counsel or an acknowledgment that he was informed of his opportunity to be represented by legal counsel and declined such representation. For good cause shown, the court may dispense with the requirements regarding th e filing of the birth fathers identifying information pursuant to this subdivision 1. d. e. In the event that the birth mothers consent is not executed in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, the consent of the birth father shall be executed in the juv enile and domestic relations district court. f. A child born to a married birth mother shall be presumed to be the child of her husband and his consent shall be required, unless the court finds that the fathers consent is w ithheld contrary to the best interests of the child as provided in § 63.2-1205 or if his consent is unobtainable. The consent of such presumed father shall be under oath and in writing and may be executed in or out of court. The presumption that the h usband is the father of the child may be rebutted by sufficient evidence, satisfactory to the juvenile and domestic relations district court, which would establish by a preponderance of the evidence the paternity of another man or the impossibility or im probability of cohabitation of the birth mother and her husband for a period of at least 300 days preceding the birth of the child, in which case the husbands consent shall not be required. The executed denial of paternity by the putative father shal l be sufficient to rebut the presumption that he is the father of the child. If the court is satisfied that the presumption has been rebutted, notice of the adoption shall not be required to be given to the presumed father. 2. After the application of the provisions of subdivision 1, if a birth parent is entitled to a hearing, the birth parent shall be given notice of the date and location of the hearing and be given the opportunity to appear before the juvenile and domestic relations district court. Such hearing may occur subsequent to the proceeding wherein the consenting birth parent appeared but may not be held until 15 days after personal service of no tice on the nonconsenting birth parent, or if personal service is unobtainable, 10 days after the completion of the execution of an order of publication against such birth parent. The juvenile and domestic relations district court may appoint counsel for the birth parent(s). If the juvenile and domestic relations district court finds that consent is withheld contrary to the best interests of the child, as set forth in § 63.2-1205, or is unobtainable, it may grant the petition without such consent and enter an order waiving the requirement of consent of the nonconsenting birth parent and transferring custody of the child to the prospective adoptive parents. No further consent or notice shall be required of a birth parent who fails to appear at any sc heduled hearing, either in person or by counsel. If the juvenile and domestic relations district court denies the petition, the juvenile and domestic relations district court shall order that any consent given for the purpose of such placement shall be v oid and, if necessary, the court shall determine custody of the child as between the birth parents. 3. Except as provided in subdivisions 4 and 5, if consent cannot be obtained from at least one birth parent, the juvenile and domestic relations district court shall deny the petition and determine custody of the child pursuant to § 16.1-278.2. 4. If a child has been under the physical care and custody of the prospective adoptive parents and if both birth parents have failed, without good cause, to appear at a hearing to execute consent under this section for which they were given proper notice pursuant to § 16.1-264, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may grant the petition without the consent of either birth parent and enter an order waiving consent and tra nsferring custody of the child to the prospective adoptive parents. Prior to the entry of such an order, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may appoint legal counsel for the birth parents and shall find by clear and convincing evidence (i ) that the birth parents were given proper notice of the hearing(s) to execute consent and of the hearing to proceed without their consent; (ii) that the birth parents failed to show good cause for their failure to appear at such hearing(s); and (iii) th at pursuant to § 63.2-1205, the consent of the birth parents is withheld contrary to the best interests of the child or is unobtainable. Under this subdivision, the court or the parties may waive the requirement of the simultaneous meeting under § 63.2-1231 and the requirements of subdivisions A 1, A 3, and A 7 of § 63.2-1232 where the opportunity for compliance is not reasonably available under the applicable circumstances. 5. If both birth parents are deceased, the juvenile and domestic relations district court, after hearing evidence to that effect, may grant the petition without the filing of any consent. 6. No consent shall be required from the birth father of a child placed pursuant to this section when such father is convicted of a violation of subsection A of § 18.2-61, § 18.2-63 , subsection B of § 18.2-366, or an equivalent offense of another state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction, and the child was conceived as a result of such violation, nor shall the birth father be entitled to notice of any of the proceedi ngs under this section. 7. No consent shall be required of a birth father if he denies under oath and in writing the paternity of the child. Such denial of paternity may be withdrawn no more than 10 days after i t is executed. Once the child is 10 days old, any executed denial of paternity is final and constitutes a waiver of all rights with the respect to the adoption of the child and cannot be withdrawn. 8. A birth father may consent to the adoption prior to the birth of the child. 9. The juvenile and domestic relations district court shall review each order entered under this section at least annually until such time as the final order of adoption is entered. 10. When there has been an interstate transfer of the child in a parental placement adoption in compliance with Chapter 10 (§ 63.2-1000 et seq.) of this title, all matters relating t o the adoption of the child including, but not limited to, custody and parentage shall be determined in the court of appropriate jurisdiction in the state that was approved for finalization of the adoption by the interstate compact authorities.

By ei ther consenting birth parent for any reason for up to seven days from its execution; however, such seven-day revocation period may be waived in writing at the time of consent provided that the child is at least 10 days old and the consenting birth parent acknowledges having received independent legal counsel regarding the effect of such waiver. In the case of two consenting birth parents, the waiver by one consenting birth parent shall not affect the right of the second consenting birth parent to retain his seven-day revocation period. a. Such revocation shall be in writing, signed by the revoking party or counsel of record for the revoking party and shall be filed with the clerk of the juvenile and domestic relations district court in which the petition was filed during the business day of the juvenile and domestic relations district court, within the time period specified in this section. If the revocation period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or any day on which the clerks office is closed as authorized by statute, t he revocation period shall be extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or other day on which the clerks office is closed as authorized by statute. b. Upon the filing of a valid revocation within the time period set out in this section, the juvenile and domestic relations district court shall order that any consent given for the purpose of such placement is void and, if necessary, the juvenile and domestic relations district court shall determine custody of the child as between the birth parents. 2. By any party prior to the final order of adoption (i) upon proof of fraud or duress or (ii) after placement of the child in an adoptive home, upon written, mutual consent of the birth parents and prospective adoptive parents.

In cases in which the spouse of a birth parent or parent by adoption or a person with a legitimate interest who is not the birth parent of a child wishes to adopt the child, the birth parent or parent by adoption and such parents spouse or other person with a l egitimate interest may file a petition for adoption in the circuit court of the county or city where the birth parent or parent by adoption and such parents spouse or other person with a legitimate interest reside or the county or city where the chil d resides. The petition shall be the joint petition of the birth parent or parent by adoption and such parents spouse or other person with a legitimate interest, but the birth parent or parent by adoption shall unite in the petition for the purpose o f indicating consent to the prayer thereof only. The petition shall also state whether the petitioners seek to change the name of the child. B. The court m ay order the proposed adoption and change of name without referring the matter to the local director if (i) the birth parent or parent by adoption, other than the birth parent or parent by adoption joining in the petition for adoption, is deceased; (ii) the birth parent or parent by adoption, other than the birth parent or parent by adoption joining in the petition for adoption, consents to the adoption in writing and under oath; (iii) the acknowledged, adjudicated, presumed, or putative father denies p aternity of the child; (iv) the birth mother swears under oath and in writing that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable; (v) the child is the result of surrogacy and the birth parent, other than the birth parent joining in the petit ion, consents to the adoption in writing; (vi) the parent by adoption joining in the petition was not married at the time the child was adopted; or (vii) the child is 14 years of age or older and has lived in the home of the person desiring to adopt the child for at least five years.

CASE NOTES Adoption of children conceived through artificial insemination.  Adoption of children by husband whose wife conceived the children through artificial insemination not only establishes and creates rights in the adoptive father a nd the child, but also divests the natural father of all legal rights or obligations with respect to the child; § 32.1-257 and former § 64.1-7.1 do not establish the parent-child relationship with the legal certainty and to the same extent as adopt ion proceedings.

Adoption by stepparent in childrens best interests.  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a stepfather to adopt his wifes biological children, pursuant to § 63.2-1241, over objections by the g uardian ad litem, because the guardian did not avail himself of the opportunity to present evidence or request a formal evidentiary hearing, and the record contained sufficient evidence that the adoption was in the childrens best interests pursuant t o § 63.2-1205. In re C.J.F., 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 344 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 24, 2010). Department of social services report.  Circuit court correctly stated that the report of the department of social services did not investigate factors relevant to determining whether consent of the bir th parent was withheld contrary to the best interest of the child, but the department was not required to investigate those factors because the order of reference did not include such a requirement.

Any man who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman is deemed to be on legal notice that a child may be conceived and that the man is entitled to all legal rights and obligations resulting therefrom. Lack of knowledge of the pregnancy does not excuse failure to timely register with the Virginia Birth Father Registry. B. A man who d esires to be notified of a placement of a child by a local board pursuant to § 63.2-900, a proceeding for adoption, or a proceeding for termination of parental rights regarding a child that he may have fathered shall register with the Virginia Birth F ather Registry. C. Failure to timely register with the Virginia Birth Father Registry shall waive all rights of a man who is not acknowledged to be, presumed to be, or adjudicated the father to withhold consent to an adoption proceeding unless the man was led to believe through the b irth mothers misrepresentation that (i) the pregnancy was terminated or the mother miscarried when in fact the baby was born or (ii) the child died when in fact the child is alive. Upon discovery of the misrepresentation, the man shall register with the Virginia Birth Father Registry within 10 days; however, registration with the Virginia Birth Father Registry shall be untimely if 180 days have elapsed from the date the circuit court entered the final order of adoption. D. A man will not prejudice any rights by failing to register if: 1. A fat her-child relationship between the man and the child has been established pursuant to § 20-49.1, 20-49.8, or if the man is a presumed father as defined in § 63.2-1202; or 2. The man commences a proceeding to adjudicate his paternity before a petition to accept consent or waive adoption consent is filed in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, or before a petition for adoption or a petition for the termination of his parental rights is filed with the court. E. Registratio n is timely if it is received by the Department within 10 days of the childs birth unless the time specified in subsection C or F applies. Registration is complete when the signed registration form is first received by the Department. The signed regi stration form shall be submitted in the manner prescribed by the Department. F. In the even t that the identity and whereabouts of the birth father are reasonably ascertainable, the child-placing agency or adoptive parents shall give written notice to the birth father of the existence of an adoption plan and the availability of registration wit h the Virginia Birth Father Registry. Such written notice shall be provided by personal service, certified mailing with proof of service, or express mailing with proof of delivery to the birth fathers last known address. Registration is timely if the signed registration form is received by the Department within 10 days of personal service of the written notice or within 13 days of the certified or express mailing date of the written notice. The personal service or certified or express mailing may be completed either prior to or after the birth of the child. When written notice is provided to a putative father before the birth of the child, the putative fathers registration with the Virginia Birth Father Registry shall be untimely if received by the Department more than 10 days after personal service of the written notice or more than 13 days after the certified or express mailing date of the written notice, whichever occurs first. G. The child-p lacing agency or adoptive parent(s) shall give notice to a registrant who has timely registered of a placement of a child by a local board pursuant to § 63.2-900, a proceeding for adoption, or a proceeding for termination of parental rights regarding a child. Notice shall be given pursuant to the requirements of this chapter or § 16.1-277.01 for the appropriate adoption proceeding. H. 1. The Department shall prepare a form for registering with the agency that shall requi re (i) the registrants name, date of birth and social security number; (ii) the registrants drivers license number and state of issuance; (iii) the registrants home address, telephone number, and employer; (iv) the name, date of birth, et hnicity, address, and telephone number of the putative mother, if known; (v) the state of conception; (vi) the place and date of birth of the child, if known; (vii) the name and gender of the child, if known; and (viii) the signature of the registrant. N o form for registering with the Virginia Birth Father Registry shall be complete unless signed by the registrant and the signed registration form is received by the Department in the manner prescribed by the Department. 2. The form shall also state that (i) timely registration entitles the registrant to notice of a proceeding for adoption of the child or termination of the registrants parental rights , (ii) registration does not commence a proceeding to establish paternity, (iii) the information disclosed on the form may be used against the registrant to establish paternity, (iv) services to assist in establishing paternity are available to the regis trant through the Department, (v) the registrant should also register in another state if conception or birth of the child occurred in another state, (vi) information on registries of other states may be available from the Department, (vii) the form is s igned under penalty of perjury, and (viii) procedures exist to rescind the registration of a claim of paternity. 3. A registrant shall promptly notify the Virginia Birth Father Registry of any change in information, including change of address. The Department shall incorporate all updated informatio n received into its records but is not required to request or otherwise pursue current or updated information for incorporation in the registry.

CASE NOTES Failure to register.  Circuit court properly denied a putative fathers request to intervene in an adoption proceeding because the father had neither standing to intervene nor a rig ht to withhold his consent to the adoption since the record failed to establish his paternity; the putative father did not register as a putative father before the deadline for doing so expired under the Virginia Putative Father Registry. Chollette v. Ke eling, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 279 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 6, 2015). Timeliness of registration.  Circuit court erred in granting a plea in bar by the adoptive parents and the mother on the basis that the putative father had no standing to appeal a legal decis ion made by the juvenile and domestic relations district court regarding the child because he was entitled to notice and participation in adoption proceedings regarding the child where he timely registered with the Virginia Birth Father Registry, and onc e the mother revoked her consent, the petition had to be denied.

The purpose of adoption assistance is to facilitate adoptive placements and ensure permanency for children with special needs. B. In accordan ce with § 473 of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 673), a child with special needs is a child who is unlikely to be adopted within a reasonable period of time due to one or more of the following factors: 1. Physi cal, mental or emotional condition existing prior to adoption; 2. Hereditary tendency, congenital problem or birth injury leading to substantial risk of future disability; or 3. Individual circumstances of the child related to age, racial or ethnic background or close relationship with one or more siblings. C. A child wit h special needs will be eligible for adoption assistance if (i) the child is a citizen or legal resident of the United States; (ii) the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his parents; and (iii) reasonable efforts to place the child in an appropriate adoptive home without the provision of adoption assistance have been unsuccessful. An exception may be made to the requirement that efforts be made to place the child in an adoptive home without the provision of adoption assistance when it is in the best interest of the child due to factors such as the development of significant emotional ties with his foster parents while in their care and the foster parents wish to adopt the child.

Law Review. For survey of Virginia law on domestic relations for the year 1973-1974, see 60 Va. L. Rev. 1529 (1974). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS When eligibility determination is made.  Making a determination of eligibility for adoption assistance before the termination of parental rights  and thus prior to the childs being legally free f or adoption  is inappropriate because Virginia Department of Social Services regulations and policy require that a child be free for adoption through termination of parental rights in order to be eligible. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012). Local department of social services erred by determining, before a child became free for adoption, that he was not eligible for adoption assistance, as it thereby created a circumstance in which the adoptive parents mere acceptance of the child into their home undercut their later efforts to appeal the eligibility determination. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Au gusta County Mar. 8, 2012). Right to appeal denial of subsidy.  Adoptive familys mere acceptance of a child  particularly when the acceptance is accompanied by the familys clear and unequivocal disagreement with th e adoption subsidy determination  cannot itself serve as a basis for forestalling the adoptive familys statutory right to appeal that determination. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar . 8, 2012). Hard to place due to special needs.  Hearing officers finding that a child was not hard to place due to any special needs was not supported by substantial evidence, as it was based on the testimo ny of employees of a local department of social services regarding their subjective impressions of their ability to place the child in another home without a subsidy. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012). Special needs.  Child had special needs, as 1) his birth parents parental rights were terminated; 2) as a minority, he was hard to place; and 3) he had developed significant emotional ties with his foster family, thereby relieving the department of social services of the requirement to search for a family who would adopt the child without a subsidy. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 16 5 (Augusta County Mar. 8, 2012). Emotional ties.  Requirement to make reasonable efforts to place a child without an adoption subsidy was not met, as the child had developed significant emotional ties with the fo ster family that adopted him; therefore, the local department of social services need not and should not have sought to place him for adoption without a subsidy. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir.

However, the total amount of nonrecurring expense payments made to adoptive parents for the adoption of a child shall not exceed $2,000 or an amount established by federal law.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS When eligibility determination is made.  Local department of social services erred by determining, before a child became free for adoption, that he was not eligible for adoption assistance, as it thereby created a circumstance in which the adoptive parents mere acceptance of the child into their home undercut their later efforts to appeal the eligibility determination. Colavita v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 85 Va. Cir. 51, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Au gusta County Mar. 8, 2012). Making a determination of eligibility for adoption assistance before the termination of parental rights  and thus prior to the childs being legally free f or adoption  is inappropriate because Virginia Department of Social Services regulations and policy require that a child be free for adoption through termination of parental rights in order to be eligible.

Ables v. Rivero, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 83 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2003). Jurisdiction.  Administrative proceedings under the Child Abuse and Neglect Act, § 63.2-1500 et seq., were not criminal in nature, and a grandfathers assertion that the V irginia Department of Social Services lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide a matter for acts that occurred in North Carolina was without merit. C.G. v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 374 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2008). Purpose not punishment.  The purpose of the Child Abuse and Neglect Act former § 63.1-248.1 et seq. (see now § 63.2-1500 et seq.) is not one of punishment and correction of the alle ged abuser. Any possible aspect of punishment is merely ancillary to the primary purpose the registry under the Act serves, which is to protect the abused child and the community from offenders. J.P. v. Carter, 24 Va. App. 707, 485 S.E.2d 162, 1997 Va. A pp. LEXIS 310 (1997) (decided under prior law). The purpose of the Virginia Child Abuse and Neglect Act, § 63.1-248.1 et seq. (see now § 63.2-1501 et seq.) is not one of punishment and correction of the a lleged abuser; rather, under this statute, the policy of protecting abused children and preventing further abuse of those children is key. Ables v. Rivero, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 83 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2003). Effect of Juvenile Law.  The mandates of the Child Abuse and Neglect Act, former § 63.1-248.1 et seq. (see now § 63.2-1500 et seq.), are not superseded by those outlined in the Juve nile Law, § 16.1-226 et seq. J.P. v. Carter, 24 Va. App. 707, 485 S.E.2d 162, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 310 (1997) (decided under prior law). Licensing and ch ild abuse use different standards.  Since a licensing hearing officer reviewed a case against a day care provider under former § 63.1-212, [now § 63.2-1709.1], and the decision was properly re viewed under the Virginia Administrative Process Act, § 2.2-4000 et seq., and a child protective services hearing officer reviewed a child abuse case against the provider under § 63.2-1500 et seq., the hearing officers addressed different areas of governmental concern, and the trial court properly weighed their conclusions in affirming six findings of Level 3 child abuse as founded. Windell v. Va. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 205 (Va. Ct. App. May 5, 2009). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Cases arising within boundaries of United States Naval Weapons Station.  Virginia courts have jurisdiction to issue and enforce orders pursuant to Chapter 11 of Title 16.1 and Title 63.2 for child-protective services cases arising with in the boundaries of the United States Naval Weapons Station. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James E. Barnett, County Attorney for York County, 03-034 (3/3/04). A local department of social services is obligated to provide child welfare services within the Naval Weapons Station, including removal and protective orders, an d to apply current abuse and neglect statutes. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James E. Barnett, County Attorney for York County, 03-034 (3/3/04). Local courts may order social workers to enter the Naval Weapons Station to perform home studies and conduct investigations regarding allegations of abuse, neglec t, or delinquency. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James E. Barnett, County Attorney for York County, 03-034 (3/3/04). Releas e of information to local commissioner of revenue.  This section does not prohibit a landlord or managing agent of an apartment complex from releasing to the local commissioner of the revenue a tenant list and vehi cle information. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Geraldine M. Whiting, Commissioner of the Revenue for Arlington County, 03-022 (10/8/03). Entry of the name of an individual acquitted of criminal charges related to child abuse and neglect on the Child Abuse and Neglect Central Registry does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Mark L. Cole, Member, House of Delegates, 03-089 (12/1/03).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_63.2-1502"><akn:num>§ 63.2-1502</akn:num><akn:heading>Establishment of Child-Protective Services Unit; duties</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text There is created a Child-Protective Services Unit in the Department that shall have the following powers and duties: 1.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Reports by advocates.  Advocates in domestic violence shelters and sexual assault crisis centers generally are not statutorily mandated to report child abuse and neglect. However, when such an advocate performs activities that would place him under any of the categories in subsection A of § 63.2-1509, he would be required to report suspected child abuse or neglect.

If a teache r, principal or other person employed by a local school board or employed in a school operated by the Commonwealth is suspected of abusing or neglecting a child in the course of his educational employment, the complaint shall be investigated in accordanc e with §§ 63.2-1503, 63.2-1505 and 63.2-1516.1. Pursuant to § 22.1-279.1, no teacher, principal or other person employed by a school board or employed in a school operated by the Commonwealth shall subject a student to corporal punishment. Howev er, this prohibition of corporal punishment shall not be deemed to prevent (i) the use of incidental, minor or reasonable physical contact or other actions designed to maintain order and control; (ii) the use of reasonable and necessary force to quell a disturbance or remove a student from the scene of a disturbance that threatens physical injury to persons or damage to property; (iii) the use of reasonable and necessary force to prevent a student from inflicting physical harm on himself; (iv) the use o f reasonable and necessary force for self-defense or the defense of others; or (v) the use of reasonable and necessary force to obtain possession of weapons or other dangerous objects or controlled substances or paraphernalia that are upon the person of the student or within his control. In determining whether the actions of a teacher, principal or other person employed by a school board or employed in a school operated by the Commonwealth are within the exceptions provided in this section, the local de partment shall examine whether the actions at the time of the event that were made by such person were reasonable. B. For purpose s of this section, corporal punishment, abuse, or neglect shall not include physical pain, injury or discomfort caused by the use of incidental, minor or reasonable physical contact or other actions designed to maintain order and control as permitted in clause (i) of subsection A or the use of reasonable and necessary force as permitted by clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) of subsection A, or by participation in practice or competition in an interscholastic sport, or participati on in physical education or an extracurricular activity. C. If, after a n investigation of a complaint under this section, the local department determines that the actions or omissions of a teacher, principal, or other person employed by a local school board or employed in a school operated by the Commonwealth were within su ch employees scope of employment and were taken in good faith in the course of supervision, care, or discipline of students, then the standard in determining if a report of abuse or neglect is founded is whether such acts or omissions constituted gro ss negligence or willful misconduct. D. Each local department and local school division shall adopt a written interagency agreement as a protocol for investigating child abuse and neglect reports. The interagency agreement shall be based on recommended procedures for conducting investigations developed b y the Departments of Education and Social Services.

The 2014 amendments. The 2014 amendment by c. 412 deleted against school personnel at the end of the first sentence in subsection D. CASE NOTES Willful Misconduct Found.  Substantial evidence supported the agencys determination that a teacher committed willful misconduct when the teacher dragged a student down the hallway and i nto a carpeted office, resulting in a rug burn.

History History. 1975, c. 341, § 63.1-248.5; 1988, c. 686; 2002, c. 747. Annotations Law Review. For survey of Virginia law on domestic relations for the year 1974-1975, see 61 Va. L. Rev. 1732 (1975). CASE NOTES Immunity attaches to both mandatory and voluntary reporters.  In fact, the standards for immunity, a presumptive protection absent bad faith or malice, are the same; the main difference between the two types of reporters lie s not in the level of immunity provided but rather in the penalty for failure to report, which applies only to mandatory reporters. Wolf v. Fauquier County Bd. of Supervisors, 555 F.3d 311, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 2256 (4th Cir. 2009). Section 63.2-1512 provides that immunity will dissolve only in those infrequent circumstances where someone used the reporting system for purposes other than that for which it was designed  namely, the protection of children. Wolf v. Fauquier County Bd. of Supervisors, 555 F.3d 311, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 2256 (4th Cir. 2009). Negligence is not bad faith.  Counseling center and the life coach were immune from suit on defamation, breach of contract of confidentiality, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotion al distress claims under § 63.2-1512, as all arose directly out of the coachs report of suspected child abuse; viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs suggested that the coach was at worst negligent in making the report and negligence was a far cry from bad faith. Wolf v. Fauquier County Bd. of Supervisors, 555 F.3d 311, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 2256 (4th Cir. 2009). Bad faith alleged.  In an action by a father claiming that his daughter was coerced to falsely accuse him of sexual abuse, a social workers motion to dismiss was denied because t he father sufficiently alleged bad faith on the part of the social worker, so as to overcome her defense under Virginias reporters immunity statute; the father alleged that the social worker told a news reporter that he was guilty of abuse after he had been found innocent in state court. Nelson v. Green, 965 F. Supp. 2d 732, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115479 (W.D. Va. 2013). Bad faith not alleged.  In parents claims arising from a local social services departments removal of their children due to suspected child abuse, the social services caseworkers and the state social services department were entitled to qualified immunity because there was no showing that they acted in bad faith or with a malign motive. Parker v. Henry &amp; William Evans Home for Children, Inc., 762 Fed. Appx. 147, 2019 U.S. App. L EXIS 6336 (4th Cir. 2019). Parent failed to overcome the strong presumption that a school principal who reported teachers concerns about the parents child to child protective servic es was entitled to immunity as a mandatory reporter even though child protective services investigated the matter and was not concerned with the parents interactions with the parents children because defendant did not show that the principals referral to child protective services was done in bad faith or with malicious intent.

Annotations Cross references. As to punishment for Class 6 felonies, see § 18.2-10. As to punishment for Class 1 misdemeanors, see § 18.2-11. CASE NOTES Evidence sufficient.  Evidence clearly established that defendant did unlawfully make and cause to be made a false report of child abuse because her daughter acted as an innocent agent for defendant, who was therefore guilty as a principal in the first degree; because defendant engaged in actions that caused her daughter to commit a crime as an innocent agent of defendant, she was guilty of giving a false report to law-enforcement as a principal in the first degree. Gibson v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 174 (Va. Ct. App. July 23, 2019). Trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to convict defendant of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, making a false report of child abus e or neglect, and giving a false report to a law-enforcement official because it was entitled to reject defendants theory that she did not cause her daughter to fabricate child abuse; it was reasonable to infer that defendant used an audio file to he lp her daughter provide a full account of the alleged child abuse to authorities.

The local d epartment shall retain the records of all reports or complaints made pursuant to this chapter, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board. However, all records related to founded cases of child sexual abuse involving injuries or conditions, real or threatened, that result in or were likely to have resulted in serious harm to a child shall be maintained by the local department for a period of 25 years from the date of the complaint. B. The Departm ent shall maintain a child abuse and neglect information system that includes a central registry of founded complaints, pursuant to § 63.2-1515. The Department shall maintain all (i) unfounded investigations, (ii) family assessments, and (iii) reports or complaints determined to be not valid in a record which is separate from the central registry and accessible only to the Department and to local departments for child-protective services. The purpose of retaining these complaints or reports is to pro vide local departments with information regarding prior complaints or reports. In no event shall the mere existence of a prior complaint or report be used to determine that a subsequent complaint or report is founded. The subject of the complaint or repo rt is the person who is alleged to have committed abuse or neglect. The subject of the complaint or report shall have access to his own record. The record of unfounded investigations that involved reports of child abuse or neglect shall be purged three y ears after the date of the complaint or report if there are no subsequent complaints or reports regarding the same child or the person who is the subject of the complaint or report within such three-year period. Records of complaints and reports determin ed to be not valid shall be purged one year after the date of the complaint or report if there are no subsequent complaints or reports regarding the same child or the person who is the subject of the complaint or report in that one year. The local depart ment shall retain such records for an additional period of up to two years if requested in writing by the person who is the subject of such complaint or report. The record of family assessments shall be purged three years after the date of the complaint or report if there are no subsequent complaints or reports regarding the same child or the person who is the subject of the report in that three-year period. The child-protective services records regarding the petitioner which result from such complaint or report shall be purged immediately by any custodian of such records upon presentation to the custodian of a certified copy of a court order that there has been a civil action that determined that the complaint or report was made in bad faith or with m alicious intent. After purging the records, the custodian shall notify the petitioner in writing that the records have been purged. C. At the time the local department notifies a person who is the subject of a complaint or report made pursuant to this chapter that such complaint or report is either an unfounded investigation or a completed family assessment, it shall notify him how long the record will be retained and of the availability of the procedures set out in this section regarding reports or complaints alleged to be made in bad faith or with malicious intent. Upon request, the local department shall advise the person who was the subject o f an unfounded investigation if the complaint or report was made anonymously. However, the identity of a complainant or reporter shall not be disclosed. D. Any person who is the subject of an unfounded report or complaint made pursuant to this chapter who believes that such report or complaint was made in bad faith or with malicious intent may petition the circuit court in the jurisdiction in which the report or compl aint was made for the release to such person of the records of the investigation or family assessment. Such petition shall specifically set forth the reasons such person believes that such report or complaint was made in bad faith or with malicious inten t. Upon the filing of such petition, the circuit court shall request and the local department shall provide to the circuit court its records of the investigation or family assessment for the circuit courts in camera review. The petitioner shall be en titled to present evidence to support his petition. If the circuit court determines that there is a reasonable question of fact as to whether the report or complaint was made in bad faith or with malicious intent and that disclosure of the identity of th e complainant would not be likely to endanger the life or safety of the complainant, it shall provide to the petitioner a copy of the records of the investigation or family assessment. The original records shall be subject to discovery in any subsequent civil action regarding the making of a complaint or report in bad faith or with malicious intent.

Department of Social Services (DSS) not entitled to present evidence.  Under the procedure established by this section, the DSS is not given the right to present evidence in opposition to a petition for the disclosure of records of a n investigation in which a report or complaint against the petitioner was found not founded nor is the court required to conduct an evidentiary hearing before granting such a petition. Gloucester County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Kennedy, 256 Va. 40 0, 507 S.E.2d 81, 1998 Va. LEXIS 150 (1998). Purpose of retention of unfounded reports.  Department of Social Services own guidelines recognize the possibility of harm to a person wrongly accused of child abuse because in Unfounded cases, DSS must retain the report of the disposition in the central registry for up to two years if the individual involved so requests (see § 63.2-1514). The obvious purpose is to allow an accused abuser to prove to others that the charge was without merit. Jackson v. Marshall, 19 Va. App. 628, 454 S.E.2d 23, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 147 (1995). St anding to appeal expungement of name of suspected abuser.  Father of an allegedly sexually abused child did not have standing under the Administrative Process Act to appeal the ruling of the Commissioner of Social Service s that expunged the name of the suspected abuser from the central registry for child abuse and neglect.

Text The local department shall, at the initial time of contact with the person subject to a child abuse and neglect investigation, advise such person of the complaints or a llegations made against the person, in a manner that is consistent with laws protecting the rights of the person making the report or complaint. In cases where a child is alleged to have been abused or neglected by a teacher, principal or other person em ployed by a local school board or employed in a school operated by the Commonwealth, in the course of such employment in a nonresidential setting, the provisions of § 63.2-1516.1 shall also apply.

The written notification shall include the information that the alleged abuser or neglector has the right to have an attorney or other representative of his choice present during his i nterviews. However, the failure by a representative of the Department of Social Services to so advise the subject of the complaint shall not cause an otherwise voluntary statement to be inadmissible in a criminal proceeding. 4. Written notification of the findings shall be submitted to the alleged abuser or neglector. The notification shall include a summary of the investigation and an explanation of how the information gathered supports the disposition. 5. The written notification of the findings shall inform the alleged abuser or neglector of his right to appeal. 6. The written notification of the findings shall inform the alleged abuser or neglector of his right to review information about himself in the record with the following exceptions: a. The identity of the person making the report. b. Information provided by any law-enforcement official. c. Information that may endanger the well-being of the child. d. The identity of a witness or any other person if such release may endanger the life or safety of such witness or person. B.

A physician or child-protective services worker of a local department or law-enforcement official investigating a report or complaint of abuse and neglect may take a child into custody for up to 72 hours without prior approval of parents or guardians provided: 1. The c ircumstances of the child are such that continuing in his place of residence or in the care or custody of the parent, guardian, custodian or other person responsible for the childs care, presents an imminent danger to the childs life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would be likely to result or if evidence of abuse is perishable or subject to deterioration before a hearing can be held; 2.

The local department shall also notify the Child-Protective Services Unit within the Department whenever a child is taken into custody. D. When a chil d is taken into custody by a child-protective services worker of a local department pursuant to subsection C, that child shall be returned as soon as practicable to the custody of his parent or guardian. However, the local department shall not be require d to return the child to his parent or guardian if the circumstances are such that continuing in his place of residence or in the care or custody of such parent or guardian, or custodian or other person responsible for the childs care, presents an im minent danger to the childs life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would be likely to result or if the evidence of abuse is perishable or subject to deterioration before a hearing can be held. If the local department cannot r eturn the child to the custody of his parents or guardians within 72 hours, the local department shall obtain an emergency removal order pursuant to § 16.1-251.

It is not an unconstitutional denial of equal protection for children taken into protect ive custody under this section in order to protect them from imminent harm to be afforded different procedural protections than children taken into custody under subsections B through D of § 16.1-246 on suspicion of criminal or other misconduct. Jorda n v. Jackson, 15 F.3d 333, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 1488 (4th Cir. 1994). The Equal Protection Clause is not violated by the absence from this section (and the pr esence in § 16.1-247) of a requirement of administrative intake officer review prior to continued detention; the difference in procedures is neither irrational nor capricious. Jordan v. Jackson, 15 F.3d 333, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 1488 (4th Cir. 1994). Judicial review may be del ayed over a weekend.  The balance struck by the state between private and public interests is compatible with the requirements of procedural due process, and is reinforced by the fact that states across the country have struck the same or a similar balance when confronted with the identical question; Virginias judgment that judicial review may be delayed over a weekend without compromising the procedural due process rights of pare nts or children is shared by well over a majority of the states.

Virginia Forms (Matthew Bender). No. 9-215. Child Protective Order  Abuse and Neglect. CASE NOTES Applicability.  Because there was no objection to the admission of a childs statement into evidence, the trial court erred in subsequently excluding the statement based on it s application of § 63.2-1522; the childs statement did not describe an act of a sexual nature, and § 63.2-1522 was inapplicable. Anonymous C v. Anonymous B, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2011). This section does not establish a presumption, rebuttable or otherwise, that statements made by children regarding sexual acts are true; instead, it provides that out-of-court statements by children are admissible under certain circumstances, one of which is that the statements possess particularized guarantees of trustworthiness and re liability; thus, a courts ruling that statements are admissible under the section is a ruling only on the threshold question of admissibility and does not establish the weight to be given to the evidence. Fairfax County Dept. Of Family Services v . Neidig, No. 1303-97-4 (Ct. of Appeals March 31, 1998) (decided under prior law). Out-of-court statements made to therapist.  Any error by the trial court in admitting into evidence the testimony of the therapist of the older daughter, who was living in Texas, regarding her out-of-court statements concerning sexual abuse by her father and her mothers awareness of the abuse was harmless error in view of the overwhelming evidence supporting the trial courts ultimate holding. The statements played no part in the courts analysis under subdivision C 2 of § 16.1-283 in terminating the mothers parental rights as to the younger daughter as the court focused on the mothers inability to maintain adequate housing and provide a safe environment for the child over a two-year period. B. W. v. Richmond Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 698 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2003). Exclus ion of childs disclosures of sexual abuse proper.  Trial court did not err in excluding disclosures of sexual abuse a child made to a doctor and another individual because the trial court specifically referenced t he disclosures of sexual abuse, and its rulings on the statements were supported with findings on the record as required by subsection E of § 63.2-1522; the trial court found that the doctor violated the protocol of the forensic model she purported to follow and that her evaluation of the child was tainted by mothers inflammatory description of fathers alleged actions, and those findings alone would be sufficient to support the trial courts ruling. Anonymous C v. Anonymous B, 2011 Va. App . LEXIS 14 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2011). Ex clusion of childs disclosures of sexual abuse improper.  Trial court erred in excluding a childs disclosures of sexual abuse without making required findings because the trial court identified each of the twelve fac tors of trustworthiness and reliability enumerated in subsection D of § 63.2-1522 and explained how it considered each factor, but throughout its explanation, the trial court referred only to the disclosures made to two people, and at no point did the trial court reference disclosures of sexual abuse made by the child to a doctor or anyone else; the consistent use of the term statement in the singular form in § 63.2-1522 clearly indicates the General Assemblys intent that each disclosu re of sexual abuse must be analyzed individually. Anonymous C v. Anonymous B, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2011). Admission of childs testimony pr oper.  Where a mother conceded that there was testimony regarding the childs fear about testifying in front of her mother and her father, and the trial court noted t hat there was significant testimony that the child has expressed a fear or demonstrated a fear of talking about the difficult subject matters in the presence of the mother or even fear that the mother would find out that she was talking about those thing s, the trial court did not err in ruling that the child was unavailable to testify. Ferrell v. Alexandria Dep't of Cmty. &amp; Human Servs., 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 40 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 2012). Harmless error.  Assuming the oldest childs statement as to sexual abuse was admitted in error, the error was harmless as there was sufficient other evidence that the children were sexually abused as: (1) they colored on their vaginas with markers and played a game of sticking things in their vaginas; (2) the mother observed the youngest child touching herself inappropriately; (3) the oldest child reacted violently when the f athers name was mentioned; (4) the oldest childs behavior had deteriorated, requiring hospitalization; and (5) a psychologist testified that the oldest childs behaviors were highly consistent with sexual abuse and described the youngest child s behaviors that suggested sexual abuse.

If, after hearing the facts of the case, the hearing officer determines that the person who is the subject of the report h as presented information that was not available to the local department at the time of the local conference and which if available may have resulted in a different determination by the local department, he may remand the case to the local department for reconsideration. The local department shall have 14 days in which to reconsider the case. If, at the expiration of 14 days, the local department fails to act or fails to amend the record to the satisfaction of the appellant, the case shall be returned to the hearing officer for a determination.

CASE NOTES Even if prior abuse of children by parent would be inadmissible in a judicial proceeding, admission of such acts in an administrative proceeding is not error. The rules of evidence are considerably relaxed in administrative proceedings, and the findings of administrative agencies will not be reversed solely because evidence was received wh ich would have been inadmissible in court.

Jurisdiction.  Failure to comply with the procedure at issue in the instant case did not divest either the agency or the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction.

Each local board, to the extent that federal or state matching funds are made available to each locality, shall provide, pursuant to regulations and subject to supervision of the Commissioner for Aging and Rehabilitative Services, adult protective services for adul ts who are found to be abused, neglected, or exploited and who meet one of the following criteria: (i) the adult is 60 years of age or older or (ii) the adult is 18 years of age or older and is incapacitated. The requirement to provide such services shal l not limit the right of any individual to refuse to accept any of the services so offered, except as provided in § 63.2-1608. B. Upon receip t of the report pursuant to § 63.2-1606, the local department shall determine the validity of such report and shall initiate an investigation within 24 hours of the time the report is received in the local department. Local departments shall consider valid any report meeting all of the following criteria: (i) the subject of the report is an adult as defined in this article, (ii) the report concerns a specific adult and there is enough information to locate the adult, and (iii) the report describes th e circumstances of the alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation. C. The local d epartment or the adult protective services hotline shall immediately refer the matter and all relevant documentation to the local law-enforcement agency where the adult resides or where the alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation took place or, if these places are unknown, where the alleged abuse, neglect, or exploitation was discovered for investigation, upon receipt of an initial report pursuant to § 63.2-1606 involving any of the following or upon determining, during the course of an investigation pursuant to this article, the occurrence of any of the following: 1.

D. The local d epartment shall refer any appropriate matter and all relevant documentation, to the appropriate licensing, regulatory, or legal authority for administrative action or criminal investigation. E.

Upon a showing of good cause suppo rted by an affidavit or testimony in person, the court may enter an order permitting such access or entry. F. In any case of suspected adult abuse, neglect, or exploitation, local departments, with the informed consent of the adult or his legal representative, shall take or cause to be taken photographs, video recordings, or appropriate medical imaging of the adult and his environment as long as such measures are relevant to the investigation and do not conflict with § 18.2-386.1. However, if the adult is determined to be incapable of making an informed decision and of giving informed consent and either has no legal re presentative or the legal representative is the suspected perpetrator of the adult abuse, neglect, or exploitation, consent may be given by an agent appointed under an advance medical directive or medical power of attorney, or by a person authorized, pur suant to § 54.1-2986.

Upon petiti on by the local department to the circuit court, the court may issue an order authorizing the provision of adult protective services on an emergency basis to an adult after finding on the record, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that: 1. The a dult is incapacitated; 2. An emergency exists; 3. The adult lacks the capacity to consent to receive adult protective services; and 4. The proposed order is substantially supported by the findings of the local department that has investigated the case, or if not so supported, there are compelling reasons for ordering services. B. In issuing an emergency order, the court shall adhere to the following limitations: 1. Only such adult protective services as are necessary to improve or correct the conditions creating the emergency shall be ordered, and the court shall designate the approved services in its order. In ordering adult protective services the court shall consider the right of a person to rely on nonmedical remedial treatment in accordance with a recognized religious method of healing in lieu of medical care. 2.

Approval of the hospitalization or change of residence shall be stated in the order. No adult may be committed to a mental health facility under this section. 3. Adult protective services may be provided through an appropriate court order only for a period of 15 days.

In its order the court shall appoint the petitioner or another interested person, as temporary guardian of the adult with responsibility for the adults welfare and authority to giv e consent for the adult for the approved adult protective services until the expiration of the order. 5. When applicable, the court shall appoint the petitioner or another interested person as temporary conservator of the adult with responsibility and authority limited to managing the adu lts estate and financial affairs related to the approved adult protective services until the expiration of the order. 6. The issuance of an emergency order and the appointment of a temporary guardian or temporary conservator shall not deprive the adult of any rights except to the extent provided for in t he order or appointment. 7. The court shall set the bond of the temporary guardian and the bond and surety, if any, of the temporary conservator. 8. Upon a finding that the adult has been, within a reasonable period of time, subjected to an act of violence, force, or threat or been subjected to financial exploitation, the court may include in its order one or more of the following conditions to be imposed on the alleged perpetrator: (i) prohibition on acts of violence, force, or threat or criminal offenses that may result in injury to person or property; (ii) prohibition on such o ther contacts by the alleged perpetrator with the adult or the adults family or household members as the court deems necessary for the health and safety of such persons; or (iii) such other conditions as the court deems necessary to prevent (a) acts of violence, force, or threat; (b) criminal offenses that may result in injury to persons or property; (c) communication or other contact of any kind by the alleged perpetrator; or (d) financial exploitation by the alleged perpetrator. Any person who vio lates a condition imposed pursuant to this subdivision is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. C.

As used in this section, person means any individual; corporation; partnership; association; limited liability company; local government; state agency, including any department, institution, authority, instrumentality, board, or other administrative agency of the Commonwealth; or other legal or commercial entity that operates or maintains a child welfare agency, adult day care center, or assisted living facility. B. Every perso n who constitutes, or who operates or maintains, an assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency shall obtain the appropriate license from the Commissioner, which may be renewed. However, no license shall be required for an ad ult day care center that provides services only to individuals enrolled in a Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly program operated in accordance with an agreement between the provider, the Department of Medical Assistance Services and the Cente rs for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Commissioner, upon request, shall consult with, advise, and assist any person interested in securing and maintaining any such license. Each application for a license shall be made to the Commissioner, in such fo rm as he may prescribe. It shall contain the name and address of the applicant and, if the applicant is an association, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the names and addresses of its officers and agents. The application shall also contain a description of the activities proposed to be engaged in and the facilities and services to be employed, together with other pertinent information as the Commissioner may require. In the case of an application for licensure as a childrens r esidential facility, the application shall also contain information regarding any complaints, enforcement actions, or sanctions against a license to operate a childrens residential facility held by the applicant in another state. C. The license s shall be issued on forms prescribed by the Commissioner. Any two or more licenses may be issued for concurrent operation of more than one assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency, but each license shall be issued upon a separate form. Each license and renewals thereof for an assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency may be issued for periods of up to three successive years, unless sooner revoked or surrendered. D. The length of each license or renewal thereof for an assisted living facility shall be based on the judgment of the Commissioner regarding the compliance history of the facility and the extent to which it meets or exceeds state licensing standards. On the basis of this judgment, the Commissioner may issue licenses or renewals thereof for periods of six months, one year, two years, or three years. E. The Commiss ioner may extend or shorten the duration of licensure periods for a child welfare agency whenever, in his sole discretion, it is administratively necessary to redistribute the workload for greater efficiency in staff utilization. F. Each licens e shall indicate the maximum number of persons who may be cared for in the assisted living facility, adult day care center, or child welfare agency for which it is issued. G. The license and any other documents required by the Commissioner shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the licensed premises. H. Every perso n issued a license that has not been suspended or revoked shall renew such license prior to its expiration. I.

Upon receip t and verification by the Commissioner of information from any source indicating an imminent and substantial risk of harm to residents, the Commissioner may require an assisted living facility to contract with an individual licensed by the Board of Long- Term Care Administrators, to be either selected from a list created and maintained by the Department of Medical Assistance Services or selected from a pool of appropriately licensed administrators recommended by the owner of the assisted living facility, to administer, manage, or operate the assisted living facility on an interim basis, and to attempt to bring the facility into compliance with all relevant requirements of law, regulation, or any plan of correction approved by the Commissioner. Such cont ract shall require the interim administrator to comply with any and all requirements established by the Department to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the residents. Prior to or upon conclusion of the period of interim administration, management , or operation, an inspection shall be conducted to determine whether operation of the assisted living facility shall be permitted to continue or should cease. Such interim administration, management, or operation shall not be permitted when defects in t he conditions of the premises of the assisted living facility (i) present immediate and substantial risks to the health, safety, and welfare of residents, and (ii) may not be corrected within a reasonable period of time. Any decision by the Commissioner to require the employment of a person to administer, manage, or operate an assisted living facility shall be subject to the rights of judicial review and appeal as provided in the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). Actual and reasonable costs of such interim administration shall be the responsibility of and shall be borne by the owner of the assisted living facility. B. The Board s hall adopt regulations for the Commissioner to use in determining when the imposition of administrative sanctions or initiation of court proceedings, severally or jointly, is appropriate in order to ensure prompt correction of violations in assisted livi ng facilities and adult day care centers involving noncompliance with state law or regulation as discovered through any inspection or investigation conducted by the Departments of Social Services, Health, or Behavioral Health and Developmental Services. The Commissioner may impose such sanctions or take such actions as are appropriate for violation of any of the provisions of this subtitle or any regulation adopted under any provision of this subtitle that adversely affects the health, safety or welfare of an assisted living facility resident or an adult day care participant. Such sanctions or actions may include (i) petitioning the court to appoint a receiver for any assisted living facility or adult day care center and (ii) revoking or denying renewa l of the license for the assisted living facility or adult day care center for violation of any of the provisions of this subtitle, § 54.1-3408 or any regulation adopted under this subtitle that violation adversely affects, or is an immediate and subs tantial threat to, the health, safety or welfare of the person cared for therein, or for permitting, aiding or abetting the commission of any illegal act in an assisted living facility or adult day care center. C. The Commiss ioner may issue a notice of summary suspension of the license to operate the assisted living facility pursuant to (i) for assisted living facilities operated by agencies of the Commonwealth, the procedures set forth in § 63.2-1710.1 or (ii) for all ot her assisted living facilities, the procedures hereinafter set forth in conjunction with any proceeding for revocation, denial, or other action when conditions or practices exist that pose an immediate and substantial threat to the health, safety, and we lfare of the residents. The notice of summary suspension shall set forth (a) the summary suspension procedures, (b) hearing and appeal rights as provided under this subsection, (c) facts and evidence that formed the basis for which the summary suspension is sought, and (d) the time, date, and location of the hearing to determine whether the suspension is appropriate. Such notice shall be served on the assisted living facility or its designee as soon as practicable thereafter by personal service or certi fied mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record of the assisted living facility.The summary suspension hearing shall be presided over by a hearing officer selected by the Commissioner from a list prepared by the Executive Secretary of the S upreme Court of Virginia and shall be held as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days following service of the notice of hearing; however, the hearing officer may grant a written request for a continuance, not to exceed an additi onal 10 business days, for good cause shown. Within 10 business days after such hearing, the hearing officer shall provide to the Commissioner written findings and conclusions, together with a recommendation as to whether the license should be summarily suspended.Within 10 business days of the receipt of the hearing officers findings, conclusions, and recommendation, the Commissioner may issue a final order of summary suspension or an order that such summary suspension is not warranted by the facts and circumstances presented. The Commissioner shall adopt the hearing officers recommended decision unless to do so would be an error of law or Department policy. In the event that the Commissioner rejects a hearing officers findings, conclusions , or recommended decision, the Commissioner shall state with particularity the basis for rejection. In issuing a final order of summary suspension, the Commissioner may suspend the license of the assisted living facility or suspend only certain authority of the assisted living facility to provide certain services or perform certain functions that the Commissioner determines should be restricted or modified in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the residents receiving care. A final order of summary suspension shall include notice that the assisted living facility may appeal the Commissioners decision to the appropriate circuit court no later than 10 days following service of the order. A copy of any final order of summary suspension shall be prominently displayed by the provider at each public entrance of the facility, or in lieu thereof, the provider may display a written statement summarizing the terms of the order in a prominent location, printed in a clear and legible size and typeface, and identifying the location within the facility where the final order of summary suspension may be reviewed.Upon appeal, the sole issue before the court shall be whether the Department had reasonable grounds to require the assisted living faci lity to cease operations during the pendency of the concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding. Any concurrent revocation, denial, or other proceeding shall not be affected by the outcome of any hearing on the appropriateness of the summary suspe nsion. The willful and material failure to comply with the final order of summary suspension shall constitute an offense under subdivision 3 of § 63.2-1712. At the request of the Commissioner, all agencies and subdivisions of the Commonwealth shall co operate with the Commissioner in the relocation of residents of an assisted living facility whose license has been summarily suspended pursuant to this section and in any other actions necessary to reduce the risk of further harm to residents. D.

In determining whether to deny, revoke, or summarily suspend a license, the Commissioner may choose to deny, revoke, or summarily suspe nd only certain authority of the assisted living facility to operate and may restrict or modify the assisted living facilitys authority to provide certain services or perform certain functions that the Commissioner determines should be restricted or modified in order to protect the health, safety, or welfare of the residents. Such proposed denial, revocation, or summary suspension of certain services or functions may be appealed (i) if the assisted living facility is operated by an agency of the Com monwealth in accordance with the provisions of § 63.2-1710.2 and (ii) for all other assisted living facilities as otherwise provided in this subtitle for any denial, revocation, or summary suspension.

CASE NOTES Public policy.  Former employee alleged that she was terminated because she provided information regarding the health and safety of residents of defendants assisted living fa cility in response to the state investigators inquiry; the rights and protections conferred on employees were precisely designed to further Virginias public policy seeking to ensure the health and well-being of the States aged populace.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Parens patriae.  Corporations demurrer to the Commonwealths complaint, which was brought by the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Virginia Department of Social Servi ces Division of Child Support Enforcement as parens patriae and alleged that the corporation conducted illegal child support collection practices, was sustained in part and overruled in part because to the extent that the pleadings sought to recover mone y damages for parents or children allegedly wronged by the corporations practices, such recovery was not allowed under parens patriae when the role of parens patriae was not to vindicate the personal rights of citizens; the claims seeking equitable, declaratory, and other relief were appropriate under the doctrine of parens patriae to protect Virginia citizenry because damages the Commonwealth sought on its own behalf would be maintainable since those claims were permissible to redress commercial an d other interests of the Commonwealth itself, and the Commonwealth was able to seek recovery of payments from the corporation to which it was itself entitled as, for example, in cases of reimbursement for public assistance, which was allegedly misdirecte d by the corporations actions.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 9B M.J. Infants and Juveniles, § 2. CASE NOTES Editors note. The case annotated below was decided under prior law. Departments involvement in support obligations.  Former § 63.1-250.2 and § 63.1-274.4 (see now §§ 63.2-1904 and 63.2-1949) clearly contemplate that the Department would be involved in establishing, m odifying, and enforcing support obligations. Jones v. Division of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Owens, 19 Va. App. 184, 450 S.E.2d 172, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (1994). Authorit y for Departments judicial enforcement rule.  While former § 63.1-251 (see now § 63.2-1908) authorizes the Department to petition the appropriate court to collect a debt that occurs as the result of pay ment of public assistance, nothing in that statute provides that, in all circumstances, former § 63.1-251 (see now § 63.2-1908) is the exclusive authorization for the Department to seek judicial relief. By not limiting the services that the Departm ent may provide and by authorizing the Department to enforce and collect child support obligations, former § 63.1-250.2 (see now § 63.2-1904) gives the Department implicit authority to seek judicial enforcement of its administrative orders in a man ner consistent with the proviso in subparagraph 4. Jones v. Division of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Owens, 19 Va. App. 184, 450 S.E.2d 172, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (1994). Division may act as party on appeal.  Nothing in subparagraph 4 denies the Division of Child Support Enforcement the right to act as a party in court when an obligor appeals from an administrative age ncy case decision. Subparagraph 4 just prevents the Division from taking administrative actions to enforce support payments that are in arrears unless the arrearages have accrued under a prior court or administrative order. Jones v. Division of Child Sup port Enforcement ex rel. Owens, 19 Va. App. 184, 450 S.E.2d 172, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (1994). Actions not violation of subparagr aph 4.  Where Division did nothing more than defend against appeal from administrative order to the juvenile court and prosecute an appeal to the circuit court to uphold the administrative order, such actions could not be fairly characterized as enforcement of support in arrears in violation of subparagraph 4. Jones v. Division of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Owens, 19 Va. App. 184, 450 S.E.2d 172, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 653 (1994). Jurisdic tion absent where improper party filed appeal.  Nothing in Rule 8:20 permits the notice of appeal to be filed by a person who is a regular and bona fide employee of the party. Therefore, because the notice of a ppeal was not filed by the Divisions attorney, the requirement of Rule 8:20 was not followed in filing the notice of appeal and the circuit court never acquired jurisdiction over the appeal of the child support matter from the juvenile court.

Where there has been a court order for support, final decree of divorce ordering supp ort, or administrative order under the provisions of this chapter for support, the debt shall be limited to the amount of such order or decree. The Commissioner, pursuant to § 63.2-1922, shall establish the debt in an amount determined to be consisten t with a noncustodial parents ability to pay. The Department shall have the right to petition the appropriate court for modification of a court order on the same grounds as either party to such cause. The Department shall be subrogated to the right of such child or children or custodial parent to prosecute or maintain any support action or execute any administrative remedy existing under the laws of the Commonwealth to obtain reimbursement of moneys thus expended and may collect on behalf of any such child, children or custodial parent any amount contained in any court order of support or any administrative order of support regardless of whether or not the amount of such orders exceeds the amount of public assistance paid. Any support paid in excess of the total amount of public assistance paid shall be returned to the custodial parent by the Department. If a court order for support or final decree of divorce ordering support enters judgment for an amount of support to be paid by such noncustodial parent, the Department shall be subrogated to the debt created by such order, and said money judgment shall be deemed to be in favor of the Department.

Annotations CASE NOTES Food stamps and Medicaid assistance are not public assistance moneys.  Because food stamps and Medicaid assistance were not public assistance moneys as contemplated in § 63.2-1908, and the legislature did not exempt a moth er, as a noncustodial parent receiving those forms of public assistance, from reimbursing the Commonwealth of Virginia, Department of Social Services, Division of Child Support Enforcement, for moneys expended on behalf of their children as temporary ass istance to needy families, the trial court properly affirmed an administrative support order requiring the mother to reimburse a public assistance debt incurred on behalf of her minor child.

The request may be filed at any time before the child attains the age of eighteen years. Pursuant to subsection F of § 63.2-1903, the Department may summons a parent or putative parent to appear in the office of the Division of Child Support Enforcement to provide such information as may be necessary to the proceeding. Paternity may be established by a written statement of the father and mother made under oath acknowledging paternity or scientifically reliable genetic tests, including blood tests, which affirm at least a ninety-eight percent probability of paternity. The Department may order genetic testing and shall pay the costs of such tests, subject to recoupment from the father, if paternity is established. Where an original tes t is contested and additional testing is requested, the Department may require advance payment by the contestant. Before a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is accepted by the Department as the basis for establishing paternity, the Department shall provide to both the mother an d the putative father a written and oral description of the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging paternity and the consequences that arise from a signed acknowledgment, including the right to rescind the acknowledgment within the earlier of (i) s ixty days from the date of signing or (ii) the date of entry of an order in an administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the child in which the signatory is a party. A genetic test result affirming at least a ninety-eight percent probability of paternity shall have the same legal effect as a judgment entered pursuant to § 20-49.8 . When sixty days have elapsed from its signing, a voluntary statement acknowledging paternity shall have the same legal effect as a judgment entered pursuant to § 20-49.8 and shall be binding and conclusive unless, in a subsequent judicial proceeding , the person challenging the statement establishes that the statement resulted from fraud, duress or a material mistake of fact. In any subsequent proceeding in which a statement acknowledging paternity is subject to challenge, the legal responsibilities of any person signing it shall not be suspended during the pendency of the proceeding, except for good cause shown. The order of the Department in proceedings pursuant to this section shall be served upon the putative father in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 8 (§ 8.01-2 85 et seq.) or Chapter 9 (§ 8.01-328 et seq.) of Title 8.01. The Department shall file a copy of its order determining paternity, including the information required by subsection C of § 20-49.8, with the State Registrar of Vital Records within thir ty days after the acknowledgment becomes binding and conclusive or the order otherwise becomes final. No judicial or administrative proceeding shall be required to ratify an unchallenged acknowledgment of paternity nor shall the Department or the courts have any jurisdiction over proceedings to ratify an unchallenged acknowledgment.

All child s upport orders established and enforced pursuant to this title shall include a provision for health care coverage of dependent children. The Department shall use the National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) to enforce the provision of health care coverage t hrough an employment-related group health plan pursuant to a child support order if available at a reasonable cost, as that term is defined in § 63.2-1900, unless a court or administrative order stipulates alternative health care coverage to employer- based coverage. B. The Departm ent shall transfer the NMSN to employers within two business days following the date of entry into the State Directory of New Hires of an employee who is obligated to pay child support or to provide health care coverage pursuant to this title. Employers shall transfer the NMSN to the appropriate group plan providing the health care coverage for each eligible child (excluding the severable Notice to Withhold for Health Care Coverage directing the employer to withhold any mandatory employee contributions to the plan) within twenty business days after the date of the NMSN. The Department, in consultation with the custodial parent, shall promptly select from available plan options when the plan administrator reports that there is more than one option avail able under the plan. C. Employers s hall withhold any obligation of the employee for employee contribution necessary for coverage of each eligible child and send any amount withheld directly to the plan. An employee obligated for contribution necessary for coverage may contest the withhold ing based on a mistake of fact. If the employee contests the withholding, the employer shall continue to withhold the obligation necessary for coverage until the employer receives notice that the contest is resolved in favor of the employee. D. Employers s hall notify the Department promptly whenever the employment of a parent ordered to provide health care coverage is terminated in the same manner as required for income withholding pursuant to § 20-79.3. The Department shall promptly notify an employer when there is no longer a current order for health care coverage in effect for which the Department is responsible.

However, orders to withhold and to deliver shall not take priority with respect to a prior payroll deduction or income withholding order pursuant to § 20-79.1, 20-79.2, 63.2-1923, or 63.2-1 924. The Department shall have the sole authority to negotiate settlement of its liens. Settlement of the Departments support liens does not affect the remaining support arrearages. B. The order t o withhold shall also be served upon the debtor within a reasonable time thereafter, and shall state the amount of the support debt accrued. The order shall state in summary the terms of §§ 63.2-1925 and 63.2-1930 and shall be served in the manner prescribed for the service of a warrant in a civil action, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by electronic means. The order to withhold shall advise the debtor that this order has been issued to cause the property of the debtor to be taken to satisfy the debt and advise of property that may be exempted from this order. The order shall also advise the debtor of a right to appeal such order based upon a mistake of fact and that if no appeal is made within 10 days of being served, his propert y is subject to be taken. C. If the debt or believes such property is exempt from this debt, within 10 days of the date of service of the order to withhold, the debtor may file an appeal to the Commissioner stating any exemptions that may be applicable. If the Commissioner receives a timely app eal, a hearing shall be promptly scheduled before a hearing officer upon reasonable notice to the obligee. The Commissioner may delegate authority to conduct the hearing to a duly qualified hearing officer who shall consider the debtors appeal. Actio n by the Commissioner under the provisions of this chapter to collect such support debt shall be valid and enforceable during the pendency of any appeal.The decision of the hearing officer shall be in writing and shall set forth the debtors rights to appeal an adverse decision of the hearing officer pursuant to § 63.2-1943. The decision shall be served upon the debtor in accordance with the provisions of § 8.01-296, 8.01-327, or 8.01-329, mailed to the debtor at his last known address by certi fied mail, return receipt requested, or provided by electronic means or service may be waived. A copy of such decision shall also be provided to the obligee. Such decision shall establish whether the debtors property is exempt under state or federal laws and regulations. D. Any person, firm, corporation, association, or political subdivision or department of the Commonwealth upon whom service has been made is hereby required to answer such order to withhold within 10 days, exclusive of the day of service, under oath and in writing, an d shall file true answers to the matters inquired of therein. In the event that there is in the possession of any such person, firm, corporation, association, or political subdivision or department of the Commonwealth any property that may be subject to the claim of the Department, such property shall be withheld immediately upon receipt of the order to withhold, together with any additional property received by such person, firm, corporation, association, or political subdivision or department of the C ommonwealth valued up to the amount of the order until receipt of an order to deliver or release. The property shall be delivered to the Commissioner upon receipt of an order to deliver; however, distribution of the property shall not be made during pend ency of all appeals. Where money is due and owing under any contract of employment, express or implied, or is held by any person, firm, corporation, association, or political subdivision or department of the Commonwealth subject to withdrawal by the debt or, such money shall be delivered by remittance payable to the order of the Treasurer of Virginia. The person, firm, corporation, association, or political subdivision or department of the Commonwealth herein specified shall be entitled to receive from s uch debtor a fee of $5 for each answer or remittance on account of such debtor. The foregoing is subject to the exemptions contained in §§ 63.2-1925 and 63.2-1933. E. Delivery to the Commissioner shall serve as full acquittance and the Commonwealth warrants and represents that it shall defend and hold harmless for such actions persons delivering money or property to the Commissioner pursuant to this chapter. F. An order is sued to an employer for withholding from the earnings of an employee or independent contractor pursuant to this section shall conform to § 20-79.3.

CASE NOTES Federal preemption.  Bankruptcy court properly ordered trustee to return debtors post-petition payments to debtor because his Chapter 13 plan was not confirmed; any state authorit y under Virginia law for levy on bankruptcy trustee directly conflicts with federal statutory mandate that trustee refund post-petition payments to debtor, and thus, Bankruptcy Code preempts Virginia law and requires that trustee return post-petition pay ments to debtor.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 9B M.J. Infants and Juveniles, § 2. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  Proration statutes for multiple child support obligations embodied in § 63.2-1954 did not apply to mother twos and mother ones child support cases beca use the Virginia Department of Child Support Enforcement, while involved in mother ones case, was not involved in mother twos case. Miller v. Miller, 72 Va. Cir. 274, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 268 (Fairfax County Nov. 21, 2006). Virginia Division of Child Support Enforcement was or dered to distribute the proportionate share of arrearage payments made by fathers to purge a civil contempt among all the fathers families or children.  Virginia Division of Child Support Enforcement was ordered to comply with § 63.2-1954 and distribute the proportionate share of arrearage payments made by fath ers to purge a civil contempt among all the fathers families or children, despite the juvenile courts order that payment go only to the parent or guardian for the child who had brought the contempt proceedings. The court held that § 63.2-1954 s proration requirement did not infringe on the juvenile courts authority to enforce its own child support orders or render it incapable of the efficient discharge of the duties committed to its care.
