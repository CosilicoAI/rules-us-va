Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Automobiles, § 4. CASE NOTES Reasonable exercise of police power.  This section and its implementation by a state highway patrolman with respect to a property carrying vehicle is a reasonable exercise of state police power over t he operation of motor vehicles on its highways. Weaver v. Williams, 509 F.2d 884, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 16504 (4th Cir. 1975) (decided under prior law). Inspection is not limited by statutory powers of officer but he may lawfully position hi mself by any means available to improve his view. Weaver v. Williams, 509 F.2d 884, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 16504 (4th Cir. 1975) (decided under prior law). Plain view search.  Whether or not inadvertence is an essential element of the orthodox plain view search doctrine is not with respect to a traffic officer on an open highway. Pl ain view in this context means whatever can be seen, whether accidentally or by intentional scrutiny. Weaver v. Williams, 509 F.2d 884, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 16504 (4th Cir. 1975) (decided under prior law). State traffic officer may lawfully testify to anything he discerns in or about a motor vehicle on the highway. Weaver v. Williams, 509 F.2d 884, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 16504 (4th Cir. 1975) (decided under prior law). Location where defendant arrested not included in roadblock plan.  The mere fact that the location where defendant was arrested was not included in the roadblock plan effected only a minor, insubstantial deviation from compliance with the overall town plan, and did not render the checkpoint unconstitutionally impermissible.

The owner or operator of any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer shall stop on the signal of any law-enforcement officer who is in uniform or shows his badge or othe r sign of authority and shall, on the officers request, exhibit his registration card, drivers license, learners permit, or temporary drivers permit and write his name in the presence of the officer, if so required, for the purpose of est ablishing his identity.

Rev. 666 (1974). For article, Warrantless Searches and Seizures in Virginia, see 17 U. Rich L. Rev. 721 (1983). CASE NOTES Request for license.  Defendants motion to suppress was properly denied because the initial encounter between the sheriffs deputy and defendant was entirely consensual. Because the deputy did not use a police signal (defendant was parked), the deputys request to see defendants drivers license was no more than a request, and defendants compliance was voluntary and not coerced. Branham v. Commonwealth, 283 Va. 27 3, 720 S.E.2d 74, 2012 Va. LEXIS 18 (2012). Pr oduction of license restricts ones freedom of movement.  The exercise of police power pursuant to this section, and the act of requiring a person who has been operating a motor vehicle upon the public highways to produc e an operators license, is a restraint upon the individuals freedom of movement and constitutes a seizure of the person. Brown v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 694, 440 S.E.2d 619, 10 Va. Law Rep. 887, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 64 (1994). What constitutes seizure.  Where an individual is seated in a parked vehicle, a request by a police officer for a drivers license and registration does not transform a consensual encoun ter into a seizure. But where an officer observes a defendant operating a vehicle and thus, under this section, the driver is required to exhibit his license and registration upon police request, the request for such documents by the police constitutes a seizure. Cogan v. Commonwealth, No. 1751-96-2 (Ct. of Appeals May 27, 1997). Defendant was not seized in violation of U.S. Const., Amend. IV, when an officer approached him in a casual and non-threatening manner and asked for identificatio n. The officers did not issue a command to defendant to stop and produce a drivers license pursuant to § 46.2-104; thus, there was no exercise of police power. Allen v. Commonwealth, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 146 (Va. Ct. App. May 3, 2011). Request for license not a seizure.  Trial court erred when it concluded that this section rendered the officers request for a drivers license a seizure, as the encounter was initially consen sual, and the evidence was not obtained until after the officers had a reasonable suspicion to believe defendant had violated this section and after the officers learned that he had outstanding arrest warrants. Any evidence recovered from his person at t hat point was admissible as it was obtained during a search incident to a lawful arrest. Commonwealth v. Mayo, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 113 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 25, 2017). Sobriety checkpoint.  The seizure of defendant upon the initial stop at a license and sobriety checkpoint in question was constitutionally valid, where uniformed police officers, weari ng reflector vests, were assigned to the scene, the area and the warning sign were well-lighted, there were two marked police vehicles present with red lights flashing, the geography of the site permitted adequate space for the momentary initial detentio n to check licenses and to afford space for vehicles, whose operators required further evaluation, to pull aside, the officers at the checkpoint had no discretion regarding which vehicles to stop and every southbound vehicle was halted, if congestion occ urred, vehicles were permitted to move through the checkpoint until the congestion cleared, and the police endeavored to detain a motorist no more than 30 seconds for the license check. Balancing the states strong interest in protecting the public fr om the grave risk presented by drunk drivers, against the minimal inconvenience caused motorists approaching the roadblock, the action of the police was not an impermissible infringement upon defendants reasonable expectation of privacy. Lowe v. Comm onwealth, 230 Va. 346, 337 S.E.2d 273, 1985 Va. LEXIS 286 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1084, 106 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L. Ed. 2d 720, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 904 (1986) (decided under prior law). Police officers were authorized to seek defendants identification, where they saw hi m and others engaged in a drug transaction and stopped the vehicle he was driving. Smith v. Commonwealth, No. 0138-89-2 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 16, 1990). Trooper had an articulable and reasonable suspicion, where defendant switched drivers and made a U-turn after seeing checkpoint which justified trooper following defendant and requesting that he exhibit his operators license, accordingly, seizure of defendant was lawful. Brown v. Commonwealth, 17 Va. App. 694, 440 S.E.2d 619, 10 Va. Law Rep. 887, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 64 (1994). Where defendants van was blocked in a private driveway by a police vehicle and he voluntarily answered police officers questions concerning his operators permit, defendants freedom of action was not restrained to any greater extent than that of drivers detained during routine traffic stops pursuant to this secti on. Stroud v. Commonwealth, 6 Va. App. 633, 370 S.E.2d 721, 5 Va. Law Rep. 116, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (1988) (decided under prior law). Location where defendant arrested not included in roadblock plan.  The mere fact that the location where defendant was arrested was not included in the roadblock plan effected only a minor, insubstantial deviation from compliance with the overall town plan, and did not render the checkpoint unconstitutionally impermissible. Sheppard v. Commonwealth, 25 Va. App. 527, 489 S.E.2d 714, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 565 (1997). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS What constitutes seizure.  Defendant was unconstitutionally seized where an officer observed defendant driving without wearing a seat belt, defendant buckled his belt and then turned into a parking lot, and the officer followed, calling out to defendant and inquiring about his drivers license. The exercise of police power pursuant to § 46.2-104 was a restraint upon defendants freedom of movement and constituted a seizure of defe ndants person. Commonwealth v. Fuller, 78 Va.

CASE NOTES Evidence sufficient.  Sufficient evidence supported defendants convictions for unlawfully obtaining documents from the Department of Motor Vehicles to a boat and trailer because de fendant voluntarily relinquished any interest to the boat and trailer by entering into a property settlement agreement in a divorce in which the boat and trailer were awarded to defendants former husband, and no later amendment of the agreement or de cree incorporating the agreement made defendant legally entitled, under subsection A of § 46.2-105.2, to an ownership interest in the boat or trailer. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 39 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 2012). When defendant relinquished, in a property settlement agreement, any interest in a boat and trailer to defendants former husband, and then, after the husband s death, obtained title to the boat and trailer, the fact that the husband did not obtain title to the boat and trailer in the husbands own name prior to the husbands death did not allow defendant to seek title to the boat and trailer in defe ndants name, under subsection A of § 46.2-633, because an absence of recordation had no effect on the rights of parties to the transfer of a vehicle. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 39 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 2012). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Mens rea.  Omission of a mens rea in subsection B of § 46.2-105.2 does not eliminate the element of mens rea from the Commonwealths burden of proof during its case-in -chief. Given the employ of aid, a common-law term-of-art, implicit in subsection B of § 46.2-105.2 is a mens rea element of knowledge on the part of the aider. Commonwealth v. Davis, 101 Va. Cir. 71, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 4 (Fairfax County Jan. 22, 201 9). To be liable under subsection B of § 46.2-105.2, a defendant must knowingly aid another person obtain the listed documents with the knowledge the principal has not satis tied all legal and procedural Department of Motor Vehicles requirements or is otherwise not legally entitled to the document obtained. More simply put, subsection B of § 46.2-105.2 contains an implied and necessary mens rea element of knowl edge. Commonwealth v. Davis, 101 Va. Cir. 71, 2019 Va. Cir.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3B M.J. Carriers, § 106. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Constitutionality.  This section, as implemented by the Governors declaration of reciprocal waiver of motor vehicle road taxes, does not contravene the provision of Va. Const., A rt. IX, § 5 that no foreign corporation shall be relieved from compliance with any of the requirements made of similar domestic corporations. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry. v. Hooker, 194 Va. 496, 74 S.E.2d 270, 1953 Va. LEXIS 113 (1953). Legislative policy.  The Virginia statutes with respect to registration of motor vehicles and this section lay down a broad policy directive; that is, the policy of allowing residents of other states the free use of roads of Virginia when the home states of such nonresidents allow the free use of their roads to residents of Virginia. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry. v. Hooker, 194 Va. 496, 74 S.E.2d 270, 1953 Va. LEXIS 113 (1953). Reciprocal agreements may be bilateral or unilateral.  A reciprocal agreement authorized by this section may be bilateral or unilateral. The Governors unilateral declaration waiving gross receipts road tax on carr iers of all states which do not require Virginia carriers to pay a similar tax is a promise for a forbearance. When accepted by another state, either by acquiescence or express committal, it constitutes a reciprocal agreement within the intent of this se ction. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry. v. Hooker, 194 Va. 496, 74 S.E.2d 270, 1953 Va. LEXIS 113 (1953). The words used in this section are broad enough to allow agreements whereby foreign states will refrain from imposing taxes on Virginia interstate carriers, as we ll as agreements whereby such states will refrain from requiring Virginia interstate carriers to pay taxes imposed by such foreign states. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry. v. Hooker, 194 Va. 496, 74 S.E.2d 270, 1953 Va. LEXIS 113 (1953). Governors declaration of June 25, 1952, waiving gross receipts road tax on carriers of all states which did not require Virginia carriers to pay a similar tax was held to be a reciprocal agreement within the meaning of this section, notwithstanding that some states whose carriers were benefited by it had no statutes imposing a similar tax on Virginia carriers. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry. v. Hooker, 194 Va. 496, 74 S.E.2d 270, 1953 Va. LEXIS 113 (1953). Whether Governors declaration is a reciprocal agreement within the meaning o f this section, and is in compliance with it, is to be found in the statute construed as a whole, in the spirit and purpose of its enactment, and in the realities of the situation. Subtleties of meaning should not be allowed to circumvent the legislature s manifest purpose and destroy a formulated scheme of reciprocity, though inartificially expressed. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry. v. Hooker, 194 Va. 496, 74 S.E.2d 270, 1953 Va. LEXIS 113 (1953). Whether reciprocity proposed is favorable is question for Governor.  It is for the Governor and not for the court to determine whether the reciprocity proposed in his declaration, which constituted a reciprocal agreement under this section, is favorable to the interest of the State. Atlantic &amp; D. Ry. v. Hooker, 194 Va. 496, 74 S.E.2d 270, 1953 Va. LEXIS 113 (1953). Proclamations of Governor have effect of statutory enactments.  Proclamations of the Governor under this section have the effect of statutory enactments. Virginia v.

CASE NOTES Re ntal car company must assure statutory minimum coverage.  When read in pari materia, § 46.2-108 and §§ 46.2-368 and 46.2-705 evince a clear legislative intent that a company renting a motor vehicle without a dri ver in Virginia must assure that the vehicle has the statutory minimum liability insurance coverage; such intent is in keeping with the long-standing public policy to provide for the protection and compensation of innocent parties injured in motor vehicl e accidents, and the appellate court will construe the statutory language liberally to accomplish the intended purpose of the statutes. USAA Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hertz Corp., 265 Va. 450, 578 S.E.2d 775, 2003 Va. LEXIS 44 (2003). Rental car company provi ded primary coverage.  Self-insured rental car company was required to provide primary coverage on a rental car driven by a resident of another state involved in an accident; the rental car company could not avoid by contract customer avoid its obligation to assure primary liability coverage by purporting to alter or expand the insurance coverage provided by the customers own carrier, and because the policy with the insurer provide d only excess coverage, the motor vehicle remained an insured vehicle as required by subsection D of § 46.2-108 only if primary coverage was afforded by the rental car company through its certificate of self-insurance. USAA Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hertz Corp ., 265 Va. 450, 578 S.E.2d 775, 2003 Va. LEXIS 44 (2003). Self-insured rental car company was entitled to seek indemnification from a renter and his insurer for damages caused by the renters negligence once the renta l car company satisfied its obligation under subsection D of § 46.2-108 to afford primary bodily injury and property damage coverage and paid the third partys damages. Farmers Ins. Exch. v. Enter. Leasing Co., 281 Va. 612, 708 S.E.2d 852, 2011 Va. LEXIS 89 (2011). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Re ntal car company must assure statutory minimum coverage.  Holding in Hertz along with §§ 46.2-108, 46.2-368, and 46.2-705 evince a clear legislative intent requiring a company that rents motor vehicles without driv ers to ensure that such vehicles have the statutory minimum liability insurance coverage; however, this requirement did not preclude the rental car company from seeking indemnification from its renter for damages the company paid to a third party resulti ng from the renters negligence. Self-insurance was not the functional equivalent of insurance in the instant case and therefore the company was not improperly seeking indemnification from its own insured; under Hertz, the company was primarily liable and satisfied that liability by promptly paying out the third partys claims and under the insurers policy, the insurer was primarily liable for property damage caused by its insured which resulted from his use of a substitute automobile while hi s own automobile was being repaired or serviced.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section is a proper and necessary regulatory measure and is constitutional under th e Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.Shirley v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 49, 235 S.E.2d 432, 1977 Va. LEXIS 170 (1977). It is one of numerous related motor vehicle laws designed for the protection of lawful owners and the public. Shirley v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 49, 235 S.E.2d 432, 1977 Va. LEXIS 170 (1977). Person engaged in automobile repair business was on notice of possible inspection.  Where the defendant was engaged in the business of automobile repairing, a business regulated by this section, defendant knew, or should have known, of the statut ory requirements when she engaged in the business. She was placed on notice that the premises of her automobile repair business and the vehicles located on the premises were subject to inspection at any time. Shirley v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 49, 235 S.E. 2d 432, 1977 Va. LEXIS 170 (1977). Facts justifying further inspection.  Where the statutory inspection of motor vehicles on defendants premises by the officers revealed four vehicles from which the public identification numbers we re missing, including the vehicle in question, this fact alone justified a further search of the vehicle for an identification number, although the suspicions of the officers were additionally aroused by the fact that the registration certificate and the license plates attached to the vehicle were for an automobile of a different model, type and year from that of the vehicle being inspected. The officers had cause to continue their inspection and investigation and to seize pertinent documents they found regarding the vehicle. Shirley v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 49, 235 S.E.2d 432, 1977 Va.

One of the red reflectorized triangular warning devices shall be placed in the center of the lane of traffic or shoulder occupied by the stopped vehicle and not less than 100 feet therefrom in the direction of traffic approaching in that lane, a second not less than 100 feet from such vehicle in the opposite direction and a third at the traffic side of such vehicle not closer than 10 feet from i ts front or rear. However, if such vehicle is stopped within 500 feet of a curve or crest of a hill, or other obstruction to view, the red reflectorized triangular warning devices in that direction shall be so placed as to afford ample warning to other u sers of the highway, but in no case less than 500 feet from the stopped vehicle.

Flares or torches of a type approved by the Superintendent may be used in lieu of red reflectorized warning devices. In the event that the operator of the stopped vehicle elects to use flares or torches in lieu of red reflectorized triangular warning devices, the operator shall ensure that at least one flare or torch remains lighted at each of the prescribed locations as long as the vehicl e is stopped. If gasoline or any other flammable liquid or combustible liquid or gas seeps or leaks from a fuel container or a commercial motor vehicle stopped upon a highway, no emergency warning signal producing a flame shall be lighted or placed excep t at such a distance from any such liquid or gas as will ensure the prevention of a fire or explosion.The exception provided in this subsection with respect to highways within the corporate limits of cities shall not apply to any portion of any interstat e highway within the corporate limits of any city.

This section is mandatory. Savage Truck Line v. Traylor, 193 Va. 579, 69 S.E.2d 478, 1952 Va. LEXIS 168 (1952). And its violation co nstitutes negligence per se.  The violation of a statute of this character constitutes negligence per se. If it efficiently contributes to a collision and resultant damage to the wrongdoer, he may not recover. Savage Truck Line v. Traylor, 193 Va. 579, 69 S.E.2d 478, 1952 Va. LEXIS 168 (1952). The failure of a truck driver for ten minutes or more to comply with the mandate of the section is ample proof of negligence. Savage Truck Line v. Traylor, 193 Va. 579, 69 S.E.2d 478, 1952 Va. LEXIS 168 (1952). Insufficient tim e to permit driver to place flares.  Evidence held sufficient to support finding by jury that there was not sufficient time between breakdown of vehicle and collision for driver to have placed the fl ares required by the statute, and hence that the driver did not violate the statute and was not guilty of negligence. If driver did not have time to place the flares, the fact that trooper found none in the cab of his truck did not convict him of neglige nce. Roberts v. Mundy, 208 Va. 236, 156 S.E.2d 593, 1967 Va.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Purpose.  In light of the established official written statements exception to hearsay recognized in Virginia, one of the obvious purposes of the single authenticat ion provision in this section, rather than double authentication as required by § 8.01-390, is to ease the burden on the Commissioner in certifying records that are frequently utilized at trial. Ingram v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986). This section is controlling statute on issue of authentication of a transcript of defendants driving record. A statute of specific or particular application is not controlled or nullified by the statute of general application unless the Legislature clearly intended such a result. There is no such intent apparent between § 8.01-390 a nd this section. Ingram v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986). First paragraph of this section alleviates best evidence problem by allowing a certified copy or transcript to be admitted in lieu of the original. Ingram v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986). Hearsay problems not a ddressed by this section.  While this section allows a copy or transcript to be offered in lieu of the original Department of Motor Vehicles record and simplifies the procedure for auth enticating such a copy or transcript, the hearsay issue is resolved independently of this section. By the language of this section, a copy of a record of the DMV is admissible in lieu of the original only when the record itself is admissible in evidence. Whether or not the original record or document is admissible, either as an exception to the rule excluding hearsay or because it is not hearsay, must be decided separately. This section does not cure or address the hearsay problem. Ingram v. Commonwealt h, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986). Hearsay exception addressed by § 46.2-382.  Subdivision 1 of § 46.2-382 requires the clerk of a trial court to forward an abstract of a motor vehicle violation conviction to the commissioner. It requires the commissioner to keep permanent records of that information. These statutory duties satisfy the personal knowledge requirement of the official documents exception to the hearsay rule. Allen v. Commonwealth, No. 1469-93-4 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 14, 1995 ). Certificate renders document competent as evidence.  The certificate of the Commissioner or his designee of a fact appearing from the records under his control, where the law imposes a duty upon him to compile and b e custodian of such records, renders the document competent as evidence of such fact. Ingram v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986). Proper authentication.  Department of Motor Vehicles document that was introduced in defendants embezzlement trial was properly authenticated, and it was admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule. Jacobs v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 389 (Va. Ct. App. July 8, 2003). Circuit court properly convicted defendant of driving on a suspended license, third or subsequent offense, because the only prerequisite for admission of her DMV transcript was that it be authenticated, the statutory procedure for admission of the transcript conveyed no substantive rights to defendant, she demonstrated no prejudice flowing from the method by which the Commonwealth obtained the transcript, the sin gle inaccuracy in the transcript, which was redacted, did not require the complete exclusion of the transcript, and defendants due process rights were not offended by admission of the transcript. Parker v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 243 (Va. C t. App. Oct. 3, 2017). Proof that drivers license revoked.  If properly authenticated  that is, proven to be genuine  a transcript of defendants driving record which contains facts known to the commissioner is admissible to prove that the defendants license has been revoked. Ingram v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 335, 338 S.E.2d 657, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 204 (1986). Establishing ownership of vehicle in which stolen goods found.  In a prosecution for burglary and larceny, the testimony of a deputy sheriff that the car in which the belongings had been found was registered to the petitioner was hearsay where he was repeating the statement of an anonymous declarant and did not have first-hand knowledge concerning the ownership of the automobile and could not attest under cross-examination to the reliability of the information or to the metho d of its compilation. The reliability of the information could have been established by one of two procedures: namely, by the calling of the actual compiler of the report as a witness; or, pursuant to former § 46.1-34 (see now § 46.2-213) and this section by the proffering of the certificate of the license plate number of the motor vehicle as prima facie evidence of ownership. Coleman v. Johnson, 574 F. Supp. 360, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13285 (W.D. Va. 1983). Departme nt of motor vehicles record properly admitted.  Under § 46.2-384, a Department of Motor Vehicles transcript, certified pursuant to § 46.2-215, was prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein and was therefore sufficient to prove defendants prior DUI offenses and support his conviction under §§ 18.2-266 and 18.2-270.

Any such requirement shall not apply to an individual application for a credential issued under Chapter 3 (§ 46.2-300 et seq.), or the titling or registration of 12 or fewer vehicles during a period of one year. The Commissioner shall develop a method to ensure that the electronic filing is received and stored accurately and that it is readily available to satisfy the requiremen ts of the statutes that call for a written document. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Commissioner may accept, in lieu of paper documents, a filing or submission made by electronic means for any document not required to be filed or sub mitted electronically pursuant to the provisions of this title or Title 58.1. B. Whenever th is title or Title 58.1 provides that a written certificate or other document is to be delivered to an owner, registrant, licensee, lien holder, or any other person or entity by the Department or the Commissioner, the Commissioner may provide the written certificate or other document by electronic means. The electronic document may consist of all of the information included in the paper certificate or document or it may be an abstract or listing of the information held in electronic form by the Departmen t. Whenever a certificate or other document is provided by electronic means, the Department will not be required to produce a written certificate or document until requested to do so by the owner, registrant, licensee, lien holder, or other party. C. The Commiss ioner is authorized to establish, where feasible and cost efficient, contracts with public-private partnerships with commercial operations to provide for simplification and streamlining of services to citizens through electronic means. Such electronic se rvices shall include (i) an electronic lien and titling program, (ii) an online dealer program, and (iii) a print-on-demand license plate program. 1.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Legislative intent.  Legislature intends to recognize separate violations of § 46.2-300 for driving after failing to apply for a drivers license, satisfactorily passing the exa mination, and obtaining the license, and driving without a valid license. Shreve v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 541, 605 S.E.2d 780, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 605 (2004). Because defendant, a domiciliary of another state while residing in Virginia, could use his commercial drivers license (CDL) issued by that state to drive non -commercial vehicles in Virginia, the trial court erred in finding otherwise, requiring reversal of his conviction under § 46.2-300; moreover, this position was consistent with the legislatures intent that the holder of a CDL stood in a class sepa rate from persons who held regular drivers licenses. Meierotto v. Commonwealth, 50 Va. App. 1, 646 S.E.2d 1, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 227 (2007). Gravamen of the offense described in this section is the act of operating a motor vehicl e by a driver who has not obtained a valid drivers license by making a lawful application and passing the required examination. Edenton v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 413, 316 S.E.2d 736, 1984 Va. LEXIS 208 (1984). Not included in offense of felony operation by habitual offender.  The misdemeanor of driving without a license is not a lesser-included offense of the felony of operation of a motor vehicle by a habitual offender. Edenton v. Com monwealth, 227 Va. 413, 316 S.E.2d 736, 1984 Va. LEXIS 208 (1984). The misdemeanor defined in this section is not an offense substantially charged in the indictment of a violation of former § 46.1-387.8 (see now § 46.2-357) and it is error for the trial court to convict the defendant of the misdemeanor. Edenton v. Commonwealth, 227 Va. 413, 316 S.E.2d 736, 1984 Va. LEXIS 208 (1984). Driving without license as negligenc e.  See White v. Edwards Chevrolet Co., 186 Va. 669, 43 S.E.2d 870, 1947 Va. LEXIS 189 (1947); Laughlin v. Rose, 200 Va. 127, 104 S.E.2d 782, 1958 Va. LEXIS 168 (1958 ). Exclusionary clause held valid.  Where an automobile indemnity insurance policy excluded liability for losses or damage caused while the automobile was being operated by any person violating any law or ordinance as to age or driving license, it was held that this exclusion clause was not unreasonable or contrary to public policy. Holland Supply Corp. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 166 Va. 331, 186 S.E. 56, 1936 Va. LEXIS 193 (1936). Suffic ient evidence for driving with suspended license.  Defendants conviction for driving without a valid license, was upheld on appeal where sufficient evidence existed to show that she was caught driving with a s uspended license and § 46.2-300 prohibited defendant from driving until the acts of applying for a license, passing an exam, and actually obtaining the license were accomplished, which was required after the suspension expired. Shreve v. Commo nwealth, 44 Va. App. 541, 605 S.E.2d 780, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 605 (2004). In sufficient evidence for driving with suspended license.  Trial court erred in convicting defendant of driving a motor vehicle without a valid drivers license because defendants Department of Motor Vehicles recor d recited the suspension notice sent to her was unclaimed, her license was not suspended until she received notice of that status, and the Commonwealth did not present any evidence to establish that she had actual notice of the suspension of her drivers license.

In addition to any other penalty provided by this section, any motor vehicle administratively impounded or immobilized under the provisions of § 46.2-301.1 may, in the discretion of the court, be impounded or immobilized for an additional period of up to 90 days upon conviction of an offender for driving while his drivers license, learners permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been (i) suspended or revoked for a violation of § 18.2-36.1, 18.2-51.4, 18.2-266, 18.2-272, or 46.2-341.24 or a substantially similar ordinance or law in any other jurisdiction or (ii) administratively suspended under the provisions of § 46.2-391.2. However, if, at the time of the violation, the offender was driving a motor vehicle owned by another person, the court shall have no jurisdiction over such motor vehicle but may order the impoundment or immobilization of a motor vehicle owned solely by the offender at the time of arrest. All costs of impoundment or immobilization, including removal or storage expen ses, shall be paid by the offender prior to the release of his motor vehicle. B. Except as p rovided in § 46.2-304, no resident or nonresident (i) whose drivers license, learners permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked or (ii) who has been directed not to drive by any court or by the Commissioner, o r (iii) who has been forbidden, as prescribed by operation of any statute of the Commonwealth or a substantially similar ordinance of any county, city or town, to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth shall thereafter drive any motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment on any highway in the Commonwealth until the period of such suspension or revocation has terminated or the privilege has been reinstated or a restricted license is issued pursuant to subsection E. For the purposes o f this section, the phrase motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment shall not include mopeds. C. A violation of subsection B is a Class 1 misdemeanor. D. Upon a viol ation of subsection B, the court shall suspend the persons license or privilege to drive a motor vehicle for the same period for which it had been previously suspended or revoked. In the event the person violated subsection B by driving during a peri od of suspension or revocation which was not for a definite period of time, the court shall suspend the persons license, permit or privilege to drive for an additional period not to exceed 90 days, to commence upon the expiration of the previous susp ension or revocation or to commence immediately if the previous suspension or revocation has expired. E. Any person who is otherwise eligible for a restricted license may petition each court that suspended his license pursuant to subsection D for authorization for a restricted license, provided that the period of time for which the license was suspended by the court p ursuant to subsection D, if measured from the date of conviction, has expired, even though the suspension itself has not expired. A court may, for good cause shown, authorize the Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a restricted license for any of the p urposes set forth in subsection E of § 18.2-271.1. No restricted license shall be issued unless each court that issued a suspension of the persons license pursuant to subsection D authorizes the Department to issue a restricted license. Any restri cted license issued pursuant to this subsection shall be in effect until the expiration of any and all suspensions issued pursuant to subsection D, except that it shall automatically terminate upon the expiration, cancellation, suspension, or revocation of the persons license or privilege to drive for any other cause. No restricted license issued pursuant to this subsection shall permit a person to operate a commercial motor vehicle as defined in the Commercial Drivers License Act (§ 46.2-341 .1 et seq.). The court shall forward to the Commissioner a copy of its authorization entered pursuant to this subsection, which shall specifically enumerate the restrictions imposed and contain such information regarding the person to whom such a license is issued as is reasonably necessary to identify the person. The court shall also provide a copy of its authorization to the person, who may not operate a motor vehicle until receipt from the Commissioner of a restricted license. A copy of the restricte d license issued by the Commissioner shall be carried at all times while operating a motor vehicle. F. Any person who operates a motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment in violation of the terms of a restricted license issued pursuant to subsection E of § 18.2-271.1 is not guilty of a violation of this section but is guilty of a violation of § 18.2-272.

Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection B of this section, any person who is licensed to drive any motor vehicle may, on special application to the Department, be licensed to drive any vehicle, provided the operation of the vehicle would not unduly endanger th e public safety, as determined by the Commissioner.The Commissioner may waive the vision requirements of subsection B for any commercial drivers license applicant who either (i) is subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations but is exempt from the vision standards of 49 C.F.R. Part 391 or (ii) is not required to meet the vision standards specified in 49 C.F.R. § 391.41 of the regulations.In order to determine whether such a waiver would unduly endanger the public safety, the Commissio ner shall require such commercial drivers license applicant to submit a special waiver application and to provide all medical information relating to his vision that may be requested by the Department. The Department may require such commercial drive rs license applicant to take a road test administered by the Department before determining whether to grant a waiver. If a waiver is granted, the Department may subject the applicants use of a commercial motor vehicle to reasonable restrictions, which shall be noted on the commercial drivers license. If a waiver is granted, the Department may also limit the validity period of the commercial drivers license, and the expiration date shall be noted on the commercial drivers license.

See Editors note fo r applicability clause. Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Automobiles, §§ 10, 11. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Application for drivers license properly denied.  Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) properly refused to issue an applicant a drivers license where his driving privileges remained revoked or suspende d in three other states due to his driving while intoxicated (DWI) convictions as § 46.2-483 allowed a person whose driving privileges had been suspended or revoked in another state to apply for a new license in Virginia after expiration of one year f rom the date of revocation only if permitted by law; this section explicitly prohibited the DMV from issuing a drivers license to any person whose driving privileges were suspended or revoked due to a DWI conviction. Subdivision A 4 did not nullify t he provisions of §§ 46.2-360 or 46.2-391 as those statutes provided a procedure whereby driving privileges could be restored and thereafter § 46.2-316 would no longer proscribe the issuance of a drivers license. Brauer v. DMV, 70 Va. Cir. 14 5, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Warren County Jan. 20, 2006). While the Driver License Compact, § 46.2-483, allows a person whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked in another state to apply for a new licen se in Virginia after expiration of one year from the date of revocation, such permission is circumscribed by the concluding language of the same sentence: if permitted by law; this section explicitly prohibits the Virginia Department of Motor Veh icles from issuing a drivers license to any person whose driving privileges are suspended or revoked by reason of a conviction of driving while under the influence of intoxicants or drugs. Brauer v. DMV, 70 Va. Cir. 145, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 20 (Warre n County Jan. 20, 2006). CASE NOTES Drivers license renewal pr operly denied.  Driver was ineligible for a drivers license due to the similarity of the drivers convictions in other states to Virginia statutes prohibiting driving whil e intoxicated and after forfeiture of a license because (1) a dissimilar Georgia punishment did not make that states statute dissimilar for such purposes, and (2) a Florida release letter did not show the driver had no predicate Florida conviction an d suspension, as the letter did not mention a Tennessee conviction and subsequent Florida revocation, and the letter was sent in error as one of the drivers two National Driver Registry profiles listed the driver as ineligible.

Petition for Restricted Drivers License  Failure to Pay Child Support et seq. § 46.2-320.1. Other grounds for suspension; nonpayment of child support. Text A. The Commiss ioner may enter into an agreement with the Department of Social Services whereby the Department may suspend or refuse to renew the drivers license of any person upon receipt of notice from the Department of Social Services that the person (i) is deli nquent in the payment of child support by 90 days or more or in an amount of $5,000 or more or (ii) has failed to comply with a subpoena, summons, or warrant relating to paternity or child support proceedings. A suspension or refusal to renew authorized pursuant to this section shall not be effective until 30 days after service on the delinquent obligor of notice of intent to suspend or refusal to renew. The notice of intent shall be served on the obligor by the Department of Social Services (a) by cert ified mail, return receipt requested, or by electronic means, sent to the obligors last known addresses as shown in the records of the Department or the Department of Social Services or (b) pursuant to § 8.01-296, or service may be waived by the o bligor in accordance with procedures established by the Department of Social Services. The obligor shall be entitled to a judicial hearing if a request for a hearing is made, in writing, to the Department of Social Services within 30 days from service of the notice of intent. Upon receipt of the request for a hearing, the Department of Social Services shall petition the court that entered or is enforcing the order, requesting a hearing on the proposed suspension or refusal to renew. The court shall auth orize the suspension or refusal to renew only if it finds that the obligors noncompliance with the child support order was willful. Upon a showing by the Department of Social Services that the obligor is delinquent in the payment of child support by 90 days or more or in an amount of $5,000 or more, the burden of proving that the delinquency was not willful shall rest upon the obligor. The Department shall not suspend or refuse to renew the drivers license until a final determination is made by the court. B. At any time after service of a notice of intent, the person may petition the juvenile and domestic relations district court in the jurisdiction where he resides for the issuance of a restricted license to be used if the suspension or refusal to renew becomes effect ive. Upon such petition and a finding of good cause, the court may provide that such person be issued a restricted permit to operate a motor vehicle for any of the purposes set forth in subsection E of § 18.2-271.1. A restricted license issued pursuan t to this subsection shall not permit any person to operate a commercial motor vehicle as defined in § 46.2-341.4. The court shall order the surrender of the persons license to operate a motor vehicle, to be disposed of in accordance with the prov isions of § 46.2-398, and shall forward to the Commissioner a copy of its order entered pursuant to this subsection. The order shall specifically enumerate the restrictions imposed and contain such information regarding the person to whom such a permi t is issued as is reasonably necessary to identify him. C. The Departm ent shall not renew a drivers license or terminate a license suspension imposed pursuant to this section until it has received from the Department of Social Services a certification that the person has (i) paid the delinquency in full; (ii) reached a n agreement with the Department of Social Services to satisfy the delinquency within a period not to exceed 10 years, and at least one payment representing at least five percent of the total delinquency or $600, whichever is less, has been made pursuant to the agreement; (iii) complied with a subpoena, summons, or warrant relating to a paternity or child support proceeding; or (iv) completed or is successfully participating in an intensive case monitoring program for child support as ordered by a juveni le and domestic relations district court or as administered by the Department of Social Services. Certification by the Department of Social Services shall be made by electronic or telephonic communication and shall be made on the same work day that payme nt required by clause (i) or (ii) is made. D. If a person who has entered into an agreement with the Department of Social Services pursuant to clause (ii) of subsection C fails to comply with the requirements of the agreement, the Department of Social Services shall notify the Department of the persons non compliance and the Department shall suspend or refuse to renew the drivers license of the person until it has received from the Department of Social Services a certification that the person has paid the delinquency in full or has entered into a subse quent agreement with the Department of Social Services to satisfy the delinquency within a period not to exceed seven years and has made at least one payment of $1,200 or seven percent of the total delinquency, whichever is less, pursuant to the agreemen t. If the person fails to comply with the terms of a subsequent agreement reached with the Department of Social Services pursuant to this section, without further notice to the person as provided in the subsequent agreement, the Department of Social Serv ices shall notify the Department of the persons noncompliance, and the Department shall suspend or refuse to renew the drivers license of the person. A person who has failed to comply with the terms of a second or subsequent agreement pursuant to this subsection may be granted a new agreement with the Department of Social Services if the person has made at least one payment of $1,800 or 10 percent of the total delinquency, whichever is less, and agrees to a repayment schedule of not more than se ven years. Upon receipt of certification from the Department of Social Services of the persons satisfaction of these conditions, the Department shall issue a drivers license to the person or reinstate the persons drivers license. Certific ation by the Department of Social Services shall be made by electronic or telephonic communication and shall be made on the same work day that payment required by this subsection is made.

The m inor shall submit a proper application and satisfactory evidence that he (i) is a resident of the Commonwealth; (ii) has successfully completed a driver education course approved by either the State Department of Education or, in the case of a course off ered by a driver training school licensed under Chapter 17 (§ 46.2-1700 et seq.) of this title, by the Department of Motor Vehicles; and (iii) is mentally, physically, and otherwise qualified to drive a motor vehicle safely. 2. The minors application for a drivers license must be signed by a parent of the applicant, otherwise by the guardian having custody of him. However, in the event a minor has no parent or guardian, then a drivers license shall not be issued to him unless his application is signed by the judge of the juvenile and domestic relations district court of the city or county in which he resides. If the minor making the application i s married or otherwise emancipated, in lieu of any parents, guardians or judges signature, the minor may present proper evidence of the solemnization of the marriage or the order of emancipation. 3. The minor shall be required to state in his application whether or not he has been convicted of an offense triable by, or tried in, a juvenile and domestic relations district court or found by such court to be a child in need of supervision, as defined in § 16.1-228. If it appears that the minor has been adjudged not innocent of the offense alleged or has been found to be a child in need of supervision, the Department shall not iss ue a license without the written approval of the judge of the juvenile and domestic relations district court making an adjudication as to the minor or the like approval of a similar court of the county or city in which the parent or guardian, respectivel y, of the minor resides. 4. The application for a permanent drivers license by a minor of the age of persons required to attend school pursuant to § 22.1-254 shall be accompanied by evidence of compliance with the compulsory school attendance law set forth in Article 1 (§ 22.1-254 et seq.) of Chapter 14 of Title 22.1.

If the minor is unable to provide such evidence, he shall not be gr anted a drivers license until he reaches the age of 18 or presents proper evidence of the solemnization of his marriage or an order of emancipation, or the parent, as defined in § 22.1-1, or other person standing in loco parentis has provided writ ten authorization for the minor to obtain a drivers license.A minor may, however, present a high school diploma or its equivalent or a certificate indicating completion of a prescribed course of study as defined by the local school board pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:4 as evidence of compulsory school attendance compliance. 5. The minor applicant shall certify in writing, on a form prescribed by the Commissioner, that he is a resident of the Commonwealth. The applicants parent or guardian shall also cert ify that the applicant is a resident by signing the certification. Any minor providing proper evidence of the solemnization of his marriage or a certified copy of a court order of emancipation shall not be required to provide the parents certificatio n of residence. B. Any custodi al parent or guardian of an unmarried or unemancipated minor may, after the issuance of a permanent drivers license to such minor, file with the Department a written request that the license of the minor be canceled. When such request is filed, the D epartment shall cancel the license of the minor and the license shall not thereafter be reissued by the Department until a period of six months has elapsed from the date of cancellation or the minor reaches his eighteenth birthday, whichever shall occur sooner. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, in the case of a minor whose parents have been awarded joint legal custody, a request that the license of the minor be cancelled must be signed by both legal custodians. In the event on e parent is not reasonably available or the parents do not agree, one parent may petition the juvenile and domestic relations district court to make a determination that the license of the minor be cancelled. C.

The temporary license shall only be valid until the permanent license is presented as provided in § 46.2-336. E. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection A requiring the successful completion of a driver education course approved by the State Department of Education, the Commissioner, on application therefor by a person at least 16 years and three months old but less than 18 years old, shall issue to the applicant a temporary drivers license valid for six months if he (i) certifies by signing, together with his parent or guardian, if applicable, on a form prescribed by the Commissioner that he is a resident of the Co mmonwealth; (ii) is the holder of a valid drivers license from another U.S. state, U.S. territory, Canadian province, or Canadian territory; and (iii) has not been found guilty of or otherwise responsible for an offense involving the operation of a m otor vehicle.

F. For persons qualifying for a drivers license through driver education courses approved by the Department of Education or courses offered by driver training schools licensed by the Department, the application for the learners permit shall be used as the appl ication for the drivers license pursuant to § 46.2-335.

H. For those h ome schooled students completing driver education courses approved by the Board of Education and instructed by his own parent or guardian, no drivers license shall be issued until the student has successfully completed the drivers license examina tion administered by the Department. Furthermore, the Commissioner shall not issue a drivers license for those home schooled students completing driver education courses approved by the Board of Education and instructed by his own parent or guardian if it is determined by the Commissioner that, at the time of such instruction, such parent or guardian had accumulated six or more driver demerit points in the most recently preceding 12 months, had been convicted within the most recent 11 preceding year s of driving while intoxicated in ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-335"><akn:num>§ 46.2-335</akn:num><akn:heading>Learners permits; fees; certification required</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Annotations CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  Because defendant, a domiciliary of another state, while residing in Virginia, could use his commercial drivers license (CDL) issued by that state to drive no n-commercial vehicles in Virginia, the trial court erred in finding otherwise, requiring reversal of his conviction under § 46.2-300; moreover, this position was consistent with the legislatures intent that the holder of a CDL stood in a class sep arate from persons who held regular drivers licenses.

Annotations CASE NOTES Lack of causal connection bars recovery for negligent entrustment.  Although it is negligence per se under this section to entrust a motor vehicle to an unlicensed driver, there can be no recovery for negligent entrustment unless the reason for the entrustees disqualification from securing a license was a proximate cause of the collision; thus, where there was no showing that the entrustees lack of a license had any causal connection to the collision, his lack of driver s license provided no basis for recovery against entrustor. Hack v. Nester, 241 Va. 499, 404 S.E.2d 42, 1990 Va. LEXIS 157 (1990). Violation held negligence per se but not proximate cause of accident.  Although the entrustment of a car to an unlicensed driver in violation of this section, was negligence per se, it did not follow that such negligence was a proxim ate cause of the accident, where there was no showing that the driver had been denied a drivers license because of incompetency or because she belonged to that class of persons who are forbidden by statute to be licensed, or that she was an incompete nt driver to whom a license should or would have been denied had she applied therefor, and it was undisputed that she had driven the car on other occasions and had been involved in no accident, and there was no evidence that she had previously been invol ved in any accident or guilty of the negligent operation of a motor vehicle.

Violation supported officers reasonable, articulable suspicion.  Where a police officer observed a driver operating a vehicle and the officer knew that it was in violation of § 46.2-301 because her license was suspended, the re was a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to justify pulling over the car and detaining defendant as well, who owned the vehicle and who was riding in it as a passenger; the fact that defendant allowed the unlicensed driver to use t he car was in itself a violation of this section, justifying the detention and seizure of defendant, and his consent to search his vehicle, which revealed drugs, was therefore not the product of an illegal detention and the drugs should not have been sup pressed.

The phrase forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure appearance as us ed in former subdivision (a) (see now paragraph defining Conviction) of this section means the subjection of the res, i.e., the collateral deposit made by the offender and placed by him under the control of the court. Once the deposited c ollateral is in the custody and control of the court at the offenders instance, the vital and controlling feature of the procedure is its subjection to the use of the sovereign. If that be accomplished by the order, direction or judgment of the court , then the forfeiture is complete and binding whether it be termed a fine or forfeit. Tate v. Lamb, 195 Va. 1005, 81 S.E.2d 743, 1954 Va. LEXIS 178 (1954). Facts held to clearly show that the forfeiture of collateral deposited by driver with an officer authorized to admit to bail had the force and effect of a convict ion under former subdivision (a) (see now paragraph defining Conviction) of this section. Lamb v. Butler, 198 Va. 509, 95 S.E.2d 239, 1956 Va. LEXIS 237 (1956). Irregularities in procedure do not prevent forfeiture from operating as conviction.  Where accused gives his personal recognizance and deposits collateral with an officer authorized to admit to bail, which deposit may be forfeited if accused fails to appear for trial, such forfeiture has the force and effect of a conviction under this section. Whether or not the procedure adopted and fully acquiesced in by accused was regular in all particulars is of no moment. Lamb v. Smith, 195 Va. 1053, 81 S.E .2d 768, 1954 Va. LEXIS 184 (1954) (see Lamb v. Butler, 198 Va. 509, 95 S.E.2d 239 (1956)). Where appellant, summoned to appear for speeding, made deposit with city police desk sergeant which was subsequently turned over to clerk of court and forfeited u pon appellants nonappearance, the forfeiture was valid and constituted a conviction under former subdivision (a) (see now paragraph defining Conviction) of this section. Although the sergeant was not an officer authorized to admit to bail as contemplated by former § 19.2-138 and the receipt given appellant was not in the form provided by former § 19.2-139, appellant was charged with knowledge of this and selected the sergeant to transmit the fund to the court. Hence, he could not compl ain of any irregularity in the procedure. Badalson v. Lamb, 195 Va. 1018, 81 S.E.2d 750, 1954 Va. LEXIS 179 (1954) (see Lamb v. Lanzarone, 195 Va. 1038, 81 S.E.2d 760 (1954)). Where appellant was twice arrested within two months in city for speeding and summoned to appear for trial but in each case mailed checks representing deposits to traffic bureau, the amounts being determined from charts approved by the court, the understanding being that he would not have to appear for trial and in each case the summons and deposit were transmitted to the court where the disposition of each case was indicated as fine and costs in the amount of the deposit, it was held that the procedure, although irregular, constituted a valid forfeiture of deposit amounting to conviction under former subdivision (a) (see now paragraph defining Convi ction) of this section. Lamb v. Lowe, 195 Va. 1024, 81 S.E.2d 753, 1954 Va. LEXIS 180 (1954) (see Nelson v. Lamb, 195 Va. 1043, 81 S.E.2d 762 (1954)). Arrested and summoned to appear before the traffic court of the City of Richmond for speeding, the appellees each deposited with the clerk before trial a sum desi gnated by him. Appellees not appearing for trial, the summonses were indorsed to show fines and costs equalling the amounts deposited, and the sums were placed to the credit of the city. Despite the irregularity of the procedure, the sums so deposited we re forfeited, and this constituted a conviction which, together with prior convictions, authorized appellant Commissioner to revoke appellees operators licenses. Lamb v. Scearce, 196 Va. 398, 83 S.E.2d 771, 1954 Va. LEXIS 233 (1954). A charge conviction upon which requires or authorizes the Commissioner to suspend or revoke the license, in former subdivision (a) (see now paragraph defining Conviction), refers to a charge of an offense which alone or in conjunction with another requires or authorizes revocation.

CASE NOTES Intent of the General Assembly in enacting uninsured motorist protection provisions.  Where the employee of an employer which self-insured its motor vehicles was allowed to recover under the uninsured motorist statute, such application of the Worke rs Compensation Act, former § 65.1-40 (now § 65.2-307), the uninsured motorist protection provision, § 38.2-2206, and the motor vehicle code, this section, as they relate to an employee, was consistent with the language of the statutes and t he intent of the General Assembly in enacting uninsured motorist protection provisions.

Exception to self-insurers liabi lity.  Subsection C of § 46.2-368 creates an exception to the liability of a self-insurer where the permissive user has prejudicially failed to cooperate in the defen se of the claim that resulted in the judgment, and the self-insurer has provided notice of its intent to rely on this exception. USAA Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hertz Corp., 265 Va. 450, 578 S.E.2d 775, 2003 Va. LEXIS 44 (2003). Construction with § 38.2-2206.  Language of this section specifying that uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits provided by a self-insured entity shall be secondary coverage to other valid and collectible insurance, does not alter or reverse the credit priorities, as opposed to the payment priorities, set forth in § 38.2-2206. Catron v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 255 Va. 31, 496 S.E.2d 436, 1998 Va. LEXIS 2 (1998). Self-insurer m ust provide underinsurance coverage.  In requiring a self-insurer to prove uninsured motorist insurance coverage, subsection B of this section, when read with § 38.2-2206, also required a self-insu rer to provide underinsurance coverage. Hackett v. Arlington County, 247 Va. 41, 439 S.E.2d 348, 10 Va. Law Rep. 717, 1994 Va. LEXIS 4 (1994). Subsection B of § 46.2-368 requires a self-insurer to provide the permissive users of its motor vehicles uninsured or underinsured motorist protection to the e xtent required by § 38.2-2206; however, the subsection limits that protection to the financial requirements of § 46.2-472 (single accident limits of $25,000 for bodily injury or death of one person, $50,000 for bodily injury or death of two or more persons, and $20,000 for property damage) and specifically provides that this protection shall be secondary coverage to any other available insurance coverage.

Re ntal car company must assure statutory minimum coverage.  When read in pari materia, §§ 46.2-108, 46.2-368 and 46.2-705, evince a clear legislative intent that a company renting a motor vehicle without a driver in Virginia must assure that the vehicle has the statutory minimum liability insurance coverage; such intent is in keeping with the long-standing public policy to provide for the protection and compensation of innocent parties injured in motor vehicle accid ents, and the appellate court will construe the statutory language liberally to accomplish the intended purpose of the statutes. USAA Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hertz Corp., 265 Va. 450, 578 S.E.2d 775, 2003 Va. LEXIS 44 (2003). Self-insured car rental agency secondarily liable.  Underinsured motorist coverage provided by a car rental company, a certified self-insurer, was secondary to injured parties personal coverage, and the rental company was entitled to a first-priority credit for any payment to the injured parties from the underinsured tortfeasors policy. Schrock v. Lancer Ins. Co., 767 F. Supp. 2d 610, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20410 (W.D. Va. 2011). Self-insured school district.  Self-insured school district had $1 million in uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist coverage, rather than the statutory minimum of $50,000, because (1) the sc hool district so contracted with a risk pool, (2) neither the statutory minimum nor the provisions of other statutes barred such a contract, (3) the school district had the freedom to so contract, and (4) such insurance was valid and collectible. VACORP v. Young, 298 Va. 490, 840 S.E.2d 334, 2020 Va. LEXIS 34 (2020). Effect of the 1991 amendment.  When enacting the 1991 amendment the General Assembly intended a substantive change in the existing law, not merely a change in form; moreover, the amendment cann ot be given retroactive application because substantive rights are affected by it. Dale v. City of Newport News, 243 Va. 48, 412 S.E.2d 701, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1734, 1992 Va. LEXIS 154 (1992). Employees recovery not limited to workers compensation be nefits where employer self-insures its motor vehicles.  The employee of an employer which self-insures its motor vehicles is entitled to recovery under the uninsured motorist protection statute, and the employees r ecovery is not limited to workers compensation benefits by the exclusivity provision in former § 65.1-40 (now § 65.2-307).

Rights of self-insured compared to those of insurance company.  Subsection C of § 46.2-368 makes it clear that the legislature intended to afford a self-insurer the same opportunity to defend a claim arising out of the use of a vehicle without permission of the owner as it would an insurance company against a claim arising out of the use of a vehicle by one not an insured, and it is clear that the self-insurer is protected against a claim arising out of use of a vehicle by a permissive user who fails to cooperate in the defense of the claim just as an insurance company may deny a claim arising out of the insureds failure to cooperate. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Welcome Corp., 58 Va. Cir. 25, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 388 ( Portsmouth Aug. 8, 2001). Exception to self-insurers liabi lity.  Self-insured rental car company was not entitled to escape payment on a subrogation claim by an insurer for payments the insurer made to its insured following an automobile accident involving the companys permissive lessee, even though the lessee was not cooperating with the company. The company had to provide notice to the insurer of its intent to rely on the provision that its lessee was not cooperating wit hin 45 days, as required by § 38.2-2226, and the company had failed to provide such notice on the insurers property claim; as to the insurers personal injury claim, the company had fa...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-369"><akn:num>§ 46.2-369</akn:num><akn:heading>Commissioner to administer and enforce chapter; regulations; summoning witnesses and taking testimony</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The Commissioner shall administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter and he may adopt regulations for its administration.

Section intended solely as police regulation.  This section was not intended to affect the rights of either party in an action to recover for injuries sustained in an automobile accident, but was intended sole ly as a police regulation, for police purposes. Diamond Cab Co. v. Jones, 162 Va. 412, 174 S.E. 675, 1934 Va. LEXIS 257 (1934). Hence, failure to report accident does not prevent recovery for injury.  In an action by a guest against a third party for injuries received in an automobile accident, the failure of the driver of the car in which plaintiff was riding to make the report required by this section did not preclude the plaintiff from recovering for the defendants negligence, or in anywise prejudice her rights in the premises. Diamond Cab Co. v. Jones, 162 Va. 412, 174 S.E. 675, 1934 Va. LEXIS 257 (193 4). And instruction on failure to make report is properly refused.  In an action by a guest against a third party for injuries received in an automobile accident, an instruction on the failure of the host to report the accident as required by this section, was properly refused. Diamond Cab Co. v. Jones, 162 Va. 412, 174 S.E. 675, 1934 Va. LEXIS 257 (1934). Statements admissible into evidence.  Since under this section the driver was not required to admit operation of the vehicle or to furnish any information as to the time that the accident occurred, th e statements made by defendant to the officer were admissible into evidence.

Construction.  Exclusionary rules of this type should be closely construed as stumbling blocks in the jurys search for truth. Krizak v. W.C. Brooks &amp; Sons, 320 F.2d 37, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4777 (4th Cir. 1963). That the Virginia courts have given the words of this section excluding automobile accident reports their normal meaning is evidenced by Willis v. Commonwealth, 1 90 Va. 294, 56 S.E.2d 222 (1949), in which such reports prepared by a police officer were held inadmissible. Krizak v. W.C. Brooks &amp; Sons, 320 F.2d 37, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4777 (4th Cir. 1963). And scope.  The Virginia court has not permitted this statutory exclusion to protect statements or diagrams not a part of the report, even though they are the exact duplicate s of those submitted in the report. Krizak v. W.C. Brooks &amp; Sons, 320 F.2d 37, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4777 (4th Cir. 1963). The rationale of this section and former §§ 46.1-407 and 46.1-409 (see now §§ 46.2-377 and 46.2-379) is that the accident report, although routinely and sometimes hurriedly made, primarily for statistical purposes, nevertheless carries with it the stamp of a written and official document to which a jury could attach more weight than it is properly due if used as evidence. Davis v. Colgin, 219 Va. 5, 244 S.E.2d 750, 1978 Va. LEXIS 150 (1978). Reports excluded in federal court.  Virginias privilege against the use of automobile accident reports in evidence applies in a federal court. Krizak v. W.C. Brooks &amp; Sons, 320 F.2d 37, 1963 U.S . App. LEXIS 4777 (4th Cir. 1963). But stat ements therein may be used in cross-examination.  The statements made in the automobile accident report, rather than the report itself, may be used as evidence for purposes of cross-examination. Krizak v. W.C. Br ooks &amp; Sons, 320 F.2d 37, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4777 (4th Cir. 1963). Accident reports were inadmissible, under the mandate of this section, in a proceeding i n the trial court under former §§ 46.1-436 and 46.1-437 (see now §§ 46.2-408 and 46.2-410). It was a trial arising out of the accidents in question, since appellants conduct in connection with the accidents covered by the reports was material in the trial and was relied on by the Commissioner for the purpose of revoking appellants license. Willis v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 294, 56 S.E.2d 222, 1949 Va. LEXIS 284 (1949). Accident reports to Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles) are made without prejudice and are not to be used as evidence in civil case. Cou nsel on cross-examination may not make specific reference to the report in the presence of the jury and read defendants statement therein for the purpose of contradicting him, thereby accomplishing indirectly what he could not do directly. Phillips v . Schools, 211 Va. 19, 175 S.E.2d 279, 1970 Va. LEXIS 203 (1970). Objection to admissi on of report not timely made.  An objection to the introduction of the report in evidence came too late where the objection was raised for the first time after verdict as an additional grou nd in support of a motion to set aside the verdict. Carter v. Nelms, 204 Va. 338, 131 S.E.2d 401, 1963 Va. LEXIS 154 (1963). Reference to repor t not introduced into evidence.  The trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting reference to a police officers written accident report, even though the report was never introduced into evidence.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The rationale of this section and former §§ 46.1-408 and 46.1-409 (see now §§ 46.2-378 and 46.2-379) is that the accident report, although routinely and sometimes hurriedly made, primarily for statistical purposes, nevertheless carries with it the stamp of a written and official document to which a jury could attach more weight than it is properly due if used as evidence. Davis v. Colgin, 219 Va. 5, 244 S.E.2d 750, 1978 Va. LEXIS 150 (1978). Reports may not be use d as evidence in civil case.  Accident reports to Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles) are made without prejudice and are not to be used as evidence in civil case. Cou nsel on cross-examination may not make specific reference to the report in the presence of the jury and read defendants statement therein for the purpose of contradicting him, thereby accomplishing indirectly what he could not do directly. Phillips v . Schools, 211 Va. 19, 175 S.E.2d 279, 1970 Va. LEXIS 203 (1970). Reference to repor t not introduced into evidence.  The trial court committed prejudicial error in permitting reference to a police officers written accident report, even though the report was never introduced into evidence. Davis v. Colgin, 219 Va. 5, 244 S.E.2d 750, 1978 Va. LEXIS 150 (1978). Diagram of accident drawn by officer who was also a party to accident inadmissible.  Diagram of an automobile accident which was part of the accident report made by investigating officer, who was also a party involved in the accident, was erroneou sly admitted into evidence. Galbraith v. Fleming, 245 Va. 173, 427 S.E.2d 187, 9 Va. Law Rep. 928, 1993 Va. LEXIS 49 (1993). Field notes do not constitut e report.  Where plaintiff did not offer in evidence a portion of the report itself, rather, she sought to introduce in evidence the statement recorded by trooper in his fie ld notes, admission of the statement was not barred by this section even though the statement later appeared in the accident report. Cherry v. D.S. Nash Constr. Co., 252 Va. 241, 475 S.E.2d 794, 1996 Va. LEXIS 92 (1996). References during test imony deemed erroneous.  Where numerous references to an accident report during officers testimony by the officer, the court, and plaintiffs attorney amounted to nothing less than an official stamp being placed on the document used to refresh the officers recollection, and could have therefore caused the jury to place more weight on officers testimony than it might otherwise have done, the references to the accident repor t accomplished indirectly what this Code section forbids to be done directly and were erroneous. Acuar v. Letourneau, 260 Va. 180, 531 S.E.2d 316, 2000 Va. LEXIS 107 (2000). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Accident reports could be used as past recollection recorded.  Auto accident reports were past recollection recorded and two police officers were allowed to read from their reports in civil actions arising out of auto acciden ts so long as a proper foundation was laid for past recollection recorded, the juries in the cases were not informed or allowed to know that the documents the officers were reading from were accident reports, and the reports themselves were not entered i nto evidence.

Text For the purpose of enforcing the Virginia Commercial Drivers License Act (§ 46.2-341.1 et seq.), in any case in which a person is charged with a violation of any law of the Commonwealth or of any ordinance of any county, city or town pertaining to the operator or operation of a motor vehicle, except parking violations, and the warrant or summons indicates that the motor vehicle so operated was a commercial motor vehicle as defined in the Virginia Commercial Drivers License Act, or that it was a commercial motor vehicle carrying hazardous materials as defined by the Virginia Commercial Drivers License Act, the court hearing such case shall make a finding , which shall be noted on the record, as to whether such vehicle was in fact a commercial motor vehicle and, if applicable, whether such vehicle was carrying hazardous materials. If the offense charged is one in which operation of a commercial motor vehicle is an element of the offense, the conviction of the offense shall constitute the court s finding that the vehicle was a commercial motor vehicle, but a separate finding shall be made as to whether such vehicle was carrying hazardous materials, if applicable. If the offense charged is one in which operation of a commercial motor vehicle is not an element of the offense, then the court, after convicting the person charged, shall make a separate finding as to whether the vehicle was a commercial motor vehicle and, if applicable, whether it was carrying hazardous materials. The separate findings required by this section shall be noted on the conviction record, and the following procedures shall apply to such separate findings: 1.

CASE NOTES Requirement that clerk certify copy within 15 days (now 18 days) is directory.  The requirement of this section that the clerk certify to the Commissioner a copy of the conviction within 15 days (now 18 days) is not mandatory, but directory. Therefore the lapse of a greater time in the instant case did not vitiate the proceedings. Ladd v. Lamb, 195 Va. 1031, 81 S.E.2d 756, 1954 Va. LEXIS 181 (1954) (decided under prior law). Abstracts of traffic infractions t o DMV.  Clerk of the general district court must send an abstract of the record for each traffic infraction to the Division of Motor Vehicles, under § 46.2-383. Hines v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 752, 576 S.E.2d 781, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (2003). Abstracts not certified by judge or clerk did not invalidate presumption.  The fact that abstracts were certified by one not designated as the judge or the clerk of the general district court did not invalidate the presumption that the D MV maintains accurate records, and such non-compliance with the procedural requirements of the statute was not fatal where the court also admitted certified court document evidencing the convictions.

The Department shall furnish the abstract or transcript to the attorney for the Commonwealth of the jurisdiction in which the case will be heard, to be held available for the court in which the person is to be tried for the violation or charge. Howe ver, the failure of the attorney for the Commonwealth to receive the abstract or transcript in any case shall not constitute grounds for the granting of a continuance of such case.

Annotations CASE NOTES Departme nt of Motor Vehicles record properly admitted.  Department of Motor Vehicles record of defendants adjudication as an habitual offender was an official record of an agency of the Commonwealth, and those reco rds were maintained as part of a governmental function, in a non-adversarial setting, and were a neutral repository of information which did not resemble ex parte examinations; defendants driving record was admissible and its admission did not violat e the Confrontation Clause. Acuna v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 306 (Va. Ct. App. July 11, 2006). Under § 46.2-384, a Department of Motor Vehicles transcript, certified pursuant to § 46.2-215, was prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein and was therefore sufficient to prove defendants prior DUI offenses and support his conviction under §§ 18.2-266 and 18.2-270. Mitchem v. Commonwealth, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 18 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 12, 2010). Circuit court properly convicted defendant of driving on a suspended license, third or subsequent offense, because the only prerequisite for admission of her DMV transcript was that it be authenticated, the statutory procedure for admission of the transcript conveyed no substantive rights to defendant, she demonstrated no prejudice flowing from the method by which the Commonwealth obtained the transcript, the sin gle inaccuracy in the transcript, which was redacted, did not require the complete exclusion of the transcript, and defendants due process rights were not offended by admission of the transcript.

Purpose.  This section was designed under the police power of the State to protect the use of the highways from those who are not qualified to operate motor vehicles, to ex ercise some measure of control over such operators and generally to regulate, standardize and make uniform, so far as practicable, the granting or withholding of this privilege in furtherance of the safety of the users of the highways of the State. Prich ard v. Battle, 178 Va. 455, 17 S.E.2d 393, 1941 Va. LEXIS 181 (1941). The fact that the revocation of license to operate a motor vehicle is made mandatory as a result of a conviction of certain specified offenses does not alter the purpose. Prichard v. Battle, 178 Va. 455, 17 S.E.2d 393, 1941 Va. LEXIS 181 (1941). The operation of a motor vehicle on the public highways is not a natural right. It is a conditional privilege, which may be suspended or revoked under the police power. Prichard v. Battle, 178 Va. 455, 17 S.E.2d 393, 1941 Va. LEXIS 181 (1941). And the license or permit to so operate is not a contract or property right in a constit utional sense. Law v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 449, 199 S.E. 516, 1938 Va. LEXIS 297 (1938); Prichard v. Battle, 178 Va. 455, 17 S.E.2d 393, 1941 Va. LEXIS 181 (1941). Hence, revocation without hearing does not violate due process.  The revocation of an automobile operators license (now drivers license) without a hearing does not operate so as to deprive him of property without due pr ocess. Law v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 449, 199 S.E. 516, 1938 Va. LEXIS 297 (1938). Revocation of a license is civil and not criminal in its nature. Prichard v. Battle, 178 Va. 455, 17 S.E.2d 393, 1941 Va. LEXIS 181 (1941). It is a finding that licensee is no longer fit to enjoy privilege theretofore granted.  The revocation of a license because of an act for which the licensee has been convicted or because of the conviction itself is a finding that by reason of the com mission of the act or the conviction of the licensee, the latter is no longer a fit person to hold and enjoy the privilege which the State had theretofore granted to him under its police power. Prichard v. Battle, 178 Va. 455, 17 S.E.2d 393, 1941 Va. LEX IS 181 (1941). Revocation is no part of the punishment for the offense committed.  The revocation of a permit or license to drive an automobile for violation of the statutes constitutes no part of the punishment fixed by the jury or by the court wherein the offender is tried, nor is it an added punishment for the offense committed. Prichard v. Battle, 178 Va. 455, 17 S.E.2d 393, 1941 Va. LEXIS 181 (1941). Hence, such revoca tion is not affected by a pardon.  Petitioner was convicted under former § 46.1-176 (see now § 46.2-894) of leaving the scene of an accident. As a result his license was suspended for one yea r pursuant to the provisions of this section, and in order to secure a reissuance of the license, he was required to post a bond and collateral. Approximately two years after this conviction he was granted a pardon for the offense. It was held that the p ardon did not restore to petitioner the right to operate an automobile free of the conditions which were imposed upon him when his license was renewed. Prichard v. Battle, 178 Va. 455, 17 S.E.2d 393, 1941 Va. LEXIS 181 (1941). Period of license revocation ter minated.  Evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant drove a vehicle in violation of any existing period of suspension or revocation, and therefore the court reverse d his conviction under subsection B of § 46.2-301, because the period of his license suspension terminated upon payment of his outstanding court costs and his period of revocation ended years prior to his arrest, and his failure to reapply to have his license reinstated or renewed did not extend the periods of his suspension or revocation. Barden v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 700, 771 S.E.2d 699, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 159 (2015). The standard defined by the term state law is the standard of Virginia law, and the term state law means a law of this state. Thus, the Court of Appeals construes this section to control cases involving convictions under (1) a law of this state, (2) a valid county, city or town ordinance of this state, or (3) a law of the Un ited States substantially paralleling and substantially conforming to a like law of this state. Williams v. Terry, 20 Va. App. 557, 458 S.E.2d 603, 12 Va. Law Rep. 11, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 558 (1995). Meaning of used in former subdivision (d) (see now subdivision 5).  It is apparent that the word used as employed in former subdivision (d) (see now subdivision 5) is colored by its context and that its meaning is influenc ed by the purpose of this section, which is to remove from the highways those drivers who endanger the public and who operate motor vehicles in the perpetration of serious crimes. In this context it means that the person whose license is sought to be rev oked operated, drove, or ran a motor vehicle in committing a felony. Lamb v. Driver, 196 Va. 393, 83 S.E.2d 741, 1954 Va. LEXIS 232 (1954). The abstract of conviction filed with the Commissioner and the record in the instant suit begun by a licensee to enjoin the revocation of his license showed only that he had been convicted of the grand larceny of an automobile.

However, if the Commissioner has received a copy of a court order authorizing issuance of a restricted license as provided in subsection E of § 18.2-271.1, he shall proceed as provided in the order of the court. For the purposes of this subsection, an offense in violation of a valid local ordinance, or law of any other jurisdiction, which ordinance or law is substantially similar to any provision of Virginia law herein shall be considered an offense in violation of such provision of Virginia law. Additionally , in no event shall the Commissioner reinstate the drivers license of any person convicted of a violation of § 18.2-266, or of a substantially similar valid local ordinance or law of another jurisdiction, until receipt of notification that such pe rson has successfully completed an alcohol safety action program if such person was required by court order to do so unless the requirement for completion of the program has been waived by the court for good cause shown. A conviction includes a finding o f not innocent in the case of a juvenile. B. The Commiss ioner shall forthwith revoke and not thereafter reissue the drivers license of any person after receiving a record of the conviction of any person (i) convicted of a violation of § 18.2-36.1 or 18.2-51.4 or a felony violation of § 18.2-266 or ( ii) convicted of three offenses arising out of separate incidents or occurrences within a period of 10 years in violation of the provisions of subsection A of § 46.2-341.24 or 18.2-266, or a substantially similar ordinance or law of any other jurisdic tion, or any combination of three such offenses. A conviction includes a finding of not innocent in the case of a juvenile. C. Any person who has had his drivers license revoked in accordance with subsection B of this section may petition the circuit court of his residence, or, if a nonresident of Virginia, any circuit court: 1. For r estoration of his privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth after the expiration of five years from the date of his last conviction. On such petition, and for good cause shown, the court may, in its discretion, restore to the person the priv ilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth on condition that such person install an ignition interlock system in accordance with § 18.2-270.1 on all motor vehicles, as defined in § 46.2-100, owned by or registered to him, in whole or in par t, for a period of at least six months, and upon whatever other conditions the court may prescribe, subject to the provisions of law relating to issuance of drivers licenses, if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that: (i) at the time of his previous convictions, the petitioner was addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or other drugs; (ii) at the time of the hearing on the petition, he is no longer addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcoho l or other drugs; and (iii) the defendant does not constitute a threat to the safety and welfare of himself or others with regard to the driving of a motor vehicle.

The court shall notify the Virginia Alcohol Safety Action Program which shall during the term of the restricted license monitor the persons compliance with the terms of the restrictions imposed b y the court.

For a restricted license to authorize such person to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth in the course of his employment and to drive a motor vehicle to and from his home to the place of his employment after the expiration of three years from the date of his last conviction. The court may order that a restricted license for such purposes be issued in accordance with the procedures of subsection E of § 18.2-271.1, if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that (i) at the time of the previous convictions, the petitioner was addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or other drugs; (ii) at the time of the hearing on the petition, he is no longer addicted to or psychologically dependent on the use of alcohol or such other drugs; and (iii) the defendant does not constitute a threat to the safety and welfare of himself and others with regard to the driving of a motor vehicle.

Any violation of the restrictions shall be reported to the court, and the court may then modify the restrictions or revoke the license.The ignition interlock system installation requirement under subdivisions 1 and 2 of this subsection need only be satisfied once as to any single revocation under subsection B of this section for any person seeking restoration under subdivisi on 1 following the granting of a restricted license under subdivision 1 or 2.

CASE NOTES Applicability.  There is no statutory support for the interpretation that § 46.2-398 only addresses the disposition of an operators license when an appeal is noted from th e general district court to the circuit court under § 16.1-132. Corbin v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 196, 604 S.E.2d 111, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 516 (2004) (decided prior to 2005 amendment). While a court suspends a drivers license under the provisions of § 18.2-271, the court must follow the procedure mandated in § 46.2-398 after ordering t he suspension of the license. Corbin v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 196, 604 S.E.2d 111, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 516 (2004) (decided prior to 2005 amendment). Although § 16.1-135 authorizes the requirement of bail and describes the manner of taking and handling bail bonds, it does not impose any other conditions of b ond upon the defendant when perfecting an appeal to the circuit court. Thus, the language of this section requiring a proper bond would be meaningless if this statute did not apply to appeals from the circuit court. Corbin v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 196, 604 S.E.2d 111, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 516 (2004) (decided prior to 2005 amendment). § 46.2-398.1. Issuance of restricted drivers privilege to out-of-state licensees. Text When the operator of any motor vehicle who is not licensed to drive in Virginia, but who has a valid drivers license from another jurisdiction, is convicted in Virg inia of any violation for which license suspension and issuance of a restricted license to a Virginia driver is authorized, the court may issue him a restricted driving privilege in Virginia upon the same conditions as if the person held a valid Virginia license. The court order, and any writing or communication setting forth the persons restricted privilege, shall include clear language indicating that the person is not a licensed Virginia driver.

The Commiss ioner, on receipt of notice from a court, shall suspend the license of any person who has been legally adjudged to be incapacitated in accordance with Article 1 (§ 64.2-2000 et seq.) of Chapter 20 of Title 64.2. No drivers license shall be issued to any applicant who has previously been adjudged incapacitated and not competent to drive unless, at the time of such application, (i) the applicant has been adjudged restored to capacity by judicial decree or has a court order restoring or retaining th e privilege to drive and (ii) the Department is satisfied that the applicant is competent to drive a motor vehicle with safety to persons and property pursuant to § 46.2-322 or 46.2-325. The clerk of the court in which the adjudication is made shall s end a certified copy or abstract of such adjudication to the Commissioner. B. The Commiss ioner shall not suspend the license or prior privilege to drive of any person legally adjudged to be incapacitated in accordance with Article 1 (§ 64.2-2000 et seq.) of Chapter 20 of Title 64.2, where the court order specifically permits such person t o retain his drivers license or the privilege to drive or to apply for such license. In such case, the clerk of the court in which the adjudication is made shall not send a copy of the order to the Commissioner. However, a court may order any person adjudicated legally incapacitated to submit to an examination pursuant to § 46.2-322 or 46.2-325. In such case, the clerk of the court shall forward a copy of the order requiring an examination to the Department. Upon completion of the examination, th e Department shall take whatever action may be appropriate and may (i) suspend the license or privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth, (ii) permit the examinee to retain his license or privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth , or (iii) issue a license subject to the restrictions authorized by § 46.2-329. C.

The Commissioner shall require any person whose license has been suspended pursuant to this subsection to submit to an examination pursuant to § 46.2-322 or 46.2-325.In any case in which the persons license has been suspende d prior to his discharge, it shall not be returned to him unless the Commissioner is satisfied, after an examination pursuant to § 46.2-322 or 46.2-325, that the person is competent to drive a motor vehicle with safety to persons and property.The faci lity operated or licensed by the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services shall send the necessary information to the Commissioner to initiate the examination process pursuant to § 46.2-322 or 46.2-325. D. Notwithstan ding any other provision of law, the Department reserves the right to examine any licensed driver, any person applying for a drivers license or renewal thereof, or any person whose license has been suspended or revoked to determine his fitness to dri ve a motor vehicle pursuant to § 46.2-322 or 46.2-325.

CASE NOTES In determining whether this section complies with due process standards, the court appli ed the three-prong test enunciated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976): first, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest throug h the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the governments interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitu te procedural requirement would entail.

With respect to the first prong of the analysis found in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976), the private interest is a subst antial one, for the Commonwealth will not be able to make a driver whole for any personal inconvenience and economic hardship suffered by reason of any delay in redressing an erroneous suspension through postsuspension review procedures; however, the dur ation of any potentially wrongful deprivation is an important factor in assessing the impact of official action on the private interest involved.

The risk of an erroneous deprivation is negligible because the medical director of the i nstitution is in the best position to assess a patients ability to operate a motor vehicle safely. Scott v.

The Commonwealths summary suspension procedure does not violate due process if a pro mpt postsuspension remedy is available; the reinstatement procedures are constitutionally adequate. Scott v.

The immediate postdeprivation review provided by this section complies with due process; the Commissioner in Virginia does not question the accuracy of a physicians report submitted for the purpose of reinstatement, but views it as a valid and conclusive statement of the licensees competency. The reinstatement procedures cloak the licensees evidence with an irrebuttable presumption of correctness. The risk of an erroneous deprivation that a licensee could not immediately counter by seeking reinstatement is therefore insignificant, and any additional or alternative procedural safeguards would be inferior to the Commissioners procedures for reinstatement.

For note, Revocation of Operators Licenses under the 1958 Motor Vehicle Code, see 45 Va. L. Rev. 316 (1959). CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Constitutionality.  The provisions of this section for the revocation or suspension of drivers licenses are constitutional. Lamb v. Rubin, 198 Va. 628, 96 S.E.2d 80, 1957 Va. LEX IS 116 (1957). Purpose.  The suspension is designed to protect the public in the use of the highways, and to deny their use to persons who are shown to have been so reckless in their cust omary operation of motor vehicles that a repetition of the same or similar conduct may be expected, and if it occurs, it will constitute a menace to the safety of others. Lamb v. Rubin, 198 Va. 628, 96 S.E.2d 80, 1957 Va. LEXIS 116 (1957). One of the purposes of these provisions authorizing the revocation or suspension of a drivers license is to impress upon the licensee the duty and necessity o f obeying the traffic laws of this State which the General Assembly has enacted for the safety of the public. Another, and even more important purpose, is to remove from the streets and highways a driver who is likely to cause injury and damage before a tragedy occurs. Lamb v. Clark, 199 Va. 374, 99 S.E.2d 597, 1957 Va. LEXIS 200 (1957). The purpose of this section is to protect the public and remove from the streets and highways a driver who is likely to cause injury and damage before a tragedy o ccurs. Commonwealth v. Hill, 196 Va. 18, 82 S.E.2d 473, 1954 Va. LEXIS 195 (1954). This section authorizes suspension of license only for a serious violation, recognizing that there may be different degrees of guilt in violating different provisions or even in violations of the same provision. Commonwealth v. Willis, 194 Va. 210, 72 S.E.2d 269, 1952 Va. LEXIS 222 (1952). Word serious has its ordin ary meaning.  Within the intent of subdivision A 5 of this section, permitting suspension or revocation of operators license (now drivers license) for a serious violati on of the motor vehicle laws, the word serious has its ordinary meaning. Commonwealth v. Hill, 196 Va. 18, 82 S.E.2d 473, 1954 Va. LEXIS 195 (1954); Lamb v. Mozingo, 198 Va. 432, 94 S.E.2d 457, 1956 Va. LEXIS 226 (1956). The word serious as used in subdivision A 1 of this section has its ordinary meaning. Lamb v. Mozingo, 198 Va. 432, 94 S.E.2d 457, 1956 Va. LEXIS 226 (195 6). Satisfactory proof of a single serious violation may warrant a suspension or revocation. Commonwealth v. Hill, 196 Va. 18, 82 S.E.2d 473, 1954 Va. LEXIS 195 (1954); Lamb v. Mozingo, 198 Va. 432, 94 S.E.2d 457, 1956 Va. LEXIS 226 (1956). That no tragedy resulted does not lessen the seriousness of the offense. Commonwealth v. Butler, 191 Va. 193, 61 S.E.2d 12, 1950 Va. LEXIS 211 (1950); Commonwealth v. Willis, 194 Va. 210, 72 S.E.2d 269, 1952 Va. LEXIS 222 (1952); Commonwealth v. Hill, 196 Va. 18, 82 S.E.2d 473, 1954 Va. LEXIS 195 (1954); Lamb v. Mozingo, 198 Va. 432, 94 S.E. 2d 457, 1956 Va. LEXIS 226 (1956). Subdivisions A 4 and A 5 distinguished .  Suspension or revocation of a drivers license may be ordered under subdivision A 5 of this section, if there is satisfactory proof of a single serious vio lation; or under subdivision A 4 for habitually reckless and negligent driving. Lamb v. Rubin, 198 Va. 628, 96 S.E.2d 80, 1957 Va. LEXIS 116 (1957). The Commissioner is permitted to exercise discretion in applying this section. Lamb v. Mo zingo, 198 Va. 432, 94 S.E.2d 457, 1956 Va. LEXIS 226 (1956). Under this section the Commissioner acts in discretionary and not mandatory manner. Dillon v. Joyner, 192 Va. 559, 66 S.E.2d 583, 1951 Va. LEXIS 203 (1951). In applying this section the Commissioner is permitted to exercise discretion. He may suspend a license for a period as long as a year and as short as one day, as he may deem proper under the facts and circumstances of the particular offense. Lamb v. Rubin, 198 Va. 628, 96 S.E.2d 80, 1957 Va. LEXIS 116 (1957). Burden of proof.  The burden of proof is upon the Commonwealth under this section, providing that the revocation of the license may be had when the necessary facts are satisfac torily proved at the hearing. Willis v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 294, 56 S.E.2d 222, 1949 Va. LEXIS 284 (1949). Proof that a driver did, in overtaking and passing a vehicle, cross the double lines, is sufficient to make a prima facie case and meet the burden placed on the C ommonwealth by this section. The burden then shifts to the defendant to show how he could be entirely sure of the saving fact. Commonwealth v. Willis, 194 Va. 210, 72 S.E.2d 269, 1952 Va. LEXIS 222 (1952). Failure to observe stop sign.  Failure to observe a stop sign, standing alone, might not be sufficient to meet the requirements of subdivision A 5 and constitute a serious violation of the motor vehicle laws. Lamb v. Mozingo, 198 Va. 432, 94 S.E.2d 457, 1956 Va. LEXIS 226 (1956). Crossing center line of highway and striking another vehicle.  The offense of crossing the center line of the highway and striking another vehicle, inflicting several hundred dollars damage to the two cars, meets the requirem ents of subdivision A 1. Lamb v. Mozingo, 198 Va. 432, 94 S.E.2d 457, 1956 Va. LEXIS 226 (1956). Crossing double lines.  If a driver has been able to observe the road sufficiently far ahead to be entirely sure that no vehicle is approaching that could render his passing unsafe, his crossing of the double lines, while a violation of the law, may not be a serious violation such as contemplated by this section. But if conditions are not such that he can be entirely sure of that fact, his violation is necessarily serious, because in th at event he is taking a chance of injury or death to himself, to those he meets and to those he is passing. Commonwealth v. Willis, 194 Va. 210, 72 S.E.2d 269, 1952 Va. LEXIS 222 (1952). Racing and passing impro perly on city streets.  The Commissioners finding that a driver had been guilty of a serious violation of the motor vehicle laws in racing and in passing improperly on city streets w as supported by the record and justified his order suspending the drivers license for a period of two months. Commonwealth v. Hill, 196 Va. 18, 82 S.E.2d 473, 1954 Va. LEXIS 195 (1954). License properly suspended on ground that driver was habitually reckless or negligent.  During the period from February 23, 1953, to June 1, 1956, a driver was convicted on three occasions for speeding and three times for disregarding stop signs. The record further showed that his driving habits had not improved as a result of his conviction. Under these circumstances, his license to drive was properly suspended for 30 days on the ground that he was habitually a reckless or negligent driver within t he meaning of this section. Lamb v. Clark, 199 Va. 374, 99 S.E.2d 597, 1957 Va. LEXIS 200 (1957). Admissibility of drivers record subsequent to order revoking license.  See Commonwealth v. Willis, 194 Va. 210, 72 S.E.2d 269, 1952 Va.

Annotations CASE NOTES Testimony of witness not listed in notice.  On appeal from suspension of a license by the Commissioner, the circuit court did not err in permitting an officer to testify, although the officer was not listed as a witness in the original citation notice provided for in this section, where his statements added nothing to what the abstract of conviction disclosed.

Annotations CASE NOTES Sufficiency of finding.  A statement in the Commissioners order that In addition, it is charged that you are an habitually reckless or negligent driver of a motor vehicle in that you have been convicted of the violations cited above, was a sufficient finding on this point, notwithstanding the argument that this sentence was merely an allegation or charge that the driver was an habitually reckless or negligent driver, but not a finding or conclusion to that effect.

History History. Code 1950, § 46-423; 1952, c. 544; 1958, c. 541, § 46.1-436 ; 1974, c. 453; 1984, c. 780; 1989, c. 727. Annotations CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The purpose of this section is to deny the use of the highways to drivers who are shown to have been reckless in their customary operation of motor vehicles so that a repetition of the same, or similar conduct, may be expected, and if it occurs, will constitute a menace to the safety of others. Willis v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 294, 56 S.E.2 d 222, 1949 Va. LEXIS 284 (1949). By clear and reliable evidence.  This section was intended to apply only to drivers who are, in fact, unsafe, and this fact the statute contemplates must be proved by clear and reliable evidence at a fair trial. Willis v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 294, 56 S.E.2d 222, 1949 Va. LEXIS 284 (1949). The test is whether the revocation or suspension is necessary for the safety of others o n the highway. This must be determined on the basis of the past conduct of the defendant. Willis v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 294, 56 S.E.2d 222, 1949 Va. LEXIS 284 (1949) (see Commonwealth v. Willis, 194 Va. 210, 72 S.E.2d 269 (1952)). If the suspension of an operators license (now drivers license) and registration privileges is not reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of rende ring the highway safe for others, then it must be concluded that the Commissioner has exceeded the authority conferred upon him. Butler v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 411, 53 S.E.2d 152, 1949 Va. LEXIS 184 (1949). This section sufficiently guides and restrains the actions of the Commissioner in the ex ercise of the power conferred. Adequate protection in the form of judicial review to any person deeming himself aggrieved by any action of the Commissioner which purports to be in the exercise of such power is also afforded. Butler v. Commonwealth, 189 V a. 411, 53 S.E.2d 152, 1949 Va. LEXIS 184 (1949). Who acts in a discretionary manner.  Under this section the Commissioner acts in a discretionary and not a mandatory manner. Dillon v. Joyner, 192 Va. 559, 66 S.E.2d 583, 1951 Va. LEXIS 203 (1951). Where the records of the Division (now Department) giving rise to the complaint consist of accident reports or other documents, the specific acts or conduct relied on by the Commissioner with respect to each accident should be set out in the notice, as well as the names of the operators of the other vehicles involved, if they appear on the reports. Willis v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 294, 56 S.E.2d 222, 1949 Va. LEXIS 284 (1949). Revoking license plates and registration certificate.  If there is no evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that the motorist will continue to operate or drive his motor vehicle during the period of suspension of his operators license (now drivers license), then this section cannot be said to justify the action of the Commissioner in also suspending and revoking the license plates and registration certificates. Butler v. Commonwealth, 189 Va . 411, 53 S.E.2d 152, 1949 Va. LEXIS 184 (1949); Commonwealth v. Butler, 191 Va. 193, 61 S.E.2d 12, 1950 Va. LEXIS 211 (1950). The provision in this section for the revocation of registration certificates and plates was intended solely for use in cases where the evidence indicates that, i n the absence of such revocation, the motorist whose operators license (now drivers license) is being suspended will nevertheless continue to operate his motor vehicle or vehicles without such license in violation of the law. Butler v. Commonweal th, 189 Va. 411, 53 S.E.2d 152, 1949 Va. LEXIS 184 (1949); Commonwealth v. Butler, 191 Va. 193, 61 S.E.2d 12, 1950 Va. LEXIS 211 (1950). Sufficiency of evidence.  Evidence held insufficient to establish that revocation or suspension of operators license (now drivers license) was necessary for the safety of others on the highway.

Code 1950, § 46-424; 1952, c. 544; 1958, c. 541, § 46.1-437 ; 1960, c. 511; 1984, cc. 673, 703; 1986, c. 615; 1989, c. 727. Annotations CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Consideration. II. Decisions Under Prior Law. I.General Consideration. No review where revocation mandatory.  Review where revocation of defendants license to operate a motor vehicle was mandatory was precluded by the express language of the relevant statute, § 46. 2-410, and defendant was not entitled to review pursuant to subsection B of former § 46.2-352, even though that provision allowed for review, as defendants petition for review under it was precluded by the fact the statute was repealed two months before he filed his petition and the review provision was purely procedural, which meant its repeal affected no vested substantive right to which defendant as entitled. Commonwealth v. Shaffer, 263 Va. 428, 559 S.E.2d 623, 2002 Va. LEXIS 39 (2002). Subject matt er jurisdiction.  Circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to address the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) suspension of appellants drivers license b ecause his challenge did not relate to identity, as he contended that the DMV lacked authority to place certain prior driving convictions on his Virginia driving record after he obtained his Virginia license, and under the plain language of § 46.2-499 , the license suspension was mandatory within the meaning of this section. Wendt v. Holcomb, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 57 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 6, 2021). II.Decisions Under Prior Law. Act of the Commissioner.  The acts of a law-enforcement officer taken to secure the actual surrender of the license of an operator, revoked pursuant to action of the Commissioner under for mer § 46.1-417 (see now § 46.2-389), do not of themselves constitute the act of the Commissioner requiring a suspension or revocation of such drivers license within the meaning of this section. Lawrence v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 960, 58 S.E.2d 875, 1950 Va. LEXIS 185 (1950). Jurisdiction of court rendering original judgment is prerequisite.  Reading former subsection (a) (see now the first paragraph) of this section and former § 46.1-443 (see now § 46.2-418) in conjunction, the jurisdiction of t he court rendering the original judgment is a critical prerequisite to the Commissioners obligation to suspend a license. If the court lacked jurisdiction, suspension is not mandatory, and the full right to appeal remains in force, unencumbered by an y qualification. Tomai-Minogue v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 770 F.2d 1228, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 22520 (4th Cir. 1985). No review where revocation mandatory.  Petitioners license to operate an automobile was revoked by the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles), in accordan ce with the provisions of former §§ 46.1-417, 46.1-466, and 18.2-266 (see now §§ 46.2-389 and 46.2-434), upon receipt of the record of his unappealed conviction by a Maryland court for drunken driving. Petitioners petition for review was properly dismissed by the court of review on the Commissioners motion, for the revocation by the Commissioner was mandatory, and petitioner was thus not entitled, under this section, to a review of his case. Scott v. Commonwealth, 191 Va. 73, 60 S.E. 2d 14, 1950 Va. LEXIS 200 (1950); Dillon v. Joyner, 192 Va. 559, 66 S.E.2d 583, 1951 Va. LEXIS 203 (1951). Under this section there is a right preserved to the operator for a review of the act of the Commissioner, provided the revocation of the license is not mandatory . Dillon v. Joyner, 192 Va. 559, 66 S.E.2d 583, 1951 Va. LEXIS 203 (1951). Except on question of identity.  There is no review under this section where the revocation was mandatory, except on the question of identity. Dillon v. Joyner, 192 Va. 559, 66 S.E.2d 583, 1951 V a. LEXIS 203 (1951); Lamb v. Curry, 197 Va. 395, 89 S.E.2d 329, 1955 Va. LEXIS 233 (1955). Determinatio n of identity.  This section, permitting the circuit court to determine the identity of the person concerned, is intended to allow the introduction of evidence to show th at the person whose license was revoked by the order or act of the Commissioner was not in fact the same person who had been convicted of the offense or offenses for which the revocation was required. In short, its purpose is to afford a judicial review where it is claimed that the license of one person has been revoked by reason of a judgment of conviction pronounced against another. Morrison v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 527, 58 S.E.2d 30, 1950 Va. LEXIS 149 (1950). This section was not designed or intended to permit a licensee who has been convicted upon a charge of reckless driving, or upon any of the other charges mentione d in former § 46.1-417 (see now § 46.2-389), to have such conviction reviewed and set aside by showing that he was not sufficiently identified at the trial to warrant his conviction. Morrison v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 527, 58 S.E.2d 30, 1950 Va. LEX IS 149 (1950). Weight of Commissioners decision.  Though the trial court be vested with board discretionary power under this section, yet the Commissioners order should not be vacated and annulled if his find ings are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and he has applied correct principles of law to the proved facts. Lamb v. Mozingo, 198 Va. 432, 94 S.E.2d 457, 1956 Va. LEXIS 226 (1956); Lamb v. Rubin, 198 Va. 628, 96 S.E.2d 80, 1957 Va. LEXIS 116 ( 1957). The abstracts of conviction are presumed to be correct, and if they are valid on their f ace, the Commissioner cannot question their validity. Dillon v. Joyner, 192 Va. 559, 66 S.E.2d 583, 1951 Va. LEXIS 203 (1951). There is also a strong presumption that a substitute trial justice properly exercises his prerogative, and whether he does so or not is a question of fact that must be raised before the trial justice court or an appropriate appellate court. Dillon v. Joyner, 192 Va. 559, 66 S.E.2d 583, 1951 Va. LEXIS 203 (1951). Purpose of revocation to be considered.  In considering the reasonableness of the action of the Commissioner in revoking the appellants operators license (now drivers license) and registratio n privileges, it is important to bear in mind that such revocations are not intended as a punishment for the operator of the car, but are designed solely for the protection of the public in the use of the highways. The authorities agree that the purpose of the revocation is to protect the public and not to punish the licensee. Lamb v. Taylor, 198 Va. 621, 96 S.E.2d 124, 1957 Va. LEXIS 115 (1957); Butler v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 411, 53 S.E.2d 152, 1949 Va. LEXIS 184 (1949). Eviden ce of other convictions.  Where license was suspended for 30 days by Commissioner under former § 46.1-430 (see now § 46.2-402) upon a showing that operator had been found guilty of s peeding on four occasions and twice of going through a red light, on appeal to the circuit court under this section it was error to refuse to receive evidence offered by the Commissioner of other convictions of speeding. Such evidence was relevant, would have been helpful to the court, and was admissible under the statute. Lamb v. Rubin, 198 Va. 628, 96 S.E.2d 80, 1957 Va. LEXIS 116 (1957). Restoration of permit and license justified.  Upon appeal from Commissioners suspension of license under subdivisions A 1 and A 5 of former § 46.1-430 (see now § 46.2-402), where additional evidence was introduced in the circuit court, it was held that the court did not abuse the discretion vested in it by this section in reversing the order of suspension and restoring petitioners permit and license. Lamb v. Taylor, 198 Va. 621, 96 S.E.2d 124, 1957 Va. LEXIS 115 (1957). Reduction of period of suspension.  Upon appeal from suspension of license by Commissioner under former § 46.1-430 (see now § 46.2-402), it was held that the lower court erred in reducing the period of suspension from 30 days to 10 days. Lamb v. Rubin, 198 Va. 628, 96 S.E.2d 80, 1957 Va. LEXIS 116 (1957). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Former procedural remedy.  Defendant had no vested interest in the procedural remedy formerly provided by § 46.2-352, prior to its 1999 repeal, although it was still in effect at the tim e his license was revoked as an habitual offender, even though he never received notice of his habitual offender determination until he attempted to renew his Maryland license. Bare v. Commonwealth, 59 Va. Cir. 109, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 68 (Fairfax County May 9, 2002). Suspension held improper.  Defendant who was not charged with second offense DUI could not have his license suspended as a second offender; Commissioners order of suspension as a second offender was manifestly unjust, and improperly conflicted with the order of the trial court, as defendant had not been adjudged to be a second offender. Richardson v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 63 (Roanoke Apr. 16, 2002). § 46.2-410.1. Judicial review of revocation or suspension by Commissioner. Text A.

The Commiss ioner may refuse, after a hearing if demanded, to issue to any person whose license has been suspended or revoked any new or renewal license, or to register any motor vehicle in the name of the person, whenever he deems or in case of a hearing finds it n ecessary for the safety of the public on the highways in the Commonwealth. B. Before gran ting or restoring a license or registration to any person whose drivers license or other privilege to drive motor vehicles or privilege to register a motor vehicle has been revoked or suspended pursuant to § 46.2-389, 46.2-391, 46.2-391.1, or 46.2 -417, the Commissioner shall require proof of financial responsibility in the future as provided in Article 15 (§ 46.2-435 et seq.), but no person shall be licensed who may not be licensed under the provisions of §§ 46.2-389 through 46.2-431. C. Whenever th e drivers license or registration cards, license plates and decals, or other privilege to drive or to register motor vehicles of any resident or nonresident person is suspended or revoked by the Commissioner or by a district court or circuit court pu rsuant to the provisions of Title 18.2 or this title, or any valid local ordinance, the order of suspension or revocation shall remain in effect and the drivers license, registration cards, license plates and decals, or other privilege to drive or re gister motor vehicles shall not be reinstated and no new drivers license, registration cards, license plates and decals, or other privilege to drive or register motor vehicles shall be issued or granted unless such person, in addition to complying wi th all other provisions of law, pays to the Commissioner a reinstatement fee of $30. The reinstatement fee shall be increased by $30 whenever such suspension or revocation results from conviction of involuntary manslaughter in violation of § 18.2-36.1 ; conviction of maiming resulting from driving while intoxicated in violation of § 18.2-51.4; conviction of driving while intoxicated in violation of § 18.2-266 or 46.2-341.24; conviction of driving after illegally consuming alcohol in violation of § 18.2-266.1 or failure to comply with court imposed conditions pursuant to subsection D of § 18.2-271.1; unreasonable refusal to submit to drug or alcohol testing in violation of § 18.2-268.2; conviction of driving while a license, permit or p rivilege to drive was suspended or revoked in violation of § 46.2-301 or 46.2-341.21; disqualification pursuant to § 46.2-341.20; violation of drivers license probation pursuant to § 46.2-499; failure to attend a driver improvement clinic pu rsuant to § 46.2-503 or interventions pursuant to former § 46.2-351.1; conviction of eluding police in violation of § 46.2-817; conviction of hit and run in violation of § 46.2-894; conviction of reckless driving in violation of Article 7 ( § 46.2-852 et seq.) of Chapter 8 of Title 46.2 or a conviction, finding or adjudication under any similar local ordinance, federal law or law of any other state. Five dollars of the additional amount shall be retained by the Department as provided in this section and $25 shall be transferred to the Commonwealth Neurotrauma Initiative Trust Fund established pursuant to Article 12 (§ 51.5-178 et seq.) of Chapter 14 of Title 51.5. When three years have elapsed from the termination date of the order o f suspension or revocation and the person has complied with all other provisions of law, the Commissioner may relieve him of paying the reinstatement fee. D. No reinstat ement fee shall be required when the suspension or revocation of license results from the persons suffering from mental or physical infirmities or disabilities from natural causes not related to the use of self-administered intoxicants or drugs. No r einstatement fee shall be collected from any person whose license is suspended by a court of competent jurisdiction for any reason, other than a cause for mandatory suspension as provided in this title, provided the court ordering the suspension is not r equired by § 46.2-398 to forward the license to the Department during the suspended period. E. Except as o therwise provided in this section and § 18.2-271.1, reinstatement fees collected under the provisions of this section shall be paid by the Commissioner into the state treasury and shall be set aside as a special fund to be used to meet the expenses of the Department. F. Before gran ting or restoring a license or registration to any person whose drivers license or other privilege to drive motor vehicles or privilege to register a motor vehicle has been revoked or suspended, the Commissioner shall collect from such person, in add ition to all other fees provided for in this section, an additional fee of $40. The Commissioner shall pay all fees collected pursuant to this subsection into the Trauma Center Fund, created pursuant to § 18.2-270.01, for the purpose of defraying the costs of providing emergency medical care to victims of automobile accidents attributable to alcohol or drug use. G. Whenever an y person is required to pay a reinstatement fee pursuant to subsection C or pursuant to subsection E of § 18.2-271.1 and such person has more than one suspension or revocation on his record for which reinstatement is required, then such person shall b e required to pay one reinstatement fee, the amount of which shall equal the full reinstatement fee attributable to the one of his revocations or suspensions that would trigger the highest reinstatement fee, plus an additional $5 fee for administrative c osts associated with compliance for each additional suspension or revocation. Fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be set aside as a special fund to be used to meet the expenses of the Department. History History.

The Commiss ioner shall not suspend the drivers license or driving privilege or any registration certificate, license plates, or decals under clause (i) of subsection A or § 46.2-418, if the Commissioner finds that an insurer authorized to do business in the Commonwealth was obligated to pay the judgment upon which suspension is based, or that a policy of the insurer covers the person subject to the suspension, if the insurers obligation or the limits of the policy are in an amount sufficient to meet the minimum amounts required by § 46.2-472, even though the insurer has not paid the judgment for any reason. A finding by the Commissioner that an insurer is obligated to pay a judgment, or that a policy of an insurer covers the person, shall not be bin ding upon the insurer and shall have no legal effect whatever except for the purpose of administering this article. Whenever in any judicial proceeding it is determined by any final judgment, decree, or order that an insurer is not obligated to pay the j udgment, the Commissioner, notwithstanding any contrary finding made by him, forthwith shall suspend the drivers license or driving privilege, or any registration card, license plates or decals of any person against whom the judgment was rendered, as provided in subsection A. D. Any suspens ions timely requested by any judgment creditor under subsection A and issued by the Commissioner shall not extend (i) beyond 10 years from the date of judgment for any civil judgment obtained in a general district court, unless the judgment creditor noti fies the Commissioner that an extension has been granted as provided in subdivision B 4 of § 16.1-69.55 or (ii) beyond 20 years from the date of judgment for any civil judgment obtained in a circuit court, unless the judgment creditor notifies the Com missioner that an extension has been granted as provided in § 8.01-251. The expiration of such suspension shall not relieve the judgment debtor of complying with the requirements of proof of financial responsibility pursuant to subsection B of § 46 .2-411 and the reinstatement fees pursuant to subsections C and F of § 46.2-411 after the judgment debtor becomes eligible for restoration of his driving privileges.

Full faith and credit clause permits adoption of another states judgment.  Though a drivers license is a property interest which may not be suspended without some form of hearing, the full faith and credit clause, U.S. Const. Art. IV , § 1, permits Virginia to adopt, for purposes of its own compliance with due process, the judgment of a court from another state. Tomai-Minogue v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 770 F.2d 1228, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 22520 (4th Cir. 1985). Jurisdiction of court rendering original judgment is prerequisite.  Reading former § 46.1-437(a) (see now the first paragraph of § 46.2-410) and this section in conjunction, the jurisdiction of the court rendering the origin al judgment is a critical prerequisite to the Commissioners obligation to suspend a license. If the court lacked jurisdiction, suspension is not mandatory, and the full right to appeal remains in force, unencumbered by any qualification. Tomai-Minogu e v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 770 F.2d 1228, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 22520 (4th Cir. 1985). Section affords post-deprivati on hearing.  This section affords a driver whose license has been suspended a post-deprivation hearing in the Virginia courts on the question of the invalidity of another stat es judgment for absence of personal jurisdiction. Tomai-Minogue v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 770 F.2d 1228, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 22520 (4th Cir. 1985). Pre-de privation hearing not constitutionally mandated.  Virginia provides no pre-deprivation hearing on the jurisdiction of another states court in a proceeding to revoke a drivers license no such hearing is co nstitutionally mandated. Tomai-Minogue v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 770 F.2d 1228, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 22520 (4th Cir. 1985). Authenti cated copy as proof of pretermination hearing.  When the Commissioner suspends a license pursuant to this section, he can rest upon the authenticated copy of the prior judgment as proof that a pretermination he aring has occurred.

The Commissioner shall prescribe the manner in which the written notice shall be made.

Purpose of SR-21 form.  The main purpose of the SR-21 form (financial responsibility form) is for the information of the Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles) so that they may act accordingly in revoking driving privileges. It is not meant to be relied on by insurance carriers. White v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 245 F. Supp. 1, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7222 (W.D. Va. 1965), aff'd, 361 F.2d 785, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6289 (4th Cir. 1966). If there is a policy applicable to the liability, if any, of an operator involved in an accident, the SR-21 form serves the purpose of so advising the Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles) so that such operator will not be required to furnish security or suffer the suspension of his license and registration. White v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 245 F. Supp. 1, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7222 (W.D . Va. 1965), aff'd, 361 F.2d 785, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6289 (4th Cir. 1966). The purpose of requiring the filing of the form is merely to give the Division (now Department) information needed by it to determine whether or not to take actio n under former § 46.1-449 to force the driver involved in an accident to furnish security or suffer suspension of his license and registration because he has no insurance coverage. Virginia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Saccio, 204 Va. 769, 133 S.E.2d 268, 1963 Va. LEXIS 211 (1963). If a policy does not afford coverage in the manner and to the extent required by former § 46.1-450, then the carrier, by the SR-21 form, advises the Division o f Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles) that this policy is not applicable to liability, if any, and the Division is free to invoke the provisions of former § 46.1-449. White v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 245 F. Supp. 1, 1965 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 7222 (W.D. Va. 1965), aff'd, 361 F.2d 785, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6289 (4th Cir. 1966). The filing of an SR-21 form does not convert a voluntary policy into a certified one. Con nell v. Indiana Ins. Co., 334 F.2d 993, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4647 (4th Cir. 1964). Nor does it render the insurance carrier absolutely liable. Connell v. Indiana Ins. Co., 334 F.2d 993, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4647 (4th Cir. 1964). Hence, filing notice does not estop insurer from denying coverage.  The filing of the notice required by this section does not, without more, estop the company from denying coverage. Virginia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Saccio, 2 04 Va. 769, 133 S.E.2d 268, 1963 Va. LEXIS 211 (1963). There is no indication in the statutes of any legislative intent to give the filing of the required notice the effect of binding the insurance company irrevocably to the matters represented by it in such notice. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Atlantic Nat'l Ins. Co., 329 F.2d 769, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5968 (4th Cir. 1964). Nor does filing constitute express waiver of policy exclusions.  The filing of an SR-21 did not constitute an express waiver of policy exclusions by the insurer since there was no language or statement in the SR-21 expressly in dicating that the insurer waived or intended to relinquish its right to thereafter rely upon the exclusions contained in its policy, either generally or with respect to particular exclusions. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Atlantic Nat'l Ins. Co., 329 F.2d 7 69, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5968 (4th Cir. 1964). Where there are no facts indicating that the insurer intended to relinquish any of its policy rights, the court cannot impute that intention to the insurance comp any simply because the form SR-21 was filed. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Atlantic Nat'l Ins. Co., 329 F.2d 769, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5968 (4th Cir. 1964). Unless other circumstances so indi cate.  The filing of an SR-21 form might, in an appropriate case, be considered together with other circumstances as indicative of a waiver by the insurer of the right t o rely upon certain policy provisions. Connell v. Indiana Ins. Co., 334 F.2d 993, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4647 (4th Cir. 1964). Declaration that policy did not cover driver involved in accident held inadmissible.  A declaration, made by a defendant insurance company pursuant to this section, stating that a policy did not cover the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an ac cident, is a self-serving statement and is not admissible in evidence on behalf of the defendant. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Cook, 186 Va. 658, 43 S.E.2d 863, 1947 Va.

The cash or securit ies may be assigned by the depositor for the benefit of the person or persons damaged or injured in the accident as the result of which the cash or securities were filed or deposited without the damaged or injured person being required to institute legal proceedings. The Commissioner shall accept the assignment if, in his opinion, the rights of any other person or persons shall not be prejudiced thereby. History History.

However, the judgment debtor whose driving privileges, registration certificates, and license plates have been so suspended may petition t he court that entered the judgment for reinstatement of his driving privileges, registration certificates, and license plates and the court may order reinstatement if the judgment has not been satisfied, provided the judgment debtor proves by a preponder ance of the evidence that the judgment debtor (i) is unable, after examination of the records of the Department and the court reflecting that suspension and the exercise of due diligence, to locate the person to whom payment is due or, if the person to w hom payment is due is dead, the judgment debtor is unable to identify either who are his heirs and assignees, or where they are located, and (ii) has paid into the court an amount equal to the judgment, court costs, and all interest that has accrued up t o the date payment was made to the court. Any payment made to the court under this section shall be held for one year and, if unclaimed by the judgment creditor during that period, shall be transmitted by the court to the State Treasurer or his designee to be disposed of pursuant to the Virginia Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (§ 55.1-2500 et seq.). Upon receipt of such an order, the Commissioner shall reinstate the driving privileges, registration certificates, and license plates of the judgment debtor, provided t he judgment debtor has given proof of his financial responsibility in the future and satisfied all other reinstatement requirements as provided in this chapter. The motor vehicle involved in the accident on which the suspension under § 46.2-417 is based shall not be registered in the name of any other person when the Commiss ioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the registration of the vehicle will have the effect of defeating the purpose of the chapter and no other motor vehicle shall be registered, and no drivers license or learners permit shall be issued in the name of the person suspended, except as prescribed in § 46.2-437 until the suspension is terminated. This section shall not relieve any person from giving or maintaining proof of his financial responsibility when he is required so to do for some reason rather than havi ng been involved in a motor vehicle accident.

Chapter applies only to policies certified as proof of financial responsibility. Farm Bur eau Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Hammer, 177 F.2d 793, 1949 U.S. App. LEXIS 3286 (4th Cir. 1949), cert. denied, 339 U.S. 914, 70 S. Ct. 575, 94 L. Ed. 1339, 1950 U.S. LEXIS 2278 (1950). The provisions of the sections found in the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, including this section, apply only to policies which have been certified to t he Commissioner of Motor Vehicles as proof of financial responsibility. They do not apply to a policy which has been voluntarily procured. Stillwell v. Iowa Nat'l Mut. Ins. Co., 205 Va. 588, 139 S.E.2d 72, 1964 Va. LEXIS 222 (1964) (see State Farm Mut. A uto. Ins. Co. v. Arghyris, 189 Va. 913, 55 S.E.2d 16 (1949)). This section affirms the view that an owners policy is dependent upon ownership of t he vehicles described in it. Byrd v. American Guarantee &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., 89 F. Supp. 158, 1949 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1846 (D. Va. 1949), aff'd, 180 F.2d 246, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2405 (4th Cir. 1950). And it makes intent of parties clearer .  The intent of the parties is made clearer by the requirement of this section that all liability policies designate by explicit description or by appropriate r eference, all motor vehicles with respect to which coverage is intended to be granted. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Akers, 340 F.2d 150, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6987 (4th Cir. 1965). Intentional torts of insured.  An automobile liability insurance policy which is certified pursuant to the Virginia Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act does not afford coverage for the inte ntional torts of its insured. Certified policies do not provide greater protection to the insured than standard policies and the word accident does not take on a different meaning merely because the policy is certified. Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tra velers Indem. Co., 223 Va. 145, 286 S.E.2d 225, 1982 Va. LEXIS 181 (1982). Secondary pr otection required for permissive users.  Subsection B of § 46.2-368 requires a self-insurer to provide the permissive users of its motor vehicles uninsured or underinsured motorist protection to the e xtent required by § 38.2-2206; however, the subsection limits that protection to the financial requirements of § 46.2-472 and specifically provides that this protection shall be secondary coverage to any other available insurance coverage. USAA Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hertz Corp., 265 Va. 450, 578 S.E.2d 775, 2003 Va. LEXIS 44 (2003). Effect of uncompleted sale of vehicle.  Where insured had contracted to sell the automobile covered by a liability policy, and the purchaser had possession and had made the final payment on the purchase price, but the certificate of title had not been transferred as required by former § 46.1-87 (see now § 46.2-628), insured remained the owner of the vehicle, and the policy covered persons injured by the purchaser while driving the vehicle with th e consent of the insured. Nationwide Ins. Co. v. Storm, 200 Va. 526, 106 S.E.2d 588, 1959 Va. LEXIS 135 (1959). Provision requiring insured to maintain underlying policy with higher limits was enforceable.  Under a personal liability umbrella policy, a provision requiring an insured to perform the affirmative act of maintaining underlying insurance at policy limits g reater than the amount required by § 46.2-472 was enforceable against a third-party additional insured because the provision was a condition precedent to the insurers obligation to pay for loss that exceeded an insureds underlying policy limit s and a third-party additional insureds rights could not be greater than the rights of the named insured. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 596 F. Supp. 2d 940, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8263 (E.D. Va. 2009). In a case in which an employee sought a declaratory judgment that an insurer provide uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage of $ 1 million, th e limits of the policy, because the policy failed to comply with Virginias split limits requirements since the declaration page only identified his employers UM/UIM coverage limits in a combined single limit format, rather than tracking the preci se split limits language of § 46.2-472, which § 38.2-2206 prescribed as the minimum limits for UM/UIM coverage, contrary to the employees argument, those imprecise provisions in his employers policy, by operation of law, did not cause his employers UM/UIM coverage to equal its $ 1 million liability limit. Melton v. Discover Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 760 F. Supp. 2d 633, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4048 (W.D. Va. 2011). Rejection of higher limits.  In a case in which an employee sought a declaratory judgment that an insurer provide uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage of $1 million, the limits of the policy, because deficiencies in that form invalidated his employers selection, while the insurers supplementary application form garbled its explanation of Virginias financial responsibility limits, the employer clearly rejecte d its liability limits as its UM/UIM limits and instead selected Virginias minimum limits which it understood to be the minimum UM/UIM limits Virginia permitted. Both its rejection and its selection were clear, and it understood them. Melton v. Disco ver Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 760 F. Supp. 2d 633, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4048 (W.D.

This section applies exclusively to policies certified as proof of financial responsibility pursuant to the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act. Connell v. Indiana Ins. Co., 334 F.2d 993, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4647 (4th Cir. 1964). It has no application to policies which have been voluntarily procured. Connell v. Indian a Ins. Co., 334 F.2d 993, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4647 (4th Cir. 1964). The provisions of the Virginia Safety Responsibility Act, which includes this section, do not apply to policies voluntarily procured but only to policies certifie d as proof of financial responsibility under the statute.

(2) Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and property. (3) The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the v ehicle is operated. (b) It is the policy of each of the party states to: (1) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles. (2) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances an d administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states. Article II Definitions As used in this compact: (a) State means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (b) Home state means the state which has issued and has the power to suspend or revoke the use of the l icense or permit to operate a motor vehicle. (c) Conviction means a conviction of any offense related to the use or operation of a motor vehicle whi ch is prohibited by state law, municipal ordinance or administrative rule or regulation, or a forfeiture of bail, bond, or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, and which conviction or f orfeiture is required to be reported to the licensing authority. Article III Reports of Conviction The licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee. Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted; describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated; identify the court in which action was taken; indicate whether a plea o f guilty or not guilty was entered, or the conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security; and shall include any special findings made in connection therewith. Article IV Effect of Conviction (a) The licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Article III of this compact, as it would if such co nduct had occurred in the home state, in the case of convictions for: (1) Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle; (2) Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug, or under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders the driver incapab le of safely driving a motor vehicle; (3) Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used; (4) Failure to stop and render aid in the event of a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another. (b) As to other convictions, reported pursuant to Article III, the licensing authority in the home state shall give such effect to the conduct as is provided by the laws of the home sta te. (c) If the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in subdivision (a) of this article, such party state shall construe the denominations and descriptions appearing in subdivision (a) hereof as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature and the laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is given to this article. Article V Applications for New Licenses Upon application for a license to drive, the licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of a license to drive issued by any other party state. The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to the applicant if: (1) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated. (2) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of one year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law. The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing auth ority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways. (3) The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license. Article VI Applicability of Other Laws Except as expressly required by provisions of this compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state. Article VII Compact Administrator and Interchange of Information (a) The head of the licensing authority of each party state shall be the administrator of this compact for his state. The administrators, acting jointly, shall have the power to formulate all necessary and proper procedures for the exchange of information under this compact. (b) The administrator of each party state shall furnish to the administrator of each other party state any information or documents reasonably necessary to facilitate the administration of this compact. Article VIII Entry Into Force and Withdrawal (a) This compact shall enter into force and become effective as to any state when it has enacted the same into law. (b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until six months after the executive head of the wi thdrawing state has given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by the licensing authorities of states remaining party to the compact of any report of convicti on occurring prior to the withdrawal. Article IX Construction and Severability This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, senten ce or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of thi s compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and ef fect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

Annotations CASE NOTES Construction with § 46.2-300.  Because defendant, a domiciliary of another state, while residing in Virginia, could use his commercial drivers license issued by that state to drive non-comm ercial vehicles in Virginia, the trial court erred in finding otherwise, requiring reversal of his conviction under § 46.2-300; moreover, this position was consistent with the legislatures intent that the holder of a commercial drivers license stood in a class separate from persons who held regular drivers licenses.

The Commiss ioner shall place on probation for a period of six months any person who has been directed to attend a driver improvement clinic pursuant to the provisions of § 46.2-498. In addition, the Commissioner shall place any person on probation for a period o f six months on receiving a record of a conviction of such person of any offense for which demerit points are assessed and the offense was committed within any driver control period imposed pursuant to § 46.2-500. Whenever a person who has been placed on probation is convicted, or found not innocent in the case of a juvenile, of any offense for which demerit points are assessed, and the offense was committed during the probation period, the Commissioner shall suspend the persons license for a per iod of ninety days when six demerit points are assigned, for a period of sixty days when four demerit points are assigned, and for a period of forty-five days when three demerit points are assigned. In addition, the Commissioner shall again place the per son on probation for a period of six months, effective on termination of the suspension imposed pursuant to this section. B. Upon reques t, the Commissioner shall grant a restricted license during the first period of suspension imposed pursuant to subsection A of this section provided the person is otherwise eligible to be licensed. Any person whose drivers license is suspended for a second or subsequent time under subsection A of this section shall be eligible to receive a restricted drivers license only if the violation occurred within a probation period that was immediately preceded by a control period. A restricted license ma y be issued for any of the purposes set forth in subsection E of § 18.2-271.1. Written verifications of the persons employment, continuing education or medically necessary travel shall also be required and made available to the Commissioner. Whene ver a person who has been granted a restricted license pursuant to this subsection is convicted, or found not innocent in the case of a juvenile, of any offense for which demerit points are assessed, and the offense was committed during the restricted li cense period, the Commissioner shall suspend the persons license using the same demerit point criteria and suspension periods set forth in subsection A of this section. No restricted license issued pursuant to this subsection shall permit any person to operate a commercial motor vehicle as defined in the Virginia Commercial Drivers License Act (§ 46.2-341.1 et seq.). C. Whenever th e Department receives notice from the court that restricted license privileges have been granted to a person who has an existing restricted license issued pursuant to subsection B of this section, the existing restricted license shall be cancelled, and t he Commissioner shall suspend the persons license for the period of time remaining on the original order of suspension. No court-granted restricted license shall be issued until the end of the suspension period imposed by the Commissioner.

CASE NOTES Subject matter jurisdiction.  Circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to address the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) suspension of appellants drivers license b ecause his challenge did not relate to identity, as he contended that the DMV lacked authority to place certain prior driving convictions on his Virginia driving record after he obtained his Virginia license, and under the plain language of this section, the license suspension was mandatory within the meaning of § 46.2-410.

CASE NOTES Prohibits vehicles from being held in tenancy by the entirety.  Debtor could not own a minivan in a tenancy by the entireties where the clear import of § 46.2-622 was to make the interest of an individual co-owner liable fo r his or her individual debts, which ran afoul of the principal feature of a tenancy by the entireties, which was to immunize the jointly-owned property from claims of non-joint creditors. But if there were any doubt as to the legislatures intent to prevent that result, the statute expressly prohibited the issuance of a certificate of title in the names of two persons as tenants by the entireties.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Strict construction.  The Supreme Court has adopted a very strict attitude in construing Virginias motor vehicle registration laws. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. , 227 F. Supp. 958, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7247 (W.D. Va. 1964). Interpretation of section by Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles) is entitled to substantial weight. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 227 F. Supp. 958, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7247 (W.D. Va. 1964). Virginias Motor Vehicle Act uses the certificate of title as a substitute recording system. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 227 F. Supp. 958, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7247 (W.D. Va. 1964). As well as the conclus ive evidence of ownership.  See Travelers Indem. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 227 F. Supp. 958, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7247 (W.D. Va. 1964). An automobile, by its characteristics, was not intended to be handled by bill of sale.  To follow the general law of sales to ascertain ownership of automobiles would be contrary to the intent of the registration laws, and would create confusion, unc ertainty and endless difficulties. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Trussell, 208 F. Supp. 154, 1962 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4668 (W.D. Va. 1962). Compliance with this section is required in most cases in order to transfer ownership of an automobile. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Trussell, 208 F. Supp. 154, 1962 U.S. Dist.

Otherwise contract of sale is merely executory.  If no assignment of title to the automobile has been executed and delivered by the seller to the purchaser, and no notice of transfer has been given as required b y the statute, then the contract of sale is merely executory and not executed.

American Inter-Insurance Exch. v. H ome Indem. Co., 489 F. Supp. 234, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12768 (W.D. Va. 1980). In order to effect a transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle, two things are required: (1) the owner must actually deliver the endorsed certificate of title to t he transferee; and (2) the owner must deliver possession of the vehicle to the transferee. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Atlanta Cas. Co., 260 Va. 148, 530 S.E.2d 161, 2000 Va. LEXIS 103 (2000).

Transfer effective even though name of transferee left blank.  Pursuant to § 46.2-630, it is the responsibility of the transferee, not the owner, to enter on the received certificate of title the name in which the new cert ificate of title will be issued; the delivery of the certificate of title to the transferee, signed by the owner, is thus effective to transfer title to the vehicle even though the name of the transferee has been left blank. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Atlanta Cas. Co., 260 Va. 148, 530 S.E.2d 161, 2000 Va. LEXIS 103 (2000). The test employed to find a delivery under this section is a sufficiently manifested int ent to deliver. American Inter-Insurance Exch. v. Home Indem. Co., 489 F. Supp. 234, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12768 (W.D. Va. 1980). When the seller mailed the assigned title to its agent, it manifested the intention that the document should pass into the possession of the purchaser and this ma nifestation of intent, without more, constitutes a delivery under this section. American Inter-Insurance Exch. v. Home Indem. Co., 489 F. Supp. 234, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12768 (W.D. Va. 1980).

LEXIS 12768 (W.D. Va. 1980). Motor numb er must correspond with that on certificate.  Transfer of a marketable title to a motor vehicle can only be accomplished by compliance with the formalities imposed, one of which is that the motor number be re cited upon the certificate of title. That necessarily contemplates and requires that the motor number on the engine correspond with that appearing on the certificate of title. Silvey v. Johnston, 193 Va. 677, 70 S.E.2d 280, 1952 Va. LEXIS 179 (1952).

Bell, 111 F.2d 103, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 3583 (4th Cir. 1940). Insurance coverage where assignment and delivery of title deferred.  Where an automobile is sold by the owner with full payment of the agreed price and delivery of possession to the purchaser thereof but the assignment and delivery of the certificate of title are deferred, a change in the ownership of the automobile is not consummated and coverage of such automobile by an insurance policy issued to the owner thereof continues in force until the consummation of the sale by assignme nt and delivery of the certificate of title.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The requirements of this section are mandatory. Wicker v. National Sur. Corp., 330 F.2d 1 009, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5627 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 838, 85 S. Ct. 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1964). An affirmative agreement to postpone compliance with this section, in the context of lia bility coverage, has been held to require a conclusion that the agreement was executory. Wicker v. National Sur. Corp., 330 F.2d 1009, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5627 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 838, 85 S. Ct. 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1 964). Execution of the assignment and delivery of the certificate are, or may be, critical and conclusive of the question of passage of title. Wicker v. National Sur. Corp., 330 F.2d 1009, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5627 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 838, 85 S. Ct. 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1964). Hence, if the assignment of the title certificate has not been executed at the time of an accident, the seller has at least a legal title and the entire transacti on may be held to be executory. Wicker v. National Sur. Corp., 330 F.2d 1009, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5627 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 838, 85 S. Ct. 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1964). But filing of documents with the Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles) is not. Wicker v. National Sur. Corp., 330 F.2d 1009, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5627 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 838, 85 S. Ct. 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1964). Hence, where at the time an accident occurs the assignment of the title has been properly and completely executed and the papers are being held by the dealer only for the purpose of filing them in the Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles), then closed for the holidays, nothing else remained for the seller or purchaser to do, and the sale of the vehicle was executed, not executory, the purc hasers use of the automobile was not permissive, and the omnibus clause of the dealers liability insurance did not extend the coverage of that insurance to the purchaser. Wicker v. National Sur. Corp., 330 F.2d 1009, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5627 (4t h Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 838, 85 S. Ct. 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1964). Failure to execute an assignment of the title documents prevents passage of the legal ti tle in some circumstances. Wicker v. National Sur. Corp., 330 F.2d 1009, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5627 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 838, 85 S. Ct. 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1964). Divestment of sellers interest not affected by purchasers noncompliance.  If the seller delivers the title certificate to the purchaser, the assignment on the back of the certificate having been properly executed, the seller has diveste d himself of all interest in the vehicle, whether or not the purchaser thereafter complies with his statutory duty of filing the assigned certificate with the Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles). Wicker v. National Sur. Corp., 3 30 F.2d 1009, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 5627 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 838, 85 S. Ct. 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 45, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 575 (1964). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Effect on ownership.  Buyer was not entitled to return vehicle purchased from a seller under § 46.2-1542 as the seller would have been able to produce the old certificate of title b efore the expiration of the temporary certificate of registration if the buyer would have retrieved it within 30 days of the purchase and the buyer became the owner and could not rescind the sale when the seller finally signed the certificate of title in compliance with § 46.2-631 one day before the alleged rescission.

Whenever th e applicant for the registration of a motor vehicle, manufactured home, trailer, or semitrailer or a new certificate of title is unable to present a certificate of title because the certificate has been lost or unlawfully detained by one in possession of it or whenever the certificate of title is otherwise not available, the Department may receive the application and investigate the circumstances of the case and may require the filing of affidavits or other information. When the Department is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to the title, it may register the motor vehicle, manufactured home, trailer, or semitrailer and issue a new registration card, license plate, or plates and certificate of title to the person entitled to it. B. Whenever th e insurance company or its agent makes application for a certificate of title to a vehicle that is not a salvage vehicle as defined in § 46.2-1600 and is unable to present a certificate of title, the Department may receive the application along with a n affidavit indicating that the vehicle was acquired as the result of the claims process and describing the efforts made by the insurance company or its agent to obtain the certificate of title from the previous owner. When the Department is satisfied th at the applicant is entitled to the title, it may issue a certificate of title to the person entitled to it. The Commissioner may charge a fee of $25 for the expense of processing an application under this subsection that is accompanied by an affidavit. Such fee shall be in addition to any other fees and taxes required. All fees collected under the provisions of this subsection shall be paid into the state treasury and set aside as a special fund to be used to meet the expenses of the Department. History History.

Connecticut Fire Ins. Co., 233 F. Supp. 31, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7349 (W.D. Va. 1964), aff'd, 341 F.2d 913, 1965 U.S. App. LEXIS 6621 (4th Cir. 1965) (decided under prior l aw). Repossession under c onditional sales contract.  Where a conditional vendor retained title to a trailer as security for the purchase price, but immediately after the sale transferred all his right, title and int erest in the trailer and all his rights under the conditional sales contract to a bank, he did not reacquire title to the trailer by operation of law when he repossessed it with the consent of the vendee. Eureka-Security Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Maxwell , 276 F.2d 132, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 5189 (4th Cir. 1960) (decided under prior law). Finance company which was the assignee of a conditional sales contract and had obtained a power of attorney from the purchaser under the contract, automatically a cquired title to automobile by operation of law when it repossessed the car, even though it failed to send proper papers to the Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles). United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Trussell, 208 F. Supp. 154, 1 962 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4668 (W.D. Va. 1962) (decided under prior law). Redemption in bankruptcy.  Repossession of the debtors car prior to the Chapter 13 bankruptcy did not extinguish the debtors interest in the car under §§ 8.9A-609, 8.9A-615, 8 .9A-619(c), and 46.2-633, and the debtors plan could effectuate a redemption under § 8.9A-623 by paying the creditor in full by resuming payments and paying delinquent installments within a reasonable time; thus, the creditors motion for relie f from the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C.S. § 362(d)(1) was denied.

Criminal defendant not allowed to seek title in own name.  When defendant relinquished, in a property settlement agreement, any interest in a boat and trailer to defendants former husband, and then, after the husband s death, obtained title to the boat and trailer, the fact that the husband did not obtain title to the boat and trailer in the husbands own name prior to the husbands death did not allow defendant to seek title to the boat and trailer in defe ndants name, under subsection A of § 46.2-633, because an absence of recordation had no effect on the rights of parties to the transfer of a vehicle. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 39 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 14, 2012). § 46.2-633.1. Sale in Virginia of vehicle repossessed in another state. Text Any motor vehicle dealer who purchases a vehicle titled in another state and that was repossessed may sell that vehicle in Virginia without obtaining a Virginia title f or the vehicle from Virginia or the state in which the vehicle is titled, provided the motor vehicle dealer has an affidavit of repossession or similar document showing the lawful repossession, which affidavit or document would be sufficient to allow the sale of the repossessed vehicle in the state where it is titled without titling the vehicle in the name of the seller.

Legislative intent.  It was the intention of the legislature, in enacting this section and former §§ 46.1-70 through 46.1-74 (see now §§ 46.2-637 through 46.2-641) 46.1-77 through 46.1-79 (see now §§ 46.2-644, 46.2-624, 46.2-604), and 46.1-86 (see now § 46.2-620), to provide for a simple means for the ascertainment of liens against motor vehicles. Maryland Credit Fin. Corp. v. Franklin Credit Fin. Corp., 164 Va. 579, 180 S.E. 408, 1935 Va. LEXIS 230 (1935); General Credit, Inc. v. Winchester, Inc., 196 Va. 711, 85 S.E.2d 201, 1955 Va. LEXIS 143 (1955); Richlands Nat'l Bank v. Smith, 34 Bankr. 749, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12263 (W.D. Va. 1983). One purpose of the Virginia Registration Statute is to afford notice to third parties of any outstanding liens against the vehicle. Richlands Nat'l Bank v. Smith, 34 Bankr. 749, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12263 (W.D. Va. 1983). Former sections 46.1-69 through 46.1-71 (see now §§ 46.2-636 through 46.2-638) were designed to supersede former provisions for recording bill of sale for an automobile or a chattel mortgage thereon in the local clerks office (§ 55-96 et seq.) by requiring that such documents be registered with a central state agency, namely, t he Division of Motor Vehicles (now Department of Motor Vehicles). General Credit, Inc. v. Winchester, Inc., 196 Va. 711, 85 S.E.2d 201, 1955 Va. LEXIS 143 (1955). Notation needed for perfection.  In order to perfect a security interest in a motor vehicle, a notation must appear on the vehicles certificate of title. In re Johnson, 179 Bankr. 800, 1995 B ankr. LEXIS 455 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1995). Limited Liability Company (LLC) that acquired debt owed by a family-owned communications company (debtor) that declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy did not acqu ire security interests in motor vehicles the debtor owned because a bank that loaned the debtor $50.8 million did not perfect its interest in the vehicles before it sold the debt to the LLC; while the vehicles were arguably included within the scope of a security agreement the debtor executed, the bank did not annotate title to the vehicles, pursuant to § 46.2-636, to show its interest, and the debtor retained possession of the certificates of title and held those certificates at the time the bank so ld the debt to the LLC. DSP Acquisition, LLC v. Free Lance-Star Publ. Co. (In re Free Lance-Star Publ. Co.), No. 14-30315-KRH, No. APN 14-03038-KRH, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 1644 (Bankr. E.D. Va. Apr. 14, 2014). Creditor may enforce unrecorded security agreement against purchaser.  Even though an owner may not record a security interest and thus does not give third parties notice, nevertheless, the creditor is entitled to rely upon and enfor ce the security agreement against the purchaser who had executed the agreement. Richlands Nat'l Bank v. Smith, 34 Bankr. 749, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12263 (W.D. Va. 1983). Perfection of a lien on a mobile home can only be accomplished by indication of same on the face of the certificate of title. In re Smith, 311 F. Supp. 900, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12092 (W.D. Va. 1970), aff'd, 437 F.2d 898, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 11938 (4th Cir. 1971). § 46.2-636.1. Security interests in farm tractors and special construction and forestry equipment. Text A financing statement, as defined in § 8.9A-102, must be filed to perfect all security interests in farm tractors and special construction and forestry equipment, as defined in § 46.2-100. No other provisions of this chapter pertaining to security interests shall apply to these motor vehicles.

In such cases, the owner shall file an application with the Department on a form furnished for that purpose, setting forth the security interests and whatever addi tional information the Department may deem necessary. If satisfied that it is proper for the security interest to be recorded, when the certificate of title covering the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, is surrendered, the Department shall issue a new certificate of title, showing security interests in the order of their priority according to the date of the filing of the application. For the purpose of recording a subsequent security interest, the Commissioner may require any secured party to de liver to him the certificate of title. The new certificate shall be sent or delivered to the secured party from whom the prior certificate was obtained. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a security interest in a motor vehicle, trailer, or semit railer which is inventory held for sale shall be perfected only as provided in §§ 8.9A-301 through 8.9A-527.

Commercial Law, § 98. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Purpose of section.  Although this section provides for the recording of security interests created in a motor vehicle after the original issuance of the title, the purpose of this se ction is to provide a simple means for third-party purchasers or creditors to ascertain the existence of a prior security interest. Bain v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 89, 205 S.E.2d 641, 1974 Va. LEXIS 236 (1974). By requiring the showing of security interests in automobiles on the certificates of title, this section protects other creditors who may rely on the public recor d. Lubman v. J.B. Eurell Co. (In re Fregosi), 23 Bankr. 641, 1982 Bankr. LEXIS 3186 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1982). Bank entitled to enforce unrecorded security agreement against defaulting debtor.  Even though banks security interest was unrecorded and therefore unperfected as to third parties, the bank was entitled to rely upon and enforce its security agreement against a defaulting debtor. Bain v. Commonwealth, 215 Va. 89, 205 S.E.2d 641, 1974 Va. LEXIS 236 (1974). Camping trailer.  While a camping trailer has been afforded a definition separate from that of a trailer or semitrailer, it still falls under the general category of trailers, and, accordingly, all security interest created in such trailers, unless excluded by an exception, must be shown on the certificate of title to be properly perfected. Marshall v. Wilton (In re ASW III Builder-Contractor), 12 Bankr. 29, 1981 Bankr. LEXIS 3668 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1981). Floor plan lenders.  In Chapter 7 trustees avoidance action against floor plan lender, agreement that required debtor, a car dealer, to give the lender physical possession of titl es to cars debtor had purchased for resale, this section did not prohibit a floor plan lender from possessing certificates of title; rather, it provided that the lenders lien shall not be perfected unless the lender had complied with Virginias ve rsion of the Uniform Commercial Code, which required the filing of a financing statement. Barrett v. Vehicle Acceptance Corp. (In re Chamberlayne Auto Sales &amp; Repair, Inc.), 585 Bankr. 116, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 484 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2018). Date of perfection.  Electronic record of the lien pre-petition demonstrated a perfected security interest; perfection took place prior to the petition date, and the filing of debtor s bankruptcy prior to the issuance of a paper title reflecting the creditors lien did not invalidate the creditors perfected security interest. The creditor properly perfected its security interest prior to the petition date and thus was the holder of a secured claim. In re Thompson, No. 18-60017, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 1521 (Bankr. W.D. Va.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Many of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The use of the words adequate notice and to the Commonwealth, creditors and purchasers seems to be very strong and definite language which, by any fair interpretation, would strongly indicate that this section is a notice statute as to third persons and was not intended to invalidate unrecorded transactions in motor vehic les other than sales as between the immediate parties to that transaction. Staunton Indus. Loan Corp. v. Wilson, 190 F.2d 706, 1951 U.S. App. LEXIS 3443 (4th Cir. 1951). Registration cards and certificates of title and the liens thereon appearing are sufficient notice to creditors and purchasers and do not have to be recorded locally. C.I.T. Corp. v. Guy, 170 Va. 16, 195 S.E. 659, 1938 Va. LEXIS 158 (1938). Under this section, without recordation elsewhere, the notation of a lien on a certificate of title is adequate constructive notice thereof to creditors a nd purchasers, just as the recordation in the local clerks office of a chattel mortgage on any other personal property is adequate constructive notice thereof to creditors and purchasers. General Credit, Inc. v. Winchester, Inc., 196 Va. 711, 85 S.E.2d 201, 1955 Va. LEXIS 143 (1955). When issued, a certificate of title showing a lien is adequate notice to all creditors and purchasers, without further recordation, that a lien against the motor vehicle exists. GMAC v. Smith, 377 F.2d 271, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 6350 (4th Cir. 1967). Such registration is required of residents and of nonresidents who operate here. Obvious ly it was never intended to place the burden upon nonresidents who are never in Virginia except upon some casual occasion. C.I.T. Corp. v. Guy, 170 Va. 16, 195 S.E. 659, 1938 Va. LEXIS 158 (1938); Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. v. Kaplan, 198 Va. 67, 92 S .E.2d 359, 1956 Va. LEXIS 175 (1956). Lien p erfected only by noting security interest on title.  When a certificate of title is issued without the lien noted thereon, there is no lien of record and the property is free of a recorded encumbrance. It follows th at if no certificate of title has issued showing such lien, then the lien is unperfected: The security interest must be filed with the Division (now Department). Perfection of a lien on a motor vehicle can be accomplished only by indicating the security interest on the face of the certificate of title. Richlands Nat'l Bank v. Smith, 34 Bankr. 749, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12263 (W.D. Va. 1983). Lien not shown on title certificate is subordinate to lien of execution.  A lien not shown on the certificate of title to a truck, owned by a resident, is not recorded as required by statute and is subordinate to the lien of an executio n levied on the truck. Maryland Credit Fin. Corp. v. Franklin Credit Fin. Corp., 164 Va. 579, 180 S.E. 408, 1935 Va. LEXIS 230 (1935); C.I.T. Corp. v. Crosby &amp; Co., 175 Va. 16, 7 S.E.2d 107, 1940 Va. LEXIS 141 (1940). Because interest was unperfected on the date debtor filed its bankruptcy petition, the t rustees hypothetical judicial lien had priority, rendering the unperfected lien subject to avoidance by the chapter 7 trustee; as such, claimant was left with an unsecured claim against debtors estate. General Elec. Capital Corp. v. Spring Grove Transp., Inc., 202 Bankr. 862, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1684 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1996). Creditor perfected its security interest in a motor vehicle on the day the title applica tion was filed with the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles because Virginias perfection statute, § 46.2-638, although ambiguous as to the time of perfection, did not rely on the date of issuance of a certificate of title for perfection purposes . Because this met the ten day perfection requirement for an actual contemporaneous exchange, the transfer satisfied the exception of 11 U.S.C.S. § 547(c)(1). Terry v. American General Financial Services, 338 Bankr. 700, 2006 Bankr. LEXIS 626 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2006). A conditional sales contract is an encumbrance within the meaning of this section. C.I.T. Corp. v. Guy, 170 Va. 16, 195 S.E. 659, 1938 Va. LEXIS 158 (1938); C.I.T. Corp. v. Crosby &amp; Co., 175 Va. 16, 7 S.E.2d 107, 1940 Va. LEXIS 141 (1940); Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp. v. Kaplan, 198 Va. 67, 92 S.E.2d 359, 1956 Va. LEXIS 175 (1956). And lien of such contract not shown on certificate may be subject to lien of an attachment.  Where a nonresident owner failed to register his motor vehicles in Virginia, as required by former §§ 46.1-131 through 46.1-139 (see now §§ 46.2-655 t hrough 46.2-661 and 46.2-601), and failed to obtain certificates of title showing the liens of conditional sales thereon, such liens were not recorded in Virginia and were, therefore, subject to a lien of an attachment. C.I.T. Corp. v. Crosby &amp; Co., 175 Va. 16, 7 S.E.2d 107, 1940 Va. LEXIS 141 (1940). Certificate showing erroneous engine number may be sufficient.  A certificate of title that had an erroneous engine number but that referred to a conditional sale contract that gave the correct engine and serial numbers, corre ctly described the automobile, the place where it could be found and the person who owned and had possession of it, would be sufficient to maintain the lien as against the trustee in bankruptcy. In re Lowry, 40 F.2d 321, 1930 U.S. App. LEXIS 3160 (4th Ci r. 1930). A creditor must not be misled by possession, but must look to the title certificate, and when a lien is registered thereon, notice is given, be the mortgage oral or written. Staunton Indus. Loan Corp. v. Wilson, 190 F.2d 706, 1951 U.S. App. LEXIS 3443 (4th Cir. 1951). When certificate is issued which fails to show lien or encumbrance, it is notice to the world that the property is free from any lien or encumbrance, and if transferred to a bona fide purchaser the latter would obtain a good title. Toyota Motor Credit Corp. v. C.L. Hyman Auto Whsle., Inc., 256 Va. 243, 506 S.E.2d 14, 1998 Va. LEXIS 116 (199 8). If certificate erroneously states that no liens exist against the vehicle, the interest of the bona fide purchaser for value prevails over the interest of the cre ditor with a security interest in the motor vehicle. Toyota Motor Credit Corp. v. C.L. Hyman Auto Whsle., Inc., 256 Va. 243, 506 S.E.2d 14, 1998 Va. LEXIS 116 (1998). When provision excluding influence of former § 55-152 applies.  The provision of this section excluding motor vehicles from the influence of the former Traders Act, § 55-152, does not apply until they are registered und er the provisions of former §§ 46.1-41 and 46.1-42 (see now §§ 46.2-600 and 46.2-650). Universal Credit Co. v. Botetourt Motor Co., 180 Va. 159, 21 S.E.2d 800, 1942 Va. LEXIS 154 (1942). The provision of this section excluding registered motor vehicles from application of the provisions of former § 55-152 was so phrased as to avoid the possibil ity that unregistered motor vehicles owned by the manufacturer or distributor but in possession of a dealer and exposed for sale as a part of his merchandise in stock would be exempt from levy of an execution obtained by a creditor of the dealer. Univers al Credit Co. v. Botetourt Motor Co., 180 Va. 159, 21 S.E.2d 800, 1942 Va. LEXIS 154 (1942). Lien on car left in possession of dealer is invalid against innocent purchaser.  A properly recorded lien on an automobile given by a dealer to a finance company which left the car in the dealers possession knowing that it would be offered for sale in the regular course of business, is not valid as against a purchaser for value without actual knowledge of the lien. General Credit, Inc. v. Winchester, Inc., 196 Va. 711, 85 S.E.2d 201, 1955 Va. LEXIS 143 (1955); McQuay v. Mount Vernon Bank &amp; Trust Co., 200 Va. 776, 108 S.E.2d 251, 1959 Va. LEXIS 166 (1959). But lien is valid where lienholder had no knowledge of dealers offering car for sale.  Where lienholder did not know nor was chargeable with notice that dealer would place automobile on which it held lien in his stock of cars for sale, finding in li enholders favor as against subsequent purchaser for value and without notice was sustained.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Levy pursuant to writ of fieri facias not accompanied by physical seizure.  The statute does not require the sheriff to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of a levy made on a vehicle pursuant to a writ of fieri facias that is not acc ompanied by physical seizure of the vehicle; however, a vehicle levied on but not seized, and subsequently sold by the debtor, may not be sold at sheriffs auction. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Paul J. Lanteigne, Sheriff for the Ci ty of Virginia Beach, 0-073 (5/15/01). § 46.2-644.01. Lien of keeper of vehicles. Text A.

B. Every keepe r of vehicles shall have a lien upon such vehicles for the amount that may be due him for the towing, storage, recovery, and care thereof, until such amount is paid.Such lien shall be in addition to any lien under § 46.2-644.02. Any garage keeper to w hom a vehicle has been delivered pursuant to § 46.2-1209, 46.2-1213, or 46.2-1215 shall, within 30 days from the date of delivery, have a lien upon such vehicle pursuant to this section, provided that action has not been taken pursuant to such section s for the sale of the vehicle. C. In the case of any vehicle for which the title shows an existing lien, the keeper of vehicles shall have a lien upon the vehicle for his reasonable charges for storage under this section not to exceed $500; however, the keeper of vehicles shall also be entitled to a lien against any proceeds remaining after the satisfaction of all prior security interests or liens. In addition, any tow truck driver or towing and recovery operator shall have a lien for all normal costs incident to any towing and recovery services f urnished for the vehicle.In the case of any vehicle not subject to an existing lien on the title, the keeper of vehicles shall have a lien thereon for his reasonable charges for storage under this section, alone or in combination with a lien under § 4 6.2-644.02 not to exceed the value of the vehicle as determined by the provisions of § 8.01-419.1. D. The keeper of vehicles, or the authorized agents of such, shall ascertain from the Department whether the certificate of title for the vehicle shows a lien in accordance with the provisions of § 46.2-644.03 within seven business days of taking possession of the vehicle. The owner or lienholder shall have 10 business days from the date of the notice sent by the Department pursuant to § 46.2-644.03 to reclaim the vehicle. The terms for such reclamation shall be the payment of the amount due to the keeper of th e vehicles or other amount as agreed by the parties. If the vehicle remains unclaimed, the keeper of the vehicles may enforce the lien under the provisions of § 46.2-644.03 or relinquish the lien under the provisions of § 46.2-644.04.For purposes o f this subsection, the date of possession for a garage keeper to whom a vehicle has been delivered pursuant to § 46.2-1209, 46.2-1213, or 46.2-1215 shall be the date such lien attaches, and the date of possession for a self-storage facility shall be t he date on which the facility owner learns that a leased space subject to default contains a motor vehicle. E. Any lien cr eated under this section shall not extend to any personal property that is not attached to or considered to be necessary for the proper operation of any motor vehicle, and it shall be the duty of any keeper of vehicles to permit the owner to access the v ehicle in order to recover his personal property, provided the owner claims and retrieves the items at least two business days prior to the auction date. The keeper of vehicles may dispose of any unclaimed personal property. F. For the pur poses of this section, in the case of a truck or combination of vehicles, the owner, or in the case of a rented or leased vehicle, the lessee of the truck or tractor truck, shall be liable for the costs of the towing, recovery, and storage of the cargo a nd of any trailer or semitrailer in the combination. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall bar the owner of the truck or tractor truck from subsequently seeking to recover from the owner of any trailer, semitrailer, or cargo all or any portion of th ese towing, recovery, and storage costs.

CASE NOTES Mobile homes.  11 U.S.C.S. § 1322(b)(2) did not prevent debtors from modifying a creditors claim, which was secured by a lien on the debtors mobile home, because 11 U .S.C.S. § 101(13A)s definition of debtors principal residence did not alter the real property requirement of § 1322(b)(2)s anti-modification clause and the mobile home was personal property under Virginia law given that the debt ors obtained a vehicle title to the mobile home from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles, the mobile home was classified under subdivision A 6 of § 58.1-3503 as tangible personal property for tax purposes, and the debtors did not attempt to conv ert the mobile home to real estate.

Reciprocal agreement with other states; assessment and collection of fees on an apportionment or allocation basis; registration of vehicles and rep orting of road tax; violations; vehicle seizures; penalties. Text A. Notwithstan ding any other provision of this title, the Governor may, on the advice of the Department, enter into reciprocal agreements on behalf of the Commonwealth with the appropriate authorities of any state of the United States or a state or province of a count ry providing for the assessing and collecting of license fees for motor vehicles, tractor trucks, trucks, trailers, and semitrailers on an apportionment or allocation basis, as outlined in the International Registration Plan developed by the Internationa l Registration Plan, Inc.The Commissioner is authorized to audit the records of any owner, lessor, or lessee to verify the accuracy of any information required by any jurisdiction to determine the registration fees due. Based on this audit, the Commissio ner may assess any owner, lessor, or lessee for any license fees due this Commonwealth, including interest and penalties as provided in this section. In addition to any other penalties prescribed by law, the Commissioner or the Reciprocity Board may deny the owner, lessor, or lessee the right to operate any motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth until the assessment has been paid.Trip permit registration may be issued for any vehicle or combination of vehicles that could be lawfully operated in the jurisdiction if full registration or proportional registration were obtained. The fee for this permit shall be $15 and the permit shall be valid for 10 days.Any person who operates or permits the operation of any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitra iler over any highway in the Commonwealth without first having paid to the Commissioner the fees prescribed and payable under this section shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Failure to display a license plate indicating that the vehicle is registe red on an apportionment or allocation basis or carry a trip permit, as outlined in the International Registration Plan, shall constitute prima facie evidence the apportioned or allocated fee has not been paid.If the Commissioner ascertains that any fees that he is authorized to assess any owner, lessor, or lessee for any license year have not been assessed or have been assessed for less than the law required for the year because of failure or refusal of any owner, lessor, or lessee to make his records a vailable for audit as provided herein, or if any owner, lessor, or lessee misrepresents, falsifies, or conceals any of these records, the Commissioner shall determine from any information obtainable the lawful fees at the rate prescribed for that year, p lus a penalty of five percent and interest at the rate of six percent per year, which shall be computed on the fees and penalty from the date the fees became due to the date of assessment, and is authorized to make an assessment therefor against the owne r, lessor, or lessee. If the assessment is not paid within 30 days after its date, interest at the rate of six percent per year shall accrue thereon from the date of such assessment until the fees and penalty are paid. The notice of the assessment shall be forthwith sent to the owner, lessor, or lessee by registered or certified mail to the address of the owner, lessor, or lessee as it appears on the records in the office of the Department. The notice, when sent in accordance with these requirements, sh all be sufficient regardless of whether it was received.If any owner, lessor, or lessee fails to pay the fees, penalty, and interest, or any portion thereof, assessed pursuant to this section, in addition to any other provision of law, the Attorney Gener al or the Commissioner shall bring an appropriate action before the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond for the recovery of the fees, penalty, and interest, and judgment shall be rendered for the amount found to be due together with costs. If it is fou nd that the failure to pay was willful on the part of the owner, lessor or lessee, judgment shall be rendered for double the amount of the fees found to be due, plus costs. B. Notwithstan ding any other provision of this title or Chapter 27 (§ 58.1-2700 et seq.) of Title 58.1, the Governor, on the advice of the Department, may enter into reciprocal agreements on behalf of the Commonwealth with the duly authorized representatives of oth er jurisdictions providing for the road tax registration of vehicles, establishing periodic road tax reporting and road tax payment requirements from owners of such vehicles, and disbursement of funds collected due to other jurisdictions based on mileage traveled and fuel used in those jurisdictions as outlined in the International Fuels Tax Agreement.Notwithstanding any statute contrary to the provisions of any reciprocal agreement entered into by the Governor or his duly authorized representative as a uthorized by this title, the provisions of the reciprocal agreement shall govern and apply to all matters relating to administration and enforcement of the road tax. In the event the language of any reciprocal agreement entered into by the Governor as au thorized by this title is later amended so that it conflicts with or is contrary to any statute, the Department shall consider the amended language of the reciprocal agreement controlling and shall administer and enforce the road tax in accordance with t he amended language of the reciprocal agreement.An agreement may provide for determining the base state for motor carriers, records requirements, audit procedures, exchange of information, persons eligible for tax licensing, defining qualified motor vehi cles, determining if bonding is required, specifying reporting requirements and periods, including defining uniform penalties and interest rates for late reporting, determining methods for collecting and forwarding of motor fuel taxes and penalties to an other jurisdiction, and other provisions as will facilitate the administration of the agreement.The Governor may, as required by the terms of the agreement, forward to officers of another member jurisdiction any information in the Departments possess ion relative to the use of motor fuels by any motor carrier. The Department may disclose to officers of another state the location of offices, motor vehicles, and other real and personal property of motor carriers.An agreement may provide for each state to audit the records of motor carriers based in the state to determine if the road taxes due each member jurisdiction are properly reported and paid. Each member jurisdiction shall forward the findings of the audits performed on motor carriers based in t he member jurisdiction to each jurisdiction in which the carrier has taxable use of motor fuels. For motor carriers not based in the Commonwealth and which have taxable use of motor fuel in the Commonwealth, the Department may serve the audit findings re ceived from another jurisdiction, in the form of an assessment, on the carrier as though an audit had been conducted by the Department.Any agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter does not preclude the Department from auditing the records of any m otor carrier covered by the provisions of this chapter.The Department shall not enter into any agreement that would affect the motor fuel road tax rate.The Department may adopt and promulgate such rules, regulations, and procedures as may be necessary to effectuate and administer this title. Nothing in this title shall be construed to affect the tax rate provisions found in Chapter 27 (§ 58.1-2700 et seq.) of Title 58.1. C. Notwithstan ding any other provision in this title or Title 56, the Governor, on the advice of the Department, may participate in the single state registration system as authorized under 49 U.S.C. § 14504 and 49 C.F.R. Part 367, and the Unified Carrier Registrati on System authorized under 49 U.S.C. § 14504a, enacted pursuant to the Unified Carrier Registration Act of 2005, and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder. D. Notwithstan ding any other provision of this title or Title 58.1, the following violations of laws shall be punished as follows: 1. Any p erson who operates or causes to be operated on any highway in the Commonwealth any motor vehicle that is not in compliance with the Unified Carrier Registration System authorized under 49 U.S.C. § 14504a, enacted pursuant to the Unified Carrier Regist ration Act of 2005, and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. 2. Any person who operates or causes to be operated on any highway in the Commonwealth any motor vehicle that is not in compliance with Chapter 27 (§ 58.1-2700 et seq.) of Title 58.1 o r the terms and provisions of the International Fuel Tax Agreement, as amended by the International Fuel Tax Association, Inc., shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. 3. Any person who knowingly displays or uses on any vehicle operated by him any registration, license, identification marker or other identification or credential authorized to be issued pursuant to this title, Chapter 27 (§ 58.1-2700 et seq.) of Title 58.1, or the reciprocal agreements entered into pursuant to this chapter that has not been issued to the owner or operator thereof for such vehicle and any person who knowingly assists him to do so shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. E. An officer charging a violation under subsection D shall serve a citation on the operator of the vehicle in violation. Such citation shall be directed to the owner, operator or other person responsible for the violation as determined by the officer. Service of the citation on the vehicle operator shall constitute service of process upon the owner, operator, or other person charged with the violation under this article, and shall have the same legal force as if served within the Common...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-704"><akn:num>§ 46.2-704</akn:num><akn:heading>Prohibited operations; checking on weights; penalties</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

USAA Cas. Ins. Co. v. Hertz Corp., 265 Va. 450, 578 S.E.2d 775, 2003 Va. LEXIS 44 (2003). Motorcycle was properly held to be a motor vehicle, as that term was used in § 46.2-705, and thus triggered the provisions of § 46.2-706, requiring registration with the DMV; thus, the motorcycles owner was not excused from registering the same believing in good faith that he was insured without taking the necessary and prudent steps to confirm the fact of coverage.

Self-insurance was not the functional equivalent of insurance in the instant case and therefore the company was not improperly seeking indemnification from its own insured; under Hertz , the company was primarily liable and satisfied that liability by promptly paying out the third partys claims and under the insurers policy, the insurer was primarily liable for property damage caused by its insured which r esulted from his use of a substitute automobile while his own automobile was being repaired or serviced.

Additional fee; proof of insurance required of applicants for registration of insured motor vehicles; verification of insurance; suspension of driv ers license, registration certificates, and license plates for certain violations. Text A. In addition to any other fees prescribed by law, every person registering an uninsured motor vehicle, as defined in § 46.2-705, at the time of registering or reregistering the uninsured vehicle, shall pay a fee of $500; however, if the uninsured motor vehicle is being registered for a period of less than a full year, the uninsured motor vehicle fee shall be prorated for the unexpired portion of the registration period. If the vehicle is a motor vehicle being registered as provided in subsection B of § 46.2-6 97, the fee shall be one-fourth of the annual uninsured motor vehicle fee for each quarter for which the vehicle is registered. B. If the owne r of a motor vehicle registered under this article as an uninsured motor vehicle, during the period for which such vehicle is registered, obtains insurance coverage adequate to permit such vehicles registration as an insured motor vehicle and present s evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner of the existence of such insurance coverage, the Commissioner shall amend the Departments records to show such vehicle to be registered as an insured motor vehicle and shall refund to the owner a prorated p ortion of the additional fee required by this section for registration of an uninsured motor vehicle. Such proration shall be on a monthly basis, except that no such refund shall be made (i) as to any registration during the last three months of its vali dity or (ii) on any portion of any such fee required to be paid resulting from a determination by the Department or any court that a vehicle was uninsured and no fee had been paid. C. Every perso n applying for registration of a motor vehicle and declaring it to be an insured motor vehicle shall, under the penalties set forth in § 46.2-707, execute and furnish to the Commissioner his certificate that the motor vehicle is an insured motor vehic le as defined in § 46.2-705, or that the Commissioner has issued to its owner, in accordance with § 46.2-368, a certificate of self-insurance applicable to the vehicle sought to be registered. The Commissioner, or his duly authorized agent, may ver ify that the motor vehicle is properly insured by comparing owner and vehicle identification information on file at the Department of Motor Vehicles with liability information on the owner and vehicle transmitted to the Department by any insurance compan y licensed to do business in the Commonwealth as provided in § 46.2-706.1. If no record of liability insurance is found, the Department may require the motor vehicle owner to verify insurance in a method prescribed by the Commissioner. D. The refusal or neglect of any owner within 30 days to submit the liability insurance information when required by the Commissioner or his duly authorized agent, or the electronic notification by the insurance company or surety company that the policy or bond named in the certificate of insurance is not in effect, shall require the Commissioner to suspend any drivers license and all registration certificates and license plates issued to the owner of the motor vehicle until the person (i) has paid to the Commiss ioner a noncompliance fee of $600 to be disposed of as provided for in § 46.2-710 and (ii) furnishes proof of financial responsibility for the future in the manner prescribed in Article 15 (§ 46.2-435 et seq.) of Chapter 3. No order of suspension r equired by this section shall become effective until the Commissioner has offered the person an opportunity for an administrative hearing to show cause why the order should not be enforced. Notice of the opportunity for an administrative hearing may be i ncluded in the order of suspension. Any request for an administrative hearing made by such person must be received by the Department within 180 days of the issuance date of the order of suspension unless the person presents to the Department evidence of military service as defined by the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50 U.S.C. § 3901 et seq.), incarceration, commitment, hospitalization, or physical presence outside the United States at the time the order of suspension was issued. When thre e years have elapsed from the effective date of the suspension required in this section, the Commissioner may relieve the person of the requirement of furnishing proof of future financial responsibility. E. The Commiss ioner shall suspend the drivers license and all registration certificates and license plates of any person on receiving a record of his conviction of a violation of any provisions of § 46.2-707, but the Commissioner shall dispense with the suspens ion when the person is convicted for a violation of § 46.2-707 and the Departments records show conclusively that the motor vehicle was insured or that the fee applicable to the registration of an uninsured motor vehicle has been paid by the owner prior to the date and time of the alleged offense. F. The Commiss ioner may dispense with a suspension for a violation of this section or § 46.2-708 if the person determined to have committed the violation provides to the Commissioner proof that conclusively shows that the motor vehicle in question was insured at th e time the Department initiated insurance monitoring under § 46.2-706 or at the time of a violation of § 46.2-708.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Statute applied to motor cycle held in storage.  Motorcycle was properly held to be a motor vehicle, as that term was used in § 46.2-705, despite the fact that it was held in storage, and thus trigger ed the provisions of § 46.2-706, requiring registration with the DMV; thus, the motorcycles owner was not excused from registering the same believing in good faith that he was insured without taking the necessary and prudent steps to confirm the f act of coverage. Vasaio v. DMV, 42 Va. App. 190, 590 S.E.2d 596, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 10 (2004). The uninsured motor vehicle assessment, which may substitute for insurance coverage, cre ates a fund that benefits the general public by reducing the overall cost of uninsured motorist insurance coverage and is an involuntary exaction rather than a payment to receive permission to engage in a voluntary activity. Williams v. Motley, 925 F.2d 741, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 2040 (4th Cir. 1991). Uninsured motor vehicle assessment is an involuntary pecuniary burden levied upon uninsured motorists for a proper governmental purpose and is an excise tax for p urposes of 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(8)(E) and thus is nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Williams v. Motley, 925 F.2d 741, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 2040 (4th Cir. 1991).

The refusal or neglect of the owner who has not, prior to the date of operation, paid the uninsured motor vehicle fee required by § 46.2-706 as to such motor vehicle, to provide such verification shall be prima facie evidence that the motor vehicle was an uninsured motor vehicle at the time of such operation. Any person who falsely verifies insurance to the Commissioner or gives false evidence that a motor vehicle sought to be registered is an insured motor vehicle, shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. However, the foregoing portions of this section shall not be applicable if it is established that the owner had good cause to believe and did believe that such motor ve hicle was an insured motor vehicle, in which event the provisions of § 46.2-609 shall be applicable. Any person who owns an uninsured motor vehicle (i) licensed in the Commonwealth, (ii) subject to registration in the Commonwealth, or (iii) displaying temporary license plates provided for in § 46.2-1558, and who has not paid the uninsured motor vehicle fee required by § 46.2-706, shall immediately surrender the vehicles license plates to the Department, unless the vehicles registration has been deactivat ed as provided by § 46.2-646.1. Any person who fails to immediately surrender his vehicles license plates as required by this section is guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor. Abstracts of records of conviction, as defined in this title, of any violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be forwarded to the Commissioner as prescr ibed by § 46.2-383. The Commissioner shall suspend the drivers license and all registration certificates and license plates of any titled owner of an uninsured motor vehicle upon recei ving a record of his conviction of a violation of any provisions of this section, and he shall not thereafter reissue the drivers license and the registration certificates and license plates issued in the name of such person until such person pays a noncompliance fee of $600 to be disposed of as provided for in § 46.2-710 and furnishes proof of future financial responsibility as prescribed by Article 15 (§ 46.2-435 et seq.) of Chapter 3. However, when three years have elapsed from the date of the suspension herein required, the Commissioner may relieve such person of the requirement of furnishing proof of future financial responsibility. When such suspension results from a conviction for presenting or causing to be presented to the Commission er false verification as to whether a motor vehicle is an insured motor vehicle or false evidence that any motor vehicle sought to be registered is insured, then the Commissioner shall not thereafter reissue the drivers license and the registration c ertificates and license plates issued in the name of such person so convicted for a period of 180 days from the date of such order of suspension, and only then when all other provisions of law have been complied with by such person. The Commissioner shall suspend the drivers license of any person who is the operator but not the titled owner of a motor vehicle upon receiving a record of his conv iction of a violation of any provisions of this section and he shall not thereafter reissue the drivers license until 30 days from the date of such order of suspension.

CASE NOTES Generally.  While not having insurance, alone, does not constitute a criminal offense in Virginia, not having insurance is a criminal offense if the driver has not paid the u ninsured motorist fee. Burrell v. Virginia, 395 F.3d 508, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 1329 (4th Cir. 2005). City officials had qualified immunity from an individuals claim that they violated his Fourth Amendment rights when they issued a summons for operating an uni nsured motor vehicle without paying an uninsured motorist fee because the requirement that the individual respond to their request to provide evidence of insurance at the scene of an accident did not violate the Fifth Amendment and his refusal to furnish insurance information provided probable cause to believe that he neither had insurance nor paid the fee. Burrell v. Virginia, 395 F.3d 508, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 1329 (4th Cir. 2005). Statute applied to motor cycle held in storage.  Motorcycle was properly held to be a motor vehicle, as that term was used in § 46.2-705, despite the fact that it was held in storage, and thus trigger ed the provisions of § 46.2-706, requiring registration with the DMV; thus, the motorcycles owner was not excused from registering the same believing in good faith that he was insured without taking the necessary and prudent steps to confirm the f act of coverage. Vasaio v. DMV, 42 Va. App. 190, 590 S.E.2d 596, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 10 (2004). Seizure of license plates.  Statutes justified the seizure of license plates, and once the deputy seized the plates, defendants vehicle could not be lawfully operated; the statute preven ting lawful operation of a vehicle without license plates did not also provide authority to impound the vehicle, and absent such a provision, the sheriffs impoundment policy did not support the argument that the impoundment was reasonable. Commonweal th v. Hocutt, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 202 (Va. Ct. App. June 23, 2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Joinder.  The connected test of Rule 3A:6(b) is that the crimes should be so intimately connected and blended with the main facts adduced in evidence that they cann ot be departed from with propriety. Defendants motion for severance was granted to separate a count of driving under a suspended license and a count of operating a motor vehicle without paying fees from other counts that charged him with various crim inal acts related to the deaths of two of his passengers in an automobile accident; those two counts had no relation to the manner in which defendant operated his vehicle and defendant was strictly liable for those counts regardless of the manner in whic h he drove, so defendant was entitled to severance of those two counts. Commonwealth v. Walsh, 62 Va. Cir. 511, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 267 (Culpeper County Sept. 25, 2003). § 46.2-707.1. Noncompliance fee payment plan. Text A. The Departm ent may establish a noncompliance fee payment plan to allow individuals to pay the fees for a motor vehicle determined to be uninsured as prescribed in § 46.2-706, 46.2-707, or 46.2-708. Notwithstanding §§ 46.2-706, 46.2-707, and 46.2-708, an in dividual 18 years of age or older whose drivers license and vehicle registration have been suspended pursuant to § 46.2-706, 46.2-707, or 46.2-708 may apply to the Department to enter into a payment plan agreement with a duration of no more than t hree years from the agreement date, referred to in this section as the payment plan period. B. To be eligi ble to enter into the payment plan, the individual must (i) have one or more outstanding suspensions of driving privileges pursuant to the provisions of § 46.2-706, 46.2-707, or 46.2-708 and have no other outstanding suspensions or revocations; (ii) m eet all other conditions for reinstatement of driving privileges; and (iii) have not defaulted twice on the same uninsured motor vehicle payment plan agreement.

However, no order of suspension required by this section shall become effective until the Commissioner has offered the person an opportunity for an administrative hearing to show cause why the order should not be enforced.

CASE NOTES Reasonable suspicion of other offe nses.  Display of license plates belonging to a vehicle other than the one to which they are attached may be permitted under § 46.2-719 and does not alone raise reaso nable suspicion that vehicle was stolen; motion to suppress heroin found during improper search of owner should have been granted. Lawrence v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 95, 578 S.E.2d 54, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 136 (2003). Where an officer testified he stopped the defendant because the vehicle did not have a front license plate, the court properly found that the officer reasonably s uspected the defendant was operating his vehicle in violation of § 46.2-715 and lawfully stopped the defendant. Savage v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 187 (Va. Ct. App. Apr. 1, 2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Transporter license tag.  Granting of a motion to suppress was appropriate because a law-enforcement officer did not have a reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct an investigatory tr affic stop of defendants vehicle when the vehicle displayed no front license, but displayed a rear Virginia Transport Tag license plate in that the proper display of a Transport Tag did not require display of a front license plate. Commonweal th v. Howard, 94 Va. Cir. 231, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 131 (Norfolk Sept. 2, 2016). Detention of out-of-state vehicles.  In a case in which: (1) defendant was charged with possession with intent to distribute marijuana and transporting controlled substances following the stop of his Pennsylvania rental car for not displaying front license plates as required by § 46.2-715; (2) Pennsylvania did not require front license plates; and (3) defendant moved to suppress the contraband, arguing that the stop violated the Fourth Amendment, the officer, who, despite having 10 years experience did not know and did not check prior to initiating the stop whether Pennsylvania required a front license plate, did not articulate a reasonable basis to suspect that defendant was engaged in some illegal activity. Until he confirmed Pennsylvania law, no specific and objective facts indicated that defendants vehicle was violating Virginia law. Commonwealth v. Smith, 79 Va. Cir. 16, 2009 Va. Cir.

CASE NOTES Issuing state obscured.  Defendant argued that the license plate of the tractor-trailer he was driving was not in fact obscured and that the officer therefore lacked any reasonable basis for pulling over the tractor-trailer; however the police officer testified under oath that he could not read the issuing state at the top of the license plate and a photograph of the front of the tractor on the date in question showed that the top of the license plate had been bent such that the name of the issuing state was illegible. Thus, the condition of the license plate provided the officer with an objectively reasonable basis for the traffic stop, and the fact that the traffic stop was a pretext for further investigation was irrelevant and did nothing to impair the stops constitutionality. United States v. Greenwood, 405 F. Supp. 2d 673, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33348 (E.D. Va. 2005), aff'd, 246 Fed. Appx. 174, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 18420 (4th C ir. 2007). Reasonable basis for a stop.  Defendant argued that this section violated the U.S. Constitutions prohibition against state regulations that burden interstate commerce, and that because the underlying statute was unconstitutional, it could not serve as the basis for the police officers traffic stop; however, the merits of defendants negative commerce clause argument were doubtful, given that the Virginia statute, as applied to all vehicles traveling in Virginia, was both reasonable and neither discriminated against interstate commerce, nor resulted in an unreasonable burden on such commerce. In any event, it was unnecessary to reach the merits of defendants negative commerce c lause argument inasmuch as the Fourth Amendment required only that a police officer have an objectively reasonable basis for the stop, not that he correctly discern the constitutionality of the traffic statute on which he relied; in other words, it was e nough that the officer or any officer enforce a statute as written  the officer is not tasked with making constitutional judgments, with which even the United States Supreme Court sometimes struggles. United States v. Greenwood, 405 F. Supp. 2d 673, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33348 (E.D. Va. 2005), aff'd, 246 Fed. Appx. 174, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 18420 (4th Cir. 2007). Officer had an objectively reasonable basis to stop defendants vehicle, where defendants front license plate was badly bent, so that the date of the plate and the state that issued it were obscured; even if § 46.2-716 did not apply to out-of-state license plates, it provided an objectively reasonable basis for the stop. United States v. Greenwood, 246 Fed. Appx. 174, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 18420 (4th Cir . 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1158, 128 S. Ct. 1107, 169 L. Ed. 2d 839, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 819 (2008). Probable cause to search.  Although the police could not have searched defendants car based solely upon a tinted license plate cover, defendants attempt to flee constituted a new of fense and provided probable cause to effect a custodial arrest and subsequent search. Elder v. Commonwealth, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 508 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2004). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Clear plastic covering over li cense plate.  The plain language of subsection B of § 46.2-716 is broad enough to prohibit the placing of a clear plastic covering over a license plate, if the covering in a ny way obscures information contained on the license plate, but that whether any particular covering would bring rise to a violation of the provision is a determination of fact.

Text A. Except as p rovided in subsection C, there is hereby imposed an annual highway use fee on any motor vehicle registered in the Commonwealth under § 46.2-694 or 46.2-697 that is an alternative fuel vehicle, an electric motor vehicle, or a fuel-efficient vehicle. Th e fee shall be collected by the Department at the time of vehicle registration. If the vehicle is registered for a period of other than one year as provided in § 46.2-646, the highway use fee shall be multiplied by the number of years or fraction ther eof that the vehicle will be registered. B. For an elec tric motor vehicle, the highway use fee shall be 85 percent of the amount of taxes paid under subsection A of § 58.1-2217 on fuel used by a vehicle with a combined fuel economy of 23.7 miles per gallon for the average number of miles traveled by a pas senger vehicle in the Commonwealth, as determined by the Commissioner. For all other fuel-efficient vehicles, the highway use fee shall be 85 percent of the difference between the tax paid under subsection A of § 58.1-2217 on the fuel used by a vehicl e with a combined fuel economy of 23.7 miles per gallon for the average number of miles traveled by a passenger vehicle in the Commonwealth in a year, as determined by the Commissioner, and the tax paid under subsection A of § 58.1-2217 on the fuel us ed by the vehicle being registered for the average number of miles traveled by a passenger vehicle in the Commonwealth in a year, as determined by the Commissioner.For purposes of this chapter, the Commissioner shall use combined fuel economy as determin ed by the manufacturer of the vehicle. If the Commissioner is unable to obtain the manufacturers fuel economy for a vehicle, then the Commissioner shall use the final estimate of average fuel economy, as determined by the U.S. Environmental Protectio n Agency, of (i) all trucks having the same model year as the vehicle being registered, if the vehicle has a gross weight between 6,000 pounds and 10,000 pounds, or (ii) all cars having the same model year as the vehicle. If data is not available for the model year of the vehicle being registered, then the Commissioner shall use available data for the model year that is closest to the model year of the vehicle being registered.The Commissioner shall update the fees calculated under this section by July 1 of each year. C. This sectio n shall not apply to: 1. An au tocycle, moped, or motorcycle; 2. A vehicle with a gross weight over 10,000 pounds; 3. A vehicle that is owned by a governmental entity as defined in § 58.1-2201; or 4. A vehicle that is registered under the International Registration Plan.A vehicle shall not be subject to the fee set forth in this section in any year in which such vehicle is register ed to participate in the mileage-based user fee program established pursuant to § 46.2-773. D. In any case where an applicant has requested and is eligible for a refund pursuant to § 46.2-688, the Commissioner shall refund to the applicant the cost of the highway use fee, prorated in six-month increments, if such application is made when six or more month s remain in the registration period.

Text A. There is he reby established a mileage-based user fee program. The program shall be a voluntary program that allows owners of vehicles subject to the highway use fee pursuant to § 46.2-772 to pay a mileage-based fee in lieu of the highway use fee. No owner of a m otor vehicle registered in the Commonwealth shall be required to participate in the program established pursuant to this section. B. In any year that an owner pays the fee set forth in this section, such owner shall not be subject to the fee set forth in § 46.2-772 for the same vehicle. In no case shall the fees paid pursuant to this section during a 12-month period exceed the annual highway use fee that would have otherwise been paid. C. The fee sch edule for the mileage-based user fee program shall be calculated by dividing the amount of the highway use fee as determined pursuant to subsection B of § 46.2-772 by the average number of miles traveled by a passenger vehicle in the Commonwealth to d etermine a fee per mile driven. D. The Departm ent shall establish procedures for the collection of the fees set forth in this section. Such procedures may limit the total number of participants during the first four years of the program. E. The Departm ent shall offer program participants the option to participate without location tracking. F.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Purpose.  The evident purpose and intent of this section is to impose upon the person controlling the operation of a bicycle the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Code. Phill ips v. Schools, 211 Va. 19, 175 S.E.2d 279, 1970 Va. LEXIS 203 (1970). This section was not intended to impose the duties of a driver of a vehicle upon one who rides on a bicycle as a passenger and who has no control over its operati on. Phillips v. Schools, 211 Va. 19, 175 S.E.2d 279, 1970 Va. LEXIS 203 (1970). This section is not applicable to a person leading an animal. By its express terms, it i s only applicable when the animal is being ridden or driven. However, it was not erroneous to instruct the jury that such person has the right to lead his animal along the highway on the right side thereof with the animal walking on the edge of the hard surface, where the evidence did not show negligence by such person in selecting the right side or in using more of the roadway than reasonably necessary. Bayne v. Tharpe, 201 Va. 484, 111 S.E.2d 816, 1960 Va. LEXIS 119 (1960). The language Every person riding a bicycle refers to the person who controls its operation by pedalling and by steering with the handlebars. Phillips v. Schools, 211 Va. 19, 175 S.E.2d 279, 1970 Va. LEXIS 203 (1970). Passenger on bicycle not within provisions of former § 46.1-172 (see now § 46.2-909).  There is no language in this section which brings a person riding as a passenger on a bicycle within the provisions of former § 46.1-172 (see now § 46.2-909 ), dealing with motorcycles. Phillips v. Schools, 211 Va. 19, 175 S.E.2d 279, 1970 Va. LEXIS 203 (1970). Driver may assume that bicyclist will comply with former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848).  When driver of automobile saw decedent riding his bicycle on the shoulder of the road, he had a right to assume that decedent would not turn off the shoulder into the highway without complying with the provisions of former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848). Laubach v. Howell, 194 Va. 670, 74 S.E.2d 794, 1953 Va. LEXIS 133 (1953). Instructions.  An instruction which tells the jury that the riding of more than one person on a bicycle is prohibited unless it is designed to carry more than one person, is not a correct statement of the law and constitutes reversible error. Phillips v. Schools, 211 Va. 19, 175 S.E.2d 279, 1970 Va. LEXIS 203 (1970). § 46.2-800.1. Riding animals on highways after sunset. Text A. No person r iding upon any animal on a highway between sunset and sunrise shall ride the animal on the roadway unless the rider: 1. Wears a hat made of or coated with reflectorized material; or 2. Wears upper body clothing made of or coated with reflectorized material visible from 360 degrees; or 3. Displays at least 100 square inches of solid reflectorized material at shoulder level visible from 360 degrees; or 4. Carries a light visible in clear weather from a distance of 500 feet. B. The require ments of subsection A of this section shall only apply to the riders of the first and last animals in a group riding one behind the other. C. A violation of this section shall not be construed as negligence per se in any civil action. History History. 1989, c. 295, § 46.1-171.01. § 46.2-800.2. Operation of off-road recreational vehicles in localities embraced by the Southwest Regional Recreation Authority. Text A. The governi ng body of any county, city, or town embraced by the Southwest Regional Recreation Authority may by ordinance authorize the operation of any off-road recreational vehicles (i) on highways within its boundaries that have a maximum speed limit of no more t han 35 miles per hour and (ii) for a distance of no more than five miles on any highway within its boundaries that has a maximum speed limit of more than 35 miles per hour. Any such ordinance shall define off-road recreational vehicle. Any such o peration shall be subject to the following conditions, and such additional restrictions and limitations as the county, city, or town by ordinance may impose: 1. Signs whose design, number, and location are approved by the Virginia Department of Transportation shall have been posted by the county, city, town, or Southwest Regional Recreation Authority warning motorists that off-road recreational vehicles may be operat ing on the highway; 2. Such off-road recreational vehicles shall be operated only during daylight hours; 3.

B. The governi ng body of any county, city, or town that enacts any ordinance under subsection A shall notify in writing the Virginia State Police and all law-enforcement agencies within the county, city, or town of its action, together with a copy of such ordinance. C. Operation o f any off-road recreational vehicle as provided in the foregoing provisions of this section shall be subject to the issuance of a permit by the Southwest Regional Recreation Authority pursuant to § 15.2-6020. Any such permit shall be valid for such pe riod of time and subject to the payment of such fee as the Authority shall provide. History History. 2010, cc. 332, 463; 2018, c. 364.

For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Automobiles, §§ 20, 44. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section was enacted to give protection to persons and property on the left-hand side of the highway. Hamilton v. Glemming, 187 Va. 309, 46 S.E.2d 438, 1948 Va. LEXIS 224 (1948). Also, to regulate traffic and to protect those using the roads for travel.  See Powell v. Virginian Ry., 187 Va. 384, 46 S.E.2d 429, 1948 Va. LEXIS 229 (1948). The Rules of the Road are designed to protect the users of the highways. They are for the guidance and benefit of those who proceed in the same direction, proceed in the opposite direction, who may be stopping, starting, or crossing the highway, or those who may undertake to pass another vehicle, and those who may be affected by the operation of a motor vehicle. Simmons v. Craig, 199 Va. 338, 99 S.E.2d 64 1, 1957 Va. LEXIS 195 (1957); Loving v. Mason, 206 Va. 613, 145 S.E.2d 131, 1965 Va. LEXIS 242 (1965). But not to protect a railroad company storing its railroad cars on the public highway.  See Powell v. Virginian Ry., 187 Va. 384, 46 S.E.2d 429, 1948 Va. LEXIS 229 (1948). Violation as negligence.  The violation of one or more of the statutes, former §§ 46.1-189 through 46.1-227 (see now §§ 46.2-852 through 46.2-921), defining reckless driving an d prescribing The Rules of the Road, is negligence sufficient to support a civil action if such negligence was the proximate cause of the injury or damage sustained. Richardson v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 55, 63 S.E.2d 731, 1951 Va. LEXIS 153 (1951) ; Loving v. Mason, 206 Va. 613, 145 S.E.2d 131, 1965 Va. LEXIS 242 (1965). The fact that a motor vehicle was being driven on the wrong side of the road, in violation of this section, is evidence of negligence sufficient to make a prima f acie case for the plaintiff and to cast upon the defendant the burden of producing evidence in explanation. Interstate Veneer Co. v. Edwards, 191 Va. 107, 60 S.E.2d 4, 1950 Va. LEXIS 203 (1950); Fletcher v. Horn, 197 Va. 317, 89 S.E.2d 89, 1955 Va. LEXIS 224 (1955). The unexplained fact that driver was driving automobile diagonally across highway to the extreme left was evidence of negligence. MacGregor v. Bradshaw, 193 Va. 7 87, 71 S.E.2d 361, 1952 Va. LEXIS 191 (1952). The violation of this section is evidence of negligence. Daniels v. C.I. Whitten Transf. Co., 196 Va. 537, 84 S.E.2d 528, 1954 Va. LEXIS 250 (1954). Driving a car on the left side of a highway, is, with certain exceptions, in violation of this section, and constitutes negligence. Smith v. Turner, 178 Va. 172, 16 S.E.2d 370, 1941 Va. LEXIS 154 (1941) (see Sheckler v. Anderson, 182 Va. 701, 29 S.E.2d 867 (1944); Interstate Veneer Co. v. Edwards, 191 Va. 107, 60 S.E.2d 4 (1950); Dozier v. Morrisette, 198 Va. 37, 92 S.E.2d 366 (1956)). A driver was guilty of negligence where, in making a diagonal turn, he drove for some distance on the left half of the road in plain violation of this section. Hu ffman v. Jackson, 175 Va. 564, 9 S.E.2d 295, 1940 Va. LEXIS 201 (1940). Where there was a failure to comply with this section, unless the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, the defendant was liable to plaintiff for injur ies resulting from the collision. Whipple v. Booth, 155 Va. 413, 154 S.E. 545, 1930 Va. LEXIS 173 (1930). Or as gross negligence.  While driving on the wrong side of the highway, in violation of this section, is negligence, mere inadvertence in permitting the wheels of a vehicle to cross over the center line of a highway does not in itself constitute gross negligence. Bond v. Joyner, 205 Va. 292, 136 S.E.2d 903, 1964 Va. LEXIS 179 (1964). Gross negligence was not proved where the evidence showed only that defendants car suddenly veered across the center line and went into a 180-degree skid, all within a matter of seconds. Dishman v. Pitts, 202 Va. 548, 118 S.E.2d 509, 1961 Va. LEXIS 142 (1961). Driving on the wrong side of the road does not necessarily constitute gross negligence. One who inadvertently permits the left-hand wheels of his car to pass to t he left of the center line of an open road is not guilty of gross negligence. Smith v. Turner, 178 Va. 172, 16 S.E.2d 370, 1941 Va. LEXIS 154 (1941). But needlessly driving on the wrong side of a straight road, in broad daylight, in the face of a car rapidly approaching from the opposite direction and in plain view, is gross negligence. Smith v. Turner, 178 Va. 172, 16 S.E.2d 370, 1941 Va. LEXIS 154 (1941). Where a defendant, who admittedly knew of the approach of an oncoming car, with ample time to pull to his side of the road, drove his car around the curve, on the inside thereof directly in the lawful path of an oncoming car, such defendant was not driving on the right side of the road as required by this section and his conduct, as a matter of law, amounted to gross negligence. Collins v. Robinson, 160 Va. 520, 169 S.E. 609, 1933 Va. LEXIS 232 (1933). Involuntary manslaughter.  Mere violation of one of these statutes, former §§ 46.1-189 through 46.1-227 (see now §§ 46.2-852 through 46.2-921), is insufficient to bring the negl igent act within the common-law definition of involuntary manslaughter, unless the proof discloses that the act, or acts, of negligence charged are so flagrant, so culpable and wanton as to indicate a reckless disregard of human life. Richardson v. Commo nwealth, 192 Va. 55, 63 S.E.2d 731, 1951 Va. LEXIS 153 (1951). Exceptions.  This section recognizes that there may be circumstances which make the performance of the duty imposed impracticable or excusable. The presence of persons, vehicl es, or obstructions on the highway may require a driver to drive to the left of the center of the highway. The section was not intended to prevent a motorist from driving to the left of the center of the highway in trying to avoid an emergency or to prev ent injury to a person on the right half of the highway. Hamilton v. Glemming, 187 Va. 309, 46 S.E.2d 438, 1948 Va. LEXIS 224 (1948); Reams v. Cone, 190 Va. 835, 59 S.E.2d 87, 1950 Va. LEXIS 173 (1950); Davidson v. Jackson, 193 Va. 330, 68 S.E.2d 524, 19 52 Va. LEXIS 140 (1952). It is not negligence under the terms of this section for an operator of a vehicle to drive to the left of the center of the highway under the circumstances and co nditions permitted in this section. Hoge v. Anderson, 200 Va. 364, 106 S.E.2d 121, 1958 Va. LEXIS 197 (1958). Under this section it is not necessarily negligence for one to drive on his left side of the highway when it is not practicable to drive on his right side, provid ed he uses due and reasonable care to avoid injury to other persons. Davidson v. Jackson, 193 Va. 330, 68 S.E.2d 524, 1952 Va. LEXIS 140 (1952) (see also annotation for same case under § 46.2-1102). Skidding.  Where the evidence indicates that a vehicle skidded into the left lane, the principal inquiry is as to the drivers conduct prior to the skidding. The purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether the skidding resulted from the negligence of the driver. Pullen v. Fagan, 204 Va. 601, 132 S.E.2d 718, 1963 Va. LEXIS 192 (1963). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Reasonable suspicion.  Police officers possessed a reasonable suspicion to stop a riding mower because defendant when operating the riding lawn-mower failed to drive to the right side o f the highway. Commonwealth v. Taylor, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 201 (Greene County May 29, 2019). CASE NOTES Burden of proof.  Evidence that defendant struck decedent on the far left-hand side of the road made a prima facie case of negligence and placed the burden upon defendant t o furnish a reasonable explanation, one that the jury could accept, to the effect that he was on the wrong side from a cause other than his own negligence. Spiegelman v. Birch, 204 Va. 96, 129 S.E.2d 119, 1963 Va. LEXIS 120 (1963). It was not proper to tell the jury they may assume negligence on defendants part from the fact that he crossed to the left of the center of the highwa y. Such conduct was evidence of negligence sufficient to make a prima facie case for plaintiff. The burden was then cast upon defendant to produce evidence in reasonable explanation to show that his vehicle was on the wrong side of the road by a cause ot her than his own negligence. If his explanation was reasonable and one which the jury could accept, then the ultimate burden rested upon plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that her damages were caused by defendants negligence. Bedg et v. Lewin, 202 Va. 535, 118 S.E.2d 650, 1961 Va. LEXIS 140 (1961). This section was enacted to give protection to persons and property traveling on the proper side of the highway. However, the statute did not change the law of ne gligence. The burden is still on the plaintiff to prove that the failure of a defendant to observe the duty imposed by this section was a proximate cause of the injury. Hicks v. Cassidy, 208 Va. 610, 159 S.E.2d 827, 1968 Va. LEXIS 155 (1968). The driver of a motor vehicle which collides with another motor vehicle while driving in the wrong lane in violation of this section is prima facie guilty of negl igence, and the burden is cast upon ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-803"><akn:num>§ 46.2-803</akn:num><akn:heading>Keep to the right in crossing intersections or railroads</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Except as otherwise provided by law, when crossing an intersection of highways or the intersection of a highway by a railroad right-of-way, the driver of a vehicle shal l drive on the right half of the roadway unless it is obstructed or impassable.

Annotations CASE NOTES Failure to return to proper lane before entering intersection.  Where evidence showed that plaintiff had passed another southbound car and had not gotten back into his own lane before entering the intersection, where the colli sion occurred, plaintiff violated this section and former § 46.1-190 (see now § 46.2-853), and was guilty of negligence proximately causing the accident. Loving v. Mason, 206 Va. 613, 145 S.E.2d 131, 1965 Va. LEXIS 242 (1965) (decided under prior l aw). § 46.2-803.1. Commercial motor vehicles limited to use of certain lanes of certain interstate highways. Text Except where the posted speed limit is less than 65 miles per hour, no person shall drive any commercial motor vehicle, as defined in § 46.2-341.4, on the left-most lane of any interstate highway having more than two lanes in each direction. Furthermore, within the Eighth Planning District and on Interstate Route 81, no person shall drive any commercial motor vehicle, as defined in § 46.2-341.4, on the l eft-most lane of any interstate highway having more than two lanes in each direction, regardless of the posted speed limit. Every commercial motor vehicle shall keep to the right-most lane when operating at a speed of 15 miles per hour or more below the posted speed limit on an interstate highway with no more than two lanes in each direction. The provisions of this section shall not apply to (i) buses or school buses or (ii) other commercial vehicles when (a) preparing to exit a highway via a left exit or (b ) being used to perform maintenance or construction work on an interstate highway.

Many of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Construction.  This section, which deals with the laws governing highways laned for traffic, does not contain any language that could be reasonably interpreted to prohibit cross ing a single, solid white line. Subdivision 5 prohibits crossing a solid line immediately adjacent to a broken line, without reference to the color of the line, if the vehicle is on the side of the solid line. Subdivision 6 prohibits crossing double traf fic lines consisting of two immediately adjacent solid yellow lines. Subdivision 7 prohibits crossing double traffic lines consisting of two immediately adjacent solid yellow lines. Jones v. Commonwealth, 71 Va. App. 375, 836 S.E.2d 710, 2019 Va. App. LE XIS 318 (2019). The caption of this section shows that it was intended to apply to city streets as well as open highways. Ragsdale v. Jones, 202 Va. 278, 117 S.E.2d 114, 1960 Va. LEXIS 219 (1960). Section do es not relate to duty of driver to pedestrian.  This section and former §§ 46.1-211 and 46.1-289 (see now §§ 46.2-842 and 46.2-1082) deal with the duties of an operator of a motor vehicle turning fr om one lane to another where the movement of another vehicle is involved, and with the requirement of equipping a motor vehicle with a rear view mirror. They do not relate to the duty of the operator of a motor vehicle to a pedestrian. Thus an instructio n in the words of these statutes was inappropriate under the evidence in an action for the death of a pedestrian who was struck by a motor vehicle. Russell v. Hammond, 200 Va. 600, 106 S.E.2d 626, 1959 Va. LEXIS 144 (1959). Former subdivision (b) (see now subdivision 2) applies to movement of vehicle from one lane to another on same road. Wallingford v. Karnes, 194 Va. 648, 74 S.E.2d 161, 1953 Va. LEXIS 130 (1953) (holding that subdivision was not applicable to the facts established in case growing out of collision at intersection). Former subdivision (b) (see now subdivision 2) is also applicable to movements within an intersection as well as to those upon city streets and open highways. Ragsdale v. Jones, 202 Va. 278, 117 S.E.2d 114, 1960 Va. LEXIS 219 (1960). The manifest purpose of former subdivision (e) (see now subdivision 5) of this section w as to prevent cars driving on the left side of the road for purposes of passing where there was not sufficient vision ahead to allow the passing to be made in safety in view of the fact that the car being passed was in motion. Burcham v. J.P. Stevens &amp; C o., 209 F.2d 35, 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 3612 (4th Cir. 1954). If passing movement is commenced across broken line, it must be completed before reaching solid traffic line to the right of a broken line under this section. Neighbors v. Moore, 216 Va. 514, 219 S.E.2d 692, 1975 Va. LEXIS 323 (1975). The fact that defendant/driver commenced to pass when a single broken line marked the lanes gave him no license to continue north in that lane after he reached th e solid line. That traffic control marking required the defendant to return to the northbound lane before he reached the solid line. Neighbors v. Moore, 216 Va. 514, 219 S.E.2d 692, 1975 Va. LEXIS 323 (1975). Turning left across solid lines.  It was not unlawful for motorist to cross yellow line of oncoming turn lane for purpose of turning left onto entrance ramp to Interstate highway. Commonwealth v. Reynolds, No. 2626-98-1 (Ct. of Appeals May 28, 1999). Burden of explanation.  This section forbids driving to the left of two adjacent solid lines marking double traffic lanes on a highway. Therefore, one whose car is to the left of such li nes has a burden of explanation. Bizzaro v. Payne, 169 F.2d 851, 1948 U.S. App. LEXIS 2268 (4th Cir. 1948); Interstate Veneer Co. v. Edwards, 191 Va. 107, 60 S.E.2d 4, 1950 Va. LEXIS 203 (1950). Where facts supported a valid stop.  District court did not err in ruling that police officers stop of defendants vehicle was constitutional, predicated on a reasonable suspicion of unlawful conduct; it was uncontroverted, and the district court so found, that defendant crossed the double center line, a violation of Virginia law. The searches of defendant and her purse were also appropriate and constitutional as her arrest did not contravene the Fourth Amendment and as a result, the search of ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-805"><akn:num>§ 46.2-805</akn:num><akn:heading>Lane-use control signals</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section and § 46.2-849 created reciprocal duties on the part of leading and foll owing drivers. Mandro v. Vibbert, 170 F.2d 540, 1948 U.S. App. LEXIS 2686 (4th Cir. 1948). Righ t to assume that other driver will comply with section.  Until there was something to put him upon notice to the contrary, a motorist had a right to assume that no driver approaching from his rear would follow his truck more closely than is reasonable and prudent under the circumstances obtaining. Hershman v. Payne, 196 Va. 241, 83 S.E.2d 418, 1954 Va. LEXIS 217 (1954). This section grants a driver the right to follow another vehicle as closely as is reasonable and prudent under the circumstances. Clifton v. Gregory, 212 Va. 859, 188 S.E.2d 203, 1972 Va. LEXIS 284 (1972); Meeks v. Hodges, 226 Va. 106, 306 S.E.2d 879, 1983 Va. LEXIS 274 (1983). What is a reasonable and prudent distance must, in each instance, depend upon th e particular facts involved. Except when reasonable minds cannot differ, what distance was required to be maintained and whether that distance was in fact maintained are questions for the jury. Mandro v. Vibbert, 170 F.2d 540, 1948 U.S. App. LEXIS 2686 ( 4th Cir. 1948); Elswick v. Collins, 194 Va. 292, 72 S.E.2d 626, 1952 Va. LEXIS 231 (1952). What constitutes a reasonable distance must, in each instance, depend upon the particular facts involved. Clifton v. Gregory, 212 Va. 859, 188 S.E.2d 203, 1972 Va . LEXIS 284 (1972). Reason for requiring reasonable and prudent distance.  The likelihood of sudden stopping is one of the reasons for requiring an automobile driver to maintain a reasonable and prudent distance behind an automobile in f ront of him. Every driver knows that vehicles may stop suddenly for various reasons or causes. It is not necessary that one should foresee the cause for which a car may stop; but if he is prudent he must recognize the possibility of a sudden stop. Maroul is v. Elliott, 207 Va. 503, 151 S.E.2d 339, 1966 Va. LEXIS 251 (1966). Duty of following driver.  Under Virginia law driver in following car was bound to pay attention to the vehicle in front of him and to keep a proper lookout to avoid a collision. Johnson v. United States, 528 F.2d 489, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 12347 (4th Cir. 1975). Negligence as matter of law.  In rare rear-end collision cases undisputed facts may point so unerringly to liability that Virginia courts are permitted to find negligence as a matter of law, a nd it may be reversible error to fail to do so. Johnson v. United States, 528 F.2d 489, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 12347 (4th Cir. 1975). Evidence of intoxication.  Trial court cannot reverse engineer the causal link by claiming a defendants car accident inherently creates a reasonable inference of impairment, even where the defendants fault in causing the accident is undisputed; trial courts determination that defendant violated Va. Code Ann. § 46.2-816 did not inherently give rise to a reasonable inference that he was following a vehicle too closely as a res ult of having taken zolpidem, amitriptyline, and nortriptyline, as these are two distinct charges. Brown v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 635 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 13, 2022). Contributory negligence righ tly inferred.  The trial judge was entitled to infer from one defendants violation of former § 46.1-190 (see now § 46.2-853) and this section which constitute negligen ce and the fact that she had not stopped when only a few feet from plaintiff, although, like the other defendant, she had more time than plaintiff in which to act, that her negligence contributed to the collision. Cohen v. Boxberger, 544 F.2d 701, 1976 U .S. App. LEXIS 6998 (4th Cir. 1976). Evidence jus tifying finding of violation of section.  Where, according to the admitted testimony of the driver of a truck, under the conditions then obtaining he could not have stopped his truck within 10´, and ye t he was following the preceding car at only a distance of from 8 to 10´, the jury can rightly find that he was following the car too closely in violation of this section. Richmond Coca-Cola Bottling Works v. Andrews, 173 Va. 240, 3 S.E.2d 419, 1939 V a. LEXIS 190 (1939). Defendants failure to stop held proximate cause of plaintiffs injury.  Where plaintiff was negligent in hitting the car in front of him, for the same reasons that defendant was negligent in colliding with the rear of plaintiffs v ehicle (failure to keep a proper lookout and following too closely), but there was no persuasive evidence to indicate that plaintiffs negligence was a cause of the collision between defendants and the plaintiffs vehicle and, moreover, defenda nt had a duty to avoid hitting the back of plaintiffs vehicle whatever the reason for plaintiffs sudden stop, and, finally, there was ample evidence to support a finding that it was the collision between defendants and the plaintiffs vehi cle, rather than the collision between plaintiffs vehicle and the vehicle in front of plaintiff, which caused the plaintiffs injury, defendants negligent failure to stop his vehicle after seeing plaintiff stop was the proximate cause of both plaintiffs injury and the damage to the rear of plaintiffs truck. Edwards v. United States, 672 F. Supp. 910, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10103 (E.D. Va. 1987). Instruction.  An instruction based on this section was inapplicable to the facts of the case and should not have been given. Nicholaou v. Harrington, 217 Va. 618, 231 S.E.2d 31 8, 1977 Va. LEXIS 210 (1977). When reasonable minds can differ as to what constitutes a reasonable and prudent distance under the circumstances then the question becomes a jury issue. Clifton v. Gregory, 212 Va. 859, 188 S.E.2d 203, 1972 Va. LEXIS 284 (1972). Violation supported stop of vehicle.  Officers observation of defendants positioning his car too closely to another vehicle, supported the officers stop of defendants vehicle for a vio lation of this section. Wethington v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 280 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2013). Evidence sufficient to support violation.  Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction; trial court could reasonably conclude that a prudent driver keeping a proper lookout would have noticed b oth the approaching intersection and the slowing of the other car, and by rear-ending it at the intersection, defendant failed to maintain both a proper lookout and reasonable distance. Brown v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 635 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 13 , 2022). § 46.2-816.1. Careless driving and infliction of injury or death on vulnerable road users; penalty. Text A. As used in this section, vulnerable road user means a pedestrian; the operator of or passenger on a bicycle, electric personal assistive mobility device, electric power-assisted bicycle, wheel chair or wheel chair conveyance, skateboard, roller skates, moto rized skateboard or scooter, or animal-drawn vehicle or any attached device; or any person riding an animal. B. It is a Cla ss 1 misdemeanor to operate a motor vehicle in a careless or distracted manner such that the careless or distracted operation is the proximate cause of serious bodily injury as defined in § 18.2-51.4 to or the death of a vulnerable road user who is la wfully present on the highway at the time of injury or death.

If a law-en forcement officer pursues a person as a result of a violation of subsection B and the law-enforcement officer is killed as a direct and proximate result of the pursuit, the person who violated subsection B is guilty of a Class 4 felony. D. When any pe rson is convicted of an offense under this section, in addition to the other penalties provided in this section, the drivers license of such person shall be suspended by the court for a period of not less than thirty days nor more than one year. Howe ver, in any case where the speed of such person is determined to have exceeded the maximum allowed by twenty miles per hour, his drivers license shall be suspended by the court trying the case for a period of not less than ninety days. In case of con viction and suspension, the court or judge shall order the surrender of the license to the court, which shall dispose of it in accordance with the provisions of § 46.2-398. E. Violation o f this section shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. If the acts or activities violating this section also violate another provision of law, a prosecution under this section shall not prohibit or bar any prosecution or proceeding under such o ther provision or the imposition of any penalties provided for thereby.

CASE NOTES Violation of section distinct from reckless driving.  The 1984 amendment to this section made violation of the statute an offense distinct from reckless driving. Shaw v. Commonwealth, 9 Va. App. 331, 387 S.E.2d 792, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1200, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 12 (1990). Case-by-case decision whether acts can produce multiple convictions without violating sections.  For a case indicating that courts will decide, case by case, whether particular acts in violation of this section and § 46.2-852 can produce multiple convictio ns without violating § 19.2-294 or § 19.2-294.1, see Lash v. County of Henrico, 13 Va. App. 251, 410 S.E.2d 689, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1136, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (1991), overruled, Hall v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 892, 421 S.E.2d 455, 9 Va. Law Rep. 5 4, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (1992). Double jeopardy clause not violated.  Conviction under § 46.2-357 for operation of a motor vehicle after having been adjudged an habitual offender was not barred by the double jeopardy clause becau se of appellants previous convictions from the same incident for reckless driving and for failing to stop and attempting to elude a police officer. Moore v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 198, 415 S.E.2d 247, 8 Va. Law Rep. 2481, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 95 (1 992). Although defendant had already been convicted of driving under the influence under § 18.2-266 from the same incident, his conviction for eluding a police offic er under subsection B of § 46.2-817 was not barred by § 19.2-294 because the specific acts serving as basis for prosecution of the offenses were separate and distinct in that the same evidence would not produce a conviction for both offenses. Wolfo rd v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 513 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 14, 2006). Defendants conviction of felony eluding (subsection B of § 46.2-817) after he pled guilty to reckless driving arising out of the same incident did not viol ate the double jeopardy ban; as subsection B of § 46.2-817 states that a violation thereof is a separate offense, the legislature authorized the imposition of multiple punishments in conjunction with other statutes. Hall v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 306 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2012). Reckless driving statute, § 46.2-852, and the felony eluding statute, subsection B of § 46.2-817, are not the same offense for double jeopardy purpo ses, as different facts are required to prove each; therefore, defendants conviction of felony eluding after he pled guilty to reckless driving did not violate the double jeopardy ban. Hall v. Commonwealth, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 306 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 2, 2012). In a case in which defendant was convicted of felony eluding police in Dinwiddie County and felony eluding police in Chesterfield County for the same incident, th e appellate court concluded that defendants double jeopardy rights were not violated because the evading and eluding committed by defendant in the two counties were separate and distinct acts. Francis v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 284 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 17, 2020). Convicting defendant of eluding in a second county per Va. Code Ann. § 46.2-817(B) when he had previously been convicted of eluding in the first county for vio lating § 46.2-817(B) did not violate double jeopardy where the act of eluding police in the second county, though in temporal proximity, was not a continuation of his eluding in the first county. Defendants actions in the second county involved a new formation and implementation of purpose after he ran a stop sign, failed to submit to a traffic stop, and then involved a number of different police victims in a new chase through that county. Thus, the evidence supported the trial courts finding that defendant committed two separate and distinct acts of felony eluding. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 115 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 2023). Endangerment.  In the context of § 46.2-817, the fact that the exposure to danger does not result in any actual harm is a welcome fortuity, but not a legal defense. A constru ction of the term endangerment to include conduct that raises the specter of endangerment takes into account the 1999 deletion from subsection B of any requirement that the endangerment result in serious bodily injury. Coleman v. Commonwe alth, 52 Va. App. 19, 660 S.E.2d 687, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 240 (2008). Defendant interfered with and endangered the operation of the detectives vehicle and his conduct posed a significant risk to the safety of others, including h imself.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Negligence per se.  Virginia recognized negligence per se with regard to auto accidents; where an injured person was not an inattentive plaintiff, exposed himself to danger, and viol ated § 46.2-818 by directing traffic while acting as a ground guide for a large truck exiting a cola plant, a jury verdict in his favor for injuries sustained when a motorist struck him was set aside.

Traffic stop.  Where an officer arrested defendant for driving under the influence of alcohol, suppression of evidence seized during an inventory search was not warranted, becau se the officer stopped defendant based upon the officers observation of defendants drifting as well as defendants texting while driving, and the magistrate judge found the officers specific, articulable observations to be credible; the of ficer was not required to inform defendant of every reason for initiating the traffic stop, and the officers reason for exercising the charging discretion, in this case a minor mistake of law, was irrelevant.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Reckless driving and handheld personal communication device.  On and after July 1, 2013, if a driver operates a vehicle on a highway recklessly or at a speed in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person, while using a handheld personal communication device, that driver can be charged and convicted of reckless driving regardless of whether there are grounds to support a violation of § 46.2-1078.1. Virginia case law makes clear that the mere hap pening of an accident or use of a handheld personal communication device likely would be insufficient, standing alone, to support a conviction of reckless driving.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Collection of unpaid tolls.  A Commonwealths attorney has no authority to provide representation for a toll facility operator in actions brought under § 46.2-819.1 or § 46.2-819.3 for unpaid tolls, administrative fees, and civil penalties. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable James E. Plowman, Loudoun County Commonwealths Attorney, 09-068, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 7 (2/16/10). Electronic only toll facilities.  Operator of electronic-only toll facilities may not impose processing and administrative fees on drivers for the purpose of general revenue recovery. The operator may, however, impose processing fees to recover the direct costs of use of a video-monitoring system and the cost of the inv oice, and under the conditions set forth in § 46.2-819.3:1, may impose administrative fees to recover the expenses of collecting the unpaid toll. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Kenneth C. Alexander, Member, Senate of Virginia, No. 14-08 6, 2015 Va. AG LEXIS 18 (7/9/15). A Commonwealths Attorney may collect civil penalties, unpaid tolls, and administrative fees awarded to a private toll facility operator under § 46.2-819.3 :1, but is not obligated to do so. A court is not authorized to compel a Commonwealths Attorney to undertake such a discretionary act, nor to undertake collection of such a monetary judgment on its own initiative. See opinion of Attorney General to H onorable Stephen E. Heretick, Member, Virginia House of Delegates, 18-021, (6/28/19). § 46.2-819.1.

For purpose s of this section:Automatic vehicle identification device means an electronic device that communi cates by wireless transmission with an automatic vehicle identification system.Automatic vehicle identification system means an electronic vehicle identification system installed to work in conjunction with a toll collection device that automatically produces an electronic record of each vehicle equipped with an automatic vehicle identification de vice that uses a toll facility.Debt collection means the collection of unpaid tolls and applicabl e administrative fees by (i) retention of a third-party debt collector or (ii) collection practices undertaken by employees of a toll facility operator that are materially similar to a third-party debt collector. Operator of a toll facility other than the Department of Transportation means any agency, political subdivision, authority, or other en tity that operates a toll facility.Owner means the registered owner of a vehicle on record with t he Department of Motor Vehicles or with the equivalent agency in another state. Owner does not include a vehicle rental or vehicle leasing company.Photo-monitoring syst em means a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with a toll collection device that automatically produces one or more photographs, one or more microphotographs, a v ideotape, or other recorded images of each vehicle at the time it is used or operated in violation of this section. B. The operato r of any toll facility or the locality within which such toll facility is located may install and operate or cause to be installed and operated a photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle identification system, or both, at locations where tolls are co llected for the use of such toll facility. The operator of a toll facility shall send an invoice or bill for unpaid tolls to the owner of a vehicle as part of an electronic or manual toll collection process pursuant to § 46.2-819.6 prior to seeking re medies under this section. C. Information collected by a photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle identification system installed and operated pursuant to subsection B shall be limited exclusively to that information that is necessary for the collection of unpaid tolls.

Information collected under this sectio n shall be purged and not retained later than 30 days after the collection and reconciliation of any unpaid tolls, administrative fees, and/or civil penalties. Any entity operating a photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle identification system shal l annually certify compliance with this section and make all records pertaining to such system available for inspection and audit by the Commissioner of Highways or the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles or their designee. Any violation of this subsection shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. In addition to any fines or other penalties provided for by law, any money or other thing of value obtained as a result of a violation of this section shall be forfeited to the Commonwealth.The toll facility operator may impose and collect an administrative fee in addition to the unpaid toll so as to recover the expenses of collecting the unpaid toll, which administrative fee shall be reasonably related to the actual cost of collecting the unpaid t oll and not exceed $100 per violation. Such fee may be levied upon the operator of the vehicle after the first unpaid toll has been documented. The operator of the vehicle shall pay the unpaid toll and any administrative fee detailed in an invoice for th e unpaid toll issued by a toll facility operator. If paid within 60 days of notification, the administrative fee shall not exceed $25. D. If the matt er proceeds to court, the owner or operator of a vehicle shall be liable for a civil penalty as follows: for a first offense, $50; for a second offense within one year from the first offense, $100; for a third offense within two years from the second off ense, $250; and for a fourth and any subsequent offense within three years from the second offense, $500 plus, in each case, the unpaid toll, all accrued administrative fees imposed by the toll facility operator, and applicable court costs if the vehicle is found, as evidenced by information obtained from a photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle identification system as provided in this section, to have used such a toll facility without payment of the required toll. E. Notwithstan ding subsections C and D, for a first conviction of an operator or owner of a vehicle under this section, the total amount for the first conviction shall not exceed $2,200, including civil penalties and administrative fees regardless of the total number of offenses the operator or owner of a vehicle is convicted of on that date. F. No summons may be issued by a toll facility operator for a violation of this section unless the toll facility operator can demonstrate that (i) there was an attempt to collect the unpaid tolls and applicable administrative fees through debt collection not less than 30 days prior to issuance of the summons and (ii) 120 days have elapsed since the ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-820"><akn:num>§ 46.2-820</akn:num><akn:heading>Right-of-way at uncontrolled intersections, generally</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Except as otherwise provided in this article, when two vehicles approach or enter an uncontrolled intersection at approximately the same time, the driver of the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right.

Barksdale, 177 Va. 587, 15 S.E.2d 112, 1941 Va. LEXIS 243 (1941). This section sets forth the rule controlling right-of-way where two improved, hard surfa ced roads constituting a part of the State Highway System intersect. Pistolesi v. Staton, 481 F.2d 1218, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 8669 (4th Cir. 1973). But it does not apply to railroads and streetcar companies. VEPCO v. Vellines, 162 Va. 67 1, 175 S.E. 35, 1934 Va. LEXIS 279 (1934). Nor is it applicable where one operator is driving in a line of traffic and following ve hicles already proceeding through an intersection and another operator has stopped at the intersection, since logic dictates that any right-of-way the latter driver may have had over vehicles approaching from his left is not operative until the entire li ne of traffic has passed. Sager v. Ortts, 214 Va. 318, 200 S.E.2d 539, 1973 Va. LEXIS 302 (1973). Nor does it lessen duties of motorist faced with a stop sign at an intersection or to ad d to those of the favored driver at such intersection. White v. Hunt, 209 Va. 11, 161 S.E.2d 809, 1968 Va. LEXIS 187 (1968). Section applied to intersection in condominiums parking area, where the parking area was a highway. Furman v. Call, 234 Va. 437, 362 S.E.2d 709, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1278, 1987 Va. LEXIS 274 (1987). The mere fact that a road served as a main artery for traffic does not give vehicles on that highway the right-of-way over vehicles entering from the side. Pistolesi v. Staton, 481 F.2d 1218, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 8669 (4th Cir. 1973). If the intersection is in a populated community and the speed limit is reduced, the duty to look may be discharged by observing traffic within a relatively short distance. Pistolesi v. Staton, 481 F.2d 1218, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 8669 (4th Cir. 1973). If the intersection is in open country, where the view is unobstructed for greater dista nces and speed limits are much higher, the duty to look effectively may demand that the driver of the burdened vehicle observe the traffic approaching from a greater distance. Pistolesi v. Staton, 481 F.2d 1218, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 8669 (4th Cir. 1973). There can be but one right-of-way and that is with the vehicle on the right, unless such right-of-way has been forfeited under the provisions of the statute. Pannell v. Fauber, 201 Va. 380, 111 S.E.2d 445, 1959 Va. LEXIS 238 (1959); Farmer v. Valley Marine Center, Inc., 206 Va. 737, 146 S.E.2d 265, 1966 Va. LEXIS 143 (1966). But forfeiture of the right-of-way does not operate to transfer the right-of-way to another. James v. City of Norfolk, 206 Va. 35, 141 S.E.2d 748, 1965 Va. LEXIS 165 (1965). Even if it be assumed that the driver of the vehicle on the right has forfeited his right-of-way because of negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout, or oth erwise, such forfeiture does not transfer the right-of-way to the vehicle on the left. Each is under the duty of exercising ordinary and reasonable care to avoid a collision. Moore v. Warren, 203 Va. 117, 122 S.E.2d 879, 1961 Va. LEXIS 229 (1961). Forfeiture of the right-of-way that is accorded the driver of the vehicle on the right at any uncontrolled intersection because the driver was traveling at an unl awful speed did not transfer the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on the left. Rather, neither driver possessed the right-of-way at the point of the collision. Asbury v. Town of Marion, No. 0079-85 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 7, 1986). And the mere fact that a vehicle is on the right is not of itself sufficient to give it the right-of-way. Farmer v. Valley Marine Center, Inc., 206 Va. 737, 146 S.E.2d 265, 1966 Va. LEXIS 143 (1966). Because the vehicle on the right is entitled to the right-of-way only where two vehicles approach an intersection at approximately the same time. Alford v. Frye, 205 Va. 7, 135 S.E.2d 101, 1964 Va. LEXIS 137 (1964). Under the language of the statute the driver of only one vehicle, that on the right, has the right-of-way, provided he approaches or enters the intersection at ap proximately the same time as the other vehicle and is traveling at a lawful speed. Pannell v. Fauber, 201 Va. 380, 111 S.E.2d 445, 1959 Va. LEXIS 238 (1959). Neither the prior arrival of a car on the left at an intersection nor the excessive speed of the car on the right transfers the right-of-way from the driver of th e latter to the driver of the former car. In both instances neither driver has the right-of-way over, or is required to yield to, the other. Each is under the duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid a collision. Pannell v. Fauber, 201 Va. 380, 111 S.E.2d 445, 1959 Va. LEXIS 238 (1959). Where the jury had a right to conclude that the two vehicles did not approach or enter the intersection at approximately the same time, but instead, that plaintif fs car approached and entered it substantially first, neither driver had the right-of-way over, or was required to yield to the other and each was under the duty to exercise ordinary care to avoid a collision. Farmer v. Valley Marine Center, Inc., 20 6 Va. 737, 146 S.E.2d 265, 1966 Va. LEXIS 143 (1966). The phrase at approximately the same time, as used in this section, means that t he determination of the question depends not upon a computation of time but upon the determination of a fact by the jury. Independent Cab Ass'n v. Barksdale, 177 Va. 587, 15 S.E.2d 112, 1941 Va. LEXIS 243 (1941); Hebner v. Sullivan, 194 Va. 259, 72 S.E.2 d 689, 1952 Va. LEXIS 226 (1952); Wallingford v. Karnes, 194 Va. 648, 74 S.E.2d 161, 1953 Va. LEXIS 130 (1953); Sears v. Geyer, 205 Va. 469, 137 S.E.2d 873, 1964 Va. LEXIS 204 (1964); Farmer v. Valley Marine Center, Inc., 206 Va. 737, 146 S.E.2d 265, 196 6 Va. LEXIS 143 (1966). The statutory right-of-way is to be exercised with prudence and with due regard for the rights of others. Remine v. Whited, 180 Va. 1, 21 S.E.2d 743, 1942 Va. LEXIS 139 (1942). Prudent man test.  When the driver of a burdened vehicle has looked, he must then determine whether it is safe to proceed. When he intends to enter and cross an intersection the rig ht to do so is to be tested by whether a person of ordinary prudence would attempt it. Pistolesi v. Staton, 481 F.2d 1218, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 8669 (4th Cir. 1973). Duty of reasonable care.  Upon reaching an uncontrolled intersection with another highway, a driver has a duty to look for approaching traffic with reasonable care under all the surroundin g circumstances. Pistolesi v. Staton, 481 F.2d 1218, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 8669 (4th Cir. 1973). The driver having the right-of-way is not relieved of duty of exercising due care.  In the enactment of this section the legislature never intended to relieve the driver of an automobile of the duty of exercising due care when approaching an inte rsection, even though he may have the right-of-way. The mere fact that one vehicle has the right-of-way over another at a street or highway intersection does not relieve the driver of the vehicle thus favored from the duty of exercising due care to avoid collision at the intersection. Hogan v. Miller, 156 Va. 166, 157 S.E. 540, 1931 Va. LEXIS 185 (1931) (see Johnson v. Harrison, 161 Va. 804, 172 S.E. 259 (1934); Barnes v. Mabry, 186 Va. 243, 42 S.E.2d 304 (1947); Hoffman v. Stuart, 190 Va. 880, 59 S.E.2 d 94 (1950); Carter v. Garner, 204 Va. 153, 129 S.E.2d 671 (1963)). As a general proposition the driver of a vehicle who has the right-of-way is justified in assuming that the driver of a vehicle on his left will yield the right-o f-way to him. However, this rule is subject to the qualification that the driver of the privileged vehicle has the duty to keep a reasonable lookout and otherwise exercise ordinary care to avoid a collision. Wallingford v. Karnes, 194 Va. 648, 74 S.E.2d 161, 1953 Va. LEXIS 130 (1953) (see City Cabs, Inc. v. Griffith, 194 Va. 818, 75 S.E.2d 487 (1953)). This section does not relieve the driver of the favored vehicle from the duty to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances. Particularly it does not entitl e him to enter an intersection without looking to his left or relieve him from all obligation to a vehicle coming from that direction unless he has actual knowledge of its approach. Indeed he must proceed with the ever present probability in mind that at every intersection he is likely to meet another vehicle travelling the street which he is about to cross. Weakley v. United States, 158 F.2d 703, 1946 U.S. App. LEXIS 2454 (4th Cir. 1946). It is elementary that the driver of a motor vehicle approaching an intersection must exercise ordinary care to keep a reasonable lookout. He is not under an absol ute duty to see an oncoming vehicle unless it is in such plain view that looking with reasonable care he is bound to have seen it. Thompson v. Mann, 201 Va. 528, 111 S.E.2d 792, 1960 Va. LEXIS 125 (1960). Although one vehicle has the right-of-way over another at a highway intersection, that does not relieve the driver of the privileged vehicle of the duty of keepin g a reasonable lookout and otherwise ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-821"><akn:num>§ 46.2-821</akn:num><akn:heading>Vehicles before entering certain highways shall stop or yield right-of-way</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection on a highway controlled by a stop sign shall, immediately before entering such intersection, stop at a clearly marke d stop line, or, in the absence of a stop line, stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or, in the absence of a marked crosswalk, stop at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approachi ng traffic on the intersecting roadway. Before proceeding, he shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of any vehicle approaching on such other highway from either direction. Where a Yield Right-of-Way sign is posted, the driver of a vehicle approaching or entering such intersection shall slow down to a speed reasonable for the exist ing conditions, yield the right-of-way to the driver of another vehicle approaching or entering such intersection from another direction, and, if required for safety, shall stop at a clearly marked stop or yield line, or, in the absence of a stop or yiel d line, stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway, and shall yield the right-of-way to the driver of any vehicle approaching on such othe r highway from either direction.

For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Automobiles, §§ 23, 24. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Purpose.  The purpose of the pertinent provisions of this section and former §§ 46.1-190 (j) and 46.1-223 (see now §§ 46.2-863 and 46.2-826) is to require the o perator to bring his motor vehicle to a timely stop before entering the traveled portion of the highway, or, as sometimes stated, to assure a proper lookout by the operator of the emerging vehicle. Umberger v. Koop, 194 Va. 123, 72 S.E.2d 370, 1952 Va. L EXIS 213 (1952). One of the purposes of this section is to provide that the vehicle shall not be driven into the highway until its driver has taken advantage of the stop to exerci se reasonable care in looking along the highway for approaching traffic. Nehi Bottling Co. v. Lambert, 196 Va. 949, 86 S.E.2d 156, 1955 Va. LEXIS 165 (1955). Immediately.  Immediately as used in the statutes requiring the driver or an operator to stop immediately before entering a highway is not a word of very precise signif ication. It does not necessarily import the exclusion of all intervals of time or space. Its meaning is determined by the context in which it is used and the purpose for which this section and former §§ 46.1-190 (j) and 46.1-223 (see now §§ 4 6.2-863 and 46.2-826) were enacted. Umberger v. Koop, 194 Va. 123, 72 S.E.2d 370, 1952 Va. LEXIS 213 (1952). Stopping distance.  This section and former §§ 46.1-190 (j) and 46.1-223 (see now §§ 46.2-863 and 46.2-826) do not require the operator of a motor vehicle to bring his ve hicle to a stop within a stated number of feet from the intersection. The sign is notice that danger lies ahead, and that he must stop at a point from which, in the exercise of ordinary care, he can see traffic moving on the highway he proposes to enter. Umberger v. Koop, 194 Va. 123, 72 S.E.2d 370, 1952 Va. LEXIS 213 (1952). Driver must not only stop but look.  Under this section it is the specific duty of the driver not only to stop before entering a boulevard from a secondary road but also to look with reasonable care before entering such boulevard. This is not an absolute duty to discover by looking, unless the thing to be looked for is in such plain view that looking with reasonable care was bound to have discovered it. See).Oliver v. Forsyth, 190 Va. 710, 58 S.E.2d 49, 1950 Va. LEXIS 162 (1950). This section imposes upon the operator of an automobile the duty to stop before entering a main arterial highway, and to use reasonable care to maintain a lookout and not to drive across until in the exercise of reasonable care it appears safe to do so. The duty to look requires not only the physical act of looking, but a reasonably prudent act to avoid the danger which an effective lookout would disclose. Umberg er v. Koop, 194 Va. 123, 72 S.E.2d 370, 1952 Va. LEXIS 213 (1952). But he is not an insurer of the safety of his crossing.  An instruction that placed on defendant an absolute duty to see  that is, even though he looked with reasonable care, he was guilty of negligence if he failed to see the approaching car  at whatever distance away the jury could conclude the car might have been when he looked, made him an insurer of the safety of his crossing and placed on him a greater burden than the law authorized. It was, therefore, an incorrect statement of the law. See).Oliver v. Forsyth, 190 Va. 710, 58 S.E.2d 49, 1950 Va. LEXIS 162 (1950). Driver on primary road may assume that driver on side road will obey law.  The driver on the primary road had the right to assume that the driver on the side road would obey the law until the driver on the primary road saw, or by the exe rcise of ordinary care should have seen, that the other driver would not do so. Gammon v. Hyde, 199 Va. 918, 103 S.E.2d 221, 1958 Va. LEXIS 142 (1958). It is natural to assume that one on a main highway, rapidly approaching a crossing, would take it for granted that another on a secondary road likewise approachin g it, but who had stopped, did so with the intention of giving arterial traffic the right-of-way. One who is required to stop has not the right-of-way. That right, assuming that it had theretofore existed, is then suspended and remains suspended until he can proceed with safety. Otey v. Blessing, 170 Va. 542, 197 S.E. 409, 1938 Va. LEXIS 209 (1938). Stopping at st op sign precludes conviction of crime.  If an operator stops at a stop sign he certainly cannot be convicted of a crime as he has a right to assume that the Highway Commission (now Highway and Transport ation Board) has erected the sign at a proper place for him to stop. Whether such operator, after complying with the law in this respect, is negligent in entering the intersection, depends upon the circumstances of each particular case. Umberger v. Koop, 194 Va. 123, 72 S.E.2d 370, 1952 Va. LEXIS 213 (1952). Instructions as to place of stopping.  See Umberger v. Koop, 194 Va. 123, 72 S.E.2d 370, 1952 Va. LEXIS 213 (1952). This section must be read in connection with former § 46.1-173 (see now § 46.2-830), which imposes on the driver of a motor vehicle the duty of complying with the requirements of road signs erected upon the authority of the State Highway Commission (now Commonwealth Transportation Board) or by local authorities in cities and towns. Whi te v. Hunt, 209 Va. 11, 161 S.E.2d 809, 1968 Va. LEXIS 187 (1968). But it is not controlling.  The provisions of this section are not applicable at an intersection which is controlled by a stop sign erected pursuant to former § 46.1-173 (see now § 46. 2-830). White v. Hunt, 209 Va. 11, 161 S.E.2d 809, 1968 Va. LEXIS 187 (1968). Sudden emergency defense not avail able.  Any emergency claimed by defendant driver occurred only because of the combination of the loss of power assistance in braking and his failure to use the additiona l force required to stop his vehicle. Because reasonable persons could not disagree that defendant drivers negligence contributed to the creation of the alleged emergency, defendant driver could not rely on the defense of sudden emergency. Bentley v. Felts, 248 Va. 117, 445 S.E.2d 131, 10 Va. Law Rep. 1492, 1994 Va. LEXIS 91 (1994). Collision cause properly sent to jury.  Since reasonable minds could differ as to the proximate cause of the collision with the guard rail: defendant drivers failure to stop at the intersection and yield the right-of-way; the failure of defendant drivers cars engine and defendant drivers actions in response; or plaintiff drivers actions after seeing defendant drivers car, and because the evidence could support alternative factua l findings as to the cause of plaintiff drivers collision with the guard rail, the trial court correctly denied the motion to strike and submitted the matter to the jury.

Most of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The words shall forfeit any right-of-way which he might otherwise have hereunder apply only to this section and cannot be said to apply to any other sections conferring other and different types of right-of-way. Atwell v. Watson, 204 Va. 624, 133 S.E.2d 552, 1963 Va. LEXIS 196 (1963). There can be but one right-of-way and that is with the vehicle on the right, unless such right-of-way has been forfeited under the provisions of the statute. Pannell v. Fauber, 201 Va. 380, 111 S.E.2d 445, 1959 Va. LEXIS 238 (1959); Farmer v. Valley Marine Center, Inc., 206 Va. 737, 146 S.E.2d 265, 1966 Va. LEXIS 143 (1966). But forfeiture of the right-of-way does not operate to transfer the right-of-way to another. James v. City of Norfolk, 206 Va. 35, 141 S.E.2d 748, 1965 Va. LEXIS 165 (1965). Even if it be assumed that the driver of the vehicle on the right has forfeited his right-of-way because of negligence in failing to keep a proper lookout, or oth erwise, such forfeiture does not transfer the right-of-way to the vehicle on the left. Each is under the duty of exercising ordinary and reasonable care to avoid a collision. Moore v. Warren, 203 Va. 117, 122 S.E.2d 879, 1961 Va. LEXIS 229 (1961). Forfeiture of the right-of-way that is accorded the driver of the vehicle on the right at any uncontrolled intersection because the driver was traveling at an unl awful speed did not transfer the right-of-way to the driver of the vehicle on the left. Rather, neither driver possessed the right-of-way at the point of the collision. Asbury v. Town of Marion, No. 0079-85 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 7, 1986). Excessive speed does not explain failure to see oncoming vehicle.  Excessive speed does not establish a reasonably satisfactory explanation as to why a driver did not see an oncoming vehicle. It is incredible that the speed of a vehicle was such as to make it invisible to a person keeping a lookout, regardless of its rate of travel. Pistolesi v. Staton, 481 F.2d 1218, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 8669 (4th Cir. 1973). Only an unlawful speed as distinguished from unreasonable speed works a forfeiture of the right-of-way. Atwell v. Watson, 204 Va. 624, 133 S.E.2d 552, 1963 Va. LEXIS 196 (1963). The fact that the driver of the privileged vehicle stopped before entering the intersection does not amount to a forfeiture or waiver of the right-of-way accorded to him under this section. Bolinaga v. Savage, 206 Va. 336, 143 S.E.2d 839, 1965 Va. LEXIS 203 (1965). The driver of an automobile will not be permitted to drive blindly into another fast approaching automobile simply because he has the right-of-way over such other automobile. For the plaintiff to stand upon his right-of-way and fail or refuse to look for another automobile which is using the intersecting road, when such other automobile is in plain view and approaching at a dangerous speed, is the clearest kind o f concurring negligence. Johnson v. Harrison, 161 Va. 804, 172 S.E. 259, 1934 Va. LEXIS 304 (1934) (see Brown v. Lee, 167 Va. 284, 189 S.E. 339 (1937); Hoffman v. Stuart, 190 Va. 880, 59 S.E.2d 94 (1950); Von Roy v. Whitescarver, 197 Va. 384, 89 S.E.2d 3 46 (1955)). And as to speed.  Where two highways were both improved, hard surfaced, and a part of the State Highway System, the general rule applies and it was the duty of the vehicle on the l eft, to yield; the vehicle on the right had the right-of-way subject to forfeiture thereof if the jury found that it was traveling at an unlawful rate of speed. Pistolesi v. Staton, 481 F.2d 1218, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 8669 (4th Cir. 1973). Instruction ignoring provision as to forfeiture of right-of-way was held to constitute reversible error. Shearin v.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section and former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848) must be read together. Sout hers v. Price, 211 Va. 469, 178 S.E.2d 685, 1971 Va. LEXIS 193 (1971). Where a collision occurred when one vehicle made a left turn across the path of an approaching vehicle at an intersection, former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2 -848) which requires the operator of a vehicle intending to make a left turn to first use reasonable care to see that he can do so in safety must be read and considered conjunctively with this section which requires a left turning driver to yield the rig ht-of-way to other vehicles within or approaching the point of turn. Southers v. Price, 211 Va. 469, 178 S.E.2d 685, 1971 Va. LEXIS 193 (1971). Driver turning left must exercise ordinary care in the discharge of the duties conjuncti vely imposed upon him by former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848) and this section. Hogan v. Carter, 226 Va. 361, 310 S.E.2d 666, 1983 Va. LEXIS 293 (1983). A motorist turning left across the line of travel of other vehicles within or approachin g an intersection is not negligent as a matter of law. Southers v. Price, 211 Va. 469, 178 S.E.2d 685, 1971 Va. LEXIS 193 (1971). The duty to yield does not depend upon the speed of the approaching vehicle, but upon wh ether it was sufficiently far away so that the turning vehicle could be said to have exercised reasonable care in undertaking the turn. Atwell v. Watson, 204 Va. 624, 133 S.E.2d 552, 1963 Va. LEXIS 196 (1963). Such speed does not forfeit right-of-way, but goes to question of turning drivers care.  There is no provision in this section providing for a forfeiture of right-of-way, such as in former § 46.1-221 (see now § 46.2-820). The question of unreaso nable or unlawful speed on the part of the approaching driver goes not to forfeiture of right-of-way but to the question of whether the turning driver has exercised proper care under the circumstances so as to reasonably believe that he could complete th e turn in safety. Atwell v. Watson, 204 Va. 624, 133 S.E.2d 552, 1963 Va. LEXIS 196 (1963). Duty to keep lookout for oncom ing vehicles.  Implicit in the requirements of this section and former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848) is the duty to keep a reasonable lookout for oncoming vehicles appro aching in plain view. While a driver making a left turn has the right to assume that the driver of an approaching car will observe traffic laws, this does not relieve him of the duty to comply with the requirements of these sections. Brown v. Peters, 202 Va. 382, 117 S.E.2d 695, 1961 Va. LEXIS 120 (1961). Underlying the statutory duties imposed by former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848) and this section is the common-law duty to maintain a reasonable lookout f or other traffic. Hogan v. Carter, 226 Va. 361, 310 S.E.2d 666, 1983 Va. LEXIS 293 (1983). Implicit in the requirement of the use of reasonable and ordinary care to see that a turn can be made with safety is the duty to keep a reasonable lookout for onc oming vehicles and to see any such vehicles approaching in plain view. Hogan v. Carter, 226 Va. 361, 310 S.E.2d 666, 1983 Va. LEXIS 293 (1983). In a case brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.S. §§ 2671-2680, in which the district court entered judgment in favor of the United States, t he district court erred in determining that a government employee was not negligent in operating her vehicle, and that a second driver was contributorily negligent, thus barring her recovery. In making a turn, the government employee did not yield to the second driver, who was in oncoming traffic, and, contrary to the district courts assertion, Virginia law did not require the second driver, who had the right-of-way, to slow or stop prior to entering the intersection. Cary v. United States, 343 Fed. Appx. 926, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 19480 (4th Cir. 2009). Inapplicable where other driver approaching from other of two roads at T intersection.  The language [t]he driver of a vehicle, intending to turn to the left within an intersection . . . shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle approaching fro m the opposite direction which is so close as to constitute a hazard is inapplicable where the plaintiffs vehicle was not approaching the defendant from the opposite direction, but from the other of two roads meeting at a T inters ection. Perkins v. Carr, 227 Va. 16, 313 S.E.2d 372, 1984 Va. LEXIS 262 (1984). Left turn signal ind icates stop may be necessary.  Whenever a motorist gives a signal of his intention to turn left from a direct line of travel into another highway, the driver of a following vehicle is put on no tice that it may become necessary for the driver signaling a left turn to stop before entering the intersection to yield the right-of-way to traffic proceeding from the opposite direction. He is not required to give any further notice. Montague v. Rucker , 204 Va. 612, 132 S.E.2d 726, 1963 Va. LEXIS 194 (1963). Instructions.  Since the instruction was based on this section, which contains no forfeiture provision, the court correctly refused to instruct that defendant forfeited the righ t-of-way unless she was free of negligence. Taylor v. Turner, 205 Va. 828, 140 S.E.2d 641, 1965 Va. LEXIS 140 (1965). For an instruction which was held to be unduly favorable to the turning vehicle and misleading as to the duty to yield, see Atwell v. Watson, 204 Va. 624, 133 S.E .2d 552, 1963 Va. LEXIS 196 (1963). Former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848) and this section must be read together, so that an instruction based on this section must have qualifying language, s uch as in the exercise of ordinary care, in stating the duty of defendant to yield the right-of-way. Southers v. Price, 211 Va. 469, 178 S.E.2d 685, 1971 Va. LEXIS 193 (1971). Although the instruction did incorporate a reasonable or ordinary care standard, its language was confusing, argumentative and subject to misunderstanding. It fai led to clearly point out what duty the left turning driver owed the plaintiff. For these reasons it was error to give the instruction. Southers v. Price, 211 Va. 469, 178 S.E.2d 685, 1971 Va. LEXIS 193 (1971). The instruction would have been proper if it had read: The Court instructs the jury that by statute in this State the driver of a vehicle in an intersection and t urning therein to the left across the line of travel of vehicles within or approaching the intersection shall yield the right-of-way to such other vehicles. If you believe from the evidence that the defendant in the exercise of ordinary care should have yielded the right-of-way to the plaintiff and failed to do so then the defendant was negligent. If you further believe from the evidence that such negligence was the sole proximate cause of the collision, then you shall return your verdict in favor of th e plaintiff. Southers v. Price, 211 Va. 469, 178 S.E.2d 685, 1971 Va. LEXIS 193 (1971). The instruction was a correct statement of the law, where it told the jury that even if they believed from the evidence that the plaintiff had the right-of-way, h e was required to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to avoid a collision if it appeared or should have appeared to him that the left-turning vehicle was not going to yield.

For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Automobiles, § 24. CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Sectio n imposes duty to stop and also to yield right-of-way.  This section imposes the duty not only to bring a vehicle to a stop before entering a highway, but also the duty to yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approac hing thereon. Kelley v. Henley, 208 Va. 264, 156 S.E.2d 618, 1967 Va. LEXIS 211 (1967). The driver has not only the duty to stop, but also the duty to yield the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching. Lyons v. McDonald, 312 F. Supp. 682, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11776 (E.D. Va. 1970). The statute imposes dual responsibilities upon a driver of a vehicle entering a public highway from a private driveway. The driver must stop immediately before en tering the highway and yield the right-of-way to vehicles approaching on the highway. The driver on the public highway has a statutory duty to yield the right-of-way to those lawfully approaching the intersection. Van Buren v. Simmons, 235 Va. 46, 365 S. E.2d 746, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1966, 1988 Va. LEXIS 26 (1988). And failure to obey mandate of section constitutes negligence. Seawell v. Carmines, 207 V a. 294, 149 S.E.2d 903, 1966 Va. LEXIS 219 (1966). Term public highway includes whole surface of highway.  This section does not require a car to be brought to a stop within the boundary lines of a public highway before entering upon its hard surface. The words pub lic highway mean the whole surface, not merely the hard surface, or only the main traveled part of the highway. Hall v. Miles, 197 Va. 644, 90 S.E.2d 815, 1956 Va. LEXIS 134 (1956); Moon v. Hill, 206 Va. 437, 143 S.E.2d 892, 1965 Va. LEXIS 217 (1965) . Immediately before entering.  As to place of stopping before entering main arterial highway and the meaning of immediately before entering as used in the pertinent provisions of the st atutes, see Umberger v. Koop, 194 Va. 123, 72 S.E.2d 370, 1952 Va. LEXIS 213 (1952). This section requires that a driver use reasonable care and come to a complete stop imme diately before entering a public highway from a private road. And he is not relieved of the duty to stop by the fact that the driver on the highway did not see him before he entered the highway. Temple v. Moses, 175 Va. 320, 8 S.E.2d 262, 1940 Va. LEXIS 175 (1940). When a driver on a private road approaches an intersection, stops, and looks in both directions for approaching traffic on the public highway, acting as a reasona bly prudent person exercising due care would act, he is not negligent as a matter of law if he attempts to enter the intersection under the belief that he has time and opportunity to cross safely. Temple v. Ellington, 177 Va. 134, 12 S.E.2d 826, 1941 Va. LEXIS 202 (1941); Umberger v. Koop, 194 Va. 123, 72 S.E.2d 370, 1952 Va. LEXIS 213 (1952); Brown v. Damron, 197 Va. 309, 89 S.E.2d 54, 1955 Va. LEXIS 223 (1955); Citizens Rapid Transit Co. v. O'Hara, 203 Va. 979, 128 S.E.2d 270, 1962 Va. LEXIS 247 (1962 ). But this section does not grant an exclusive privilege to drivers on the public highway regardless of their duty to obey traffic laws and to exercise reasonable care to protect the rights of others. Temple v. Ellington, 177 Va. 134, 12 S.E.2d 826, 1941 Va. LEXIS 202 (1941); Citizens Rapid Transit Co. v. O'Hara, 203 Va. 979, 128 S.E.2d 270, 1962 Va. LEXIS 247 (1962). While the driver of the automobile on the highway had the right-of-way at the intersection if he was proceeding lawfully, the driver on the private road did not h ave to assume that he would encounter any vehicle being operated at an excessive speed. Temple v. Ellington, 177 Va. 134, 12 S.E.2d 826, 1941 Va. LEXIS 202 (1941); Citizens Rapid Transit Co. v. O'Hara, 203 Va. 979, 128 S.E.2d 270, 1962 Va. LEXIS 247 (196 2). And driver on private road is only required to yield right-of-way to those lawfully approaching so near the intersection that he cannot safely enter it. Temple v. Ellington, 177 Va. 134, 12 S.E.2d 826, 1941 Va. LEXIS 202 (1941); Irvan v. Jamison Oil Co., 205 Va. 1, 135 S.E.2d 153, 1964 Va. LEXIS 136 (1964). However, a driver cannot excuse the violation of his statutory duty by relying upon a presumption that a car operated upon the highway is being driven at a careful and prudent speed. Temple v. Moses, 175 Va. 320, 8 S.E.2d 262, 1940 Va. LEXIS 175 (1940). Driver not required to stop before entering paved portion of street.  A driver was not negligent as a matter of law in failing to bring her vehicle to a stop immediately before crossing a ditch into the paved portion of the street. The ditch lay within the line of the street and defendants car was in a stopped position immediately before it entered the street. Hence this section was inapplicable. Hall v. Miles, 197 Va. 644, 90 S.E.2d 815, 1956 Va. LEXIS 134 (1956). But stopping i s required prior to crossing sidewalk.  This section makes it the duty of driver to bring his vehicle to a stop immediately before entering upon a highway which includes any part of the highway, such as a sidewalk. Thus, driver backing automobile out of private driveway is required to stop prior to crossing sidewalk. Messick v. Barham, 194 Va. 382, 73 S.E.2d 530, 1952 Va. LEXIS 242 (1952). Duty of reasonable care may require that driver stop in median.  Where a highway includes two roadways 30 feet or more apart, then every crossing of each roadway of such divided highway by an intersecting highway shall be regar ded as a separate intersection. Where the evidence does not establish that the median strip was 30 feet or more in width, there is only one intersection. The implication of this is that the driver is not required by this section to stop in the median str ip. However, his common-law duty to exercise reasonable care in the operation of his motor vehicle may require that he do so. Tubman v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 267, 348 S.E.2d 871, 3 Va. Law Rep. 838, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 361 (1986). Proper lookout.  The reasonable discharge of the duty to yield necessarily entails the antecedent duties of maintaining a proper lookout and of heeding what such a lookout reveals . Lyons v. McDonald, 312 F. Supp. 682, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11776 (E.D. Va. 1970). Presumption that dri ver on private road stopped.  The presumption, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is that the driver on the private road did stop and that he looked for oncoming traffic. Temple v. El lington, 177 Va. 134, 12 S.E.2d 826, 1941 Va. LEXIS 202 (1941). Sufficiency of instruction.  An instruction based on this section is not adequate, even if worded in accord with the section, unless it conforms with the rule that the driver on a private roa d is only required to yield to those lawfully approaching so near the intersection that he cannot safely enter it. Irvan v. Jamison Oil Co., 205 Va. 1, 135 S.E.2d 153, 1964 Va. LEXIS 136 (1964). Questions for jury.  Whether the driver on the private road is justified in going into the highway under the circumstances is for the jury. Temple v. Ellington, 177 Va. 134, 12 S.E.2d 826, 1941 Va. LEXIS 202 (1941). Where defendant company advertised an area as a private parking lot, with at least the tacit consent of the city, the jury could properly conclude that defendant s driver emerging from this parking lot did not have the right-of-way. Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. Moore, 201 Va. 928, 114 S.E.2d 626, 1960 Va. LEXIS 179 (1960). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Jury instruction in civil case.  Police officer was traveling at a high rate of speed, without emergency lights, when he collided with plaintiffs vehicle. Jury instructions that an emergency vehicle could exceed the speed limit if the driver was not grossly negligent, and that a driver had a duty to yield to a vehicle so near the driveway that the driver could not safely enter the highway, were correct statements of the law.

This section apparently grants a right-of-way to an ambulance operating under an emergen cy run. Phillips v. United States, 182 F. Supp. 312, 1960 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3011 (E.D. Va. 1960) (decided under former Title 46.1). When manslaughter implicated.  Defendants speed alone constituted reckless driving under the circumstances that existed on the night of October 11, 2018, and his conduct in passing Medic 6 and Rescue 6 constituted reckless driving; defendant knew or should have known that his acts and omissions created a substantial risk of harm to others and that he displayed a reckless disregard for the consequences of his conduct and an indifference to the safety of others. Labarge v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2022). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Breach as relating to sovereign immunity.  Whether a police officer breached §§ 46.2-804 and 46.2-829 was not material as to whether the officer was engaged in ordinary driving or emergency driving a t the time of an accident and, thus, had no application to a determination of whether sovereign immunity was available.

CASE NOTES Former section 46.1-221 (see now §§ 46.2-820 through 46.2-823) must be read in connection with this section, which imposes on the driver of a motor vehicle the duty of complying with the requirements of road signs erected upon the authority of the State Highway Commission (now Commonwealth Transportation Board) or by local author ities in cities and towns. White v. Hunt, 209 Va. 11, 161 S.E.2d 809, 1968 Va. LEXIS 187 (1968) (decided under prior law). Where a stop sign was 45 feet, 6 inches from the corner, it was not in a proper position to control the intersectional traffic flow. Hence, the intersection was uncontrolled. The court would therefore look to other Code provisions to determine which driver, if any, possessed the right-of-way at the point of impact. Asbury v. To wn of Marion, No. 0079-85 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 7, 1986)(decided under prior law). Stopping on side of highway.  Workers compensation claim was properly denied on the ground that the claim was barred by the claimants willful failure to perform a duty required by stat ute since the evidence showed that, despite highway signs warning against stopping on the side of the road unless it was an emergency, the claimant stopped his truck on the shoulder to urinate and, therefore, failed to comply with § 46.2-830 by not ob eying lawfully erected signs. The Workers Compensation Commissions finding that the claimants excuse, unsupported by any evidence that he had a medical condition that caused the sudden need to urinate, did not constitute an emergency was a matter for the Commission to determine based upon an assessment of the evidence and the claimants credibility. Patterson v. Valley Proteins, Inc., 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 21, 2006). § 46.2-830.1. Failure to obey highway sign where driver sleeping or resting. Text No driver of a vehicle shall park or stop his vehicle on the shoulder or other portion of the highway not ordinarily used for vehicular traffic in violation of a highwa y sign in order for the driver to sleep or rest. No demerit points shall be assigned pursuant to the Uniform Demerit Point System for a violation pursuant to this section. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply if such vehicle is parked or stopped in such manner as to impede or render dangerous the shoulder or other portion of the highway. History History. 1992, c. 856; 2017, c. 504. Annotations The 2017 amendments. The 2017 amendment by c. 504 rewrote the section which formerly read: Upon the trial of a person charged with failure to obey a highway sign in violation of § 46.2-830 where the court finds that the violation resulted from the having been parked or stopped by the driver on the shoulder or other portion of the highway not ordinarily used for vehicular traffic in order for the driver to sleep or rest, the c ourt may, in lieu of convicting under § 46.2-830, find the driver guilty of violating this section, which shall be a lesser-included offense of § 46.2-830.

Notwithstan ding any other provision of law, if a driver of a motorcycle or moped or a bicycle rider approaches an intersection that is controlled by a traffic light, the driver or rider may proceed through the intersection on a steady red light only if the driver o r rider (i) comes to a full and complete stop at the intersection for two complete cycles of the traffic light or for two minutes, whichever is shorter, (ii) exercises due care as provided by law, (iii) otherwise treats the traffic control device as a st op sign, (iv) determines that it is safe to proceed, and (v) yields the right of way to the driver of any vehicle approaching on such other highway from either direction. C. If the traf fic lights controlling an intersection are out of service because of a power failure or other event that prevents the giving of signals by the traffic lights, the drivers of vehicles approaching such an intersection shall proceed as though such intersect ion were controlled by a stop sign on all approaches. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to: intersections controlled by portable stop signs, intersections with law-enforcement officers or other authorized persons directing traffic, or int ersections controlled by traffic lights displaying flashing red or flashing amber lights as provided in subsection A.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. State statutes regulating the flow of traffic at intersections take precedence over loca l ordinances which prohibit drivers of vehicles from passing through or between processions, unless specific exception is made in the statutes. Paige v. Edgar, 210 Va. 54, 168 S.E.2d 103, 1969 Va. LEXIS 195 (1969). A red light is a command to stop, just as a green light is a command to proceed. VEPCO v . Holland, 184 Va. 893, 37 S.E.2d 40, 1946 Va. LEXIS 153 (1946); Virginia Transit Co. v. Tidd, 194 Va. 418, 73 S.E.2d 405, 1952 Va. LEXIS 247 (1952). But a green light is not an unqualified command to proceed.  A green light is not an unqualified command to a motorist to move in the direction indicated under any and all circumstances. It is only a command to do so in the exercise of reasonable care and when the movement indicated is not calculated to cause injury or damage to another. It is a conditional directive which is to be obeyed with reasonable care. Arney v. Bogstad, 199 Va. 460, 100 S.E.2d 749, 1957 Va. LEXIS 2 11 (1957). Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to suppress because the deputy had reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant violated this section, after defendant remained stationary at a green light for six or seven seconds and the deputy did not observe any vehicles in the intersection that would justify the prolonged stop. Joyce v. Commonwealth, 72 Va. App. 9, 840 S.E.2d 571, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 109 (2020). And driver must allow pedestrian who entered intersection when light was red to cross.  When this section is considered along with former § 46.1-231 (see now § 46.2-924), it is clear that the directive contained in this section is subordinate t o the right of a pedestrian who has lawfully entered an intersection where the red light is against vehicular traffic and is in the progress of crossing in the path of the automobile when the red light changes to green for vehicular traffic. Arney v. Bog stad, 199 Va. 460, 100 S.E.2d 749, 1957 Va. LEXIS 211 (1957). Though the light may have turned green for a driver while he was approaching an intersection, yet if a pedestrian had already entered the intersection when the re d light was against the driver, it was the latters duty under former § 46.1-231 (see now § 46.2-924), to change his course, slow down, or come to a complete stop if necessary to permit plaintiff to safely and expeditiously cross the int ersection. Arney v. Bogstad, 199 Va. 460, 100 S.E.2d 749, 1957 Va. LEXIS 211 (1957). Proximate cause.  As a matter of law, a non-party drivers negligence (the driver acted negligently because he disobeyed the red traffic signal governing the left-turn lane, and failed to ensure that he could safely turn left into the intersection, in violation of § 46.2-833) entirely supplanted any negligence on the part of defendant pizza company or its employees. Fletcher v. Pizza Hut of Am., Inc., 406 Fed. Appx. 785, 201 1 U.S. App. LEXIS 105 (4th Cir. 2011). § 46.2-833.01. Expired. Annotations Editors note.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Dividing line for users of road.  Where the white line dividing a highway into traffic lanes has become so faint as not to be noticeable to drivers, the center of the highway is the dividing line for users of the road. Tolbert v. Gillespie, 195 Va. 647, 79 S.E.2d 670, 1954 Va. LEXIS 143 (1954). Right to assume driver of approaching vehicle will move over to right side of road.  The driver of an automobile along a public highway, who sees another automobile approaching on the wrong side of the road, has the right to assume that the driver of such automobile will observe the law and seasonably move over to his right side so as to pass safely. A driver has a right to this presumption until he sees that such other driver is not going to turn to his right side. It then becomes his duty to ex ercise ordinary care to avoid a collision. Johnson v. Kellam, 162 Va. 757, 175 S.E. 634, 1934 Va. LEXIS 284 (1934). Although the law requires that the driver of a vehicle on the right side of the road, observing a vehicle approaching on the wrong side, shall exercise due care t o avoid a collision, he has the right to assume that the driver of the approaching vehicle will obey the law and return to his side of the highway in time to avoid a collision. Kale v. Douthitt, 274 F.2d 476, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 5535 (4th Cir. 1960). Burden of explanation.  Where the evidence established that defendants automobile moved to the wrong side of the road upon approaching plaintiffs car, the burden of explaining th e presence of his automobile on the wrong side of the road was on defendant.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Bus which temporarily stops is vehicle proceeding in the same direction.  A bus operating on the streets of a city, which temporarily stops at street intersections to take on or discharge passengers, is obviously a vehicle proceedin g in the same direction. Dey v. Virginia Transit Co., 187 Va. 635, 47 S.E.2d 552, 1948 Va. LEXIS 254 (1948). Vehicle which is parked is not vehicle proceeding in the same direction.  The statute requires that the other vehicle be proceeding, and injured womans vehicle did not meet the statutory requirement for the reasons articulat ed in Dey v. Virginia Transit Co., 187 Va. 635, 639, 47 S.E.2d 552, 554 (1948); in Dey, a bus had stopped temporarily to take on passengers when the defendants car passed it and cut in front of the bus as it was starting up again; however, injured wo mans vehicle was not temporarily stopped but was parked. Scott v. Greater Richmond Transit Co., 241 Va. 300, 402 S.E.2d 214, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1723, 1991 Va. LEXIS 30 (1991). Application to d river overtaking horseback rider.  No error was committed in instructing the jury that defendants agent and truck driver had the duties of a driver overtaking another vehicle. Decedent horsebac k rider was a vehicle within the contemplation of the Motor Vehicle Code and though on the shoulder of the road was still on the highway within the intent of former § 46.1-1 (see now § 46.2-100). Jessee v. Slate, 196 Va. 1074, 86 S.E.2d 821 , 1955 Va. LEXIS 180 (1955). Where truck slowed down and turned left off of pavement before turning abruptly right across highway and collision occurred with automobile which had been following when it continued on right side of highway at a moderate speed, this section and former § 46.1-209 did not apply. The driver of the automobile was not engaged in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction but was merely continuing to drive straight down the highway. Elswick v. Collins, 194 Va. 292, 72 S.E.2d 626, 1952 Va. LEXIS 231 (1952). Instruction.  A finding instruction which would have told the jury that the failure of the defendants driver to comply with the terms of this section was negligence and req uired a verdict for the plaintiff, without predicating such conclusion upon the additional finding that the plaintiff was free of negligence, was properly refused.

On a one-way street or on any one-way roadway when the roadway is free from obstructions and of sufficient width for two or more lines of moving vehicles. B. The driver of a vehicle may overtake and pass another vehicle on the right only under conditions permitting such movement in safety. Except where driving on paved shoulders is permitted by lawfully placed signs, no such movement shall be made by driving on the shou lder of the highway or off the pavement or main traveled portion of the roadway.

Section do es not relate to duty of driver to pedestrian.  This section and former §§ 46.1-206 and 46.1-289 (see now §§ 46.2-804 and 46.2-1082) deal with the duties of an operator of a motor vehicle turning fr om one lane to another where the movement of another vehicle is involved, and with the requirement of equipping a motor vehicle with a rear view mirror. They do not relate to the duty of the operator of a motor vehicle to a pedestrian. Thus an instructio n in the words of these statutes was inappropriate under the evidence in an action for the death of a pedestrian who was struck by a motor vehicle. Russell v.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Section makes statutory normal requirement of ordinary and reasonable care.  This section expressly and positively denies the driver of a vehicle the privilege to drive to the left side of the center line of a highway in overtaking and pas sing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction, unless the circumstances specified exist. It makes statutory the normal requirement that ordinary and reasonable care should be exercised in making such movement. Simmons v. Craig, 199 Va. 338, 99 S. E.2d 641, 1957 Va. LEXIS 195 (1957). It refers to moving vehicles, specifically to two vehicles proceeding in the same direct ion and not where one vehicle undertakes to pass a standing car. Goodman v. Commonwealth, 153 Va. 943, 151 S.E. 168, 1930 Va. LEXIS 274 (1930). And is a pplicable to driver overtaking horseback rider.  No error was committed in instructing the jury that defendants agent and truck driver had the duties of a driver overtaking another vehicle, as set out in thi s section. Decedent horseback rider was a vehicle within the contemplation of Motor Vehicle Code and though on the shoulder of the road was still on the highway within the intent of former § 46.1-1 (see now § 46.2-100). Jessee v. Slate, 196 Va. 1074, 86 S.E.2d 821, 1955 Va. LEXIS 180 (1955). Overtaking driver must yield right-of-way to approaching vehicle.  The statutory duty not to drive on the left side of the center line of the highway in passing unless such left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be made in safety imposes a duty on the driver of the overtaking vehicle to yield the right-of-way to any approaching vehicle while in its lane of travel. Kale v. Douth itt, 274 F.2d 476, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 5535 (4th Cir. 1960). Violation of section constituting gross negligence.  See Steele v. Crocker, 191 Va. 873, 62 S.E.2d 850, 1951 Va. LEXIS 143 (1951). Violatio n of section as gross contributory negligence.  Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, it appeared conclusively that his failure to observe the provisions of this section was an immediat e, efficient, contributing cause of the collision. It therefore followed that he was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Simmons v. Craig, 199 Va. 338, 99 S.E.2d 641, 1957 Va. LEXIS 195 (1957). Evidence showed defendant violated this section which was sufficient, standing alone, to convict him of negligence. Wright v. Osborne, 175 Va. 442, 9 S.E.2d 452, 1940 Va.

The driver of a motor vehicle approaching from any direction a clearly marked school bus that is stopped on any highway, private road, or school driveway for the purpose of taking on or discharging children, the elderly, or mentally or physically handicapped person s, who, in violation of § 46.2-859, fails to stop and remain stopped until all such persons are clear of the highway, private road, or school driveway and the bus is put in motion is subject to a civil penalty of $250, and any prosecution shall be ins tituted and conducted in the same manner as prosecutions for traffic infractions.A prosecution or proceeding under § 46.2-859 is a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under this section for the same act, and a prosecution or proceeding under this secti on is a bar to a prosecution or proceeding under § 46.2-859 for the same act.In any prosecution for which a summons charging a violation of this section was issued within 10 days of the alleged violation, proof that the motor vehicle described in the summons was operated in violation of this section, together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such violation the registered owner of the vehicle, as required by Chapter 6 (§ 46.2-600 et seq.) shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person who operated the vehicle at the place where, and for the time during which, the violation occurred. Such presumption shall be rebutted if (i) the owner of the vehicle files an affidavit by regular m ail with the clerk of the general district court that he was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation, (ii) the owner testifies in open court under oath that he was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged vi olation, or (iii) a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation of this section is presented prior to the return date established on the summons issued pu rsuant to this section to the court adjudicating the alleged violation. Nothing herein shall limit the admission of otherwise admissible evidence.The testimony of the school bus driver, the supervisor of school buses, or a law-enforcement officer that th e vehicle was yellow, conspicuously marked as a school bus, and equipped with warning devices as prescribed in § 46.2-1090 is prima facie evidence that the vehicle is a school bus. B. 1. For purposes of this subsection, video-monitoring system means a system with one or more camera sensors and computers installed and operated on a school bus that produces live digital and recorded video of motor vehicles being operated in violation of § 46.2-859. All such systems installed shall, at a minimum, produce a recor ded image of the license plate and shall record the activation status of at least one warning device as prescribed in § 46.2-1090 and the time, date, and location of the vehicle when the image is recorded. 2. A locality may, by ordinance, authorize the school division of the locality to install and operate a video-monitoring system in or on the school buses operated by the division or to co ntract with a private vendor to do so on behalf of the school division for the purpose of recording violations of subsection A. Such ordinance may direct that any civil penalty levied for a violation of subsection A shall be payable to the local school d ivision. In any locality that has adopted such an ordinance, a summons for a violation of subsection A may be executed as provided in § 19.2-76.2 and, notwithstanding the provisions of § 19.2-76, the summons may be executed by mailing by first-clas s mail a copy thereof to the address of the owner of the vehicle contained in the records of the Department. Every such mailing shall include, in addition to the summons, a notice of (i) the summoned persons ability to rebut the presumption that he w as the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation through the filing of an affidavit as provided in subsection A and (ii) instructions for filing such an affidavit, including the address to which the affidavit is to be sent. If the summ oned person fails to appear on the date of return set out in the summons mailed pursuant to this section, the summons shall be executed in the manner set out in § 19.2-76.3. No proceedings for contempt or arrest of a person summoned by mailing shall b e instituted for failure to appear on the return date of the summons. Any summons executed for violation of this section shall provide to the person summoned at least 30 business days from the mailing of the summons to inspect information collected by a video-monitoring system in connection with the violation. 3. Any private vendor contracting with a school division pursuant to this subsection may impose and collect an administrative fee in addition to the civil penalty imposed for a violation of subsection A and payable pursuant to this subsection, so as to recover the expenses of collecting any unpaid civil penalty when such penalty remains due more than 30 days after the date of the mailing of the summons and notice. The administrative fee shall be reasonably related to the actual cost of collecting the civil penalty and shall not exceed $100 per violation. The operator of the vehicle shall pay the unpaid civil penalty and any administrative fee detailed in a notice or citation issued by t he private vendor. If paid no later than 60 days after the date of the mailing of the summons and notice, the administrative fee shall not exceed $25. 4. Any private vendor contracting with a school division pursuant to this subsection may enter into an agreement with the Department of Motor Vehicles, in accordance with the provisions o f subdivision B 30 of § 46.2-208, to obtain vehicle owner information regarding the registered owners of vehicles that improperly pass stopped school buses. Information provided to such private vendor shall be protected in a database with security com parable to that of the Department of Motor Vehicles system and used only for enforcement against individuals who violate the provisions of this section. The school division shall annually certify compliance with this subdivision and make all records pertaining to such system available for inspection and audit by the Commissioner of Highways or the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles or their designee. Any person who discloses personal information in violation of the provisions of this s ubdivision shall be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 per disclosure.

Except wher e turning is prohibited, a driver intending to turn at an intersection or other location on any highway shall execute the turn as provided in this section. 1. Right turns: Both the approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close as practicable to the right curb or edge of the roadway. 2. Left turns on two-way roadways: At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both directions on each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left turn shall b e made from the right half of the roadway and as close as possible to the roadways center line, passing to the right of the center line where it enters the intersection. After entering the intersection, the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the roadway being entered.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Impossibility of going aroun d medial lines.  Under this section, the driver of a vehicle, in making a left turn, is not required to go around the intersection of the medial lines of two streets where it is p hysically impossible to do so. Birtcherds Dairy v. Randall, 180 Va. 311, 23 S.E.2d 229, 1942 Va. LEXIS 172 (1942). Impossibility of making left turn from extreme left-hand lane.  A reasonable construction of former subdivision (c) (see now subdivision A 3) of this section requires the driver to approach the intersection for the purpose of making a left turn in the extreme left-hand lane or as nearly therein as reasonably possible, using a degree of care commensurate with the hazards involved. Certainly the statute did not intend to impose an impossible duty upon the driver of licensed equ ipment. Asphalt Serv. Co. v. Thomas, 198 Va. 490, 95 S.E.2d 141, 1956 Va. LEXIS 233 (1956). Under the provisions of former subdivision (c) (see now subdivision A 3) of this section a driver intending to make a left turn need not approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand lane when to do so would make the turn impossible. Asphalt Serv. Co. v. Thomas, 198 Va. 490, 95 S.E.2d 141, 1956 Va. LEXIS 233 (1956). Violation of section con stitutes negligence.  See Hershman v. Payne, 196 Va. 241, 83 S.E.2d 418, 1954 Va. LEXIS 217 (1954). Violation of former subdivision (b) (see now subdivision A 2) constituted negligence per se, justifying a verdict for plaintiff if it were a proximate cause of he r injury. White v. Gore, 201 Va. 239, 110 S.E.2d 228, 1959 Va. LEXIS 217 (1959). Where the evidence showed that defendants car made a left turn at an intersection and when it stopped it was not as close as practicable to the right-hand cur b or edge of the street it was entering, and thus was being driven in violation of this section, the defendant was guilty of negligence. And the evidence further showing that if defendant had observed the statute the plaintiff, a pedestrian, would not ha ve been in the path of the car, the jury had a right to believe that the violation of the statute was the proximate cause of the injury to plaintiff. Sanders v. Newsome, 179 Va. 582, 19 S.E.2d 883, 1942 Va. LEXIS 250 (1942). The plaintiff violated this section, and consequently was negligent. Clausen v. Virginia Transit Co., 211 Va. 557, 179 S.E.2d 463, 1971 Va. LEXIS 215 (1971). Viol ation of section held contributing cause of accident.  While action of operator of bus in cutting the corner at an intersection in violation of this section may not have been sole proximate cause of accident, it was competent evidence upon which to base a verdict that it was a contributing and efficient cause of the accident. VEPCO v. Clark, 179 Va. 596, 19 S.E.2d 693, 1942 Va. LEXIS 251 (1942). Evidence held to show compliance with this section. Hopkins v. Pearce, 115 F.2d 784, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 2991 (4th Cir. 1940). Instruction held not harmless error.  Where the trial court committed prejudicial error in a suit brought for personal injuries suffered in a pedestrian-truck accident when it instructed the jury that it was the duty of the pickup truck driver, who was turning left from the eastbound lane of a two-way street, to enter the northbound lane of the two-way, four-lane, street onto which he was turning in the left lane of the two northbound lanes when in f act all that was necessary was for the driver to pass to the right of the center line of the roadway onto which the left turn is made, such error was not harmless since the instruction permitted the jury to find the driver guilty of negligence for breach ing a duty the law does not impose upon him.

After proceeding across the intersecting roadway, the rider shall comply with traffic signs or signals and continue his turn as close as practicable to the right curb or edge of the roadway b eing entered. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the Commissioner of Highways and local authorities, in their respective jurisdictions, may cause official traf fic control devices to be placed at intersections to direct that a specific course be traveled by turning bicycles, electric personal assistive mobility devices, electric power-assisted bicycles, and mopeds. When such devices are so placed, no person sha ll turn a bicycle, electric personal assistive mobility device, electric power-assisted bicycle, or moped other than as directed by such devices.

CASE NOTES Analysis I. General Consideration. II. Turning. III. Stopping. IV. Violation as Negligence. V. Practice and Procedure. I.General Consideration. Editors note.  Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Legislative intent.  When this section and former § 46.1-217 (see now § 46.2-849) are read and construed together, it is evident that the General Assembly intended that a motori st be required to give a signal of his intention to slow down for the purpose of stopping, turning or partly turning from a direct line whenever the operation of any other vehicle may be affected. Wagner v. Fiery, 206 Va. 370, 143 S.E.2d 876, 1965 Va. LE XIS 208 (1965). Sectio n construed with § 46.2-849.  This section and § 46.2-849 are related, deal with the same subject matter, and should be read and construed together. Wagner v. Fiery, 206 Va. 370, 143 S.E.2d 876, 1965 Va. LEXIS 208 (1965). Section 46.2-849 and this section are clear and unambiguous upon their face. Cubbage v. Meadows, 215 Va. 502, 211 S.E.2d 262, 1975 Va. LEXIS 180 (1975). And facilitate traffic flow.  Section 46.2-849 and this section are designed to facilitate the prompt, safe and orderly flow of traffic upon our highways. Cubbage v. Meadows, 215 Va. 502, 211 S.E.2d 262, 1975 Va. LEXIS 180 (1975). Driver may presume compliance with section.  Driver following truck had the right to rely on the legal presumption that the truck driver would comply with the provisions of this section. Luck v. Rice, 182 Va . 373, 29 S.E.2d 238, 1944 Va. LEXIS 186 (1944). Where a driver of automobile saw decedent riding his bicycle on the shoulder of the road, he had a right to assume that decedent would not turn off the shoulder i nto the highway without first complying with the provisions of this section. Laubach v. Howell, 194 Va. 670, 74 S.E.2d 794, 1953 Va. LEXIS 133 (1953). But such presumption does not relieve drivers duty to comply.  While the driver of an automobile has the right to assume that the driver of a truck will observe the traffic laws of the State, this does not relieve him (the dr iver of the automobile) of the duty to comply with the mandate of this section. Sink v. Masterson, 191 Va. 618, 61 S.E.2d 863, 1950 Va. LEXIS 245 (1950); Brown v. Peters, 202 Va. 382, 117 S.E.2d 695, 1961 Va. LEXIS 120 (1961). Evidence held to show compliance with this section. Hopkins v. Pearce, 115 F.2d 784, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 2991 (4th Cir. 1940). Facts showing violat ion.  See Walker v. Crosen, 168 Va. 410, 181 S.E. 753 (1937). Plaintiff was guilty of negligence when he backed his vehicle toward oncoming traffic without exercising reasonable care to see that such movement could be made i n safety, and this negligence on his part was a proximate cause of the crash. Clark v. Parks, 213 Va. 744, 195 S.E.2d 859, 1973 Va. LEXIS 222 (1973). Reasonable suspicion of violation sufficient to conduct traffic stop.  Trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to suppress because a police officer had reasonable suspicion of a violation of the statute sufficient to conduct a traffic stop of the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger; while the officer did not testify that the drivers failure to provide a turn signal actually affected the movement of his vehicle in any way, he only had to testify that it co uld have affected the movement of his vehicle. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 59 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 24, 2015). Officers observation that other vehicles may be affected by an un-signaled turn is a necessary component of a violation of, and thus, reasonable suspicion of a violation of the statute; a suspected violation of the statute requires an officer to not only observe a motorist fail to use a signal but also observe that the motorists failure to use that signal may have affected other vehicles on the road. Wils on v. Commonwealth, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 59 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 24, 2015). II.Turning. This section and § 46.2-825 must be read together. Southers v. Price, 211 Va. 469, 178 S.E.2d 685, 1971 Va. LEXIS 193 (1971). Where a collision occurred when one vehicle made a left turn across the path of an approaching vehicle at an intersection, this section must be read and considere d conjunctively with former § 46.1-222 (see now § 46.2-825) which requires a left turning driver to yield the right-of-way to other vehicles within or approaching the point of turn. Southers v. Price, 211 Va. 469, 178 S.E.2d 685, 1971 Va. LEXIS 193 (1971). No right-of-way created by secti on.  The language [e]very driver who intends to . . . turn or partly turn from a direct line shall first see that such movement can be made in safety and shall give a proper signal whenever the operation of any other vehicle may be affected by such movement does not establish a right-of-way for the benefit of the other vehicle affected by such movement. Perkins v. Carr, 227 Va. 16, 313 S.E.2d 372, 1984 Va. LEXIS 262 (1984). The words made in safety are measured by the rule of reason and the ordinary rul e of human conduct under existing conditions. VEPCO v. Holland, 184 Va. 893, 37 S.E.2d 40, 1946 Va. LEXIS 153 (1946). Dr ivers duty when action may affect other vehicle.  Whenever a driver intends to perform one of the acts mentioned in former § 46.1-217 (see now § 46.2-849) and this section and sees, in the exercise of reaso nable care, that such act is likely to affect the operation of another vehicle, the law imposes a duty upon that driver to give the requisite signal and the fact that he has the right-of-way does not relieve him of that duty. Cubbage v. Meadows, 215 Va. 502, 211 S.E.2d 262, 1975 Va. LEXIS 180 (1975). A driver undertaking to turn is not an insurer of the safe execution thereof.  The driver of an automobile undertaking to turn across the path of oncoming traffic must be vigilant and observant, but he is not an insurer of the safe execution thereof and is held only to reasonable care to see that such is safely done. Smith v. Clark, 187 Va. 181, 46 S.E.2d 21, 1948 Va. LEXIS 210 (1948) (holding that any instruction using the words of this section must be qualified with appropriate language r elieving the driver of the burden of insuring the safety of his turn. See).Oliver v. Forsyth, 190 Va. 710, 58 S.E.2d 49, 1950 Va. LEXIS 162 (1950). But he must us e reasonable and ordinary care.  While this section does not make a driver an insurer of the safety of his turn, he must use reasonable and ordinary care under the circumstances to see that such movement can be made safely. Matthews v. Hicks, 197 Va. 112, 87 S.E.2d 629, 1955 Va. LEXIS 202 (1955). This section does not make the driver an insurer of the safety of his turn. Instead he is held merely to the use of reasonable and ordinary care under the circums tances to see that such movement can be made safely. Fisher v. Gordon, 210 Va. 523, 171 S.E.2d 835, 1970 Va. LEXIS 156 (1970). And keep a reasonable lookout for oncoming vehicles.  Implicit in the requirement of the use of reasonable and ordinary care to see that a turn can be made with safety is the duty to keep a reasonable lookout for onc oming vehicles and to see any such vehicles approaching in plain view. Von Roy v. Whitescarver, 197 Va. 384, 89 S.E.2d 346, 1955 Va. LEXIS 232 (1955); Brown v. Peters, 202 Va. 382, 117 S.E.2d 695, 1961 Va. LEXIS 120 (1961). A driver of a motor vehicle is under the absolute duty to see an oncoming vehicle which is in such plain view that, looking with reasonable care, he is bound to h ave seen it. Unger v. Rackley, 205 Va. 520, 138 S.E.2d 1, 1964 Va. LEXIS 212 (1964); Hogan v. Carter, 226 Va. 361, 310 S.E.2d 666, 1983 Va. LEXIS 293 (1983). Underlying the statutory duties imposed by this section and former § 46.1-222 (now § 46.2-825) is the common-law duty to maintain a reasonable lookout for o ther traffic. Hogan v. Carter, 226 Va. 361, 310 S.E.2d 666, 1983 Va. LEXIS 293 (1983). In a case brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.S. §§ 2671-2680, in which the district court entered judgment in favor of the United States, t he district court erred in determining that a government employee was not negligent in operating her vehicle, and that a second driver was contributorily negligent, thus barring her recovery. In making a turn, the government employee did not yield to the second driver, who was in oncoming traffic, and, contrary to the district courts assertion, Virginia law did not require the second driver, who had the right-of-way, to slow or stop prior to entering the intersection. Cary v. United States, 343 Fed. Appx. 926, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 19480 (4th Cir. 2009). Driver turning left must exercise ordinary care in the discharge of the duties conjuncti vely imposed upon him by this section and former § 46.1-222 (now § 46.2-825). Hogan v. Carter, 226 Va. 361, 310 S.E.2d 666, 1983 Va. LEXIS 293 (1983). No require ment of constant looking to the rear.  In discharging the duty of reasonable care under this section, there was no legal requirement for plaintiff constantly to look to the rear after he had given a co rrect signal of his intention to turn in plain view of the drivers of any following vehicles. Neighbors v. Moore, 216 Va. 514, 219 S.E.2d 692...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-849"><akn:num>§ 46.2-849</akn:num><akn:heading>How signals given</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Signals req uired by § 46.2-848 shall be given by means of the hand and arm or by some mechanical or electrical device approved by the Superintendent, in the manner specified in this section. Whenever the signal is given by means of the hand and arm, the driver s hall indicate his intention to start, stop, turn, or partly turn by extending the hand and arm beyond the left side of the vehicle in the manner following: 1. For l eft turn or to pull to the left, the arm shall be extended in a horizontal position straight from and level with the shoulder; 2. For right turn or to pull to the right, the arm shall be extended upward; 3. For slowing down or stopping, the arm shall be extended downward. B. Wherever th e lawful speed is more than 35 miles per hour, such signals shall be given continuously for a distance of at least 100 feet, and in all other cases at least 50 feet, before slowing down, stopping, turning, or partly turning. C. A person ri ding a bicycle, electric personal assistive mobility device, electric power-assisted bicycle, moped, or motorized skateboard or scooter shall signal his intention to stop or turn. Such signals, however, need not be given continuously if both hands are ne eded in the control or operation of the bicycle, electric personal assistive mobility device, electric power-assisted bicycle, moped, or motorized skateboard or scooter. D.

The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section and former § 46.1-213 (see now § 46.2-816) create reciprocal duties o n the part of leading and following drivers. Mandro v. Vibbert, 170 F.2d 540, 1948 U.S. App. LEXIS 2686 (4th Cir. 1948). Former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848) and this section are clear and unambiguous upon their face. Cubbage v. Meadows, 215 Va. 502, 211 S.E.2d 262, 1975 Va. LEXIS 180 (1975). Former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848) and this section are designed to facilitate the prompt, safe and orderly flow of traffic upon our highways. Cubbage v. Meadows, 215 Va. 502, 211 S.E.2d 262, 1975 Va. LEXIS 180 (1975). Stopping prior to left turn does not require additional signal.  Whenever a motorist gives a signal of his intention to turn left from a direct line of travel into another highway, the driver of a following vehicle is put on no tice that it may become necessary for the driver signaling a left turn to stop before entering the intersection to yield the right-of-way to traffic proceeding from the opposite direction. He is not required to give any further notice. Montague v. Rucker , 204 Va. 612, 132 S.E.2d 726, 1963 Va. LEXIS 194 (1963). The words slowing down must be given a reasonable construction. They were never intended to apply where a motorist slightly reduces his speed on a highway by easing up on the accelerator without any present intention of stopping, turning or partly turning from a direct line. Wagner v. Fiery, 206 Va. 370, 143 S.E.2d 876, 1965 Va. LEX IS 208 (1965). Drivers duty whe n action affects other vehicle.  Whenever a driver intends to perform one of the acts mentioned in former § 46.1-216 (see now § 46.2-848) and this section and sees, in the exercise of reaso nable care, that such act is likely to affect the operation of another vehicle, the law imposes a duty upon that driver to give the requisite signal and the fact that he has the right-of-way does not relieve him of that duty. Cubbage v. Meadows, 215 Va. 502, 211 S.E.2d 262, 1975 Va. LEXIS 180 (1975). Driver of a front car is not required to be constantly on the lookout for a following vehicle. Brown v. Wright, 216 Va. 10, 216 S.E.2d 13, 1975 Va. LEXIS 240 (1975). Violation of section con stitutes negligence.  See Hershman v. Payne, 196 Va. 241, 83 S.E.2d 418, 1954 Va. LEXIS 217 (1954). Erroneous instruction.  An instruction was erroneous in that it told the jury that the driver could assume that no car was traveling or stopped behind her until she was made aware by sig nal or otherwise, because it disregarded the drivers common-law duty to keep a proper lookout and her statutory duty to see that she could start or stop with reasonable safety before doing so, if such movement affected the operation of another car. D alton v. Lawhorne, 212 Va. 530, 186 S.E.2d 90, 1972 Va.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The essence of the offense of reckless driving lies not in the act of operating a vehicl e, but in the manner and circumstances of its operation. Powers v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 386, 177 S.E.2d 628, 1970 Va. LEXIS 256 (1970); Kennedy v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 469, 339 S.E.2d 905, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (1986). It is the commonality of the underlying offending conduct, the continuous, uninterrupted operation of a motor vehicle, that invokes the preclusive effect of this section. Harris v. City of Va. Beach, 19 Va. App. 214, 450 S.E.2d 401, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 670 (1994). Reckless driving is not used with reference to law of torts.  Reckless driving as used in this section and former § 46.1-190 (see now §§ 46.2-853 through 46.2-864) is a class name used to demonstrate that cl ass of violations of the provisions of the motor vehicle laws for which the General Assembly deemed it proper to provide somewhat heavier minimum penalties than are provided for other violations of its provisions. It is not used with reference to the law of torts. Morris v. Dame's Ex'r, 161 Va. 545, 171 S.E. 662, 1933 Va. LEXIS 346 (1933). Recklessly as used in this section imparts a disregard by the driver of a motor vehicle for the consequences of his act and an indifference to the safety of life, limb or property. Powers v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 386, 177 S.E.2d 628, 1970 Va. LEXIS 256 (1970). When manslaughter implicated.  Violation of this section is insufficient to bring the negligent act within the common law definition of manslaughter unless it is so flagrant, culpable, and want on as to show utter disregard of the safety of others under circumstances likely to cause injury. Conrad v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 661, 514 S.E.2d 364, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 270, different results reached on reh'g, 31 Va. App. 113, 521 S.E.2d 321, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 652 (1999). Defendants speed alone constituted reckless driving under the circumstances that existed on the night of October 11, 2018, and his conduct in passing Medic 6 and Rescue 6 constituted reckless driving; defendant knew or should have known that his acts and omissions created a substantial risk of harm to others and that he displayed a reckless disregard for the consequences of his conduct and an indifference to the safety of others. Labarge v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2022). Relevance of statutory presumptions under § 18.2-269.  Once the prosecution introduces evidence of a particular breath test level in a reckless driving case under § 46.2-852, the blood alcohol presumptions found in § 18.2-269 become relevant for the prosecution and the defendant, and the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on the statutory presumptions. Burnside v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 152 (Va. Ct. App. May 14, 2013). One zigzagging old car at fast rate of speed is guilty of reckless driving.  One who drives an old, worn automobile at a fast rate of speed, and at the same time deliberately zigzags it back and forth across the road, over the objections and remonstrances of an occupant, is operating it in a manner so as to endanger, or be likely to endanger, the life and limb of the occupants thereof, and hence is guilty of reckless driving within the meaning of this section. Salyer v. Co mmonwealth, 165 Va. 744, 181 S.E. 435, 1935 Va. LEXIS 327 (1935). As is one crossing crest of hill at excessive speed.  Where plaintiff, who was familiar with highway, approached crest of a hill, which obscured the view beyond, at a speed of approximately 55 miles per hour, and saw defendants automobile approaching, whereupon plaintiff applied his brakes and skidded into defendants automobile, it was held that plaintiff crossed crest of hill at an unwarranted rate of speed, under the facts and circumstances, and that the c oncurring, if not the proximate, cause of the accident was his violation of this section. Noland v. Fowler, 179 Va. 19, 18 S.E.2d 251, 1942 Va. LEXIS 192 (1942). Or one f ailing to slow down upon approaching settlement.  It was the duty of a driver under this section when he reached a settlement, where persons were likely to be assembled and where children were apt to be, to slow down and have his car under such control as to be able to stop if confronted by a sudden emergency. Sheckler v. Anderson, 182 Va. 701, 29 S.E.2d 867, 1944 Va. LEXIS 222 (1944) (holding that where there is a failure to comply with this section, the defend ant is liable for injuries resulting from a collision, unless the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence). Driving in wrong lane.  Where plaintiffs evidence tended to indicate that the defendants truck was being driven in the wrong lane, a reasonable jury could infer failure to mainta in a proper lookout, to keep the vehicle under proper control, or to operate the vehicle in a manner so as not to endanger the life or property of any person. Krizak v. W.C. Brooks &amp; Sons, 320 F.2d 37, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4777 (4th Cir. 1963). Road not open to public.  Where there was no evidence whatsoever that the road defendant was driving on, when he was charged with reckless driving, was open to anyone other than those pers ons who lived on it and their invitees, the court held that the road was not a highway within the contemplation of this section. Moore v. Commonwealth, No. 0687-88-1 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 17, 1989). Dist inction between reckless driving and other offenses.  What distinguishes a speeding violation from the misdemeanor of reckless driving, and the misdemeanor from the felony of involuntary manslaughter, is the likeliho od of injury to other users of the highways. And the degree of the hazard posed by a speeding automobile depends upon the circumstances in each case. Mayo v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 644, 238 S.E.2d 831, 1977 Va. LEXIS 301 (1977). Case-by-case decision whether acts can produce multiple convictions without violating sections.  For a case indicating that courts will decide, case by case, whether particular acts in violation of § 46.2-817 and this section can produce multiple convictio ns without violating § 19.2-294 or § 19.2-294.1, see Lash v. County of Henrico, 13 Va. App. 251, 410 S.E.2d 689, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1136, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (1991), overruled, Hall v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 892, 421 S.E.2d 455, 9 Va. Law Rep. 5 4, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 210 (1992). The mere happening of an accident does not give rise to an inference of reckless driving . Powers v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 386, 177 S.E.2d 628, 1970 Va. LEXIS 256 (1970); Kennedy v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 469, 339 S.E.2d 905, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (1986). Failure of two drivers approaching each other to turn to their right convicts both of ne gligence and is in violation of this section, when they met on a clear night on a four-lane highway and each drove his vehicle so near the center of the highway that neither could pass the other in safety. Via v. Badanes, 189 Va. 44, 52 S.E.2d 174, 1949 Va. LEXIS 147 (1949). Conviction for both reckless driving and driving while intoxicated.  Where the facts showed that defendant was driving while intoxicated, in violation of § 18.2-266, and second, that he was driving recklessly, in violation of th is section, he could be convicted of both offenses. Hundley v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 449, 69 S.E.2d 336, 1952 Va. LEXIS 153 (1952), overruled in part, Evans v. Commonwealth, 299 Va. 330, 850 S.E.2d 669, 2020 Va. LEXIS 140 (2020). Falling asleep while driving.  Anyone who falls asleep while operating an automobile on a public road is guilty of a degree of negligence exceeding the lack of ordinary care. To fall asleep whi le operating an automobile manifests a disregard by the driver for the consequences of his act and an indifference to life, limb or property sufficient to find the operator guilty of the offense of reckless driving. Kennedy v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 46 9, 339 S.E.2d 905, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (1986). Where defendant had been up for 22 hours without sleep, chose to drive his vehicle, and caught himself drifting off four or five times, it could be inferred that he had the requisite knowledge that his behavior would probably injure another, such that the behavior rose to the level of criminal negligence.

Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The driver of a vehicle has a duty to use ordinary care to keep his vehicle under proper control. Meeks v. Hodges, 226 Va. 106, 306 S.E.2d 879, 1983 Va. LEXIS 274 (1983); Kennedy v. Commonwealth, 1 Va. App. 469, 339 S.E.2d 905, 1986 Va. App. LEXIS 225 (1986). Dist inction between reckless driving and other offenses.  What distinguishes a speeding violation from the misdemeanor of reckless driving, and the misdemeanor from the felony of involuntary manslaughter, is the likeliho od of injury to other users of the highways. And the degree of the hazard posed by a speeding automobile depends upon the circumstances in each case. Mayo v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 644, 238 S.E.2d 831, 1977 Va. LEXIS 301 (1977). When violation c onstitutes felonious negligence.  A violation of the reckless driving statutes does not constitute felonious negligence unless it is so flagrant, culpable, and wanton as to show utter disregard of the safety of others under circumstances likely to cause injury. Mayo v. Commonwealth, 218 Va. 644, 238 S.E.2d 831, 1977 Va. LEXIS 301 (1977). Reckless driving and involuntary manslaughter are two separate and distinct offenses, al though arising out of the same occurrence. The lesser offense is not included within the other. Delawder v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 55, 196 S.E.2d 913, 1973 Va. LEXIS 254 (1973). Contributory negligence righ tly inferred.  The trial judge was entitled to infer from one defendants violation of former § 46.1-213 (see now § 46.2-816) and this section which constitute negligen ce and the fact that she had not stopped when only a few feet from plaintiff, although, like the other defendant, she had more time than plaintiff in which to act, that her negligence contributed to the collision. Cohen v. Boxberger, 544 F.2d 701, 1976 U .S. App. LEXIS 6998 (4th Cir. 1976). The word proper used in this section is not an absolute but a relative word. It means appropriate or suitable. Voight v. Reber, 187 Va. 157, 46 S.E.2d 15, 1948 Va. LEXIS 208 (1948). Driving in wrong lane.  See same catchline in note to § 46.2-852. Evidence held to show violations with respect to speed and proper control, where it appe ared that his car skidded 96´ and struck plaintiff after she had crossed the paved surface and the shoulder and was in the ditch and that defendant knew that the place was a bus stop. Rhoades v. Meadows, 189 Va. 558, 54 S.E.2d 123, 1949 Va. LEXIS 199 (1949). Reasonable suspicion to justify stop.  Police investigators did not have reasonable suspicion to justify a stop of defendant for recklessly failing to control a vehicle, when, after the investigators w ho were trailing defendants vehicle activated their signals, defendant almost stood up in defendants vehicle, sped up without exceeding the speed limit, weaved within defendants lane of traffic, and traveled over one-and-a-half blocks before pulling over. The suppression of the evidence found in defendants vehicle following the stop was, therefore, appropriate. Commonwealth v. Augustus, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 11, 2016). Instruction.  This section requires that a vehicle shall be driven under proper control, which words have been correctly held to furnish a standard to guide the jury in applying the evidence. Thus the following instruction was held to constitute error: The court instructs the jury that the law of Virginia expressly prohibits any person from driving an automobile in such a manner as not to have the same under comple te control at all times, and declares that driving an automobile under such conditions will be deemed reckless driving. Keatts v. Shelton, 191 Va. 758, 63 S.E.2d 10, 1951 Va. LEXIS 134 (1951). Notice of steering defect.  The law does not impose the duty upon a driver to keep his automobile under complete control at all times. However, where driver knew, prior to accident, that the re was a problem with his steering, because he had previously experienced difficulty keeping his vehicle under control, the trial court could have found that he was on notice of a defect in his vehicle that could interfere with his ability to maintain pr oper control, but that he continued to operate his vehicle despite this defect.

This section was intended to prevent a collision between two meeting vehicles approachin g each other on the crest of a hill and driving across or too close to the center line of the highway. Petcosky v. Bowman, 197 Va. 240, 89 S.E.2d 4, 1955 Va. LEXIS 217 (1955). Violation constituting gross n egligence.  See Steele v. Crocker, 191 Va. 873, 62 S.E.2d 850, 1951 Va. LEXIS 143 (1951). Probable cause to arrest.  Circuit court did not err in denying defendants motion to suppress because officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for an earlier offense of reckless driving, thereby also meeting the lesser standard of reasonable suspicion to detain him to investigate that same offense; probable cause to arrest did not grow stale during the less than three hours that passed between when a detective saw defendant driv ing recklessly and when she seized him in a convenience store parking lot.

LEXIS 189 (1940). Instruction.  It was not error to instruct the jury in the language of this section that a driver was under a duty not to pass another vehicle at the crest of a hill. The conte ntion that the subdivision had no application to a four-lane highway was without merit since the road, in fact a four-lane highway, had recently been resurfaced and the usual white lines indicating the lanes of traffic had not been painted on the surface .

CASE NOTES Sufficient evidence of traveli ng abreast.  Where evidence supported the trial courts conclusion that the east-bound lane of avenue on which appellant was driving was designed for one vehicle and office r testified that while a mail truck was stopped at an intersection and as another vehicle was still approaching the intersection, appellant pulled to his right and passed both vehicles in the space normally used for parking on the avenue; evidence suppor ted the trial courts conclusion that appellant drove his car so as to travel abreast of another vehicle and therefore supported conviction of improper driving in violation of this section.

Annotations CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section is directed against cars running abreast at intersection.  The situation against which, among other things, the prescription of this section is directed, is that of two cars running abreast at an intersection. Holland v. Edelblute, 179 Va. 685, 20 S.E.2d 506, 1942 Va. LEXIS 264 (1942). This section was designed to prevent action which causes two vehicles to run abreast at an intersection. Boyd v. Diggs, 215 Va. 560, 211 S.E.2d 97, 1975 Va. LEXIS 189 (1975). Overtake in this section means to catch up with while in pursuit or motion. Boyd v. Diggs, 215 Va. 560, 211 S.E.2d 97, 1975 Va. LEXIS 189 (1975). Pass in this section means to go by or move past. Boyd v. Diggs, 215 Va. 560, 21 1 S.E.2d 97, 1975 Va. LEXIS 189 (1975). This section proscribes overtaking or passing at not in an intersection of highways. In, of course, means a location within the statutory boundary of the intersection. At indicates presence in, on or near. Near, in this context, means within a reasonable distance, which distance depends on the particu lar facts and circumstances of each case. Boyd v. Diggs, 215 Va. 560, 211 S.E.2d 97, 1975 Va. LEXIS 189 (1975). Right to assume that other driver will not violate this section.  Until there was something to put him upon notice to the contrary, a motorist had a right to assume that no driver approaching from his rear would follow his truck more closely than is reasonable and prudent under the circumstances obtaining, former § 46.1-213 (see now § 46.2-816), or violate the provision of this section, which forbids a driver proceeding in the same direction from passing him a t any intersection of highways. Hershman v. Payne, 196 Va. 241, 83 S.E.2d 418, 1954 Va. LEXIS 217 (1954). Pull ing around car at intersection violates this section.  Driver who pulled around the car ahead of him at an intersection, even though he did not completely pass, violated the terms of this section. Holland v. Edelblute , 179 Va. 685, 20 S.E.2d 506, 1942 Va. LEXIS 264 (1942). Police must observe this section while apprehending law violators.  This section must be observed by the operators of police vehicles even while engaged in the apprehension of law violators. White v. Doe, 207 Va. 276, 148 S.E.2d 7 97, 1966 Va. LEXIS 216 (1966). Failure to return to proper lane before entering intersection.  Where evidence showed that plaintiff had passed another southbound car and had not got back into his own lane before entering the intersection, where the collisio n occurred, plaintiff violated this section and former § 46.1-205 (see now § 46.2-803), and was guilty of negligence proximately causing the accident. Loving v. Mason, 206 Va. 613, 145 S.E.2d 131, 1965 Va. LEXIS 242 (1965). Exception as to multi-lane highways held inapplicable.  The exception pertaining to highway with two or more lanes in each direction was not applicable to exonerate defendant from negligence where, on a city street, de fendant blindly and at excessive speed passed a truck which was stopped in the outside lane and which obstructed defendants view of the intersection. Mills v. Wells, 204 Va. 173, 129 S.E.2d 705, 1963 Va.

The driver of a vehicle, however, need not stop when approaching a school bus if the school bus is stopped on the other roadway of a divided highway, on an access road, or on a driveway when the other roadway, access road, or driveway is separated from the roadway on which he is driving by a physical barrier or an unpaved area. The driver of a vehicle also need not stop when approaching a school bus which is loading or discharging passe ngers from or onto property immediately adjacent to a school if the driver is directed by a law-enforcement officer or other duly authorized uniformed school crossing guard to pass the school bus. This section shall apply to school buses which are equipp ed with warning devices prescribed in § 46.2-1090 and are painted yellow with the words School Bus in black letters at least eight inches high on the front and rear thereof. Only school buses which are painted yellow and equipped with the requ ired lettering and warning devices shall be identified as school buses. The testimony of the school bus driver, the supervisor of school buses or a law-enforcement officer that the vehicle was yellow, conspicuously marked as a school bus, a nd equipped with warning devices as prescribed in § 46.2-1090 is prima facie evidence that the vehicle is a school bus.

The 2011 amendments by cc. 325 and 326 are identical, and in the first sentence of the first paragraph, substituted driving a motor vehicle shall stop such ve hicle for is guilty of reckless driving who fails to stop, and shall remain stopped for and to remain stopped, and added any person violating the foregoing is guilty of reckless driving at the end.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section applies only where school bus is stopped for the purpose of taking on or discharging school children. Thus it was not applicable where a school bus stopped because of a road barricade, even though a school child was discharged from the bus while it was so stopped. County Sch. Bd. v. Thomas, 201 Va. 608, 112 S.E.2d 87 7, 1960 Va. LEXIS 136 (1960). The burden is on the Commonwealth to show that the school bus was properly marked or identified in a prosecution under this section. Until that fact is shown, defendant is not required to explain or offer evidence of innocence. Moore v. Commonwealth, 202 Va. 667, 119 S.E.2d 324, 1961 Va. LEXIS 162 (1961) (decided prior to the 1964 ame ndment which made changes in this section). Denial of right to cross-examine.  It was erroneous and prejudicial for the trial court, in a prosecution under this section, to deny the defendant the right to cross-examine the Commonwealths witnesses as to whether the bus was properly marked and to refuse to allow counsel for defendant to argue before the jury that in order to convict, it was necessary that the jury find that the school bus was marked in accordance with required regulations .

Annotations Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Automobiles, § 17. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Disregard of caution signs.  Caution signs are not speed limitation signs, and disregard of them is not an independent violation of traffic regulations apart from the duty imposed by this sec tion to operate ones automobile at a speed reasonable under the circumstances. Garst v. Obenchain, 196 Va. 664, 85 S.E.2d 207, 1955 Va. LEXIS 137 (1955). Driving behind truck.  Driver did not violate this section and was not guilty of negligence as a matter of law in driving within the statutory speed limit behind a truck whose operator had not communicated any intention of changing his course. Elswick v. Collins, 194 Va. 292, 72 S.E.2d 626, 1952 Va. LEXIS 231 (1952). When manslaughter implicated.  Defendants speed alone constituted reckless driving under the circumstances that existed on the night of October 11, 2018, and his conduct in passing Medic 6 and Rescue 6 constituted reckless driving; defendant knew or should have known that his acts and omissions created a substantial risk of harm to others and that he displayed a reckless disregard for the consequences of his conduct and an indifference to the safety of others. Labarge v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 43 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 22, 2022). Instruction under this section was properly refused where there was no evidence of exces sive speed. Baker v. Richardson, 201 Va. 834, 114 S.E.2d 599, 1960 Va. LEXIS 167 (1960). Where the evidence shows that a defendant at the time of a collision was not exceeding the applicable speed limit, but leaves it in doubt whether he was neverthel ess driving at a speed unreasonable under the circumstances, the instruction to the jury should make it clear that it is the latter matter they are to consider; and it is inadvisable in such case to refer to lawful speed. Dugroo v. Garrett, 203 V a. 918, 128 S.E.2d 303, 1962 Va. LEXIS 237 (1962). § 46.2-861.1. Drivers to yield right-of-way or reduce speed when approaching stationary vehicles displaying certain warning lights on highways; penalties. Text A. The driver of any motor vehicle, upon approaching a stationary vehicle that is displaying a flashing, blinking, or alternating blue, red, or amber light or lights as provided in § 46.2-1022, 46.2-1023, or 46.2-1024 or subsection B of § 46.2-1026 shall (i) on a highway having at least four lanes, at least two of which are intended for traffic proceeding as the approaching vehicle, proceed with caution and, if reasonable, with due regard for safety and traffic conditions, yield the right-of-way by making a lan e change into a lane not adjacent to the stationary vehicle or (ii) if changing lanes would be unreasonable or unsafe, proceed with due caution and maintain a safe speed for highway conditions. A violation of any provision of this subsection is reckless driving. B. The driver of any motor vehicle, upon approaching a stationary vehicle that is displaying a flashing, blinking, or alternating amber light or lights as provided in subdivision A 1 or 2 of § 46.2-1025 shall (i) on a highway having at least four lanes, at least tw o of which are intended for traffic proceeding as the approaching vehicle, proceed with caution and, if reasonable, with due regard for safety and traffic conditions, yield the right-of-way by making a lane change into a lane not adjacent to the stationa ry vehicle or (ii) if changing lanes would be unreasonable or unsafe, proceed with due caution and maintain a safe speed for highway conditions. A violation of any provision of this subsection shall be punishable as a traffic infraction. C. If the viol ation resulted in damage to property of another person, the court may, in addition, order the suspension of the drivers privilege to operate a motor vehicle for not more than one year. If the violation resulted in injury or death to another person, t he court may, in addition to any other penalty imposed, order the suspension of the drivers privilege to operate a motor vehicle for not more than two years. D. The provisi ons of this section shall not apply in highway work zones as defined in § 46.2-878.1.

CASE NOTES Reckless driving and speeding are separate and distinct offenses; nothing in the languag e of § 19.2-294.1 precludes the Commonwealth or a locality from convicting a person for both DUI and speeding. White v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 410, 494 S.E.2d 896, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 45 (1998). Improper driving not lesser-included offense of reckless driving.  Improper driving, § 46.2-869, was not a lesser-included offense of reckless driving, § 46.2-862, and the trial court properly denied defendants proposed jury instruction that improper driving was lesser-included offense in her reckless driving by speed trial; every commission of reckless driving by speed did not also constitute improper driving, and improper driving was not composed entirely of the elem ents of reckless driving by speed. Further, only the trial judge, or the prosecutor before the verdict was rendered, had the prerogative to reduce a reckless driving charge to improper driving under § 46.2-869. Chibikom v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 42 2, 680 S.E.2d 295, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 351 (2009). Sufficient evidence.  Defendant was properly convicted of reckless driving where evidence of defendants excessive speed was established by a calibration certificate admitted pursua nt to § 46.2-942 and the arresting agents testimony that defendant had been paced for one mile at a speed of 105 mile-per-hour in a 65 miles per hour zone. Taylor v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 159 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 25, 2003). Evidence was sufficient to support defendants conviction of reckless driving by speeding 70 miles per hour in 45 miles-per-hour zone under § 46.2-862 as: ( 1) defendant failed to object to the evidence of defendants speed obtained by pacing; (2) § 46.2-942 clearly contemplated the use of pacing as a method of determining a vehicles speed by authorizing the admission of calibration tests to prove the accuracy of an arresting officers speedometer; and (3) the omission of pacing from the methods for determining speed enumerated in § 46.2-882 did not invalidate it as an appropriate means of proving the speed of the vehicle. Savage v. Commonwe alth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (Va. Ct. App. July 21, 2009). Magistrate was well within his discretion in not reducing defendants crime of conviction of reckless driving to the lesser offense of improper driving; defend ant did not articulate why his degree of culpability was slight. United States v. Walker, 885 F. Supp. 2d 814, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110330 (E.D. Va. 2012). Appellate review.  Because defendants sentences of three months for his reckless driving offense, ten days for his failure to appear charge, and the suspension of his driving p rivileges for six months fell within the statutory ranges, the sentences would not be overturned as being an abuse of discretion, and appellate review was at an end. Defendant did not object to the admission of his driving record or the state trooper s testimony regarding his subsequent failure to appear, and the record established that the trial court determined his sentences after hearing evidence and argument from the Commonwealth and defendant.

Chapman v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 131, 804 S.E.2d 326, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (2017), aff'd, 296 Va. 386, 820 S.E.2d 611, 2018 Va. LEXIS 173 (2018). Sole cause.  If a defendants reckless driving is the only cause of an accident and resulting death, then it necessarily is the proximate cause of the death; thus, reading sole as only renders the latter half of the phrase sole and proximate mere surplusage, and by rendering and proximate meaningless, such an interpretation violates the settled rule of statutory construction that an enactmen t should be interpreted, if possible, in a manner that gives meaning to every word. Chapman v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 131, 804 S.E.2d 326, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (2017), aff'd, 296 Va. 386, 820 S.E.2d 611, 2018 Va. LEXIS 173 (2018). Concept of sole cause recognizes that, even if some act or omission contributes in some way to the occurrence of an event or injury, another act or omission still can be deemed the sole cause of the event or injury.

Victims failure to wear seatbelt.  General Assembly did not intend for a victims failure to wear a seatbelt to relieve a defendant of criminal liability under subsection B; a rear-seat passenge r is under no legal obligation to wear a seat belt because the General Assembly has elected to impose such a requirement only on front-seat passengers. Chapman v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 131, 804 S.E.2d 326, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (2017), aff'd, 296 V a. 386, 820 S.E.2d 611, 2018 Va. LEXIS 173 (2018). Probable cause to arrest.  Circuit court did not err in denying defendants motion to suppress because officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for an earlier offense of reckless driving, thereby also meeting the lesser standard of reasonable suspicion to detain him to investigate that same offense; probable cause to arrest did not grow stale during the less than three hours that passed between when a detective saw defendant driv ing recklessly and when she seized him in a convenience store parking lot.

Joe v. Commonwealth, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 33 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 10, 1995). Proximate result  creates causation element.  In choosing the phrase proximate result, the General Assembly intended to incorporate concepts of proximate causation into the elements of subsection B, a nd the terms are inextricably intertwined, one cannot have a result without a cause or causes; accordingly, in the context of the entire statute, the phrase proximate result creates a causation element. Chapman v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 131, 8 04 S.E.2d 326, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (2017), aff'd, 296 Va. 386, 820 S.E.2d 611, 2018 Va. LEXIS 173 (2018). Reckless d riving sole and proximate cause of accident.  Defendant was properly convicted of felony reckless driving that caused the death of a passenger because the victims failure to wear a seat belt was not a pro ximate cause of his death, leaving defendants reckless driving as the sole and proximate cause of the accident and resulting death; because defendant chose to drive when he knew or should have known that the victim was not wearing his seat be lt, the failure of the victim to wear a seat belt was akin to an attendant circumstance.

Necessity for warrant to charge second offense.  As the original warrant on which defendant was charged with reckless driving did not charge a second offense, and no timely amendment having been made, it was err or for the court to admit the evidence relating to the prior conviction and to instruct the jury regarding the punishment for a second offense. Kincaid v. Commonwealth, 200 Va. 341, 105 S.E.2d 846, 1958 Va. LEXIS 193 (1958) (decided under prior law). § 46.2-868.1. Aggressive driving; penalties. Text A.

Improper driving not a lesser-included offense of reckless driving by speed.  Improper driving, § 46.2-869, was not a lesser-included offense of reckless driving, § 46.2-862, and the trial court properly denied defendants proposed jury instruction that improper driving was lesser-included offense in her reckless driving by speed trial; every commission of reckless driving by speed did not also constitute improper driving, and improper driving was not composed entirely of the elem ents of reckless driving by speed. Further, only the trial judge, or the prosecutor before the verdict was rendered, had the prerogative to reduce a reckless driving charge to improper driving under § 46.2-869. Chibikom v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 42 2, 680 S.E.2d 295, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 351 (2009). Double jeopardy.  There were two distinct victims of the crimes of which defendant was convicted: the victim of the improper driving traffic offense was the Commonwealth, and the v ictim of the unlawful wounding was defendants ex-boyfriend. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendants motion to dismiss the unlawful wounding charge. Moore v. Commonwealth, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 122 (Va. Ct. App. May 1, 2018). Not entitled to jury instruction on improper driving.  Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on improper driving as a lesser-included offense of reckless driving, as the culpability determination for improp er driving was exclusively the prerogative of the trial court, which made no such finding. Blevins v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 628, 762 S.E.2d 396, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 287 (2014). When evidence sufficient.  Where defendant was driving at night with admitted poor night vision, on a secondary road with which he was unfamiliar, and when he approached an unobstructed sto p sign, he skidded through the intersection and down an embankment causing vehicle damage, the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for improper driving. Hale v. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 587, 478 S.E.2d 710, 1996 Va. App. LEXIS 810 (1996). Evidence proved that defendant engaged in improper driving where a police offices testimony that defendants car and another car quickly accelerated from a traffic light side by side and defendants admission that he was playing around while he was accelerating and driving beside the other car were sufficient to prove that the manner and circumstances of defendants driving conduct was unsafe . Bayne v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 114 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 28, 2006). When evidence insufficient.  The mere fact that an accident happened, or that the automobile followed an erratic course for 362´ after it was out of control, does not give rise to an infer ence of reckless driving or of improper driving. Bacon v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 766, 263 S.E.2d 390, 1980 Va. LEXIS 166 (1980) (decided under prior law). Evidence was insufficient to convict defendant for improper driving under § 46.2-869 because, while defendant admitted to having a few beers, the only explanat ion offered at trial was that defendant hit a patch of water and hydroplaned into a median  a sudden emergency  and not defendants negligence or recklessness. Berger v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 76 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2013). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Restitution not applicable.  Juvenile who was found guilty of improper driving could not be ordered to pay restitution because improper driving was a traffic infraction under § 46.2-869, not an offense under § 19.2-303, and was not a crime to which §§ 19.2-305.1 B or 19.2-305 B was applicable. Commonwealth v. Warwick, 78 Va. Cir. 336, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 145 (Brunswick County May 18, 2009). Expungement proper.  Granting of petitioners motion to expunge police and court records was proper because he neither pled guilty to reckless driving nor was there a finding of gu ilt as to the reckless driving charge; because improper driving was not a lesser-included offense of reckless driving, the reckless driving charge was otherwise dismissed within the meaning of the expungement statute, § 19.2-392.2.MacDonald v.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section applies t o United States employee.  The provisions of this section, fixing the speed limit for automobiles on public highways, must be obeyed by a United States employee while engaged in transportin g United States mail in a United States owned automobile pursuant to the direction of the Postmaster General, where it does not appear that such direction of the Postmaster General fixed a schedule for the carrying or delivery of the mail which required the employee to violate the provisions of the state statute. Hall v. Commonwealth, 129 Va. 738, 105 S.E. 551, 1921 Va. LEXIS 130 (1921). The effect of former § 46.1-199 (see now § 46.2-918), creating exemptions to speed limits, is that violation of the statute fixing speed limits (this section) is not negligence per se if the exemption is applicable. Yates v. Potts, 210 Va. 636, 172 S.E.2d 784, 1970 Va. LEXIS 174 (1970). Reckless driving and speeding are separate and distinct offenses; nothing in the languag e of § 19.2-294.1 precludes the Commonwealth or a locality from convicting a person for both DUI and speeding.

For the pur poses of this section, school crossing zone means an area located within the vicinity of a school at or near a highway where the presence of children on such school property or going to and from school reasonably requires a special warning to mot orists. Such zones are marked and operated in accordance with the requirements of this section with appropriate warning signs or other traffic control devices indicating that a school crossing is in progress. B. The maximum speed limit shall be twenty-five miles per hour between portable signs, tilt-over signs, or fixed blinking signs placed in or along any highway and bearing the word school or school crossing. Any signs erected under this section shall be placed not more than 600 feet from the limits of the school property or crossing in the vicinity of the school. However, school crossing signs may be placed in any location if the Department of Transportation or the council of the city or town o r the board of supervisors of a county maintaining its own system of secondary roads approves the crossing for such signs. If the portion of the highway to be posted is within the limits of a city or town, such portable signs shall be furnished and deliv ered by such city or town. If the portion of highway to be posted is outside the limits of a city or town, such portable signs shall be furnished and delivered by the Department of Transportation. The principal or chief administrative officer of each sch ool or a school board designee, preferably not a classroom teacher, shall place such portable signs in the highway at a point not more than 600 feet from the limits of the school property and remove such signs when their presence is no longer required by this section. Such portable signs, tilt-over signs, or fixed blinking signs shall be placed in a position plainly visible to vehicular traffic approaching from either direction, but shall not be placed so as to obstruct the roadway. C. Such portab le signs, tilt-over signs, or blinking signs shall be in a position, or be turned on, for thirty minutes preceding regular school hours, for thirty minutes thereafter, and during such other times as the presence of children on such school property or goi ng to and from school reasonably requires a special warning to motorists. The governing body of any county, city, or town may, however, decrease the period of time preceding and following regular school hours during which such portable signs, tilt-over s igns, or blinking signs shall be in position or lit if it determines that no children will be going to or from school during the period of time that it subtracts from the thirty-minute period. D. The governi ng body of any city or town may, if the portion of the highway to be posted is within the limits of such city or town, increase or decrease the speed limit provided in this section only after justification for such increase or decrease has been shown by an engineering and traffic investigation, and no such increase or decrease in speed limit shall be effective unless such increased or decreased speed limit is conspicuously posted on the portable signs, tilt-over signs, or fixed blinking signs required b y this section. E. The governi ng body of a county within Planning District 8 may, if the portion of the highway to be posted is within the limits of such county, increase or decrease the speed limit provided in this section only after justification for such increase or decrease has b een shown by an engineering and traffic investigation, and no such increase or decrease in speed limit shall be effective unless such increased or decreased speed limit is conspicuously posted on the portable signs, tilt-over signs, or fixed blinking sig ns required by this section. F. The City of Virginia Beach may establish school zones as provided in this section and mark such zones with flashing warning lights as provided in this section on and along all highways adjacent to Route 58. G. Any person operating any motor vehicle in excess of a maximum speed limit established specifically for a school crossing zone, when such school crossing zone is (i) indicated by appropriately placed signs displaying the maximum speed limit and (ii) in operation pur suant to subsection B of this section shall be guilty of a traffic infraction punishable by a fine of not more than $250, in addition to other penalties provided by law. H. Notwithstan ding the foregoing provisions of this section, the maximum speed limit in school zones in residential areas may be decreased to fifteen miles per hour if (i) the school board having jurisdiction over the school nearest to the affected school zone passes a resolution requesting the reduction of the maximum speed limit for such school zone from twenty-five miles per hour to fifteen miles per hour and (ii) the local governing body of the jurisdiction in which such school is located enacts an ordinance esta blishing the speed-limit reduction requested by the school board.

The maximum speed limit upon such highways may be increased or decreased by the Commissioner of Highways or other authority having jurisdiction over highways. How ever, such increased or decreased maximum speed limit shall be effective only when indicated by sign on the highway. For such highways upon which maximum speed limit is not indicated by sign, the maximum speed limit shall be 35 miles per hour.

Excessive use of force in arrest.  Because a police officers use of force was unreasonable under the circumstances, and because it failed both prongs of the qualified immunity analysis at the m otion to strike stage, the circuit court erred by granting his motion to strike on an arrestees § 1983 excessive force claim; the arrestees infraction for speeding was minor and was not a criminal offense, and obstruction of justice, the offen se for which the officer unjustifiably obtained an arrest warrant, was a misdemeanor. Cromartie v. Billings, 298 Va. 284, 837 S.E.2d 247, 2020 Va. LEXIS 2 (2020).

Federal regulations control over state law.  Because federal regulations determine how the speed limit on federal roads is to be determined, they control over state law requirements for reducing speed limits generally. United States v. Wornom, 754 F. Supp. 517, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 455 (W.D. Va. 1991). Evidence that speed limit had not been lawfully established was admissible.  As defendants proffered testimony tended to prove that no traffic or engineering study had been performed as required by § 46.2-1300 in order to establish a 30-mile-per-hour speed limit on the street where she was stopped, the evidence was relevant and admissible, and the trial court erred by refusing to admit it to rebut the presumption created by this section that the change in speed had been properly es tablished. Bahen v. City of Hampton, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 504 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 26, 2004). Lesser included offenses.  Trial court did not err in convicting defendant of speeding in violation § 46.2-870 under circumstances in which defendant was originally charged with a violat ion of § 46.2-878; the conclusion that § 46.2-870 was a lesser-included charge of § 46.2-878 was proper. There was no requirement that a lesser-included offense be of a lower grade or carry a different potential penalty than the greater offense. Plofchan v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 188 (Va. Ct. App. May 8, 2007). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Speed limit properly established.  Although the defendants contended that the city failed to pass Charlottesville, Va. Code § 15-99 pursuant to §§ 46.2-878 and 46.2-1300, which established the necessary procedures for the city to create a decreased speed limit on a limited access highway, and therefore that Charlottesville, Va. Code § 15-99 was without effect and unenforceable, according to § 46.2-878, there was a rebuttable presump tion that the speed limits were properly established. In the instant case, the rebuttable presumption at issue was not related to the elements of the offense, but only presumed the validity of the decreased maximum speed limit, and therefore, the law exp licitly presumed that the Route 250 Bypass speed ordinance was prescribed after a traffic engineering investigation; the defendants failed to provide clear evidence to rebut the presumption that the speed limits on the Route 250 Bypass were enacted pursu ant to the provisions of § 46.2-878. Commonwealth v. Tocci, 84 Va. Cir. 359, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 135 (Charlottesville Mar. 12, 2012). § 46.2-878.1. Maximum speed limits in highway work zones; penalty.

Such criteria sh all not exclude highways, functionally classified as minor arterials, serving areas that either (i) were built as residential developments or (ii) have grown to resemble residential developments, provided, in either case, (a) such highways are experienci ng documented speeding problems and (b) the local governing body requests the application of this section to such highway. Such signs may be installed in any town and shall not require the approval of the county within which such town is located. Any suc h signs installed in any town shall be paid for by the town requesting the installation of the signs, or out of the countys secondary system construction allocation.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The purpose of this section is to inform motorists that as the result of experiments wit h automobiles equipped with four-wheel brakes in good condition and under the stated conditions, drivers proceeding at the stated tabulated speeds will require the relative average stated distances within which to stop their vehicles. In other words, a m otorist driving a car equipped with four-wheel brakes in good condition and under the stated conditions, proceeding at the stated speeds, should allow for the average stated distances in order to stop his car. Cook v. Basnight, 207 Va. 491, 151 S.E.2d 40 8, 1966 Va. LEXIS 249 (1966). Courts includes juries.  It was the intendment of the General Assembly in enacting this section to include juries within the meaning of courts and to authorize that juries be inst ructed as to the contents of the section which are pertinent to the issues in a particular case. Beasley v. Bosschermuller, 206 Va. 360, 143 S.E.2d 881, 1965 Va. LEXIS 207 (1965). Factors which affect stopping dist ance.  When person would be able to stop an automobile depends upon factors other than the proper condition of his brakes. It would depend upon the time at which the bra kes were applied, the force with which they were applied, and the distance the car was from the desired point of stopping at the time of the application. Cook v. Basnight, 207 Va. 491, 151 S.E.2d 408, 1966 Va. LEXIS 249 (1966). Foundation evidence required.  Proof of each of the factors enunciated in the last paragraph of this section is required as a foundation before any instruction based on tables of speed and stop ping distances can be presented to the jury. Johnson v. Haas, 224 Va. 245, 295 S.E.2d 789, 1982 Va. LEXIS 286 (1982). Proof that a motor vehicle was unloaded except for the driver, was equipped with four-wheel brakes, was in good condition, and was traveling on dry, hard, approxi mately level stretches of highway free from loose material was required as a foundation before any instruction based on tables of speed and stopping distances could be presented to the jury. Jones v. Griffey, 104 Fed. Appx. 840, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 1382 5 (4th Cir. 2004). Tables not applicable to motorcycles.  Clearly the tables were never intended to apply to two-wheel motorcycles. Beasley v. Barnes, 201 Va. 593, 113 S.E.2d 62, 1960 Va. LEXIS 134 (1960). The Supreme Court has repeatedly discouraged the granting of an instruction on the tables of speed and stopping distances unless it is clearly supported by the evidence. Bunn v. Norfolk, F. &amp; D. Ry., 217 Va. 45, 225 S.E.2d 375, 1976 Va. LEXIS 239 (1976); Johnson v. Haas, 224 Va. 245, 295 S.E.2d 789, 1982 Va. LEXIS 286 (1982). Taking tables into jury room.  It was not reversible error to allow the jury to take the tables of speeds and stopping distances into the jury room where no sufficient objection was made in the trial court and no prejudice to plaintiff resulted. However, although the issue was not raised, the tables should not have been offered in evidence without an appropriate instruction as to their relevancy, if any. White v. Hunt, 209 Va. 11, 161 S.E.2d 8 09, 1968 Va. LEXIS 187 (1968). Where the road is upgrade rather than approximately level, the reaction time and distances given in the tables have but little probative value. Stimeling v.

No person s hall stop a vehicle in such manner as to impede or render dangerous the use of the highway by others, except in the case of an emergency, an accident, or a mechanical breakdown. B. In the even t of such an emergency, accident, or breakdown, the emergency flashing lights of such vehicle shall be turned on if the vehicle is equipped with such lights and such lights are in working order. If the driver is capable of safely doing so, the vehicle is movable, and there are no injuries or deaths resulting from the emergency, accident, or breakdown, the driver shall move the vehicle from the roadway to prevent obstructing the regular flow of traffic, provided, however, that the movement of the vehicle to prevent the obstruction of traffic shall not relieve the law-enforcement officer of his duty pursuant to § 46.2-373. A report of the vehicles location shall be made to the nearest law-enforcement officer as soon as practicable, and the vehicle shall be moved from the roadway to the shoulder as soon as possible and removed from the shoulder without unnecessary delay. If the vehicle is not promptly removed, such removal may be ordered by a law-enforcement officer at the expense of the owner if the disabled vehicle creates a traffic hazard. C. (Contingent expiration date  see Editors note) In the event of an accident on any part of Interstate 66 where a HOT lane as defined in § 33.2-500 is under construction and the sho ulders of Interstate 66 are being or have been removed, the driver shall move the vehicle from the roadway to the nearest pull-off area if the driver is capable of safely doing so, the vehicle is movable, and there are no injuries or deaths resulting fro m the accident, provided, however, that the movement of the vehicle shall not relieve the law-enforcement officer of his duty pursuant to § 46.2-373. For purposes of this subsection, pull-off area includes an exit ramp or otherwise agreed-upon location. A violation of this subsection is a traffic infraction punishable by a fine of $20.

This section and former § 46.1-250 (see now § 46.2-893) are safety measures, desig ned to prevent accidents and to protect the person and property of those using the highways. Jamison v. Richardson, 198 Va. 190, 93 S.E.2d 140, 1956 Va. LEXIS 190 (1956). This section prohibits stopping in such a manner as to impede or make dangerous the use of the highway by others. The question is whether the stopping on the road did in fact impede or make dangerous the use of the highway, not whether such impeding or making dangerous was reasonable or unreasonable. Birtcherd Dairy, Inc. v. Edwards, 197 Va. 830, 91 S.E.2d 421, 1956 Va. LEXIS 161 (1956). This section forbids one to stop a vehicle on the highway in such a manner as to impede or render dangerous the use of the highway by others, but the proh ibition is not absolute. It is not made unlawful to stop unless such action impedes traffic or renders use of the highway dangerous. Davis v. Scarborough, 199 Va. 100, 97 S.E.2d 731, 1957 Va. LEXIS 168 (1957); Elliott v. Lewis, 207 Va. 361, 150 S.E.2d 12 9, 1966 Va. LEXIS 228 (1966). It is unlawful to stop a motor vehicle in a manner which impedes or renders dangerous the use of a highway by others. The only explicit exception is a stop as the result of an emergency arising from an accident or mechanical breakdown. Hart v. Wilkins, 357 F.2d 165, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6950 (4th Cir. 1966). And its provisions include one who, stopped by an accident, allows his vehicle to remain stopped in an unreasonable manner.  While this section may not have intended to penalize one who is stopped by accident, its language is sufficiently broad to include within its provisions one who, stopped by an accident, allows his vehicle to remain stopped in a manner unreasonably interfering with traffic and rendering dangerous the use of the highway. Armstrong v. Rose, 170 Va. 190, 196 S.E. 613, 1938 Va. LEXIS 177 (1938). An instruction including the word left instead of stopped and adding unreasonable before manner was objected to. In overruling thi s objection, the court said: If to stop a vehicle upon the highway in such a manner as to interfere with the use thereof by others is contrary to statute, certainly to stop and leave a truck upon the highway and to allow it to remain there in an unre asonable manner put plaintiff to proof of a higher degree of negligence. Armstrong v. Rose, 170 Va. 190, 196 S.E. 613, 1938 Va. LEXIS 177 (1938). This section requires that the motorist stopped as the result of an accident or mechanical breakdown get the vehicle onto the shoulder of the road if practical, a nd remove it completely as soon as possible. Hart v. Wilkins, 357 F.2d 165, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6950 (4th Cir. 1966). The trial court should have instructed the jury on the defendants additional statutory duty to move his vehicle from the roadway as soon as possible, even tho ugh properly stopped for an emergency; the instruction given was misleading because it ignored defendants statutory duty to take further action after he stopped. Harrah v. Washington, 252 Va. 285, 477 S.E.2d 281, 1996 Va. LEXIS 114 (1996). But it was not designed to prevent a motorist from stopping momentarily on the highway in an emergency or in order to avoid a collision, and it was not intended to require a motorist to refrain from stopping when going ahead would bring his car into collision with another vehicle or with some other object. Doss v. Rader, 187 Va. 231, 46 S.E.2d 434, 1948 Va. LEXIS 216 (1948). In other words, stopping momentarily on the highway to avoid a collision is not a stopping within the meaning and prohibition of the statute. Doss v. Rader, 187 V a. 231, 46 S.E.2d 434, 1948 Va. LEXIS 216 (1948). This section does not apply to vehicles which are pushed or being pushed on the highway. Miller v. Query, 201 Va. 193, 110 S.E.2d 198, 1959 Va. LEXIS 211 (1959). The operator of one vehicle pushing another is not subject to liability or negligence predicated alone upon the violation of this section. Miller v. Query, 201 Va . 193, 110 S.E.2d 198, 1959 Va. LEXIS 211 (1959). Not applicable to low fuel supply.  No mechanical breakdown occurs, within the meaning of the statute, when a drivers car is rendered inoperable due to having consumed all its fuel at a time when the driver knew, or should have known, that the supply of fuel has been, or is about to be, exhausted. Thomas v. Settle, 247 Va. 15, 439 S.E.2d 360, 10 Va. Law Rep. 702, 1994 Va. LEXIS 9 (1994). Ordinary care must be exercised.  A person engaged about a motor vehicle on the highway is required to exercise ordinary care for his own safety, but the mere fact that he was on the traveled port ion of the road in the performance of a duty required of him under this section does not render him guilty per se of contributory negligence. Cowles v. Zahn, 206 Va. 743, 146 S.E.2d 200, 1966 Va. LEXIS 144 (1966). One engaged in performing his statutory duty to remove his disabled vehicle from the roadway as soon as possible has duty of exercising ordinary care to a void being injured by other passing automobiles, but has right to assume that drivers of other automobiles will keep a reasonable lookout. Bonich v. Waite, 194 Va. 374, 73 S.E.2d 389, 1952 Va. LEXIS 241 (1952). The violation of this section is negligence. Birtcherd Dairy, Inc. v. Edwards, 197 Va. 83 0, 91 S.E.2d 421, 1956 Va. LEXIS 161 (1956). A violation of a statute such as this is negligence per se, but such negligence will not support a recovery for damages unless the violation was a proximate cause of the injury. Baxley v. Fischer, 204 Va. 792, 134 S.E.2d 291, 1964 Va. LEXIS 121 (1964); Lange v. Burruss, 312 F. Supp. 30, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12815 (E.D. Va. 1970); Pullen v. Nickens, 226 Va. 342, 310 S.E.2d 452, 1983 Va. LEXIS 291 (1983). A violation of this section is negligence. But such negligence will support a recovery for damages only in the event the violation is a proximate cause of the inj ury. Virginia Stage Lines v. Brockman Chevrolet, Inc., 209 Va. 188, 163 S.E.2d 148, 1968 Va. LEXIS 214 (1968). Even assuming that hazard lights were activated, this did not excuse a truck drivers stopping on a heavily travelled road that had no shoulder, under circumst ances that did not amount to an emergency, accident, or mechanical breakdown; the trial court properly found that the truck driver was negligent as a matter of law and submitted to the jury the issue of wheth...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-889"><akn:num>§ 46.2-889</akn:num><akn:heading>Location of parked vehicles</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text No vehicle shall be stopped except close to and parallel to the right edge of the curb or roadway, except that a vehicle may be stopped close to and parallel to the lef t curb or edge of the roadway on one-way streets or may be parked at an angle where permitted by the Commonwealth Transportation Board, the Department, or local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction.

This section and former § 46.1-250 (see now § 46.2-893) are safety measures, desig ned to prevent accidents and to protect the person and property of those using the highways. Jamison v.

The question is whether the stopping on the road did in fact impede or make dangerous the use of the highway, not whether such impeding or making dangerous was reasonable or unreasonable. Birtcherd Dairy, Inc. v. Edwards, 197 Va. 830, 91 S.E.2d 421, 1956 Va. LEXIS 161 (1956). This section forbids one to stop a vehicle on the highway in such a manner as to impede or render dangerous the use of the highway by others, but the proh ibition is not absolute.

This section requires that the motorist stopped as the result of an accident or mechanical breakdown get the vehicle onto the shoulder of the road if practical, a nd remove it completely as soon as possible. Hart v. Wilkins, 357 F.2d 165, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6950 (4th Cir. 1966).

Doss v. Rader, 187 Va. 231, 46 S.E.2d 434, 1948 Va. LEXIS 216 (1948). In other words, stopping momentarily on the highway to avoid a collision is not a stopping within the meaning and prohibition of the statute. Doss v. Rader, 187 V a. 231, 46 S.E.2d 434, 1948 Va.

Cowles v. Zahn, 206 Va. 743, 146 S.E.2d 200, 1966 Va. LEXIS 144 (1966).

Brockman Chevrolet, Inc., 209 Va. 188, 163 S.E.2d 148, 1968 Va. LEXIS 214 (1968). Moving slowly.  Whether a driver stopped so as to impede or make dangerous the use of the highway by others, or whether she was moving very slowly, the jury could find he r negligent in either event. Saunders v. Bulluck, 208 Va. 551, 159 S.E.2d 820, 1968 Va. LEXIS 147 (1968). Failure to park on shoulder.  Where a driver stopped her car on the hard surface of the road in the westbound driving lane at a point where there was room to park on the shoulder, that act was a violation of this section, and hence the driver was guilty of negligence. Saunders v. Bulluck, 208 Va. 551, 159 S.E.2d 820, 1968 Va. LEXIS 147 (1968). Highway worker held to common-law standard of reasonable care.  Failure of an employee of the Department of Highways and Transportation (now Department of Transportation) to comply with the statute does not constitute negligen ce per se in view of the exemption of vehicles owned or controlled by the Department. Such employee is held to the common-law standard of reasonable care under the circumstances. Pullen v. Nickens, 226 Va. 342, 310 S.E.2d 452, 1983 Va. LEXIS 291 (1983). Civil liability of operators of vehicles of Department of Highways and Transportation.  In the 1958 revision of the Motor Vehicle Code, this section included an exemption from the provisions of the section only for vehicles owned or controlled by the Department of Highways and Transportation (now Department of Transportation). In the same revision, former §§ 46.1-199, 46.1-226, and 46.1-249 (see now §§ 46.2-918, 46.2-920 and 46.2-892) contained the provisions disclaiming release of civil liability for negligence. The omission of the disclaimer from this section, therefore, cannot be construed to have been inadvertent. However, the omission reflected the legislative intent to have any civil liability of the operators of Department vehicl es in highway work depend upon the applicability of principles of sovereign immunity. The amendment which added vehicles of units of local government including counties, cities and towns to the exemption that previously had applied only to Depart ment vehicles did not exempt Department employees from civil liability. The provision gives exemption from the criminal sanctions otherwise applicable. Pullen v. Nickens, 226 Va. 342, 310 S.E.2d 452, 1983 Va. LEXIS 291 (1983). An instruction on independent or intervening cause was properly given where the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant could not reasonably have foreseen the sudden negligent act of another driver. Baxley v. Fischer, 204 Va. 792, 134 S.E.2d 291, 1964 Va. LEXIS 121 (1964). Trial court did not err in giving a contributory negligence instruction in a personal in jury action brought by the driver of the middle of three cars involved in a rear-end collision against the driver of the third car, who contended that the plaintiffs sudden stop and failure to stay a safe distance behind the first car, which was atte mpting an illegal U-turn, constituted negligen...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-891"><akn:num>§ 46.2-891</akn:num><akn:heading>Exemption for highway construction and maintenance vehicles</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The provisions of this article shall not apply to any vehicle owned or controlled by the Virginia Department of Transportation or counties, cities or towns, while actua lly engaged in the construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or emergency road clearance of highways.

It does not require the operator of a school bus to leave the highway under any and all circumstances before stopping to take on and discharge school children. When the condition of the weather, the highway and the surrounding circumstances render it unsafe so to do, such operators are permitted by the express terms of the statute to stop o n the traveled portion of the highway.

Text The driver of any vehicle involved in an accident in which a person is killed or injured or in which an attended vehicle or other attended property is damaged shall imm ediately stop as close to the scene of the accident as possible without obstructing traffic, as provided in § 46.2-888, and report his name, address, drivers license number, and vehicle registration number forthwith to the State Police or local la w-enforcement agency, to the person struck and injured if such person appears to be capable of understanding and retaining the information, or to the driver or some other occupant of the vehicle collided with or to the custodian of other damaged property . The driver shall also render reasonable assistance to any person injured in such accident, including taking such injured person to a physician, surgeon, or hospital if it is apparent that medical treatment is necessary or is requested by the injured pe rson. Where, because of injuries sustained in the accident, the driver is prevented from complying with the foregoing provisions of this section, the driver shall, as soon as reasonably possible, make the required report to the State Police or local law-enforcement agency and make a reasonable effort to locate the person struck, or the driver or some other occupant of the vehicle collided with, or the custodian of the damage d property, and report to such person or persons his name, address, drivers license number, and vehicle registration number.

Construction.  Statute essentially requires that a vehicle impeding or rendering the roadway dangerous be moved unless it is an emergency, or the vehicle is inoperable. Cleaton v. Commonwealth, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 159 (Va. Ct. App. May 26, 2020). The purpose of this section is to prevent motorists involved in accidents from evading c ivil or criminal liability by leaving the scene of an accident and to require drivers involved in an accident to provide identification information and render assistance to injured parties and these duties apply regardless whether a collision has occurre d or a person has been struck. Smith v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 109, 379 S.E.2d 374, 5 Va. Law Rep. 2164, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 30 (1989) (decided under former § 46.1-176). The identification requirement is intended to facilitate accident investigation and to preserve public order. The assistance requirement advances public safety. It is not dependent upon the victims desire to receive aid. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. App. 769, 418 S.E.2d 729, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3619, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 179 (1992). The final sentence of the first paragraph of this section is not unconstitutionally vague. Banks v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 527, 230 S.E.2d 256, 1976 Va. LEXIS 316 (1976). State s interest outweighs self-incrimination factor.  Even though there may be a real possibility of self-incrimination to the hit and run habitual offender stemming from enforcement of this section a nd the information gained by compliance therewith in a prosecution under former § 46.1-387.8 (see now § 46.2-357), the States vital interest in its self-reporting system compels rejection of an effort to extend the self-incrimination privilege to such a statutory framework. Banks v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 527, 230 S.E.2d 256, 1976 Va. LEXIS 316 (1976). Re porting requirement conjunctive but may be disjunctive.  This section is in the conjunctive and requires a report to the police and the injured party. Yet, the trial court stated the duty in the disjunctive. Accordingly , this became the law of the case, even though contrary to this section, and the Commonwealth had the burden to prove both negatives, that is, that defendant did not report to the police and did not report to the injured party. Banks v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 527, 230 S.E.2d 256, 1976 Va. LEXIS 316 (1976). Because the statutory reporting requirement is no longer in the conjunctive and no longer requires a report to the police and the injured party, the holding in Ba nks v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 527, 230 S.E.2d 256 (1976), on this discrete issue has been superseded by the change in statutory language, and therefore, it is no longer a correct statement of the law. Butcher v. Commonwealth, 69 Va. App. 406, 819 S.E.2d 8 62, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 301 (2018), vacated in part, aff'd, 838 S.E.2d 538, 2020 Va. LEXIS 10 (Va. 2020). Doctrine of judicial restraint.  It was inappropriate, under the doctrine of judicial restraint, for the Court of Appeals to hold, sua sponte, that, under the hit-and-run statute, a defendant onl y had to report required information to one person because (1) defendant disclaimed the argument on appeal, and (2) it was unnecessary to address the issue, as sufficient evidence showed defendant did not comply with either statutory reporting requiremen t. Butcher v. Commonwealth, 838 S.E.2d 538, 2020 Va. LEXIS 10 (Va. 2020). This section does not apply to locomotives.  This section, which covers the crime of leaving the scene of the accident, does not apply to locomotives. Keaton v. Balser, 340 F. Supp. 329, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXI S 14582 (W.D. Va. 1972). The gravamen of the charge of hit and run driving is the flight from the scene and failu re to give succor or aid to the injured party. Blankenship v. Commonwealth, 184 Va. 495, 35 S.E.2d 760, 1945 Va. LEXIS 168 (1945). Elements of offense.  Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction for felony hit and run because the evidence showed that defendant had knowledge of the accident, since his SUV hit the victim so forcefully that it spun him like a top and threw him to the ground. A rational fact-finder could have concluded that a person aware of having just forcibly struck a construction worker with his SUV also would have known tha t the collision injured the construction worker. Keiron Chardel Pollard v. Commonwealth, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 462 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 27, 2022). In order to establish a conviction under the statute, the Commonwealth must prove: (1) that the defendant was the driver of a vehicle which he knew was involved i n an accident; (2) that the accident caused personal injury to another; (3) that the defendant knew, or should have known, that another person was injured by the accident; and (4) that the defendant failed to stop immediately as close to the scene as pos sible and do all of the things specified in the statute. Jones v. Commonwealth, No. 0863-97-2 (Ct. of Appeals Dec. 22, 1998). Po sitive action is required of driver involved in accident.  The duty imposed by the hit-and-run statute upon the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident is not passive. It requires positive, affirmative action  tha t is, to stop and give the aid and information specified. Herchenbach v. Commonwealth, 185 Va. 217, 38 S.E.2d 328, 1946 Va. LEXIS 193 (1946). Acts constituting offense do not commence until after injury or damage has been inflicted. James v. Commonwealth, 178 Va. 28, 16 S.E.2d 296, 1941 Va. LEXIS 141 (1941). Knowledge necessarily is an essential element of the crime. This does not mean that the person should have positive knowledge of the extent of the damage or injuries inflicted. It does mean that, in order to be guilty of violating the statute, the driver must be aware that harm has been done; it must be present in his mind that there has be en an injury; and then, with that in his mind, he must deliberately go away without making himself known. If an injury is inflicted under such circumstances as would ordinarily superinduce the belief in a reasonable person that injury would flow, or had flowed, from the accident or collision then it is the duty of the operator to stop his vehicle. Herchenbach v. Commonwealth, 185 Va. 217, 38 S.E.2d 328, 1946 Va. LEXIS 193 (1946). A conviction for hit-and-run pursuant to this section requires proof of knowledge: The driver mus...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-895"><akn:num>§ 46.2-895</akn:num><akn:heading>Duty of certain persons accompanying driver to report accidents involving injury, death, or damage to attended property</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If the driver fails to stop and make the report required by § 46.2-894, every person sixteen years of age or older in the vehicle with the driver at the time of the accident, who has knowledge of the accident, shall have a duty to ensure that a report is made within twenty-four hours from the time of the accident to the State Police or, if the accident occurs in a city or town, to the local law-enforcement agency.

Annotations CASE NOTES Section was not unconstitution ally vague.  This section explicitly describes the duty of a passenger of a vehicle involved in an accident and was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant, who c laimed it was unclear what information he was required to give in order to ensure that a report had been made. Commonwealth v. Johnson, No. 0629-90-4 (Ct. of Appeals Oct. 16, 1990) (decided under former § 46.1-176(b)). Personal reporting not required.  The statute does not require that a person make a report personally. McCray v. Commonwealth, 21 Va. App. 129, 462 S.E.2d 573, 1995 Va.

If the owner or custodian of such damaged vehicle or property cannot be found, the driver shall leave a note or other sufficient information including driver identification and contact information in a conspicuous place at the scene of the accident and shall report the accident in writing within 24 hours to the State Police or the local law-enforcement agency. Such note or other information and written report shall contain the information that the driver is required to report pursuant to § 46.2-894.

The 2005 amendment by c. 137, in the first paragraph, inserted or other sufficient information including driver identification and contact information, or other information and made minor stylistic changes. CASE NOTES Probable cause for arrest for failing to provide necessary information.  Following an accident in a store parking lot, at the time of the claimants arrest, the officers had probable cause to believe that the claimant had violated n umerous laws, including obstruction of justice and failure to provide the customer whose car she had damaged with her name, address, drivers license number, and vehicle registration number in violation of §§ 18.2-460 and 46.2-896. Because they had probable cause to believe that the claimant had violated the law, the officers did not violate the claimants Fourth Amendment rights when they arrested her without a warrant. Durney v. Doss, 106 Fed. Appx. 166, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 15545 (4th Cir . 2004). Evidence sufficient.  Sufficient evidence supported defendants conviction for leaving the scene of an accident involving damage to unattended property because a factfinder could r easonably have concluded that defendant was driving the truck when it struck the pole and did not notify the owner of the damaged property or the police about the incident.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Definition of All-terrain vehicle.   Based on definitions in the Virginia Code, some farm utility vehicles and some utility vehicles would also be considered all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Those farm u tility vehicles and utility vehicles that are considered ATVs would be eligible for the exception provided for in § 46.2 915.1, which provides that ATVs being used in conjunction with farming activities may be driven on public highways. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Paul Walther, Commonwealths Attorney, Culpeper County, 21-027, 2021 Va. AG LEXIS 36 (12/3/21). The defining characteristic of all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) is the number of wheels; the definition requires that the vehicle have "three or more wheels." See opin ion of Attorney General to the Honorable Paul Walther, Commonwealths Attorney, Culpeper County, 21-027, 2021 Va. AG LEXIS 36 (12/3/21).

Most of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. This section means what it says and is too plain to require construction. Moore v. Scott, 160 Va. 610, 169 S.E. 902, 1933 Va. LEXIS 242 (1933); Lucas v. Craft, 161 Va. 228, 170 S.E. 836, 1933 Va. LEXIS 314 (1933). It applies to highways in rural sections as well as to city streets. Sprinkle v. Davis, 104 F.2d 487, 1939 U.S. App. LEXIS 4167 (4th Cir. 1939). Intersection.  Though the streets at either end of the block where plaintiff crossed came to dead ends at that street, the Ts thus formed were intersections under th e meaning of Intersection in § 46.2-100. Brown v. Arthur, 202 Va. 624, 119 S.E.2d 315, 1961 Va. LEXIS 155 (1961). Right-of-way as betwee n motorist and pedestrian.  A motorist or pedestrian, in traveling along a portion of a highway prescribed for the use of each of them, has no right-of-way over the other except as is provid ed by statute. In the absence of such a statutory provision, the rights of motorists and pedestrians are equal and their duties are mutual and reciprocal. Brown v. Arthur, 202 Va. 624, 119 S.E.2d 315, 1961 Va. LEXIS 155 (1961). A motorist or pedestrian has no right-of-way over the other except as provided by statute. Schutt v. Brockwell, 214 Va. 38, 196 S.E.2d 921, 1973 Va. LEXIS 251 (19 73). This section does not expressly give motorists a superior right-of-way over pedestrians crossing streets and highways between intersections. Schutt v. Brockwell, 214 Va. 38, 196 S.E.2d 921, 1973 Va. LEXIS 251 (1973). Duties of pedestrian when he crosses street between intersections.  Since the passage of this section, the pedestrian, under such regulations, for his own protection, is required to exercise a greater degree of vigilance when he c rosses a street between intersections. This is because the vehicle has the superior right there. Moore v. Scott, 160 Va. 610, 169 S.E. 902, 1933 Va. LEXIS 242 (1933); Manhattan For Hire Car Corp. v. Williams, 191 Va. 489, 62 S.E.2d 10, 1950 Va. LEXIS 236 (1950); Hopson v. Goolsby, 196 Va. 832, 86 S.E.2d 149, 1955 Va. LEXIS 153 (1955); Hodgson v. McCall, 197 Va. 52, 87 S.E.2d 791, 1955 Va. LEXIS 194 (1955). If a pedestrian is crossing between intersections, reasonable care requires that he exercise a greater degree of vigilance than if crossing at the intersection. B rown v. Arthur, 202 Va. 624, 119 S.E.2d 315, 1961 Va. LEXIS 155 (1961). A pedestrian who undertakes to cross a street or highway between intersections is required to exercise a greater degree of vigilance than is required when crossin g at an intersection. Schutt v. Brockwell, 214 Va. 38, 196 S.E.2d 921, 1973 Va. LEXIS 251 (1973). Drivers duty to children.  When the driver of an automobile sees, or by the exercise of ordinary care should see, a 20-month-old child near or approaching a street, he has no right to assum e that the child will cross the street only at an intersection. Gabbard v. Knight, 202 Va. 40, 116 S.E.2d 73, 1960 Va. LEXIS 188 (1960). Center of city street is not to be considered as a comparative zone of safety fo r pedestrians. Where the plaintiff entered a city street between intersections and under circumstances which should have indicated to him that he could not continue across without stopping in the center, he was guilty of contributory negligence as a matt er of law. Smith v. Spradlin, 204 Va. 509, 132 S.E.2d 455, 1963 Va. LEXIS 179 (1963). Violation of this section is negligence per se. Sprinkle v. Davis, 104 F.2d 487, 1939 U.S . App. LEXIS 4167 (4th Cir. 1939). Hence, one who at night gets out of his car on the left-hand side, steps into the street, and fails to look or see a lighted bus which at that time was within a f ew feet of him, approaching slowly, is guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. He violates this section and former § 46.1-232 (see now § 46.2-926) by crossing the street between intersections, and by stepping into that portion of the street which is open to moving vehicular traffic between intersections where his presence may be obscured. Reams v. Cone, 190 Va. 835, 59 S.E.2d 87, 1950 Va. LEXIS 173 (1950). But a pedestrian who was struck by auto while crossing street was not disobedient to the commands of this section to the point of being negligent when she went be yond the five points of a five-way intersection to cross a street to where she would have only one street to cross instead of crossing in the area of the intersection upon which traffic converged from five directions. Hopson v. Goolsby, 196 Va. 832, 86 S .E.2d 149, 1955 Va. LEXIS 153 (1955). Proximate causation.  Under the circumstances, the jury could find that the failure of plaintiffs decedent to cross at the intersection had nothing to do with the accident and that defendants actions were the sole proximate cause. Spiegelman v. Birch, 204 Va. 96, 129 S.E.2d 119, 1963 Va. LEXIS 120 (1963). Instructions.  Refusal to grant an instruction that, in crossing the road, a pedestrian was under a legal requirement which was framed in the words of this section, was error. S prinkle v. Davis, 104 F.2d 487, 1939 U.S. App. LEXIS 4167 (4th Cir. 1939). An instruction which left the jury to infer that the diagonal crossing of a road by a pedestrian might or might not constitute negligence, depending upon the use of ordinary care, was in error. Sprinkle v. Davis, 104 F.2d 487, 1939 U.S. App. LEXIS 4167 (4th Cir. 1939). Instruction on last clear chance held proper in Sprinkle v. Davis, 111 F.2d 925, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 3813, 128 A.L.R. 1101 (4th Cir. 1940). Instruction as to drivers right to assume proper conduct by pedestrians held erroneous as applied to young child. Gabbard v. Knight, 202 Va. 40, 116 S.E.2d 73 , 1960 Va. LEXIS 188 (1960). It was error to instruct the jury that the defendant driver had the right to assume that no person would violate this section where the evidence showed that the c ircumstances were ample to put the driver on notice that children were present in the vicinity. Baker v. Richardson, 201 Va. 834, 114 S.E.2d 599, 1960 Va. LEXIS 167 (1960). An instruction that vehicles have the right-of-way except at intersecting streets was erroneous. Brown v. Arthur, 202 Va. 624, 119 S.E.2d 315, 1961 Va. LE XIS 155 (1961). Language used in an opinion of the Supreme Court is not always appropriate in an instruction. Schutt v. Brockwell, 214 Va. 38, 196 S.E.2d 921, 1973 Va. LEXIS 251 (1973). Questions for jury.  In Sprinkle v. Davis, 111 F.2d 925 (4th Cir. 1940), it was held that although the diagonal crossing in violation of this section was some evidence of neglect on p edestrians part, there was sufficient doubt whether this section contributed to the accident to make the questions of contributory negligence and of last clear chance ones for the decision of the jury. Even if a decedent had violated § 46.2-923 by not crossing at a crosswalk, a circuit court erred in concluding that the decedent had been contributorily neglig ent as a matter of law in a negligence action against a transit company. Reasonable minds could have differed about conclusions to be drawn from evidence; thus, the issue of proximate cause for contributory negligence was properly submitted to jury for r esolution. Estate of Moses v. Southwestern Va. Transit Mgmt. Co., 273 Va. 672, 643 S.E.2d 156, 2007 Va. LEXIS 48 (2007). Section not violated.  Where exhibits show that there were no marked crosswalks for pedestrians, a plaintiffs act of crossing between intersections did not violate the statute and d oes not constitute negligence as a matter of law. Schutt v. Brockwell, 214 Va. 38, 196 S.E.2d 921, 1973 Va. LEXIS 251 (1973). Undisputed facts showed that there was an intersection approximately a tenth of a mile from where defendants crossed the road, however the intersection did not ha ve a crosswalk and thus, defendants were not negligent in crossing between intersections, so long as the route they took was the most direct.

The driver of any vehicle on a highway shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian crossing such highway by stopping and remaining stopped until such pedestrian has passed the lane in which the vehicle is stopped: 1.

At any intersection when the driver is approaching on a highway where the speed limit is not more than 35 miles per hour. B. When a vehi cle is stopped pursuant to subsection A, the driver of any other vehicle approaching from an adjacent lane or from behind the stopped vehicle shall not overtake and pass such stopped vehicle. C. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection A, at intersections or crosswalks where the movement of traffic is being regulated by law-enforcement officers or traffic control devices, the driver shall yield according to the direction of the law-enforcement officer or device.No pedestrian shall enter or cross an intersection in disregard of approaching traffic.The drivers of vehicles entering, crossing, or turning at intersections shall change their course, slow down, or stop if necessary to permit pedestrians to c ross such intersections safely and expeditiously.Pedestrians crossing highways at intersections shall at all times have the right-of-way over vehicles making turns into the highways being crossed by the pedestrians. D. The governi ng body of Arlington County, Fairfax County, Loudoun County and any town therein, the City of Alexandria, the City of Fairfax, the City of Falls Church, and the Town of Ashland may by ordinance provide for the installation and maintenance of highway sign s at marked crosswalks specifically requiring operators of motor vehicles, at the locations where such signs are installed, to yield the right-of-way to pedestrians crossing or attempting to cross the highway. Any operator of a motor vehicle who fails at such locations to yield the right-of-way to pedestrians as required by such signs shall be guilty of a traffic infraction punishable by a fine of no less than $100 or more than $500. The Department of Transportation shall develop criteria for the design , location, and installation of such signs. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any limited access highway. E. Where a sha red-use path crosses a highway at a clearly marked crosswalk and there are no traffic control signals at such crossing, the local governing body may by ordinance require pedestrians, cyclists, and any other users of such shared-used path to come to a com plete stop prior to entering such crosswalk. Such local ordinance may provide for a fine not to exceed $100 for violations. Any locality adopting such an ordinance shall install and maintain stop signs, consistent with standards adopted by the Commonweal th Transportation Board and to the extent necessary in coordination with the Department of Transportation. At such crosswalks, no user of such shared-use path shall enter the crosswalk in disregard of approaching traffic. F. A locality adopting an ordinance under subsection E shall coordinate the enforcement and placement of any stop signs affecting a shared-use path owned and operated by a park authority formed under Chapter 57 (§ 15.2-5700 et seq.) of Title 15.2 with such authorit y.

Most of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The purpose of this section is to afford pedestrians crossing at an intersection at the end of any city block a right-of-way over vehicular traffic and to that extent give them some degree of protection from its dangers. Reese v. Snelson, 192 Va. 479, 65 S.E.2d 547, 1951 Va. LEXIS 196 (1951); Conrad v. Thompson, 195 Va. 714, 80 S.E.2d 561, 1954 Va. LEXIS 150 (1954); Marshall v. Shaw, 196 Va. 678, 85 S.E.2d 223, 1955 Va. LEXIS 139 (1955). The title of this article and the express language of this section definitely indicate that it is primarily intended for the protection of pedestrians from vehicu lar traffic. Arney v. Bogstad, 199 Va. 460, 100 S.E.2d 749, 1957 Va. LEXIS 211 (1957). Section applies outside as well as within incorporated cities and towns.  The contention that this section applies to intersections within incorporated towns or cities and was never intended to apply to intersections outside of incorpor ated towns and cities is without merit. Nelson v. Dayton, 184 Va. 754, 36 S.E.2d 535, 1946 Va. LEXIS 139 (1946). But does not apply to private crossing .  The provision of this section concerning the relative right of pedestrians and vehicles at city crossings does not apply to a private crossing, placed there, it i s true, for the convenience of the public, but also for a street railways own purposes in that it provided a station stop which served both the public and itself. Hendricks v. VEPCO, 161 Va. 793, 172 S.E. 160, 1934 Va. LEXIS 302 (1934). Nor where the driver was not crossing an intersection. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 684 , 179 S.E.2d 506, 1971 Va. LEXIS 242 (1971). Section to be read with other sections .  The first paragraph of this section should be read in conjunction with former §§ 46.1-184 and 46.1-216 (see now §§ 46.2-833 through 46.2-836 and 46.2- 848). Sanders v. Newsome, 179 Va. 582, 19 S.E.2d 883, 1942 Va. LEXIS 250 (1942). What constitutes crossing.  Defendant driver contended that, as the intersecting driveway to a railroad station was located on private property, the prolongation of the lateral lines of its sidewalk did not constitute a crossing within the contemplation of this section. This contention was held incorrect since the driveway was freely, regularly and much used by vehicular traffic and its accompanying sidewalk was conveniently used by pedestr ians crossing to and from the station. Reese v. Snelson, 192 Va. 479, 65 S.E.2d 547, 1951 Va. LEXIS 196 (1951). Section prescribes no method by which crosswalk should be clearly marked. Phillip s v.

A violation of this section is negligence per se. Sprinkle v. Davis, 104 F.2d 487, 1939 U .S. App. LEXIS 4167 (4th Cir. 1939). This section applies to highways in rural sections as well as to city streets. Sprinkle v. Davis, 104 F.2d 487, 1939 U.S. App. LEXIS 4167 (4th Cir. 1939). This section applied to a pedestrian who stepped from an obscured position at the curb o r side of the road into moving traffic but was inapplicable where an individual initially stepped from a position where he could be seen by oncoming vehicles into stationary traffic stopped at a red light. Cofield v. Nuckles, 239 Va. 186, 387 S.E.2d 493, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1150, 1990 Va. LEXIS 4 (1990). Instructions held erroneous and prejudicial to defendant driver.  See Tolston v.

Automobiles, §§ 29, 32, 68. CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The provisions of this section protect a pedestrian from the quiet approach of vehicles or the confusion that may arise from the noise of the mechanism of a vehicle approaching from the rear. They give him the benefit of seeing an oncoming vehicle and an opportunity to take such action as may be necessary for his own safety. Crouse v. Pugh, 188 Va. 156, 49 S.E.2d 421, 1948 Va. LEXIS 154 (1948). One of the paramount objects of this section in requiring that the pedestrian walk facin g vehicular traffic approaching on that half of the road is that he may more readily see an oncoming vehicle and thus be in a better position to avail himself of his opportunities to avoid the dangers of the road. Fein v. Wade, 191 Va. 203, 61 S.E.2d 29, 1950 Va. LEXIS 212 (1950). Detention for violation of sec tion lawful.  A police officer is entitled to detain briefly an individual who has committed an offense, in order to obtain information required for the issuance of a summons; the arresting officer had probable cause to charge defendant with violating a city ordinance, pedestrian in the roadway, and after informing defendant that he intended to issue him a summons, the officer legally detained him. Beale v. Commonwealt h, No. 1412-96-1 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 1, 1997). Section not applicable t o person leading mule.  This section is not applicable to nor does it control the manner and circumstances under which sidewalks, streets and highways shall be used by a person leading a mule. Bayne v. Tharpe, 201 Va. 484, 111 S.E.2d 816, 1960 Va. LEXIS 119 (1960). Person removing his calf f rom public highway.  A person was not a pedestrian within the meaning of this section, and was not required by this section to walk on the left side of the highway, where he was fulfi lling his duty to remove his calf from the public highway. Virginia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Simpkins, 217 Va. 611, 231 S.E.2d 226, 1977 Va. LEXIS 209 (1977). Reciprocal rights of driver and pedestrian.  When it happens that both the driver of an automobile and a pedestrian desire, or are required, to use, at the same time, that portion of the highway prescribed f or their use, each of them must exercise his respective right to the use with due regard for the right of the other. South Hill Motor Co. v. Gordon, 172 Va. 193, 200 S.E. 637, 1939 Va. LEXIS 230 (1939). Neither a pedestrian nor the operator of a vehicle, in traveling along the portion of the highway prescribed for the use of each of them, has a right-of-way  thereon over the other, except as expressly provided by statute. South Hill Motor Co. v. Gordon, 172 Va. 193, 200 S.E. 637, 1939 Va. LEXIS 230 (1939). A pedestrian walking on the highway has the duty to use ordinary care and take reasonabl e precautions to protect himself from an oncoming vehicle and obvious danger. Fein v. Wade, 191 Va. 203, 61 S.E.2d 29, 1950 Va. LEXIS 212 (1950). Assuming, but not deciding, that Owen had the statutory right to walk on the pavement, this did not relieve him of the duty of removing himself from a positio n of obvious peril which he could easily have done. Martin v. Carrington, 193 Va. 627, 70 S.E.2d 313, 1952 Va. LEXIS 173 (1952). Plaintiff s decedent was struck by defendants car while walking along the edge of the hard surface of a highway at night. Decedent was facing oncoming tra ffic and the lights of defendants vehicle could have been readily seen by decedent several hundred feet before the car reached him, but he failed to step aside or remove himself from the path of the oncoming vehicle and maintained his position on the highway until too late to avoid being struck, though he could have stepped off the hard surface and upon the shoulder of the road. When one is under an obligation to keep a lookout, as was decedent, what the proved facts disclose he must have seen if he had looked, the jury are justified in concluding that he did see, or that he negligently failed to look. Fein v. Wade, 191 Va. 203, 61 S.E.2d 29, 1950 Va. LEXIS 212 (1950). A violation of this section amounts to negligence as a matter of law. Crouse v. Pugh, 188 Va. 156, 49 S.E.2d 421, 1948 Va. LEXIS 154 (1948); Craighead v. Sellers, 194 Va. 920, 76 S.E.2d 212, 1953 Va. LEXIS 159 (1953). And intoxication does not excuse negligence.  Intoxication of pedestrian may explain his negligent violation of this section, but such intoxication does not excuse his negligence. Hardiman v. Dyson, 194 Va. 1 16, 72 S.E.2d 361, 1952 Va. LEXIS 212 (1952); Craighead v. Sellers, 194 Va. 920, 76 S.E.2d 212, 1953 Va. LEXIS 159 (1953). Pedestrian may walk on hard surface.  The provision that pedestrians using the highways shall keep as near as reasonably possible to the extreme left side or edge of the same, does not forbid one to w alk on the edge of the hard surface or require him to walk on the edge of the natural boundary of the highway or the usable portion of such highway as generally accepted by the public. Stuart v. Coates, 186 Va. 227, 42 S.E.2d 311, 1947 Va. LEXIS 145 (194 7). But walking near center line of highway on dark and misty night is gross negligence.  Though it might not be gross negligence to walk in the daytime near the center line of a concrete roadway occupied by moving automobiles where the sidewalk was im passable, to walk there on a dark and misty night without heeding vehicles approaching from behind is certainly gross negligence as well as a violation of this section which requires a pedestrian at all times to keep as near to the extreme left of the hi ghway as is possible. Saunders v. Temple, 154 Va. 714, 153 S.E. 691, 1930 Va. LEXIS 243 (1930). Doctrine of last clear chance.  The doctrine of last clear chance is not applicable when plaintiff walked on the wrong side of the street, in violation of this section, and under conditions whic h a reasonably prudent person would recognize as dangerous, and not only created a condition out of which the collision arose but which was an immediate, efficient contributing cause. Anderson v. Payne, 189 Va. 712, 54 S.E.2d 82, 1949 Va. LEXIS 212 (1949 ). Violations of this section held not to preclude operation of doctrine of last clear chance. Hoffecker v. Jenkins, 151 F.2d 951, 1945 U.S. App. LEXIS 3060 (4th Cir . 1945). Violations con stituting contributory negligence.  Pedestrian who was struck by automobile while standing upon paved portion of the highway was held guilty of contributory negligence barring recovery. Martin v. Ca rrington, 193 Va. 627, 70 S.E.2d 313, 1952 Va. LEXIS 173 (1952). In an action to recover for the death of plaintiffs decedent who was killed when struck by defendants automobile, it was held that two acts of negligence of plaintiffs decedent, walking improperly on the edge of the highway in violation of this section, and running in front of defendants car, amounted to such contributory negligence as to bar a recovery. Hutcheson v. Misenheimer, 169 Va. 511, 194 S.E. 665, 1938 Va. LEXIS 228 (1938). The decedent was walking within the traveled portion of the highway with his back to traffic when a sidewalk was available, in violation of this section. He conti nued to walk in a place of danger in violation of this section up to the moment of the impact. He could have removed himself from danger at any time prior to the impact. The evidence established that the act of the decedent was more than a condition of t he accident  it was the immediate, proximate and efficient cause, and never became remote. Russell v. Hammond, 200 Va. 600, 106 S.E.2d 626, 1959 Va. LEXIS 144 (1959). Negligence in standing on wrong side of highway held not proximate cause of injury.  See Bray v. Boston Lumber &amp; Bldrs. Corp., 161 Va. 686, 172 S.E. 296, 1934 Va. LEXIS 294 (1934); Gregory v. Daniel, 173 Va. 442, 4 S.E.2d 786, 1939 Va. LEXIS 212 ( 1939). Questions for jury.  In an action for wrongful death, a truck owned by defendants struck a horse which decedent was leading on the right-hand side of the highway and the horse in turn ran into or was thrown upon decedent, causing his death. Defendants contended that decedent was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law in walking on the right-hand side of the highway in violation of this section. It was held that it was f or the jury to say whether the violation of the statute was a remote cause and the negligence of the driver of defendants truck was the proximate cause of the accident. Clay v. Bishop, 182 Va. 746, 30 S.E.2d 585, 1944 Va. LEXIS 229 (1944). Whether a violation of this section be a remote cause or the cause which proximately contributes to the injury is a question for the jury. Crouse v. Pugh, 188 Va. 156, 49 S.E.2d 421, 1948 Va. LEXIS 154 (1948). Whether the shoulder of a highway was of sufficient width to permit plaintiff to walk upon it was a question of fact for the jury. Whitfield v. Dunn, 202 Va. 472, 117 S.E.2d 710, 1961 Va. LEXIS 131 (1961). Whether plaintiff acted as an ordinarily prudent person would have in assuming that defendant would drive upon that portion of the highway improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, until he knew or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known otherwise, was a question of fact for the jury.

The 2008 amendments. The 2008 amendment by c. 503, in the first sentence, inserted or in any portion of the right-of-way of any highway where loitering has been determined by the Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner or the local governing body of any city or town to present a public safety hazard and on and or the governing body of any city or town. The 2009 amendments. The 2009 amendment by c. 432 twice inserted county before city, or town and inserted the next-to-last sentence. CASE NOTES Constitutionality.  For discussion of constitutionality of this section, in context of a challenge brought by abortion protestors threatened with arrest thereunder, see Lytle v. Brew er, 73 F. Supp. 2d 615, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17275 (E.D. Va. 1999); Lytle v. Brewer, 77 F. Supp. 2d 730, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19522 (E.D. Va. 1999). Because § 46.2-930 did not provide fair warning to protestors that they might be arrested for participating in a peaceful demonstration, application of the sta tute to them was invalid; however, the statute was not unconstitutional on its face since restricting activity on particular bridges to protect specific safety concerns might be constitutional.

Such time shall be at least five days after such arrest unless the person arrested demands an earlier hearing. Such person shall, if he so desires, have a right to an immediate hearing, or a hearing within 24 hours at a convenient hour, before a court having jurisdiction under this title within the county, city, or town wherein such offense was committed. Upon the giving by such person of his written promise to appear at such time and place, the off icer shall forthwith release him from custody.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 19 M.J. Warrants, § 2. CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. A police officer is entitled to detain briefly an individual who has committed an offense, in order to obtain information required for the issuance of a summons; the arresting officer had probable cause to charge defendant with violating a city ordinance, pedestrian in the roadway, and after informing defendant that he intended to is sue him a summons, the officer legally detained him. Beale v. Commonwealth, No. 1412-96-1 (Ct. of Appeals Apr. 1, 1997). Summons for speeding held to give sufficient notice of offense charged.  Where appellant was issued a summons for speeding on a named street under an ordinance substantially paralleling this section, it was held that the summon s was sufficient to advise him that he was charged with the offense of exceeding the speed limit fixed by law for such street and thus his conviction was proper. Ladd v. Lamb, 195 Va. 1031, 81 S.E.2d 756, 1954 Va. LEXIS 181 (1954) (see Lamb v. Lanzarone, 195 Va. 1038, 81 S.E.2d 760 (1954)). Issuance or serv ice of formal warrant unnecessary.  The clear and necessary implication to be drawn from the language of § 19.2-75, with regard to a copy of process being left with accused, when read along with this section, is that when a summons is issued under this section there is no need for the issuance or service of a formal warrant. Tate v. Lamb, 195 Va. 1005, 81 S.E.2d 743, 1954 Va. LEXIS 178 (1954). A summons issued under this section constituted both the charge of the offense and process upon the accused. Service of a warrant was thus unnecessary. Badalson v . Lamb, 195 Va. 1018, 81 S.E.2d 750, 1954 Va. LEXIS 179 (1954). Jurisdiction to convict defendant for speeding violation on naval base.  Since the Little Creek Amphibious Base was acquired by the United States, under the provisions of Title 3, Chapter 4, § 19, Virginia Code of 1942, a state cess ion statute, and since under the provisions of that cession statute, Virginia retained concurrent criminal jurisdiction, this state retained concurrent jurisdiction over the Little Creek Amphibious Base for the enforcement of laws regarding traffic infra ctions; the circuit court, consequently, had jurisdiction to convict the appellant for a speeding violation while on that naval base. Gay v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 229, 391 S.E.2d 737, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2273, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 72 (1990). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability to speeding charges.  Motion to dismiss a Fairfax County speeding charge against a defendant was denied since: (1) the charge was not a misdemeanor requiring immediate hearing upon his request under § 46.2-936 as the penalty (a fine of up to $200) was less than for the lowest misdemeanor, and § 46.2-100 defined a traffic infraction as a violation of law punishable as provided in § 46.2-113, which was neither a felony nor a mi sdemeanor; and (2) dismissal was not the remedy for a statutory (as opposed to constitutional) violation of § 46.2-936. Commonwealth v. Towarnicky, 67 Va. Cir. 17, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 30 (Fairfax County Jan. 20, 2005). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Sentencing.  Trial court may not order a person convicted of a felony to serve any confinement in jail on weekends or nonconsecutive days. The plain language of § 53.1-131. 1, limits the courts authority to convictions for misdemeanors, traffic offenses and violations of Chapter 5 (§ 20-61 et seq.) Title 20.

CASE NOTES Knowledge and intent not ele ment of offense.  Neither this section, nor language contained elsewhere in the Motor Vehicle Code, provides that knowledge or intent is an element of an offense. Williams v. Commo nwealth, 5 Va. App. 514, 365 S.E.2d 340, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1872, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 36 (1988) (decided under prior law). Statutory language requiring a fact finder to consider calibration evidence in determining guilt or innocence of speeding was not meant to require proof of intent or knowledge as an element of a speeding conviction. Having concluded that this section was not intended to make knowledge or intent an element in a speeding charge when calibration evidence is introduced, the trial court did not err in refusing to so i nstruct the jury. Williams v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 514, 365 S.E.2d 340, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1872, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 36 (1988) (decided under prior law). Pacing.  Omission of pacing from the methods for determining speed enumerated in § 46.2-882 does not invalidate it as an appropriate means of proving the speed of the v ehicle as § 46.2-942 clearly contemplates the use of pacing as a method of determining a vehicles speed by authorizing the admission of calibration tests to prove the accuracy of an arresting officers speedometer. Savage v. Commonwealth, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 327 (Va. Ct. App. July 21, 2009). Inaccurate speedometer.  There is no language in this section supporting the argument that the legislature intended an incorrect speedometer reading to constitute an absolute bar to a con viction for speeding. In a speeding case the only issue is whether the defendants vehicle was in fact exceeding the lawful maximum speed. If so, he is guilty; if not, he is innocent. The calibration report is admissible in evidence and the fact finde r under the statute may give it such weight as it deems proper under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Williams v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 514, 365 S.E.2d 340, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1872, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 36 (1988) (decided under prior law ). The legislature, in enacting former § 46.1-193 (see now §§ 46.2-870 through 46.2-878), did not intend to bar a conviction for speeding for persons with i naccurate speedometers. Such an interpretation would discourage motorists from repairing defective speedometers and encourage tampering with them so as to prevent a conviction for speeding. The court does not think the legislature intended to encourage a result that would foster unlawful activity. Williams v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 514, 365 S.E.2d 340, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1872, 1988 Va.

For related discussion, see 5B M.J. Criminal Procedure, §§ 70, 86. CASE NOTES Construction with § 19.2-295.1.  Because the General Assembly does not expressly refer to § 46.2-943, a statute related to sentencing proceedings in bifurcated trials for traffic offenses, whe n it enacted § 19.2-295.1, it did not intend to impose the § 19.2-295.1 notice requirements as a prerequisite for the admissibility of a defendants prior traffic record into evidence pursuant to § 46.2-943; section 46.2-943 is the more speci fic statute, and § 19.2-295.1 notice requirements do not apply to the admission of a defendants prior traffic record into evidence pursuant to § 46.2-943. Ngomondjami v. Commonwealth, 54 Va. App. 310, 678 S.E.2d 281, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 296 (20 09). Evidence of prior driving under the influence (DUI) convictions does not constitute the traffic record as contemplated by this section where the offense charged under § 18.2-266 is a subsequent offense of DUI punishable under § 18.2-270. Proof of such charge requires proof of the prior DUI convictions, and a trial court, ther efore, does not err in admitting evidence of a defendants prior DUI convictions independent of his prior traffic record during the guilt stage of the trial. Farmer v. Commonwealth, 10 Va. App. 175, 390 S.E.2d 775, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1958, 1990 Va. App. L EXIS 60 (1990). Since evidence of prior driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) convictions does not constitute the traffic record as contemplated by this section wh ere the offense charged under § 18.2-266 is a subsequent offense of DUI punishable under § 18.2-270, and since proof of such charge requires proof of prior DUI convictions, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendants prior D UI convictions independent of his prior traffic record during the guilt stage of the trial.

Admission of Department of Motor Vehicle record at sentencing phase proper.  Trial court did not err by admitting defendants Department of Motor Vehicles record into evidence at the sentencing phase of his trial for driving under the i nfluence of alcohol in violation of § 18.2-266 because when the jury found defendant guilty of driving under the influence, authorized the admission of his DMV record into evidence during the sentencing phase as evidence of his prior traffic record; a DMV record is admissible evidence of a defendants prior traffic record.

Department to suspend registration of vehicles lacking certain equipment; officer to take possession of registration card, license plates and d ecals when observing defect in motor vehicle; when to be returned. Text The Department shall suspend the registration of any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer which the Department or the Department of State Police determines is not equ ipped with proper (i) brakes, (ii) lights, (iii) horn or warning device, (iv) turn signals, (v) safety glass when required by law, (vi) mirror, (vii) muffler, (viii) windshield wiper, (ix) steering gear adequate to ensure the safe movement of the vehicle as required by this title or when such vehicle is equipped with a smoke screen device or cutout or when such motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is otherwise unsafe to be operated. Any law-enforcement officer shall, when he observes any defect in a motor vehicle as described above, take possession of the registration card, license plates, and deca ls of any such vehicle and retain the same in his possession for a period of 15 days unless the owner of the vehicle corrects the defects or obtains a new safety inspection sticker from an authorized safety inspection station. When the defect or defects are corrected as indicated above the registration card, license plates, and decals shall be returned to the owner. For any summons issued for a violation of this section, the court may, in its discretion, dismiss the summons, where proof of compliance with this section is provided t o the court on or before the court date.

Such law-enforcement officer may allow any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer discovered to be in such an unsafe condition while being opera ted on the highway to continue in operation only to the nearest place where repairs can be safely effected and only if such operation is less hazardous to the public than to permit the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer to remain on the highway. No person shall operate a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer which has been removed from service as provided in the foregoing provisions of this section prior to co rrection and proper authorization by a law-enforcement officer certified to perform vehicle safety inspection procedures. For the purpose of this section, the term law-enforcement officer certified to perform vehicle safety inspections means those law-enforcement officers who have satisfactorily met the requirements for initial certification and maintenance of certification of driver/vehicle inspectors as prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Those law-enforcement officer s certified to place vehicles out of service must receive annual in-service training in current federal motor carrier safety regulations, safety inspection procedures, and out-of-service criteria. The Superintendent of State Police shall be responsible f or coordinating the annual in-service training. The agency administrator of the law-enforcement agencies employing law-enforcement officers certified to perform vehicle safety inspections shall provide the Department of Criminal Justice Services with ver ification that law-enforcement officers certified to perform vehicle safety inspections have met the requirements for initial certification and maintenance of certification of driver/vehicle inspectors prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and satisfactorily completed the annual in-service training required by this section. Every vehicle inspected by a local law-enforcement officer pursuant to this section and found to be free of defects which would constitute grounds for removal of the ve hicle from service shall be issued a sticker as evidence of such inspection and freedom from defects. Such stickers shall be valid for 90 days. Any vehicle displaying a valid sticker shall be exempt from local or State Police inspections under this secti on. However, the fact that a vehicle displays a valid sticker shall not prevent any local or State Police officer from stopping and inspecting the vehicle if he observes an obvious safety defect. The Superintendent of State Police shall work cooperativel y with local law-enforcement agencies of localities whose officers are authorized to perform inspections pursuant to this section to develop a standard sticker as provided for in this section and uniform policies and procedures for issuance and display o f such stickers. However, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, before placing any vehicle out of service, the vehicle operator shall be allowed two hours to effect repairs to his vehicle. Such repairs may be performed at the site where the vehicle was inspected and found to be unsafe, provided the vehicle requiring repair is off the highway, where the repairs can be effected safely. If such repairs remedy the condi tion or conditions that would have caused it to be taken out of service, it shall not be taken out of service, but allowed to resume its operations. No such repairs, however, shall be allowed if the vehicles load consists of hazardous material as def ined in § 10.1-1400.

Special equipment required for converted electric vehicles. Text In addition to any other equipment required by this chapter, no converted electric vehicle may be registered in or operated on the highways of the Commonwealth without the following: 1. Orang e-colored high voltage cables and high voltage markings on all conduit containing high voltage cables. No high voltage cables may be attached to the chassis of the vehicle in such a way as to cause the chassis to be used to ground the electric current; 2. A breaker or fuse in the high voltage circuit that contains the traction battery pack and the motor controller. Such breaker or fuse must be rated to interrupt the expected maximum cur rent at or above the battery pack voltage; 3. An externally mounted switch to open the high voltage circuit in case of an emergency. Such switch must be located where the fuel tank filler cap was located prior to conversion. Any c over protecting the switch must be able to be opened from the outside of the vehicle; 4. Traction batteries mounted in secure nonconductive enclosures that provide for limited access. Multiple enclosures may be used but must be connected by high voltage cables encased in c onduit made of metal, composite, or other materials of comparable strength, crush, and abrasion resistance to metal or composite; 5. If batteries other than lead acid batteries are used as traction batteries, a temperature monitoring system that monitors the temperature of at least one battery in each battery enclos ure. Such system must warn the driver of the vehicle if the temperature of the battery is rising rapidly or is above safe levels; 6. Conduit made of metal, composite, or other materials of comparable strength, crush, and abrasion resistance to metal or composite, encasing any high voltage cables running under or out side of the vehicle. Such conduit must be secured to the vehicle chassis and must not violate the ground clearance provisions of § 46.2-1063; 7. A vacuum system and pump, or comparable equipment, to maintain proper brake function and capacity, as required by this chapter; and 8. Labeling on three sides of the vehicle identifying such vehicle as CONVERTED ELECTRIC. Each label shall be at least six inches long and consist of lettering at least three inch es tall.At such time as the federal government establishes minimum equipment and safety standards, including any related to synthetic vehicle sounds, for converted electric vehicles, to the extent that such standards are different from the standards esta blished by this section, the federal standards sha...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-1002"><akn:num>§ 46.2-1002</akn:num><akn:heading>Illegal possession or sale of certain unapproved equipment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text It shall be unlawful for any person to possess with intent to sell or offer for sale, either separately or as a part of the equipment of a motor vehicle, or to use or h ave as equipment on a motor vehicle operated on a highway any lighting device, warning device, signal device, safety glass, or other equipment for which approval is required by any provision of this chapter or any part or parts tending to change or alter the operation of such device, glass, or other equipment unless of a type that has been submitted to and approved by the Superintendent or meets or exceeds the standards and specifications of the Society of Automotive Engineers, the American National Sta ndards Institute, Incorporated or the federal Department of Transportation.

Annotations CASE NOTES Passenger side mirror.  Commonwealths claim that mirrors were equipment items subject to an annual motor vehicle inspection under §§ 46.2-1157 and 46.2-1158, and that the inspe ction requirement made mirrors equipment for which approval was required under § 46.2-1002 was rejected; defendants vehicle had working drivers side and rearview mirrors, and under § 46.2-1082, defendant did not need a passengers side m irror. Any defect in the passengers side mirror was not a violation of the minimum requirements, or a defective equipment violation under § 46.2-1003. Commonwealth v. Snyder, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 14, 2007). Tail lights.  Grant of a motion to suppress drugs seized from a vehicle was vacated because under the facts before him, specifically the vehicles clear tail light lenses, i t was reasonable for a state trooper to believe that a § 46.2-1013 traffic violation may have been committed and, therefore, the stop was objectively reasonable. United States v. McHugh, 349 Fed. Appx. 824, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 24153 (4th Cir. 2009). Reflective tail light.  Officers suspicion that the reflective tail lights on defendants truck were an equipment violation was reasonable and justified an investigative stop of t he truck; the officer recited observed facts concerning the reflective tail lights which reasonably supported the officers belief that they might violate equipment requirements and the officer corroborated that testimony with a photograph of the ligh ts. Javier-Paz v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 83 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 19, 2013). Broken brake light provided reasonable suspicion for traffic stop.  Trial court erred in granting defendants motion to suppress evidence a police officer obtained pursuant to a traffic stop of his vehicle because § 46.2-101 4.1 required defendants vehicle to be equipped with a supplemental center high mount stop light, and the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe defendant was in violation of § 46.2-1003 since the officer observed that the vehicles brake l ight was defective; drivers have a duty to keep their vehicles from falling into an unsafe or defective condition. Commonwealth v. Gaskins, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (Va. Ct. App. May 24, 2011). Trial court correctly denied defendants motion to suppress because a deputys stop of defendants vehicle was based on a reasonable, articulable suspici on that the vehicle had defective brake lights, in violation of §§ 46.2-1002 and 46.2-1003. Otey v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 346, 735 S.E.2d 255, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 421 (2012). License plate lights.  Trial court properly denied defendants motion to suppress because the basis of the stop of the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger, that the car had tw o lights that were intended to illuminate the license plate but only the left light was lit, and the right light was not functioning, was objectively reasonable; if both lights illuminating the license plate were not operational, the equipment was defect ive, no matter how minimal. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 272 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 31, 2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction with § 46.2-1020.  Section 46.2-1020 contains no requirement that equipment be a type approved by the Superintendent of the Department of State Police of the Commonwealth an d therefore subject to the provisions of §§ 46.2-1002 and 46.2-1003; therefore they are not lighting devices governed by § 46.2-1002 and their defective condition is not prohibited by § 46.2-1003. Commonwealth v. Najera, 68 Va. Cir. 17, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 24 (Fairfax County Feb. 1, 2005). Since state police approval under § 46.2-1002 was not required for § 46.2-1020 equipment, the defendants noncompliance with § 46.2-1020 for the car s front left side marker light being out was not a violation of § 46.2-1003 so the officers stop and search of the defendants car violated Terry and evidence from the search was suppressed.

For annual survey article, see Criminal Law and Procedure, 48 U. Rich. L. Rev. 63 (2013). CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  The apparent intent of § 46.2-1003 is to compel automobile owners to repair or replace any of their vehicles equipment that falls into a defective or unsaf e condition. Defendants harmonization of § 46.2-1003 with § 46.2-1013 had the effect of eviscerating the impact of § 46.2-1003 because it would create an entire class of equipment that could be legally used on a vehicle in an unsafe or defe ctive condition simply because the equipment was in excess of the Codes minimum requirements. The court refused to construe the two provisions to achieve such an unwarranted result. Ragland v. Commonwealth, No. 1036-96-2 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 18, 199 7). Retroactive application.  Seizure provision of Va. Code Ann. § 46.2-1003(C) was a substantive change in the law and could not be applied retroactively to render the stop of defendant s car for a defective front bumper illegal, because the evidentiary prong of the statute, though procedural, was only triggered by a seizure that violated the substantive portion of the statute. Swinson v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 61 (Va. Ct . App. Jan. 31, 2023). The statute is not restricted in application to unapproved equipment. Myree v. Commonwea lth, No. 0383-98-2 (Ct. of Appeals Mar. 2, 1999). Cracked windshield provided reasonable suspicion for stop.  Where an officer observed that defendants vehicle had a crack in the windshield that spanned the entire length of the windshield, a traffic stop was proper un der the Fourth Amendment because the cracked windshield provided the basis for a reasonable suspicion that defendant was operating a vehicle with defective equipment. United States v. Washington, 439 F. Supp. 2d 589, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52064 (E.D. Va. 2006), aff'd, 338 Fed. Appx. 316, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 16364 (4th Cir. 2009). Broken passenger side mirror.  Commonwealths claim that mirrors were equipment items subject to an annual motor vehicle inspection under §§ 46.2-1157 and 46.2-1158, and that the inspe ction requirement made mirrors equipment for which approval was required under § 46.2-1002 was rejected; defendants vehicle had working drivers side and rearview mirrors, and under § 46.2-1082, defendant did not need a passengers side m irror. Any defect in the passengers side mirror was not a violation of the minimum requirements, or a defective equipment violation under § 46.2-1003. Commonwealth v. Snyder, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 307 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 14, 2007). Broken brake light provided reasonable suspicion for traffic stop.  Trial court erred in granting defendants motion to suppress evidence a police officer obtained pursuant to a traffic stop of his vehicle because § 46.2-101 4.1 required defendants vehicle to be equipped with a supplemental center high mount stop light, and the officer had reasonable suspicion to believe defendant was in violation of § 46.2-1003 since the officer observed that the vehicles brake l ight was defective; drivers have a duty to keep their vehicles from falling into an unsafe or defective condition. Commonwealth v. Gaskins, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (Va. Ct. App. May 24, 2011). Trial court correctly denied defendants motion to suppress because a deputys stop of defendants vehicle was based on a reasonable, articulable suspici on that the vehicle had defective brake lights, in violation of §§ 46.2-1002 and 46.2-1003. Otey v. Commonwealth, 61 Va. App. 346, 735 S.E.2d 255, 2012 Va. App. LEXIS 421 (2012). License plate lights.  Trial court properly denied defendants motion to suppress because the basis of the stop of the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger, that the car had tw o lights that were intended to illuminate the license plate but only the left light was lit, and the right light was not functioning, was objectively reasonable; if both lights illuminating the license plate were not operational, the equipment was defect ive, no matter how minimal. Lewis v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 272 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 31, 2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction with § 46.2-1020.  Section 46.2-1020 contains no requirement that equipment be a type approved by the Superintendent of the Department of State Police of the Commonwealth an d therefore subject to the provisions of §§ 46.2-1002 and 46.2-1003; therefore they are not lighting devices governed by § 46.2-1002 and their defective condition is not prohibited by § 46.2-1003. Commonwealth v. Najera, 68 Va. Cir. 17, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 24 (Fairfax County Feb. 1, 2005). Since state police approval under § 46.2-1002 was not required for § 46.2-1020 equipment, the defendants noncompliance with § 46.2-1020 for the car s front left side marker light being out was not a violation of § 46.2-1003 so the officers stop and search of the defendants car violated Terry and evidence from the search was suppressed.

Defendants harmonization of § 46.2-1003 with § 46.2-1013 had the effect of eviscerating the impact of § 46.2-1003 because it would create an entire class of equipment that could be legally used on a vehicle in an unsafe or defe ctive condition simply because the equipment was in excess of the Codes minimum requirements. The court refused to construe the two provisions to achieve such an unwarranted result. Ragland v. Commonwealth, No. 1036-96-2 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 18, 199 7). Compliance.  Motor vehicles operating on the highways of this State are required to comply with the statutes relating to lighting equipment in effect at the time of their oper ation. Hall v. Hockaday, 206 Va. 792, 146 S.E.2d 215, 1966 Va. LEXIS 151 (1966) (decided under prior law). Reasonable suspicion.  Grant of a motion to suppress drugs seized from a vehicle was vacated because under the facts before him, specifically the vehicles clear tail light lenses, i t was reasonable for a state trooper to believe that a § 46.2-1013 traffic violation may have been committed and, therefore, the stop was objectively reasonable. United States v. McHugh, 349 Fed. Appx. 824, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 24153 (4th Cir. 2009). Trial court properly denied defendants motion to suppress because the basis of the stop of the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger, that the car had tw o lights that were intended to illuminate the license plate but only the left light was lit, and the right light was not functioning, was objectively reasonable; if both lights illuminating the license plate were not operational, the equipment was defect ive, no matter how minimal.

Commonwealth v. Gaskins, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 180 (Va. Ct. App. May 24, 2011). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statutory change and motion to sup press.  Section 1-238 lays out the general principles against retroactive application of statutes, which do not apply when changes are procedural, as § 1-239 allows fo r their retroactive application; statutory change that forbid police officers from stopping vehicles solely for violation of certain statutes did not alter § 46.2-1014.1 Bs punishment and instead created an evidentiary rule. Court excluded evidenc e obtained during traffic stop due to the statutory change that became effective after the stop occurred. Commonwealth v. Hardy, 2021 Va. Cir.

The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. The first paragraph applies to vehicles parked upon a highway as well as to vehicles bei ng operated upon a highway. To this extent, this section overlaps and supplements former § 46.1-276 (see now § 46.2-1037). Allen v. Brooks, 203 Va. 357, 124 S.E.2d 18, 1962 Va. LEXIS 151 (1962). Failure to display headlights justifies verdict for passenger in other car.  Where plaintiff was a passenger in a car which, while passing another vehicle was involved in a head-on collision with defendants car, and where there was cre dible evidence that defendants car was not displaying headlights as required by the first paragraph, a jury verdict for plaintiff was affirmed on appeal. Carter v. Nelms, 204 Va. 338, 131 S.E.2d 401, 1963 Va. LEXIS 154 (1963). Failure to turn on headlights insufficient for conviction of involuntary manslaughter.  Where evidence in a criminal prosecution showed at most only an inadvertent failure by the defendant to turn on her white headlights rather than her amber running or parking lights, this act of omission was no more than ordinary negligence, an insufficient predicate for a conviction of involuntary manslaughter. King v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 601, 231 S.E.2d 312, 1977 Va. LEXIS 208 (1977). Instruction using former language of section.  In a case that arose prior to the 1960 amendment, it was held that an instruction was proper which used the language of the first paragraph, notwithstanding the c ontention that the phrase persons in vehicles was an obvious clerical error.

Text No person shall operate for a commercial purpose a truck, trailer, or semitrailer with tires on any highway in the Commonwealth if any officer authorized to enforce ove rweight vehicle laws determines upon weighing such truck, trailer, or semitrailer that any such tire carries a weight greater than 125 percent of that marked on the sidewall of the tire. The provisions of this section shall not apply to: 1. Any v ehicle that is being operated under the terms of a permit issued under Article 18 (§ 46.2-1139 et seq.) and is being operated at a reduced speed as required by the permit to compensate for the tire loading in excess of the manufacturers rated capa city for the tire; 2. Any vehicle having a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more; 3. Any manufactured home; or 4. Any vehicle not required to be registered.

For comment, Automobile Noise  An Effective Method for Control, see 4 U. Rich. L. Rev. 314 (1970). CASE NOTES Stop based on excessive and unus ual noise.  Traffic stop was justified because an officer testified that the exhaust noise from defendants car was unusual and excessive in comparison to similar vehicles , and a district court did not err when it found that this excessive and unusual noise supported a reasonable and articulable suspicion of a violation of § 46.2-1049.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Retroactivity.  Regardless of whether this sections former prohibition against stopping vehicles for defective exhaust was substantive, procedural, or a mixture of both for p urposes of a retroactivity analysis, drug evidence from a stop of defendants vehicle for defective exhaust was admissible because the stop occurred before the effective date of the prohibition and thus did not violate it.

CASE NOTES Obstructing drivers view.  Trial court erred in granting defendants motion to suppress evidence seized in an investigatory stop and consent to search, pursuant to § 19.2-266.2, as th e police officer who stopped defendants car had observed an air freshener hanging from the rear view mirror and determined that it was so big as to constitute a possible obstruction to the drivers view; pursuant to a review of the officers in vestigatory stop, the trial court should have merely determined whether the officer, under the totality of the circumstances, had a reasonable and articulable belief that the freshener could have constituted a violation of § 46.2-1054, not whether it in fact was such an obstruction, as that was an inquiry for the trial court or jury. Commonwealth v. Bryant, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 283 (Va. Ct. App. June 15, 2004). Trial court erred in denying defendants motion to suppress because the Fourth Amendment was violated when a police officer made a traffic stop and search of a vehicle that he mistakenly believed was violating the law by having a 3 x 5 parking pass hanging from the rearview mirror where there was nothing about the drivers driving that made the officer believe that the drivers view was obstructe d, and the trial court stated that the pass would not obstruct the drivers view of the highway. Mason v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 587, 760 S.E.2d 831, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 276 (2014). Officer mistakenly believed that any object hanging from the vehicles mirror constituted an offense under this section. Mason v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 714 , 762 S.E.2d 806, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 308 (2014). Underlying the statute is the General Assemblys unstated, but implied, recognition that a drivers ability to see clearly through an unobstructed windshiel d is crucial to the safety of the driver as well as others sharing the road. Mason v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 292, 767 S.E.2d 726, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (2015), aff'd, 291 Va. 362, 786 S.E.2d 148, 2016 Va. LEXIS 59 (2016). Because a highway includes the entire width between the boundary lines of the way or place used by vehicular traffic, it includes overhead highway signs, on-ramps and off-ramps, merge lanes, deceleration lanes, roadways, bridges, intersections, shoulders, pedestrian crosswalks, and shared-use paths; thus, a clear view of the highway, as used in § 46.2-1054, means the pavement itself and everyth ing physically on it. Mason v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 292, 767 S.E.2d 726, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (2015), aff'd, 291 Va. 362, 786 S.E.2d 148, 2016 Va. LEXIS 59 (2016). Investigatory stop.  Suppression of evidence was not warranted in a drug case because an officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion that defendant was operating his vehicle in vi olation of a view obstruction statute; a tree-shaped air freshener was large enough that the officer was able to see it from his own vehicle as he passed defendant on a two-lane road. Richardson v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 98 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2014). Defendants motion to suppress was properly denied because a reasonable officer could make an investigatory stop of the sedan defendant was riding in to determ ine if, in fact, the parking pass the officer observed hanging from the rearview mirror violated the statute; the police officer testified that he clearly observed the parking pass prior to stopping the vehicle, and a reasonable officer could suspect tha t the parking pass could violate the statute and thus, warrant an investigatory stop. Mason v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 292, 767 S.E.2d 726, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (2015), aff'd, 291 Va. 362, 786 S.E.2d 148, 2016 Va. LEXIS 59 (2016). Defendants motion to suppress evidence obtained after traffic stop was properly denied, as an officer had a reasonable suspicion that a clump of air freshener s hanging from defendants rearview mirror might have obstructed his clear view of the highway, in violation of this section. Freeman v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. App. 407, 778 S.E.2d 519, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 332 (2015). Where an officer saw a large clump of air fresheners hanging from defendants rearview mirror, as the officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was vio lating this section, the contraband the officer seized after he stopped defendants vehicle was admissible regardless of the constitutionality vel non of this section, which, as a duly enacted statute, was presumed to be constitutional. Freeman v. Com monwealth, 65 Va. App. 407, 778 S.E.2d 519, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 332 (2015). Because the trial court did not err in deciding that an objective officer could have reasonably concluded that the object dangling from the rear-view mirror might violate the law, justifying an investigatory stop, and that a reasonable person could readily conclude that the tag might have violated the law as the tag was sufficiently prominent to attract the detaining officers attention during the brief moment s that it passed through his field of view, the objective facts and circumstances were such as to create a reasonable suspicion that a violation of the law was occurring, justifying an investigatory stop of the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger, and that defendants Fourth Amendment rights were not violated thereby. Mason v. Commonwealth, 291 Va. 362, 786 S.E.2d 148, 2016 Va. LEXIS 59 (2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Constitutionality.  This section was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to a black, tree-shaped air freshener dangling from the rear view mirror of defendants vehicle where the statute unambiguously provided that any object suspended from a vehicle that obstructed a drivers clear view of the highway through the windshield, thereby providing fair notice of its prohibitions, and the statute did not confer unlimited discre tion on law enforcement to determine whether an offense had occurred. City of Chesapeake v. Evans, 91 Va. Cir. 247, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 244 (Chesapeake Sept. 29, 2015). Suspension o f objects so as to obstruct drivers view.  This section, which prohibits those objects which are suspended from the rear view mirror in such a manner as to obstruct the drivers clear view of the highwa y through the windshield, is clear and unambiguous. Commonwealth v. Penn, 61 Va. Cir. 25, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 156 (Winchester Jan. 13, 2003). Object on rearview mirror gives probable cause to stop vehicle.  Motion to suppress was denied because the presence of an object that was dangling from defendants rearview mirror and that could have violated § 46.2-1054 gave the arresting officer probable cause to stop his car and the fact that the officer could not describe the object at a suppression hearing was not relevant to probable cause. Commonwealth v. Floode, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 70 (Fairfax County Apr. 24, 200 7).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_46.2-1055"><akn:num>§ 46.2-1055</akn:num><akn:heading>Windshield wipers</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Every permanent windshield on a motor vehicle shall be equipped with a device for cleaning snow, rain, moisture, or other matter from the windshield directly in front o f the driver.

For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Automobiles, § 126.1. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Constitutionality.  The second paragraph of this section (now the second paragraph of subsection A of this section) as it stood prior to the 1978 amendments created an irrebuttable p resumption which was violative of due process. Read as a whole, the paragraph permitted conviction of the offense of operating a motor vehicle equipped with a radar detector upon proof of the mere presence of the detector, despite credible evidence that the device was inaccessible or unavailable for use. Thus, it permitted the presumption to be applied as a purely arbitrary mandate, violative of due process. Crenshaw v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 38, 245 S.E.2d 243, 1978 Va. LEXIS 157 (1978) (citing, but exp ressing no opinion upon the effect of the 1978 amendments.). Because of the wording of this section, it is all but frivolous to suggest that the section fails to give adequate warning of what activities it proscribes or fai ls to set out explicit standards for those who must apply it; accordingly, this section is not unconstitutionally vague. Bryant Radio Supply, Inc. v. Slane, 507 F. Supp. 1325, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12042 (W.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 669 F.2d 921, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 22248 (4th Cir. 1982). This section furthers a significant state interest in the health or safety of Virginias motorists and its impact on interstate commerce, while existent, is no t unduly burdensome. Bryant Radio Supply, Inc. v. Slane, 507 F. Supp. 1325, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12042 (W.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 669 F.2d 921, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 22248 (4th Cir. 1982). The General Assembly was not precluded from enacting this section by the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution or by the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 151 et seq. Crenshaw v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 38, 245 S.E.2d 243, 1978 Va. LEXIS 157 (1978). Since there was neither an actual conflict between this section and the Communications Act, nor evidence of a clear and manifest purpose of Congress to pr eempt the field of radio reception, the challenged Virginia statute was found not to violate the supremacy clause. Bryant Radio Supply, Inc. v. Slane, 507 F. Supp. 1325, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12042 (W.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 669 F.2d 921, 1982 U.S. App. LEX IS 22248 (4th Cir. 1982). This section was found not to have been preempted by federal law since under current standards, a state statute is to be held violative of the supremacy clause on ly when Congress has clearly manifested an intent that its legislation be given preemptive effect, or when an actual conflict exists between the state and federal statutory schemes. Bryant Radio Supply, Inc. v. Slane, 507 F. Supp. 1325, 1981 U.S. Dist. L EXIS 12042 (W.D. Va. 1981), aff'd, 669 F.2d 921, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 22248 (4th Cir. 1982). No conflict with federal reg ulatory system.  There is no conflict between the prohibition of this section and the federal regulatory system established by the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. § 151 e t seq. Crenshaw v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 38, 245 S.E.2d 243, 1978 Va. LEXIS 157 (1978). The known purpose of police radar is to regulate the speed of motor vehicles on the highway. This purpose would be thwarted by the unregulated use of the rada r detectors encompassed within the prohibition of this section. Thus, in regulating radar detectors, this section, rather than conflicting with the federal regulatory function, actually complements this function by protecting the effectivenes s of essential police radio communication. Crenshaw v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 38, 245 S.E.2d 243, 1978 Va. LEXIS 157 (1978). Cause to search vehicle for radar detection device.  Where a state trooper observed a vehicle exceeding the speed limit and then slowing down abruptly after the officer activated his radar device, the trooper was ju stified in stopping the speeding vehicle and searching for a radar detection device.

Annotations CASE NOTES Inaccurate speedometer.  There is no language in former § 46.1-193.1 (see now § 46.2-942) supporting the argument that the legislature intended an incorrect speedometer reading to c onstitute an absolute bar to a conviction for speeding. In a speeding case the only issue is whether the defendants vehicle was in fact exceeding the lawful maximum speed. If so, he is guilty; if not, he is innocent. The calibration report is admissi ble in evidence and the fact finder under the statute may give it such weight as it deems proper under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Williams v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 514, 365 S.E.2d 340, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1872, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 36 (1988) (decided under prior law). The legislature, in enacting former § 46.1-193 (see now §§ 46.2-870 through 46.2-878), did not intend to bar a conviction for speeding for persons with i naccurate speedometers. Such an interpretation would discourage motorists from repairing defective speedometers and encourage tampering with them so as to prevent a conviction for speeding. The court does not think the legislature intended to encourage a result that would foster unlawful activity. Williams v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 514, 365 S.E.2d 340, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1872, 1988 Va.

CASE NOTES Section do es not relate to duty of driver to pedestrian.  This section and former §§ 46.1-206 and 46.1-211 (see now §§ 46.2-804 and 46.2-842) deal with the duties of an operator of a motor vehicle turning fro m one lane to another where the movement of another vehicle is involved, and with the requirement of equipping a motor vehicle with a rear view mirror. They do not relate to the duty of the operator of a motor vehicle to a pedestrian. Thus, an instructio n in the words of these statutes was inappropriate under the evidence in an action for the death of a pedestrian who was struck by a motor vehicle. Russell v. Hammond, 200 Va. 600, 106 S.E.2d 626, 1959 Va. LEXIS 144 (1959) (decided under prior law). Mirror will show vehicle a pproaching in rear.  It is a fact of common knowledge and experience that an automobile rear view mirror, such as is required by this section, if properly adjusted, will necessarily s how a vehicle approaching in the rear, and at night the headlights of such a vehicle make its prominence all the more pointed.

CASE NOTES Evidence that automobile had seat belts was admissible.  In a personal injury action alleging defects and negligence in the design, manufacture and assembly of an automobile, evidence that the automobile was equipped wi th seat belts for purposes of determining whether the automobile was defectively designed was admissible.

Evidence of nonuse.  Sections 46.2-1094 and 46.2-1092 did not prevent the presentation of non-seatbelt use evidence for issues such as negligent design and manufacture, breach of warr anty, and product misuse. Thus, such evidence theoretically would be admissible to demonstrate that a drivers seatbelt non-use was the proximate cause of the injuries he allegedly received; however, because the manufacturer could not demonstrate that the drivers injuries could have been avoided by wearing a seat belt, the court declined to grant a motion in limine declaring that such evidence was admissible.

Automobiles, §§ 5, 55, 106, 114. CASE NOTES Rear-seat passenger.  Defendant was properly convicted of felony reckless driving that caused the death of a passenger because the victims failure to wear a seat belt was not a pro ximate cause of his death, leaving defendants reckless driving as the sole and proximate cause of the accident and resulting death; as a rear-seat passenger, the victim was under no legal obligation to wear a seat belt because the General Ass embly elected to impose such a requirement only on front-seat passengers. Chapman v. Commonwealth, 68 Va. App. 131, 804 S.E.2d 326, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 238 (2017), aff'd, 296 Va. 386, 820 S.E.2d 611, 2018 Va. LEXIS 173 (2018). Willful failure to comply.  Workers Compensation Commission properly barred an employee from an award of benefits because, by acknowledging that he intended to put his seat belt on at so me point, and yet did not put it on when he knew he was required to do so, the employee demonstrated that he was violating the seatbelt statute purposefully, not accidentally, and with deliberate intent, and the uncontested and uncontroverted evidence su pported the courts finding that the employees injuries were proximately caused by his failure to wear his seat belt and his resulting ejection from his truck. Mizelle v. Holiday Ice, Inc., 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 68 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 10, 2020). Evidence of nonuse inadmissible.  This section forbids evidence of nonuse of seat belts in a motor vehicle with respect to both liability and damages. Freeman v. Case Corp., 924 F. Supp. 1456, 199 6 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5897 (W.D. Va. 1996), rev'd, 118 F.3d 1011, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 16791 (4th Cir. 1997). Sections 46.2-1094 and 46.2-1092 did not prevent the presentation of non-seatbelt use evidence for issues such as negligent design and manufacture, breach of warr anty, and product misuse. Thus, such evidence theoretically would be admissible to demonstrate that a drivers seatbelt non-use was the proximate cause of the injuries he allegedly received; however, because the manufacturer could not demonstrate that the drivers injuries could have been avoided by wearing a seat belt, the court declined to grant a motion in limine declaring that such evidence was admissible. Tunnell v. Ford Motor Co., No. 4:03-CV-00074, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12145 (W.D. Va. Apr. 18, 2005). Admissibility of nonuse in div ersity case.  Insofar as subsection D of this section provides that failure to wear a seatbelt is not contributory negligence and may not be considered in mitigation of damages , it is substantive and thus controlling in a federal diversity case. However, insofar as subsection D limits the admissibility in evidence of the failure to wear a seatbelt or counsels comment upon such failure with regard to issues other than contr ibutory negligence and mitigation of damages, it is procedural and not controlling in such cases. Therefore, in a diversity case, evidence of truck occupants failure to wear a seatbelt was admissible, as it relates to the issues of negligent design a nd manufacture, breach of warranty and product misuse. Brown v. Ford Motor Co., 67 F. Supp. 2d 581, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16136 (E.D. Va. 1999), aff'd, 246 F.3d 663, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 9967 (4th Cir. 2001). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL A checking detail or roadblock alone does not permit the issuance of a summons for failure to use a safety belt system; however, when the checking detail or roadblock reveals some other violation of law, an officer then may issue a summons for failure to use a safety belt system.

Any person who drives on the highways of Virginia any motor vehicle manufactured after January 1, 1968, shall ensure that any child, up to age eight, whom he transports therein is provided with and properly secured in a child restraint device of a type which meets the standards adopted by the United States Department of Transportation. Such child restraint device shall not be forward-facing until at least (i) the child reaches two years of age or (ii) the child reaches the minimum weight limit for a forward-facing child restraint device as prescribed by the manufacturer of the device. Further, child restraint devices shall be placed in the back seat of a vehicle. In the event the vehicle does not have a back seat, the child restraint device may be placed in the f ront passenger seat only if the vehicle is either not equipped with a passenger side airbag or the passenger side airbag has been deactivated. B. Any person transporting another person less than 18 years old, except for those required pursuant to subsection A to be secured in a child restraint device, shall ensure that such person is provided with and properly secured by an appropriate safety belt system whe n driving on the highways of Virginia in any motor vehicle manufactured after January 1, 1968, equipped or required by the provisions of this title to be equipped with a safety belt system, consisting of lap belts, shoulder harnesses, combinations thereo f or similar devices. C.

D. A violation of this section may be charged on the uniform traffic summons form. E. Nothing in this section shall apply to any person operating taxicabs, school buses, executive sedans, or limousines.

Ingram v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 533 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 27, 2002). Violations not negligence per se.  Demurrer to an infants negligence action against a father was reversed because §§ 46.2-1095 and 46.2-1098 precluded a cause of action based upon neglige nce per se and precluded any mention of the statutory provisions by the parties at trial for any reason. Evans v. Evans, 280 Va. 76, 695 S.E.2d 173, 2010 Va. LEXIS 77 (2010). Criminal negligence.  Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of involuntary manslaughter, felonious child abuse or neglect involving the reckless endangerment of a child, and fel onious child abuse involving serious injury to a child as the evidence proved that defendant was criminally negligent because he drove recklessly after recently ingesting marijuana with the knowledge that his minor passengers were not properly restrained by seat belts or appropriate devices; and he possessed the knowledge and consciousness of risk that could establish reckless disregard as he wore his own seat belt. Turner v. Commonwealth, 2017 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 10, 2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Traffic infraction.  Violations of the child safety seat law are traffic infractions, for which a valid Terry stop may be made, as an attempt to maintain public order.

Cir. 223, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 582 (Suffolk 2000). CASE NOTES Detention proper.  Defendants motion to suppress a traffic stop was properly denied because (1) the evidence showed an officer saw a small child standing in defendants back seat, making it objectively reasonable for the officer to believe defendant was violating either of two statutes, and (2) the trial courts assessment of the officers credibility was deferred to. Muwakkil v. Commonwealth, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 166 ( Va. Ct. App. July 16, 2019). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Public schoo l buses used by Head Start Program exempt.  School buses are exempt from the requirement that children under the age of four be properly secured in an approved child restraint device and, therefore, public school buses used to transport children in a Head Start Program are not required to provide children under the age of four with child safety seats regardless of whether such buses have seat belts.

For related discussion, see 2B M.J. Automobiles, §§ 5, 27. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Access scheme preempted by federal l aw.  The Virginia access restrictions are not based solely on, nor adequately supported by, the safety analysis produced by defendant, the access restrictions do not p rovide the requisite reasonable access for single pup trailers, and the restrictions are unreasonable because they require prior route approval before single pup trailers are granted access to local points of loading and unloading. For all the fo regoing reasons, Virginias enforcement of width requirements for single pup trailer units conflicts with federal law and is, therefore, preempted. A.B.F. Freight Sys. v. Suthard, 681 F. Supp. 334, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2167 (E.D. Va. 1988). Access scheme which entails prior review for local access invalid.  Given the conditions under which local deliveries and pickups must be made by the trucking industry, any system of prior review for local access is necessarily un reasonable and invalid when applied to single 102" wide pup trailers. The Virginia access scheme entails such prior review, and its regulations must fall. A.B.F. Freight Sys. v. Suthard, 681 F. Supp. 334, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2167 (E.D. Va. 1988). For local access schemes to be valid they must satisfy certain criteria.  As a limited exception to the reasonable access guarantee of former 49 U.S.C. § 2312(a), § 2312(b) (now 49 U.S.C. § 31114(b)) expressly allows th e states to impose reasonable restriction[s], based on safety considerations, on the local access mandated for single 102" wide pup trailer units. Accordingly, in order to be valid and to survive under the federal statute, any state law restricti ng the local access of single pup trailers must satisfy these criteria: (1) the law may impose only reasonable restrictions, and the resulting access allowed must be reasonable access in fact; and (2) the state restrictions must be based solely on valid considerations of safety and not on any other, extraneous factors. The Virginia scheme of restricted access conflicts with the federal statute and is thus invalid under the Supremacy Clause. A.B.F. Freight Sys. v. Suthard, 681 F. Supp. 334, 1988 U.S. Dis t. LEXIS 2167 (E.D. Va. 1988). Since former § 46.1-328.1 (see now § 46.2-1109) fails to provide access for 102" wide trailers for loading and unloading, the applicable governing statute b ecomes former 46.1-328(a) (see now § 46.2-1105). A.B.F. Freight Sys. v. Suthard, 681 F. Supp. 334, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2167 (E.D. Va. 1988). Violation of section is negligence.  An instruction that the violation of any one or more of the provisions of this section or former §§ 46.1-334 and 46.1-339 (see now §§ 46.2-1111, 46.2- 1122 and 46.2-1123), was negligence and that, if the jury believed that such negligence was a proximate cause of the death of decedent, plaintiff was entitled to recover, was correct.

Nothing contained in this section shall require either the public authorities or railroad companies to provide vertical clearances of overhead bridges or structures in excess of 12 feet, six inches, or to make any changes in the vertical clearances of existing overhead bridges or structures crossing highways. The driver or owner of vehicles on highways shall be held financially responsible for any damage to overhead br idges or structures that results from collisions therewith. The driver or owner of any vehicle colliding with an overhead bridge or structure shall immediately notify, either in person or by telephone, a law-enforcement officer or the public authority or railroad company, owning or maintaining such overhead bridge or structure of the fact of such collision, and his name, address, drivers license number, and the registration number of his vehicle. Failure to give such notice immediately, either in person or by telephone, shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. On any highway maintained by the Department of Transportation over which there is a bridge or structure having a vertical clearance of less than 14 feet, the Commission er of Highways shall have at least two signs erected setting forth the height of the bridge or structure. Such signs shall be located at least 1,500 feet ahead of the bridge or structure. On any highway maintained by a county, city, or town over which a bridge or structure has a vertical clearance of less than 14 feet, the local governing body shall have at least two signs erected setting forth the height of the bridge or structure. Such signs shall be located at least 1,500 feet ahead of the bridge or structure. The Department of Transportation may install and use overheight vehicle optical detection systems to identify vehicles that exceed the overhead clearance of the westbou nd tunnel of the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel on Interstate 64. When the optical system sensor located closest to the westbound tunnel entrance is used in identifying such vehicles, the system shall be installed at the specified height as determined by me asurement standards that have been certified by the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and are traceable to national standards of measurement. Such identification by such system shall, for all purposes of law, be equival ent to having measured the height of the vehicle with a tape measure or other measuring device. When an employee of the Department of Transportation or the Department of State Police identifies a vehicle whose height exceeds 13 feet, six inches and whose driver is driving or attempting to drive through the westbound tunnel of the Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel on Interstate 64, the driver of such vehicle may elect to wait until the end of peak traffic periods, as determined by the Department of Transportat ion, so that the Department of Transportation or Department of State Police may safely stop traffic and allow such vehicle to proceed in the opposite direction. If the driver does not elect to wait, he shall be subject to the penalties under this section . Any person who drives or attempts to drive any vehicle or combination of vehicles into or through any tunnel when the height of such vehicle, any vehicle in a combinati on of vehicles, or any load on any such vehicle exceeds that permitted for such tunnel, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, in addition, shall be assessed three driver demerit points. In addition, the driver of any such vehicle shall be fined $1,000, o f which $1,000 shall be a mandatory minimum.

Text No motor vehicle longer than 40 feet shall be operated on any highway in the Commonwealth except for buses and motor homes. The actual length of any combination of vehi cles, including motor homes and buses, coupled together including any load thereon shall not exceed a total of 65 feet. However, the length of a tractor truck semitrailer combination may exceed 65 feet in length, provided the semitrailer does not exceed 53 feet in length and the distance between the kingpin of the semitrailer and the rearmost axle or a point midway between the rear tandem axles does not exceed 41 feet. The Commissioner of Highways may impose restrictions on the operation of vehicles exc eeding 65 feet in length on certain roads, based on a safety and engineering analysis. No bus or motor home longer than 45 feet shall be operated on any highway in the Commonwealth. No tolerance shall be allowed that exceeds 12 inches. The Commissioner, however, when good cause is shown, may issue a special permit for combinations either in excess of 65 feet, including any load thereon, or where the o bject or objects to be carried cannot be moved otherwise. Such permits may also be issued by the Department when the total number of otherwise overdimensional loads of modular housing of no more than two units may be reduced by permitting the use of an o verlength trailer not exceeding 54 feet. No permit shall be issued by the Commissioner until an engineering analysis of a proposed routing has been conducted by the Commissioner of Highways to assess the ability of the roadway to be traversed to sustain the vehicles size. No overall length restrictions, however, shall be imposed on any tractor truck semitrailer combinations drawing one trailer or any tractor truck semitrailer combination s when operated on any interstate highway or on any highway as designated by the Commonwealth Transportation Board. No such designation shall be made, however, until notice of any proposed designation has been provided by the Commissioner of Highways to the governing body of every locality wherein any highway affected by the proposed designation is located. No individual semitrailer or trailer being drawn in a tractor truck semitrailer trailer combination, however, shall exceed 28 1/2 feet in length, and no semitrailer bei ng operated in a tractor truck semitrailer combination shall exceed 48 feet in length, except when semitrailers have a distance of not more than 41 feet between the kingpin of the semitrailer and the rearmost axle or a point midway between the rear tande m axles, such semitrailer shall be allowed not more than 53 feet in length. The length limitations on semitrailers and trailers in the foregoing provisions of this section shall be exclusive of safety and energy conservation devices, steps and handholds for entry and egress, rubber dock guards, flexible fender extensions, mudflaps, refrigeration units, and air compressors. The Commissioner of Highways shall designate reasonable access to terminals, facilities for food, fuel, repairs and rest. Household goods carriers and any tractor truck semitrailer combination in which the semitrailer has a length of no more than 28 1/2 feet shall not be denied reasonable access to points of loading and unloading, except as designated, based on safety consi derations, by the Commissioner of Highways. Any person operating a vehicle whose length is not in conformity with the provisions of this chapter on a two-lane highway where passing is permitted shall be guilty of a traffic infraction and fined $250.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 46.1 or prior law. Constitutionality.  The constitutionality of an earlier form of this section was upheld in Tiller v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 418, 69 S.E.2d 441 (1952). General weight schedule of this section does not unduly burden interstate commerce. Gutri dge v. Virginia, 532 F. Supp. 533, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10483 (E.D. Va. 1982). Commonwealths system of weight restrictions does not create a suspect classification. Gutridge v. Virginia, 532 F. Supp. 533, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10483 (E.D. Va. 1982). Right to haul cargo on Virginias roads is not a fundamental right explicitly or impl icitly guaranteed by the United States Constitution. Gutridge v. Virginia, 532 F. Supp. 533, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10483 (E.D. Va. 1982). Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to prevent injury to roads and bridges and to promote the safety of persons traveling over the highways by prohibiting the use on t he public highways of vehicles of excessive weight. Tiller v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 418, 69 S.E.2d 441, 1952 Va. LEXIS 150 (1952). The purpose of the state laws regulating the size and weight of vehicles on the highways is to protect the safety of travellers and to protect the roads from unre asonable wear. Virginia v. Stiff, 144 F. Supp. 169, 1956 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2730 (D. Va. 1956). This section may be construed as remedial as well as penal to the extent that it relates to the public safety. Tiller v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 418, 69 S.E.2d 441, 1952 Va. LEXIS 150 (1952). It applies to vehicles own ed by United States.  A federal employee operating an overweight vehicle on the Virginia highways was guilty of violation of the Virginia statutes regulating the weight of vehicles and was liable for the fine provided by statute for such violation, although the vehicle was owned by the United States and was being operated in the business of the United States. Virginia v. Stiff, 144 F. Supp. 169, 1956 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2730 (D. Va. 1956 ). Axle as used in this section means the assembly of housing and axle shafts which support and propel the wheels. Tiller v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 418, 69 S.E.2d 441, 1952 Va. LEXIS 150 (1952). A truck had only one rear axle within the meaning of this section notwithstanding the fact that the rear wheels on each side were attached to separate sha fts. The two shafts were only a part of the entire assembly embraced within the word axle. Tiller v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 418, 69 S.E.2d 441, 1952 Va. LEXIS 150 (1952). Violation of section is negligence.  See note to § 46.2-1105. Conviction and fine affects only d river.  The driver of a vehicle who violates this section can be charged with a misdemeanor under former § 46.1-341 (see now § 46.2-1131), and if convicted he is fi ned under former § 46.1-16.01 (see now § 46.2-113). This affects only the driver of the vehicle. It does not touch directly the owner of the truck unless it happens, which is rare, that the driver of the truck is also the owner. Joyner v. Matthews, 193 Va. 10, 68 S.E.2d 127, 1951 Va.

Annotations CASE NOTES Evidence of violation sufficient.  Defendant was properly found guilty of operating an overweight vehicle under the statute because its paver was a vehicle as defined in Va. Code Ann. § 46.2-100; it operated via a gas pedal, moved on its own, and was transporting people and property along a highway. Slurry Pavers, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 29 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 17, 2023). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Vehicle hauling coal.  Section 46.2-1143 allows for a six-axle vehicle used exclusively for hauling coal or coal byproducts to have a gross vehicle weight of 110,000 pounds, but no more than that, provided that the vehicle has a valid overweight permit, is loaded at the time and has its weight distributed over the axles as required by the statute.

(Contingent effective date  see Editors notes) Liquidated damages for violation of weight limits. Text A. Any person violating any weight limit as provided in this chapter or in any permit issued pursuant to Article 18 (§ 46.2-1139 et seq.) of this chapter by the Department or its designee or by local authorities pursuant to this chapter shall be assessed liquidated damages. The amount of those damages shall be: Excess weight over Assessed Excess weight over Assessed the prescribed amount per the prescribed amount per or permitted pound gross weight pound axle weig ht limit limits 4,000 pounds or less 1¢ per pound 4,000 pounds or less 1¢ per pound 4,001 to 8,000 pounds 10¢ per pound 4,001 to 8,000 pounds 5¢ per pound 8,001 to 12,000 pounds 20¢ per pound 8,001 to 12,000 pounds 10¢ per pound 12,0 01 pounds or more 30¢ per pound 12,001 pounds or more 15¢ per pound Click to viewAll gross permit violations shall be assessed $.20 per pound over the permitted weight limit.If a person has no prior violations under the motor vehicle we ight laws, and the excess weight does not exceed 2,500 pounds, the general district court may waive the liquidated damages against such person. Except as provided by § 46.2-1138, such assessment shall be entered by the court or by the Department as a judgment for the Commonwealth, the entry of which shall constitute a lien upon the overweight vehicle. Except as provided by § 46.2-1138, such sums shall be paid to the Department or collected by the attorney for the Commonwealth and forwarded to the State Treasurer and allocated to the fund appropriated for the construction and maintenance of state highways. B. If the gros s weight of the vehicle exceeds lawful limits by at least 25 percent but no more than 50 percent, the amount of the liquidated damages shall be two times the amount provided for in the foregoing provisions of this section; if the gross weight of the vehi cle exceeds lawful limits by more than 50 percent, the amount of the liquidated damages shall be three times the amount provided for in the foregoing provisions of this section.

For the pur poses of this section, a permanent weighing station includes any location equipped with fixed, permanent scales for weighing motor vehicles. B. Any officer or size and weight compliance agent authorized to enforce the law under this title, having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful, is authorized to weigh the load and the vehicle. If the place where the vehicle is stopped is 10 road miles or less from a permanent weighing station, the officer may, and upon demand of the driver shall, require the vehicle to proceed to such station. If the distance to the nearest permanent weighing station is more than 10 road miles such vehi cle may be weighed by wheel load weighers. Any driver who fails or unreasonably refuses to drive his vehicle to such permanent weighing station or such scales or wheel load weighers upon the request and direction of the officer to do so is guilty of a Cl ass 4 misdemeanor. The penalty for such violation shall be in addition to any other penalties prescribed for exceeding the maximum weight permitted or for any other violation. C. Any person operating a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight or registered gross weight of more than 10,000 pounds shall drive into a permanent weighing station for inspection when directed to do so by highway signs. Any person who fails or refuses to comply with thi s subsection is guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor, which shall be in addition to any other penalties prescribed for exceeding the maximum weight permitted or for any other violation. D. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection C, a person instructed by a bypass system to bypass a permanent weighing station may do so unless directed to drive onto the scales for weight inspection by an officer or size and weight compliance agent pursuant to the provisions of subsection B. For purposes of this subsection, a bypass system means any system approved by the Commissioner that (i) communicates information about a vehicle to a permanent weighing station, (ii) is capable of receiving return comm unications from the permanent weighing station indicating whether the driver may bypass the weighing station or must drive onto the scales, and (iii) is capable of instructing the driver in accordance with the communication received. E. In the even t the operator of a vehicle fails or unreasonably refuses to submit a vehicle required to be inspected for an inspection, where the officer has reason to believe the vehicle is overweight, the officer may use whatever reasonable means are available to ha ve the vehicle weighed, including the employment of a tow truck to move the vehicle to the weighing area. He may also use whatever means are necessary to reload the vehicle if the load is intentionally dumped. In such a case, any expenses incurred in hav ing the vehicle weighed may be taxed as costs to be imposed upon the operator who failed or unreasonably refused to submit his vehicle for inspection, when he has been convicted of such failure or refusal and an overweight violation. In all cases where s uch failure or refusal or overweight charges are dismissed or the defendant acquitted, payment shall be made from highway funds. F. Should the officer or size and weight compliance agent find that the weight of any vehicle and its load is greater than that permitted by this title or that the weight of the load carried in or on such vehicle is greater than that which the vehicle is licensed to c arry under the provisions of this title, he may require the driver to unload, at the nearest place where the property unloaded may be stored or transferred to another vehicle, such portion of the load as may be necessary to decrease the gross weight of t he vehicle to the maximum therefor permitted by this title. Any property so unloaded shall be stored or cared for by the owner or operator of the overweight vehicle at the risk of such owner or operator. G. Notwithstan ding the provisions of §§ 46.2-1122 through 46.2-1127, should the officer or size and weight compliance agent find that the gross weight of the vehicle and its load is within limits permitted under this title and does not exceed the limit for which the vehicle is registered, but that the axle weight of any axle or axles of the vehicle exceeds that permitted under this title, the driver shall be allowed one hour to shift his load within or on that same vehicle in order to bring the axle weight or a xle weights within proper limits. However, liquidated damages shall be assessed under § 46.2-1135 based on the weight prior to shifting the load, unless the load can be successfully shifted to bring the vehicles axle weight within limits permitted under this title by (i) sliding the axle or axles of the semitrailer or the fifth wheel of the tractor truck, (ii) repositioning the load if the motor vehicle is transporting off-the-road mobile construction equipment, or (iii) adjusting the load if the vehicle is operating on non-interstate highways and qualifies for weight extensions pursuant to § 46.2-1129. Such load shifting shall be performed at the site where the vehicle was weighed and found to exceed allowable axle weight limits. No such loa d shifting shall be allowed if such load is required to be placarded as defined in § 10.1-1450 and consists of hazardous material as defined in § 10.1-1400. H. If the driv er of an overloaded vehicle is convicted, forfeits bail, or purchases an increased license as a result of such weighing, the court in addition to all other penalties shall assess and collect a weighing fee of two dollars from the owner or operator of the vehicle and shall forward such fee to the State Treasurer. Upon receipt of the fee, the State Treasurer shall allocate the same to the fund appropriated for the administration and maintenance of the Department of State Police. I. In any cour t or legal proceedings in which any question arises as to the calibration or accuracy of any such scales at permanent weighing stations or wheel load weighers, a certificate, executed and signed under oath by the inspector calibrating or testing such dev ice as to its accuracy as well as to the accuracy of the test weights used in such test, and stating the date of such test, type of test and results of testing, shall be admissible when attested by one such inspector who executed and signed it as evidenc e of the facts therein stated and the results of such testing.

CASE NOTES Ordinance invalid fo r conflicting with statute.  As Prince William County, Virginia, has prohibited the parking of an uninspected motor vehicle on a public highway, whereas the general assembly has merel y prohibited the operation of such vehicle on a public highway, and there is no statutory authority authorizing the county to take such action, there is a clear conflict between Prince William, Va., County Code § 13-322 and §§ 46.2-1157 and 46.2-1163. Accordingly, Prince William, Va., County Code § 13-322(a)(1) violates the Dillon Rule. Eberth v. County of Prince William, 49 Va. App. 105, 637 S.E.2d 338, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 545 (2006). Rejection sticke r justifying investigatory stop.  Although a vehicle displaying an inspection rejection sticker may be operated legally, the rejection sticker provides reasonable suspicion that the driver is comm itting a traffic infraction, and an officer may conduct an investigatory stop to determine whether the defective equipment has been repaired. Reel v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 262, 522 S.E.2d 881, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 1 (2000). Legality of traffic stop.  Motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a traffic stop of defendants antique vehicle was improperly denied as the evidence was obtained in violation of U.S. Const., Amend. IV. The trooper stopped the vehicle solely because it displayed no inspection sticker even though, as the trooper acknowledged, exceptions to this requirement were specifically provided in §§ 46.2-730, 46.2-1157, and 46.2-116 3 for antique vehicles displaying antique tags, and the trooper did not articulate any reasons for suspecting that defendant was operating his vehicle in violation of the permitted uses.

CASE NOTES Ordinance invalid fo r conflicting with statute.  As Prince William County, Virginia, has prohibited the parking of an uninspected motor vehicle on a public highway, whereas the general assembly has merel y prohibited the operation of such vehicle on a public highway, and there is no statutory authority authorizing the county to take such action, there is a clear conflict between Prince William, Va., County Code § 13-322 and §§ 46.2-1157 and 46.2-1163. Accordingly, Prince William, Va., County Code § 13-322(a)(1) violates the Dillon Rule. Eberth v. County of Prince William, 49 Va. App. 105, 637 S.E.2d 338, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 545 (2006). Designation not a property right.  Virginia has not clothed an automobile inspection designee with such a claim of entitlement as creates a property right in that designation when the designee enga ges in activity, aliunde the operation of the inspection station, which impugns the integrity and propriety of the Virginia State Police. Thus a former service station owner who had pled guilty to a misdemeanor possession of marijuana charge did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to such a designation, and revocation of his designation as an official inspector did not deprive him of a property right in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

CASE NOTES Designat ion as inspection station not a property right.  Virginia has not clothed an automobile inspection designee with such a claim of entitlement as creates a property right in that designation when the designee enga ges in activity, aliunde the operation of the inspection station, which impugns the integrity and propriety of the Virginia State Police. Thus a former service station owner who had pled guilty to a misdemeanor possession of marijuana charge did not have a legitimate claim of entitlement to such a designation, and revocation of his designation as an official inspector did not deprive him of a property right in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Cliborne v. Department of State Police, 483 F. Supp. 207, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9885 (E.D. Va. 1980) (decided under prior law). Due process.  Although this section provides for a court trial and for an additional hearing, it requires these procedures only when there is a violation by an official inspect ion station of Article 10 [former § 46.1-315 et seq. (see now Article 21, § 46.2-1157 et seq.)] or of regulations made pursuant thereto. It must be inferred, then, that the subject violation must be one relating directly to the conduct of motor veh icle inspections by an inspection station. In such case a criminal hearing followed by a due process hearing is required by law before the Superintendent may effect revocation. Thus, if an inspection station is charged with approving a worn brake shoe, r igid due process, including proof of guilt in court beyond a reasonable doubt, is required. Such statutorily imposed process ineluctably imputes a claim of entitlement to the designee which is undeniably legitimate. Thus, inspection station designations have been infused with a property interest by act of the General Assembly. Cliborne v. Department of State Police, 483 F. Supp. 207, 1980 U.S. Dist.

CASE NOTES Fraudulent sticker.  Traffic stop was lawful because it was based on the fact that defendants vehicle displayed a fraudulent inspection sticker, which permitted an inference that defendant avoided an inspection because the vehicle was not drivable.

Stolen sticker.  Trial court erred in granting defendants motion to suppress because a police officer who conducted a search of defendants vehicle had probable cause to be lieve that the vehicle contained evidence of a crime where the officer noticed that the vehicle had a new inspection sticker, which he verified was stolen, the officer had knowledge that supporting documentation issued alongside the inspection stickers w as often stored in the vehicles, and the automobile exception to the warrant rule authorized the officer to search any area of the vehicle in which the evidence might be found.

Annotations CASE NOTES Motion to suppress.  Because there was no requirement that an inspection sticker had to be completely affixed to a vehicles windshield, a peeling inspection sticker was no t, in and of itself, unlawful, nor did it, standing alone, constitute a particularized and objective fact that gave rise to a reasonable articulable suspicion that the sticker had unlawfully been transferred from another vehicle or was otherwise counterf eit in violation of § 46.2-1173, so it was improper to conduct an investigative stop of the vehicle. Moore v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 294, 640 S.E.2d 531, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 45, different results reached on reh'g, 51 Va. App. 1, 654 S.E.2d 305, 200 7 Va. App. LEXIS 487 (2007) (as to legal standard). It was unquestionable that the peeling appearance of a valid inspection sticker was a relevant factor in determining whether the sticker was unlawfully tr ansferred from another vehicle, but, because a partially peeling inspection sticker was not unlawful, it did not justify, without some additional indicia of legal wrongdoing, stopping all vehicles displaying valid inspections stickers that were not compl etely affixed to their windshields, and trial courts had to consider the totality of all of the circumstances surrounding a stop of a vehicle, including whether a relevant factor might have a legitimate explanation, when determining whether an officer ha d a reasonable articulable suspicion, based on particularized and objective facts, to stop a vehicle.

For purpose s of this section:Clean alternative fuel means any fuel, including methanol, ethanol, other alcoh ols, reformulated gasoline, diesel, natural gases, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, and electricity or other power source used in a clean fuel vehicle that complies with the standards applicable to such vehicle under the federal Clean Air Act when usin g such fuel or other power source. In the case of a flexible fuel vehicle or dual fuel vehicle, clean alternative fuel means only a fuel for which the vehicle was certified when operating on clean alternative fuel. Fleet means any centrally fueled fleet of ten or more motor vehicles owned or operated by a single entity. Fleet does not include motor vehicles held for lease or rental to the general public, motor vehicles held for sale by motor vehicle dealers, motor vehicles used for manufacturer product tests, law-enforcement and other emergency vehicles, or nonroad vehicles, inclu ding farm and construction vehicles. B. The Board m ay adopt by regulation motor vehicle clean alternative fuel fleet standards consistent with the provisions of Part C of Title II of the federal Clean Air Act for model years beginning with the model year 1998 or the first succeeding model year for which adoption of such standards is practicable. If adoption and implementation by the Board of an equivalent air pollution reduction program is approved by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, the regulation and program authorized by this section shal l not become effective. Such regulations shall contain the minimum phase-in schedule contained in § 246 (b) of Part C of Title II of the Clean Air Act. However, nothing in this section shall preclude affected fleet owners from exceeding the minimum re quirements of the federal Clean Air Act. Beginning in 1995 and upon adoption of the standards by the Board, the Board shall require the fleet owned by the federal government to meet the clean alternative fuel fleet standard and phase-in schedule establis hed by the Board. If necessary to meet the Boards standards and phase-in schedule, the Board shall require fleets owned by the federal government to convert a portion of existing fleet vehicles to the use of clean alternative fuels as defined by the federal Clean Air Act. The standards specified in this subsection shall apply only to (i) motor vehicles registered in localities designated by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, as serious, severe, or ext reme air quality nonattainment areas, or as maintenance areas formerly designated serious, severe, or extreme and (ii) motor vehicles not registered in the above-mentioned localities, but having either (a) a base of operations or (b) a majority of their annual travel in one or more of those localities. C. An owner of a covered fleet shall not use any motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine which is manufactured during or after the first model year to which the standards specified in subsection A of this section are applicable, if such vehicle or engine is registered o r has its base of operations in the localities specified in subsection B of this section and has not been certified in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Board. The Board may promulgate regulations providing for reasonable exemptions consiste nt with the provisions of Part C of Title II of the federal Clean Air Act. Motor vehicles exempted from the provisions of this section shall forever be exempt. D. Any person that violates the requirements of this section or any regulation adopted hereunder shall be subject to the penalties in §§ 46.2-1187 and 46.2-1187.2. Each day of violation shall be a separate offense, and each motor vehicle shall be treated separat ely in assessing violations. E. In order to limit adverse economic and administrative impacts on covered fleets operating both in Virginia and in neighboring states, the Department of Environmental Quality shall, to the maximum extent practicable, coordinate the provisions of its regulations prom ulgated under this section with neighboring states statutes and regulations relating to use of clean alternative fuels by motor vehicle fleets. F. The State C orporation Commission, as to matters within its jurisdiction, and the Department of Environmental Quality, as to other matters, may, should they deem such action necessary, promulgate regulations necessary or convenient to ensure the availability of clea n alternative fuels to operators of fleets covered by the provisions of this section. The State Air Pollution Control Board may delegate to the Commissioner of Agriculture its authority under the Air Pollution Control Law of Virginia, Chapter 13 (§ 10 .1-1300 et seq.) of Title 10.1, to implement and enforce any provisions of its regulations covering the availability of clean alternative fuels. Upon receiving such delegation, the authority to implement and enforce the regulations under the Air Pollutio n Control Law of Virginia shall be vested solely in the Commissioner, notwithstanding any provision of law contained in Title 10.1, except as provided in this section. The State Air Pollution Control Board, in delegating its authority under this section, may make the delegation subject to any conditions it deems appropriate to ensure effective implementation of the regulations according to the policies of the State Air Pollution Control Board.

No conversion occurred because the shop made repeated requests to pick up the car, it remained on the property without consent for more than 48 hours, a compliant notice was sent, and there was no evidence that the shop failed to co mply with the Virginia Abandoned Vehicle Act or that its operator lacked authority.

CASE NOTES Failure to follow abandonment procedures.  United States motion for summary judgment as to the companies liability for violation of 50 U.S.C.S. App. § 537(a)(1) was granted because: (1) the serv ice members should not have been equitably estopped from bringing their claims simply because they failed to anticipate and guard against the companies unlawful actions; (2) the companies argument that the vehicles were abandoned and therefore di d not qualify as personal effects covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) was incorrect as a matter of Virginia law because the companies did not follow the statutory abandonment procedure set forth in § 46.2-1202; and (3) the SC RA imposed strict liability, and thus, the companies were liable under the statute without regard to their care.

No person s hall leave any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part or combination thereof immobilized or unattended on or adjacent to any roadway if it constitutes a hazard in the use of the highway. No person shall leave any immobilized or unattended motor veh icle, trailer, semitrailer, or part or combination thereof longer than 24 hours on or adjacent to any roadway outside the corporate limits of any city or town, or on an interstate highway or limited access highway, expressway, or parkway inside the corpo rate limits of any city or town.

Before obtaining possession of the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or combination, its owner or successor in interest to ownership shall pay to the parties entitled thereto all costs incidental to its removal or storage. In any violation of this section the owner of such motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or part or combi nation of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, shall be presumed to be the person committing the violation; however, this presumption shall be rebuttable by competent evidence. C.

If the vehicles owner fails to remove the vehicle within five days of receipt of such notice, the vehicle shall be released to the owner upon payment of the full costs of storage, towing, and recovery fees, and the owner shall then be entitled to seek reimbursement from the state treasury from the appropriation for cri minal charges. The owner shall produce a valid motor vehicle registration or other proof of ownership to the employees of the facility wherein the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or part or combination thereof is being stored. In any case in which th e identity of the violator cannot be determined, or where it is found by a court that this section was not violated, the costs of daily storage, towing, and recovery fees of the vehicle shall be reimbursed to the towing and recovery operator and paid out of the state treasury from the appropriation for criminal charges. Payment from the treasury shall be made no later than 45 days from the application for such payment.

CASE NOTES Purpose.  This section and former § 46.1-3 (see now §§ 46.2-1213 and 46.2-1217) are designed primarily to give police officers the authority to have unattended, ab andoned or immobile vehicles removed from the highways and streets of this state, and from private property under certain circumstances, without prior permission of the owners; and to assure any garageman towing and storing a vehicle at the request of an officer the legal right to recover from the owner the charges and costs incident thereto, or to subject the vehicle to the payment thereof by sale. First Virginia Bank v. Sutherland, 217 Va. 588, 231 S.E.2d 706, 1977 Va. LEXIS 206 (1977) (decided under prior law). Determining priority given storage and towing charges in certain instances.  Sections of the Code other than this section and former § 46.1-3 (see now §§ 46.2-1213 and 46.2-1217) must be looked to in order to determine what priori ty is given charges for storage and towing in instances when the vehicle is sold and the proceeds of sale must be disbursed. First Virginia Bank v. Sutherland, 217 Va. 588, 231 S.E.2d 706, 1977 Va. LEXIS 206 (1977) (decided under prior law). Bank held not an owner within the contemplation of this section and former § 46.1-3 (see now §§ 46.2-1213 and 46.2-1217) where bank was lienholder with the right upon default to exercise all the rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code as provided in a security agreement.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Violation of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act.  Section 59.1-199, did not render the Virginia Consumer Protection Act inapplicable to an owners claims against a body shop because the amended complaint plead ed facts sufficient to support a finding that the body shop did not comply with § 46.2-1209 regarding the sale of her car; though § 59.1-199 rendered the Virginia Consumer Protection Act inapplicable to certain aspects of the transaction at issue, the owner properly stated a cause of action under the Act since the amended complaint alleged misrepresentations by the body shop regarding aspects of the transaction not authorized by § 46.2-1209, and § 46.2-1209 did not authorize the sale of the owners car under circumstances other than those identified in § 46.2-1209.

The governi ng body of any county, city, or town may by ordinance provide for the removal for safekeeping of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, or parts thereof to a storage area if: 1. It is left unattended on a public highway or other public property and constitutes a traffic hazard; 2. It is illegally parked; 3. It is left unattended for more than 10 days either on public property or on private property without the permission of the property owner, lessee, or occupant; 4. It is immobilized on a public roadway by weather conditions or other emergency situation. B. Removal sha ll be carried out by or under the direction of a law-enforcement officer or other uniformed employee of the local law-enforcement agency who specifically is authorized to do so by the chief law-enforcement officer or his designee. The ordinance, however, shall not authorize removal of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and parts thereof from private property without the written request of the owner, lessee, or occupant of the premises. The ordinance may also provide that the person at whose request the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is removed from private property shall indemnify the county, city, or town against any loss or expense incurred by reason of removal, storage, or sale thereof. Any such ordinance may also provide that it shall be presumed that such motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part thereof is abandoned if it (i) lacks either a current license plate; or a current county, city or town license plate or sticker; or a val id state safety inspection certificate or sticker; and (ii) it has been in a specific location for four days without being moved. As promptly as possible, each removal shall be reported to a local governmental office to be designated in the ordinance and to the owner of the motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer. Before obtaining possession of the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part thereof, the owner shall pay to the parties entitled thereto all costs incidental to its removal and storage and locating the owner. If the owner fails or refuses to pay the cost or if his identity or whereabouts is unknown and unascertainable after a diligent search has been made, and after notice to him at his last known address and to the holder of any lien of r ecord with the office of the Department against the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or part of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, the vehicle shall be treated as an abandoned vehicle under the provisions of Article 1 (§ 46.2-1200 et seq.).

The contract may specify the fees or charges to be paid by the owner or operator of a towed vehicle to the person undertaking its towing or storage and may prescribe the geographical area to be served by each person providing towing services. The county, city, or town may establish criteria for eligibility of persons to enter into towing services contracts and, in its discretion, may itself provide exclusive towing and storage servic e for police-requested towing of unattended, abandoned, or immobile vehicles. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Department of State Police from entering into a memorandum of understanding with a county, city, or town to provide for towing services.

Text The governing body of any county, city, or town may adopt an ordinance not in conflict with state law regulating or prohibiting the stopping, standing, parking, or flow of vehicles in parking areas or driveways of shopping centers and commercial office and apartment complexes. The ordinance shall be applied to and enforced in a specific center or commercial area upon application in writing by the owner or person in gen eral charge of the operation of such area to the chief law-enforcement officer or other official designated by the ordinance for that purpose. The provisions of any such ordinance shall be substantially as follows: Cruising Ordinance. No person shall drive or permit a motor vehicle under his care, custody, or control to be driven past a traffic control point three or more times within a two-hour peri od from 6:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. Monday through Sunday, in or around a posted no cruising area so as to contribute to traffic congestion; obstruction of streets, sidewalks, parking lots, or public vehicular areas; impediment of access to shopping centers o r other buildings open to the public; or interference with the use of property or conduct of business in the area adjacent thereto. At every point where a public street or alley becomes or provides ingress to a no-cruising area, there shall be posted a sign which designates No-Cruising areas and times. Traffic control point, as used in this section, means any point or points within the no-cruising area established by the local law-enforcement agency for the pu rpose of monitoring cruising. No violations shall occur except upon the third passage past the same traffic control point within a two-hour period. No area shall be designated or posted as a no-cruising area except upon the passage of a resolution by the local governing body specifically requiring such designation and posting for a particular area. This ordinance shall not apply to in-service emergency vehicles, taxicabs for hire, buses, and other vehicles being used for business purposes. Where there is a violation of any provision of this ordinance, a law-enforcement officer shall charge such violation on the uniform traffic summons form. The ordinance may further provide that any person violating the ordinance shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of twenty-five dollars. Any person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of the ordinance may be punished by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $100 for each succeeding violatio n. No assignment of demerit points shall be made under Article 19 (§ 46.2-489 et seq.) of this title for any violation of the ordinance. History History. 1990, c. 891; 1993, c. 574.

Parking of vehicles in commuter parking lots owned by the Virginia Department of Transportation. Text A. It shall co nstitute a traffic infraction for any person to park any vehicle in any commuter parking lot owned by the Virginia Department of Transportation in any manner not in conformance with posted signs and pavement markings. In Planning District 8, such signs s hall clearly indicate that before 10:00 a.m. Monday through Friday except holidays parking is only for commuters using mass transit or who are car pool or bicycle riders. B. In the pros ecution of an offense established under this section, prima facie evidence that the vehicle described in the summons issued pursuant to this section was parked in violation of this section, together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such v iolation the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a rebuttable presumption that such owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle was the person who committed the violation. Such presumption shall be rebutted if the owner, les see, or renter of the vehicle (i) files an affidavit by regular mail with the clerk of the general district court that he was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation or (ii) testifies in open court under oath that he was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such presumption shall also be rebutted if a certified copy of a police report, showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violatio n of this section, is presented, prior to the return date established on the summons issued pursuant to this section, to the court adjudicating the alleged violation.

Right of municipality is superior to right of abutting owner.  An abutter has an easement in the public roads which amounts to a property right, but the exercise of this right is subordinate to the right of the municipality, derived by legislative authority, to so control the use of the streets as to promote the safety, comfort, health and general welfare of the public.

Such signs shall, at a minimum, include the nonemergency telephone number of the local law-enforcement agency or the telephone number of the responsible towing and recovery operator to contact for information related to the location of vehicles towed from that location.

It shall be unlawful to fail to report such tow as required by this section and violation of the reporting requirement of this section shall constitute a traf fic infraction punishable by a fine of not more than $100. Such failure to report shall limit the amount which may be charged for the storage and safekeeping of the towed vehicle to an amount no greater than that charged for one day of storage and safeke eping. If the vehicle is removed and stored, the vehicle owner may be charged and the vehicle may be held for a reasonable fee for the removal and storage. All businesses engaged in towing vehicles without the consent of their owners shall prominently display (i) at their main place of business and (ii) at any other locati on where towed vehicles may be reclaimed a comprehensive list of all their fees for towing, recovery, and storage services, or the basis of such charges. This requirement to display a list of fees may also be satisfied by providing, when the towed vehicl e is reclaimed, a written list of such fees, either as part of a receipt or separately, to the person who reclaims the vehicle. Charges in excess of those posted shall not be collectable from any motor vehicle owner whose vehicle is towed, recovered, or stored without his consent. At the time a vehicle owner or agent reclaims a towed vehicle, such towing and recovery operator, if located in Planning District 8, shall provide a written receipt that provides a telephone number or website available for cus tomer complaints. A locality located wholly or partially in Planning District 8 may require additional information to be included on such receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, if the owner or representative or agent of the owner of the trespassing vehicle is present and removes the tre spassing vehicle from the premises before it is actually towed, the trespassing vehicle shall not be towed, but the owner or representative or agent of the owner of the trespassing vehicle shall be liable for a reasonable fee, not to exceed $25 or such o ther limit as the governing body of the county, city, or town may set by ordinance, in lieu of towing. In lieu of having a trespassing vehicle removed by towing or otherwise, the owner, operator, lessee or authorized agent of the premises on which the trespassing vehicle is parked may cause the vehicle to be immobilized in a manner that prevents its removal or lawful operation, provided that any device used to immobilize the trespassing vehicle does not damage the vehicle or any part of the vehicle.

The governi ng body of any county, city, or town may by ordinance regulate the removal of trespassing vehicles from property by or at the direction of the owner, operator, lessee, or authorized agent in charge of the property. In the event that a vehicle is towed fr om one locality and stored in or released from a location in another locality, the local ordinance, if any, of the locality from which the vehicle was towed shall apply. B. No local or dinance adopted under authority of this section shall require that any towing and recovery business also operate as or provide services as a vehicle repair facility or body shop, filling station, or any business other than a towing and recovery business. C. Any such lo cal ordinance may also require towing and recovery operators to (i) obtain and retain photographs or other documentary evidence substantiating the reason for the removal; (ii) post signs at their main place of business and at any other location where tow ed vehicles may be reclaimed conspicuously indicating (a) the maximum charges allowed by local ordinance, if any, for all their fees for towing, recovery, and storage services and (b) the name and business telephone number of the local official, if any, responsible for handling consumer complaints; (iii) obtain at the time the vehicle is towed, verbal approval of an agent designated in the local ordinance who is available at all times; and (iv) obtain, at the time the vehicle is towed, if such towing is performed during the normal business hours of the owner of the property from which the vehicle is being towed, the written authorization of the owner of the property from which the vehicle is towed, or his agent. Such written authorization, if required, shall be in addition to any written contract between the towing and recovery operator and the owner of the property or his agent, except for vehicles being towed from a locality within Planning District 8 or Planning District 16, which shall not require written authorization if such written contract is in place. Any such written contract governing a property located within Planning District 8 or Planning District 16 shall clearly state the terms on which towing and recovery operators may monitor privat e lots on behalf of property owners. For the purposes of this subsection, agent shall not include any person who either (a) is related by blood or marriage to the towing and recovery operator or (b) has a financial interest in the towing and reco very operators business. D. Any such or dinance adopted by a locality within Planning District 8 may require towing companies that tow vehicles from the county, city, or town adopting the ordinance to other localities, provided that the stored or released location is within the Commonwealth of Virginia and within 10 miles of the point of origin of the actual towing, (i) to obtain from the locality from which such vehicles are towed a permit to do so and (ii) to submit to an inspection of such towing companys facilities to ensure that the company meets all the localitys requirements, regardless of whether such facilities are located within the locality or elsewhere. The locality may impose and collect reasonable fees for the issuance and administration of permits as provided for in th is subsection. Such ordinance may also provide grounds for revocation, suspension, or modification of any permit issued under this subsection, subject to notice to the permittee of the revocation, suspension, or modification and an opportunity for the pe rmittee to have a hearing before the governing body of the locality or its designated agent to challenge the revocation, suspension, or modification. Any tow truck driver who removes or tows a vehicle, pursuant to any such ordinance, that is occupied by an unattended companion animal as defined in § 3.2-6500 shall, upon such removal, immediately notify the animal control office of the locality in which the vehicle is being removed or towed.

CASE NOTES Territorial restrictions.  Trial court did not err in entering judgment in favor of a county board of supervisors in towing companies action alleging that the territorial restriction co ntained in § 82-5-32(e)(1) of the Fairfax County, Va., Code violated their Equal Protection rights secured by the federal and State constitutions because the ordinance did not offend the Equal Protection guarantee contained in the Fourteenth Amendment ; the boards argument that subsection A of § 46.2-1232 made no provision for the enforcement of any of its protective regulations in any other locality and that the only way to ensure that its regulations were enforced was to confine the towing of vehicles to the area in which its own officers had the authority to enforce them posited a reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification made by the ordinance.

Ed. 2d 374, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 8547 (2010). Territorial restriction contained in § 82-5-32(e)(1) of the Fairfax County, Va., Code does not contravene the Dillon Rule because the localities may exercise r easonable discretion in prescribing, by ordinance, the territory within which towed vehicles shall be stored without contravening the Dillon Rule since with respect to the territory within which vehicles are to be stored after being towed, the statutory grant of power to regulate towing in subsection A of § 46.2-1232 is silent as to the manner of its execution; although subsection A clearly implies that localities may permit vehicles to be towed outside their borders, it falls far short of compelling them to do so.

CASE NOTES Power of local authorities is either expressly denied or expressly granted.  In the statutes relating to regulation by localities of traffic upon the streets and highways of the Commonwealth, the power of the locality to deal with the subj ect is either expressly denied or expressly granted under certain named limitations. Shaw v. City of Norfolk, 167 Va. 346, 189 S.E. 335, 1937 Va. LEXIS 282 (1937) (decided under prior law). Localities may adopt ordinances not in conflict with Title 46.1 (now Title 46.2).  Under former § 46.1-880 (now this section) localities may adopt ordinances not in conflict with provisions of Title 46.1 (now Title 46.2), and the governing bo dy of the locality may authorize its chief administrative officer to increase and decrease speeds based upon an engineering and traffic investigation by such county.

Former § 46.1-196 (now § 46.2-881) not inconsistent with allowing counties to adopt lower speeds.  Former § 46.1-196 (now § 46.2-881), reflecting the special interest of the General Assembly in the structural safety of bridges, is not inconsistent with al lowing counties to adopt lower speeds on highways, including bridges, for the purposes of vehicular safety, pursuant to former § 46.1-180 (now this section). Nelson v. County of Henrico, 10 Va. App. 558, 393 S.E.2d 644, 7 Va. Law Rep. 27, 1990 Va. App . LEXIS 126 (1990). State statutes regulating the flow of traffic at intersections take precedence over loca l ordinances which prohibit drivers of vehicles from passing through or between processions, unless specific exception is made in the statutes. Paige v. Edgar, 210 Va. 54, 168 S.E.2d 103, 1969 Va. LEXIS 195 (1969). Intent that brid ge be considered part of highway.  The General Assembly, for the purposes of former § 46.1-180 (a) (1) (now subdivision A. 1.), intended that a bridge be considered as part of a highway. Nelson v. County of Henrico, 10 Va. App. 558, 393 S.E.2d 644, 7 Va. Law Rep. 27, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 126 (1990). Evidence that no traffic or engineering study had been performed.  As defendants proffered testimony tended to prove that no traffic or engineering study had been performed in order to establish a 30-mile-per-hour speed limit on the street where she was stopped, the evidence was relevant and admissible, and the trial court erred by refusing to admit it to rebut the presumption created by § 46.2-878 that the change in speed had been properly established. Bahen v. City of H ampton, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 504 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 26, 2004). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Speed limit properly established.  Although the defendants contended that the city failed to pass Charlottesville, Va. Code § 15-99 pursuant to §§ 46.2-878 and 46.2-1300, which established the necessary procedures for the city to create a decreased speed limit on a limited access highway, and therefore that Charlottesville, Va. Code § 15-99 without effect and unenforceable, according to § 46.2-878, there was a rebuttable presumption that the speed limits were properly established. In the instant case, the rebuttable presumption at issue was not related to the elements of the offense, but only presumed the validity of the decreased maximum speed limit, and therefore, the law explici tly presumed that the Route 250 Bypass speed ordinance was prescribed after a traffic engineering investigation; the defendants failed to provide clear evidence to rebut the presumption that the speed limits on the Route 250 Bypass were enacted pursuant to the provisions of § 46.2-878. Commonwealth v. Tocci, 84 Va. Cir. 359, 2012 Va. Cir. LEXIS 135 (Charlottesville Mar. 12, 2012). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Constitutionality.  Since the funds collected by localities in enforcing their traffic light laws do not constitute fines for offenses against the Commonwealth, the General A ssembly constitutionally may permit localities to retain such funds.

County of Prince William, 49 Va. App. 105, 637 S.E.2d 338, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 545 (2006). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Highway.  Roadways in a subdivision were highways for law-enforcement purposes because a repealed Virginia Code title was immediately reenacted by the Virginia Legislature as a different title without substantial change, thus maintaining a lawfully enacted ordinance by the county board of supervisors that designated private roads as highways. Commonwealth v. Taylor, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 201 (Greene County May 29, 2019). Because the county board of supervisors declared the roadways within the subdivision as highways at the request of the subdivision, the roads were highways for la w enforcement purposes. Commonwealth v. Taylor, 102 Va. Cir. 190, 2019 Va. Cir. LEXIS 1198 (Greene County May 29, 2019). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Traffic laws may be enforced before street is accepted into the secondary system of state highways.  As a prerequisite to the enforcement of Virginias traffic laws, it is not necessary that a street be constructed in accordance with standards established by t he Department of Transportation and actually accepted into the secondary system of state highways. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Randall R. Hamilton, Town Attorney for the Town of Berryville, 00-018 (10/31/00). Property owners  association stopping vehicles.  A property owners association may not compel a vehicle driver to stop, unless done by a local law enforcement agency or by a private security service that is properly licensed by the Department of Criminal Justice Services, and whose employees have also been appointed as conservators of the peace. To enforce traffic laws on privately owned streets, a property owners association may request the local law e nforcement agency to do so, or the local governing body may designate the private streets as highways for law enforcement purposes. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Bryce E. Reeves, Member, Senate of Virginia, No. 13-106, (8/13/1 4). § 46.2-1307.1.

Text Notwithstanding the provisions of § 46.2-1307, the governing body of Warren County may adopt ordinances designating the private roads within any residential developm ent containing 50 or more lots as highways for law-enforcement purposes, and the governing body of Greene County, upon receipt of a petition therefore by a majority of property owners within a residential development containing 25 or more lots, may adopt ordinances designating the private roads within any such development as highways for law-enforcement purposes.

Annotations CASE NOTES Aim in adopting traffic control device manual.  Nothing inherent in the authority invoked by the Commonwealth Transportation Board when it adopted the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as a stan dard suggests that railroads would be relieved of their responsibility to discover especially hazardous crossings and to erect lights and other appropriate protective devices at such crossings. Rather, the adoption of MUTCD seems to have been aimed princ ipally at setting standards to make highway safety measures implemented by local agencies consistent with those implemented by state agencies.

B. Any such st atements, threats, promises, acts, contracts, or offers of contracts, when their effect may be to lessen or eliminate competition or tend to create a monopoly, are declared unfair trade practices and unfair methods of competition and are prohibited.

For purposes o f this section, the refusal by an affiliate of a manufacturer or distributor to accept assignment of a retail installment sales contract or lease solely because it includes a product in connection with the sale of the vehicle not sponsored, sold, or offe red by the manufacturer or distributor, or any affiliate thereof, shall be unlawful; but an affiliate of a manufacturer or distributor may establish standards for products in connection with a sale of a vehicle to be included in retail installment sales contracts or leases it will accept, provided the standards, including the establishment of maximum prices for products, are equally enforceable and enforced with respect to products in connection with the sale of a vehicle sponsored, sold, or offered by the manufacturer, distributor, or affiliate and products that are not. Nothing in this section prohibits a manufacturer, distributor, or affiliate from offering dealer or consumer incentive programs directly related to the sale of products sponsored, sol d, or offered by the manufacturer, distributor, or affiliate whether or not in connection with any retail installment sales contract or lease. A dealer that chooses not to participate in these programs shall not be penalized as a result. Non-payment of t he incentive due to non-participation in the incentive programs directly related to the sale of products sponsored, sold, or offered by the manufacturer, distributor, or affiliate by the dealer shall not qualify as a penalty. E. Any person aggrieved by an action prohibited by this section may seek a hearing, pursuant to § 46.2-1573, against any manufacturer or distributor licensed under this title. F. Nothing con tained in this section shall prohibit a manufacturer or distributor from offering or providing incentive benefits or bonus programs to a retail motor vehicle dealer or prospective retail motor vehicle dealer in the Commonwealth who makes the voluntary de cision to offer to sell or sell any extended service contract or extended maintenance plan offered, sold, backed, or sponsored by the manufacturer or distributor or to sell, assign, or transfer any retail installment sale or lease by him in the Commonwea lth of motor vehicles manufactured or sold by the manufacturer or distributor to a specified finance company or leasing company controlled by or affiliated with the manufacturer or distributor.

If there is no remedy or there are no parts available from the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch to remediate each affected used motor vehicle in the inventory of the dealer, the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch shal l (a) compensate the dealer for any affected used motor vehicle in the inventory of the dealer that it cannot sell because of such coercion or requirement at least one percent a month or any part thereof of the cost of such used motor vehicle, including repairs and reconditioning expenses based on the financial records of the dealer, and (b) establish a written procedure to compensate dealers under this subdivision that it shall provide to dealers subject to its coercion or requirement and file with the Commissioner as a franchise document pursuant to § 46.2-1566.Any claim for compensation by a dealer shall be submitted on a monthly basis for the amount owed pursuant to this subdivision. The manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch shall process and pay the claim in the same manner as a claim for warranty reimbursements as provided in § 46.2-1571. This subdivision shall not prevent a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch from (1) requiring that a motor vehicle not be subject to an open recall or stop sale directive in order to be qualified, remain qualified, or be sold as a certified pre-owned vehicle or similar designation; (2) paying incentives for selling used vehicles with no unremedied rec alls; or (3) paying incentives for performing recall repairs on a vehicle in the dealers inventory.Nothing in this subdivision shall prevent a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch from instructing that a dealer repair used vehicles of the line-make for which the dealer holds a franchise with an open recall, provided that the instruction does not involve coercion that imposes a penalty or provision of loss of benefits on the dealer. 3. To prevent or refuse to approve the sale or transfer of the ownership of a dealership by the sale of the business, stock transfer, or otherwise, or the transfer, sale, or assignment of a dealer franchise, or a change in the executive management or principal operator of the dealership, unless the franchisor provides written notice to the dealer of its objection and the reasons therefor by certified mail or overnight delivery or other m ethod designed to ensure delivery to the dealer at least 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of the transfer, sale, assignment, or change. No such objection shall be sufficient unless the failure to approve is reasonable. Notwithstanding the pro visions of subsection D of § 46.2-1573, the only grounds that may be considered reasonable for a failure to approve are that an individual who is the applicant or is in control of an entity that is an applicant (i) lacks good moral character, (ii) lac ks reasonable motor vehicle dealership management experience and qualifications, (iii) lacks financial ability to be the dealer, or (iv) fails to meet the standards otherwise established by this title to be a dealer. No such objection shall be effective to prevent the sale, transfer, assignment, or change if the Commissioner has determined, if requested in writing by the dealer within 30 days after receipt of an objection to the proposed sale, transfer, or change, and after a hearing on the matter, that the failure to permit or honor the sale, transfer, assignment, or change is unreasonable under the circumstances. No franchise may be sold, assigned, or transferred unless (a) the franchisor has been given at least 90 days prior written notice by th e dealer as to the identity, financial ability, and qualifications of the proposed transferee on forms generally utilized by the franchisor to conduct its review, as well as the full agreement for the proposed transaction, and (b) the sale or transfer of the franchise and business will not involve, without the franchisors consent, a relocation of the business. 3a. To impose a condition on the approval of the sale or transfer of the ownership of a dealership by the sale of the business, stock transfer, or otherwise if the condition would viola te the provisions of this title if imposed on the existing dealer.In the event the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch takes action to prevent or refuse to approve the sale or transfer of the ownership of a dealership by the s ale of the business, stock transfer, or otherwise, or the transfer, sale or assignment of a dealer franchise, or a change in the executive management or principal operator of the dealership, without a statement of specific grounds for doing so that is co nsistent with subdivision 3 hereof or imposes a condition in violation of subdivision 3a hereof, that shall constitute a violation of this section.

Each motor vehicle manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch shall (i) specify in writing to each of its motor vehicle dealers licensed in the Commonwealth the dealers obligations for preparation, delivery, recall, and warranty service on its products and (ii) compensate the dealer for recall or warranty parts, service, and diagnostic work required of the dealer by the manufacturer or distributor as follows: 1. Compe nsation of a dealer for recall or warranty parts, service, and diagnostic work shall not be less than the amounts charged by the dealer for the manufacturers or distributors original parts, service, and diagnostic work to retail customers for non warranty service, parts, and diagnostic work installed or performed in the dealers service department, and the determination of compensation in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be deemed reasonable due to the substantial number of repair orders reviewed, unless the manufacturer can show that the amounts are not reasonable. All manufacturer or distributor compensated parts, service, diagnostic work, updates to a vehicle accessory or function, or initialization or repair of a vehic le part, system, accessory, or function performed by the dealer shall be subject to this subsection. Recall or warranty parts compensation shall be stated as a percentage of markup, which shall be an agreed reasonable approximation of retail markup and w hich shall be uniformly applied to all of the manufacturers or distributors parts unless otherwise provided for in this section. If the dealer and manufacturer or distributor cannot agree on the recall or warranty parts compensation markup to be paid to the dealer, the markup shall be determined by an average of the dealers retail markup on all of the manufacturers or distributors parts as described in subdivisions 2 and 3. 2. For purposes of determining recall or warranty parts and service compensation paid to a dealer by the manufacturer or distributor, including body-shop repairs, only retail repair order s, or the retail portion of repair orders containing retail and non-retail operations, shall be considered. For the purposes of this section, retail does not include menu-priced parts or services, services and parts used in internal repairs paid by the dealer, group discounts, special event discounts, special event promotions, and insurance-paid repairs. 3. Increases in dealer recall or warranty parts and service compensation and diagnostic work compensation, pursuant to this section, shall be requested by the dealer in writing, shall be based on 100 consecutive repair orders or all repair orders over a 90-day period, whichever occurs first. If any portion of a retail repair order includes amounts that are not retail, such portion shall be excluded. Compensation for parts shall be stated as a percentage of markup that shall be uniformly applied to all the manufacturers or distributors parts. 4. In the case of recall or warranty parts compensation, the provisions of this subsection shall be effective only for model year 1992 and succeeding model years. 5. If a manufacturer or distributor furnishes a part to a dealer at no cost for use by the dealer in performing work for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to compensate th e dealer under this section, the manufacturer or distributor shall compensate the dealer for the part in the same manner as recall or warranty parts compensation, less the wholesale costs, for such part as listed in the manufacturers current price sc hedules. A manufacturer or distributor may pay the dealer a reasonable handling fee instead of the compensation otherwise required by this subsection for special high-performance complete engine assemblies in limited production motor vehicles that consti tute less than five percent of model production furnished to the dealer at no cost, if the manufacturer or distributor excludes such special high-performance complete engine assemblies in determining whether the amounts requested by the dealer for recall or warranty compensation are consistent with the amounts that the dealer charges its other retail service customers for parts used by the dealer to perform similar work. 6. In the case of service work, manufacturer original parts or parts otherwise specified by the manufacturer or distributor, and parts provided by a dealer either pursuant to an adjustmen t program as defined in § 59.1-207.34 or as otherwise requested by the manufacturer or distributor, the dealer shall be compensated in the same manner as for recall or warranty service or parts. This section does not apply to compensation for parts such as components, systems, fixtures, appliances, furnishings, accessories, and features that are designed, used, and maintained primarily for nonvehicular, residential purposes. Recall, warranty, and sales incentive audits of dealer records may be conducted by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch on a reasonable basis, and dealer claims for recall, warranty, or sales incentive compensation shall not be denied except for good cause, such as performance of nonwarranty repairs, lack of material documentation, fraud, or misrepresentation. A dealers failure to comply with the specific requirements of the manufacturer or distributor for processing the claim shall not constitute grounds for the denial of the claim or reduction of the amount of compensation to the dealer as long as reasonable documentation or other evidence has been presented to substantiate the claim. The manufacturer, factory bra nch, distributor, or distributor branch shall not deny a claim or reduce the amount of compensation to the dealer for recall or warranty repairs to resolve a condition discovered by the dealer during the course of a separate repair requested by the custo mer or to resolve a condition on the basis of advice or recommendation by the dealer. Claims for dealer compensation shall be paid within 30 days of dealer submission or within 30 days of the end of an incentive program or rejected in writing for stated reasons. The manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch shall reserve the right to reasonable periodic audits to determine the validity of all such paid claims for dealer compensation. Any chargebacks for recall or warranty parts or service compensation and service incentives shall only be for the six-month period immediately following the date of the claim and, in the case of chargebacks for sales compensation only, for the six-month period immediately following the date of claim. However, such limitations shall not be effective if a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch has reasonable cause to believe that a claim submitted by a dealer is intentionally false or fraudulent. For purposes of this section, reasonable cause means a bona fide belief based upon evidence that the material issues of fact are such that a person of ordinary caution, prudence, and judgment could believe that a claim was intentionally false or fraudulent. A dealer shall no t be charged back or otherwise liable for sales incentives or charges related to a motor vehicle sold by the dealer to a purchaser other than a licensed, franchised motor vehicle dealer and subsequently exported or resold, unless the manufacturer, factor y branch, distributor, or distributor branch can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the dealer should have known of and did not exercise due diligence in discovering the purchasers intention to export or resell the motor vehicle. B. It shall be unlawful for any motor vehicle manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch to: 1. Fail to perform any of its recall or warranty obligations, including tires, with respect to a motor vehicle; 2. Fail to assume all responsibility for any liability resulting from structural or production defects; 3. Fail to include in written notices of factory recalls to vehicle owners and dealers the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment will be available to dealers for the correc tion of defects; 4. Fail to compensate any of the motor vehicle dealers licensed in the Commonwealth for repairs effected by the dealer of merchandise damaged in manufacture or transit to the dealer where the carrier is designated by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch; 5. Fail to fully compensate its motor vehicle dealers licensed in the Commonwealth for recall or warranty parts, work, and service pursuant to subsection A either by reduction in the amou nt due to the dealer or by separate charge, surcharge, or other imposition by which the motor vehicle manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch seeks to recover its costs of complying with subsection A, or for legal costs and expen ses incurred by such dealers in connection with recall or warranty obligations for which the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch is legally responsible or which the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor br anch imposes upon the dealer. Failure to fully reimburse a dealer for the cost to the dealer of a rental vehicle provided to a customer as required, offered, advertised as available, or agreed to by the manufacturer or distributor shall be considered a v iolation of this subsection. Failure to provide compensation consistent with this section to a dealer for assistance requested by a customer whose vehicle was subjected to an over the air or remote change, repair, or update to any part, system, accessory , or function by the vehicle manufacturer or distributor and performed at the dealership to satisfy the customer shall be considered a violation of this subsection; 6.

CASE NOTES Board recommendation is prerequisite to action by Commissioner.  The opinion of the Board is advisory only and the Commissioner is not required to follow the Boards recommendation. However, subsection B of former § 46.1- 550.1 [see now this section] specifically provides that before rendering any decision under this article, the Commissioner shall obtain (now request) recommendations on the subject from the Motor Vehicle Dealers Advisory Board. The clear mandate of f ormer § 46.1-517.1 and § 46.2-1502 [now repealed] and this section is that before the Commissioner can act he must receive a recommendation from a validly constituted Board.

A veh icle shall not be advertised as new, either by word or implication, unless it is one which conforms to the requirements of § 46.2-1500. 2. When advertising any vehicle which does not conform to the definition of new as provided in § 46.2-1500, the fact that it is used shall be clearly and unequivocally expresse d by the term used or by such other term as is commonly understood to mean that the vehicle is used. By way of example but not by limitation, special purchase by itself is not a satisfactory disclosure; however, such terms as demonstr ator or former leased vehicles used alone clearly express that the vehicles are used for advertising purposes. 3. Advertisement of finance charges or other interest rates shall not be used when there is a cost to buy-down said charge or rate which is passed on, in whole or in part, to the purchase r. 4. Terms, conditions, and disclaimers shall be stated clearly and conspicuously. An asterisk or other reference symbol may be used to point to a disclaimer or other information, but shall not be used as a means of contradicting or changing the meaning of an advertised statement. 5. The expiration date of an advertised sale shall be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. 6. The term list price, sticker price, or suggested retail price and similar terms, shall be used only in reference to the manufacturers suggested retail price for new vehicles or the dealers own usual and customary price for used vehicles. 7. Terms such as at cost, below cost, $ off cost shall not be used in advertisements because of the difficulty in determining a dealers actual net cost at the time of the sale. Terms such as invoice price, $ over invoice, may be used, provided that the invoice referred to is the manufacturers factory invoice or a bona fide bill of sale and the invoice or bill of sale is available for custom er inspection.Manufacturers factory invoice means that document supplied by the manufacturer to the dealer listing the manufacturers charge to the dealer before any deduction for holdback, group advertising, factory incentives or rebates, or any governmental charges. 8. When the price or credit terms of a vehicle are advertised, the vehicle shall be fully identified as to year, make, and model. In addition, in advertisements placed by individual deale rs and not line-make marketing groups, the advertised price or credit terms shall include all charges which the buyer must pay to the seller, except buyer-selected options, state and local fees and taxes, and manufacturers or distributors freight or destination charges, and a processing fee, if any. If a processing fee or freight or destination charges are not included in the advertised price, the amount of any such processing fee and freight or destination charge must be (i) clearly and conspic uously disclosed in not less than eight-point boldface type or (ii) not smaller than the largest typeface within the advertisement. If the processing fee is not included in the advertised price, the amount of the processing fee may be omitted from any ad vertisement in which the largest type size is less than eight-point typeface, so long as the dealer participates in a media-provided listing of processing fees and the dealers advertisement includes an asterisk or other such notation to refer the rea der to the listing of the fees. 9. Advertisements which set out a policy of matching or bettering competitors prices shall not be used unless the terms of the offer are specific, verifiable and reasonable. 10. Advertisements of dealer rebates shall not be used. This does not affect advertisement of manufacturer rebates. 11. Free, at no cost, or other words to that effect shall not be used unless the free item, merchandise, or service is available without a purchase. This provisi on shall not apply to advertising placed by manufacturers, distributors, or line-make marketing groups. 12. Bait advertising, in which an advertiser may have no intention to sell at the price or terms advertised, shall not be used. By way of example, but not by limitation: a. If a specific vehicle is advertised, the seller shall be in possession of a reasonable supply of said vehicles, and they shall be available at the advertised price. If the advertised vehicle is available only in limited numbers or only by order, that sha ll be stated in the advertisement. For purposes of this subdivision, the listing of a vehicle by stock number or vehicle identification number in the advertisement is one means of satisfactorily disclosing a limitation of availability. b. Advertising a vehicle at a certain price, including as low as statements, but having available for sale only vehicles equipped with dealer added cost options which increase the selling price, above the advertised price, shall also be considered bait advertising. c. If a lease payment is advertised, the fact that it is a lease arrangement shall be disclosed. 13. The term repossessed shall be used only to describe vehicles that have been sold, registered, titled and then taken back from a purchaser and not yet resold to an ultimate u ser. Advertisers offering repossessed vehicles for sale shall provide proof of repossession upon request. 14. Words such as finance or loan shall not be used in a motor vehicle advertisers firm name or trade name, unless that person is actually engaged in the financing o f motor vehicles. 15. Any advertisement which gives the impression a dealer has a special arrangement or relationship with the distributor or manufacturer, as compared to similarly situated dealers, shal l not be used.

Each salvag e vehicle that has been rebuilt for use on the highways shall be submitted for a state safety inspection in accordance with § 46.2-1157. The inspection shall be conducted by an inspector wholly unaffiliated with the person requesting the inspection of the vehicle. B. 1. Upon passage of a state safety inspection, each rebuilt vehicle shall be examined by the Department prior to the issuance of a title for the vehicle. The examination by the Department shall include a review of video or photographic images of the vehicle prior to being rebuilt, if available; all documentation for the parts and labor used for the repair of the salvage vehicle; and verification of the vehicles identification number, confidential number, odometer reading, and engine, transmission, or electronic modules, if applicable. This inspection shall serve as an antitheft and ant ifraud measure and shall not certify the safety or roadworthiness of the vehicle. The Commissioner shall ensure that, in scheduling and performing examinations of salvage vehicles under this section, single vehicles owned by private owner-operators are a fforded no lower priority than examinations of vehicles owned by motor vehicle dealers, salvage pools, licensed auto recyclers, or vehicle removal operators. The Commissioner may charge a fee of $125 per vehicle, for the examination of rebuilt vehicles. 2. The examination described in subdivision 1 shall not be required for a rebuilt vehicle if (i) the person rebuilding the vehicle has been licensed under this chapter for at least 10 yea rs and has not incurred any penalties pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; (ii) the rebuilt vehicle is at least 10 years old but does not qualify as an antique motor vehicle; and (iii) the resale value of the rebuilt vehicle is less than $10,000. Any rebuilder who sells a rebuilt vehicle without an examination, as authorized by this subdivision, shall be required to maintain all required records for rebuilt vehicles described in subdivision 1 for inspection upon request of the Department or any l aw-enforcement official. C. Any salvage vehicle whose vehicle identification number or confidential number has been altered, is missing, or appears to have been tampered with may be impounded by the Department until completion of an investigation by the Department. The vehicle may not be move d, sold, or tampered with until the completion of this investigation. Upon completion of an investigation by the Department, if the vehicle identification number is found to be missing or altered, a new vehicle identification number may be issued by the Department. If the vehicle is found to be a stolen vehicle and its owner can be determined, the vehicle shall be returned to him. If the owner cannot be determined or located and the person seeking to title the vehicle has been convicted of a violation o f § 46.2-1074 or 46.2-1075, the vehicle shall be deemed forfeited to the Commonwealth and said forfeiture shall proceed in accordance with Chapter 22.1 (§ 19.2-386.1 et seq.) of Title 19.2. D. If the Depa rtments examination of a rebuilt salvage vehicle indicates no irregularities, a title and registration may be issued for the vehicle upon application therefor to the Department by the owner of the salvage vehicle. The title issued by the Department a nd any subsequent title thereafter issued for the rebuilt vehicle shall be permanently branded to indicate that it is a rebuilt vehicle. All rebuilt vehicles shall be subject to all safety equipment requirements provided by law. Except as otherwise provi ded in this chapter, no title or registration shall be issued by the Department for any rebuilt vehicle that has not first passed a safety inspection or for any vehicle for which a nonrepairable certificate has ever been issued. E. If the Depa rtments examination of a rebuilt salvage vehicle reveals irregularities in the required documentation or obvious defects, the Department shall identify to the owner the irregularities and defects that must be corrected before the Departments exam ination can be completed. F. Notwithstan ding § 46.2-1550, a licensed salvage dealer or rebuilder who is also licensed as a motor vehicle dealer pursuant to Chapter 15 (§ 46.2-1500 et seq.) may use dealers license plates for the sole purpose of transporting a rebuilt salvage vehicle t o and from an official safety inspection station. Such dealers license plates may not be used on any vehicle not owned by the licensed salvage dealer or rebuilder. For all other rebuilt salvage vehicles, when necessary and upon application, the Depar tment shall issue temporary trip permits in accordance with § 46.2-651 for this purpose.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The case annotated below was decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 56. Public convenience and necessity.   As used in the statutes regulating motor vehicle carriers, the words in the phrase public convenience and necessity are not semantically independent and d istinct but conceptually interrelated. The word convenience modifies and qualifies the literal import of the word necessity. Considered contextually, the two words do not require a showing of imperative need rooted in public hardship. In applying the statutory phrase, the commission is entitled to consider public convenience as well as an imbalance in supply and demand. Abbott Bus Lines v. Courtesy Bus Lines, 230 Va. 181, 335 S.E.2d 818, 1985 Va. LEXIS 267 (1985). Protection against ruinous compe tition.  The General Assembly, recognizing the public benefits of competition in the market place, authorized the Commission to deny a charter party certificate only when it finds that a grant will create competitive pressures so intense that existing carriers will be unable to earn a reasonable profit. By protecting certificated carriers from such ruinous competition, the statute protects the public from loss of service. Abbott Bus Lines v. Courtesy Bus Lines, 230 Va. 181, 335 S.E.2d 818, 1985 Va.

Some of the annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 56. Legislative intent and criteria.  The General Assembly, by enacting a former version of this section, intended that the public receive special and charter party service that is economical, comfort able and convenient, and that the State Corporation Commissions decision in granting or denying such a certificate be based upon a consideration of three factors, namely: (1) an existing public need for the proposed carriers service; (2) the prop osed carriers ability to provide economical, comfortable and convenient service for the geographical area; and (3) the economic and competitive impact which the proposed carrier would have upon existing carriers providing similar service within the s ame territory. Atlantic Greyhound Lines v. Jones Bus Co., 216 Va. 255, 217 S.E.2d 857, 1975 Va. LEXIS 277 (1975). Existing carriers not guaranteed exclusive license to operate indefinitely.  The statutory protection is not so broad as to guarantee existing carriers an exclusive license to operate indefinitely in a particular community. Although this s ection empowers the commission to place such restrictions upon [new] certificates as may be reasonably necessary to protect any existing motor carrier, the statute expressly forbids the commission to deny a certificate solely on the ground th at the applicant may render special or charter party service originating at the same point or points as [existing] motor carriers. Abbott Bus Lines v. Courtesy Bus Lines, 230 Va. 181, 335 S.E.2d 818, 1985 Va. LEXIS 267 (1985). Record sustaining grant of certifi cate.  The Commissions grant of a certificate was upheld where the record showed there was a demand for charter party service which was unmet and that the applicant had local offices and appropriate equipment to satisfy the need more economically than the objectors, whose main function was transportation over designated routes for a separate fare charged each passenger. Atlantic Greyhound Lines v. Silver Fox Lines, 204 Va. 360, 131 S.E.2d 284, 1963 Va. LEXIS 157 (1963). Effect of Commissions find ings on appeal.  The findings of the Commission must be regarded by the Supreme Court as prima facie just, reasonable, and correct, and cannot be upset in the absence of a showing of an abuse of the discretion vested in it by statutory and constitutional provisions. Atlantic Greyhound Lines v. Silver Fox Lines, 204 Va. 360, 131 S.E.2d 284, 1963 Va. LEXIS 157 (1963). Decision of the State Corporation Commission is presumed to be correct. Atlantic Greyhoun d Lines v. Jones Bus Co., 216 Va. 255, 217 S.E.2d 857, 1975 Va. LEXIS 277 (1975). Unless contrary to or without eviden ce.  A determination made by the State Corporation Commission, based upon the application of correct principles of law, will not be disturbed unless it is contrary to the evidence or without evidence to support it.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 3B M.J. Carriers, §§ 103, 104.1. CASE NOTES Editors note. The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 56. Commission [now the Department] to ascertain and determine facts.  It is the duty of the Commission to ascertain and determine the facts and in doing so, it is within the province of that body to draw just and reasonable inferenc es from the proved facts. When that has been done, its factual finding is entitled to and must be accorded weight and its final decision must be regarded as prima facie just, reasonable and correct. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 799, 71 S.E.2d 146, 1952 Va. LEXIS 192 (1952). The use of the words may, among other things, in a former version of this sectio n, preceding the enumeration of four other things, which may be considered by the State Corporation Commission in determining whether a certificate of public convenience and necessity shall be granted to a carrier by motor vehicle, shows clearly that the four things enumerated were not the only things the legislature intended to be considered by the Commission in determining whether or not a certificate should be granted. Jessup v. Commonwealth, 174 Va. 133, 5 S.E.2d 482, 1939 Va. LEXIS 147 (1939). This section and § 56-282 inapplicable if competing carriers operate over different routes.  A carrier was authorized to carry interstate passengers between Roanoke and Lynchburg over Routes 24, 122 and 297, through Bedford, and to operate intrastate pass enger service over all but 23 miles in the center of this route, leading into and out of Bedford. The State Corporation Commission, on a finding of convenience and necessity, issued the carrier a certificate for intrastate service over the 23 miles with authority to carry passengers between Lynchburg and Roanoke over this route. This action of the Commission was proper, and did not involve any duplication of the service of another carrier, which operated between Lynchburg and Roanoke over Route 460, or infringe upon the latters rights. Since the two carriers operated over different routes, this section and § 56-282 were inapplicable. Atlantic Greyhound Corp. v. Commonwealth, 196 Va. 183, 83 S.E.2d 379, 1954 Va. LEXIS 212 (1954). § 46.2-2011.1. Issuance of temporary authority. Text To enable the provision of service for which there is an immediate and urgent need to a point or between points in Virginia where certificated carriers are unable to pe rform the service, or within a territory having no certificated carrier, the Department may, in its discretion and without hearings or other proceedings, grant temporary authority for such service by a carrier that would otherwise be required to obtain a certificate under this chapter. Such temporary authority, unless suspended or revoked in accordance with § 46.2-2011.26, shall be valid for such time as the Department shall specify, but for not more than an aggregate of 180 days, and shall create no presumption that corresponding permanent authority will be granted thereafter.

Whether or not public convenience and necessity require rendition of the service offered is an issue addressed to the sound discretion of the Commission. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 799, 71 S.E.2d 146, 1952 Va. LEXIS 192 (1952). It is not mandatory upon the Commission to grant a certificate authorizing an applicant to establish a freight line over all sectors of every highway, even though there may be no other carrier by motor vehicles serving that particular sector of the highway in question. Whether such a right shall be granted is addressed to the sound discre tion of the Commission. Lee Compton Lines v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 411, 65 S.E.2d 515, 1951 Va. LEXIS 187 (1951). The Commission may award a railroad a certificate to operate motor vehicles and furnish service auxiliary and supplemental to rail service presently rendered by the railroad, provided it be shown that the public convenience and necessity require such proposed service over the route and that the present motor carrier cannot or will not furni sh the service offered. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 799, 71 S.E.2d 146, 1952 Va. LEXIS 192 (1952). Public convenience is always the paramount consideration. However, in arriving at this p aramount consideration, the convenience and necessity of the entire public affected by the proposed line should be considered. For unnecessary duplication of transportation facilities, the public ultimately pays. Shoestring competition, in the en d, hurts everybody. Lee Compton Lines v. Commonwealth, 192 Va. 411, 65 S.E.2d 515, 1951 Va. LEXIS 187 (1951). Words route and highway defined and distinguished.  The words route and highway, as used in this article, are not synonymous. The word route means a direction of travel from one place to ano ther. It may be over one or more named or numbered highways or paths. A highway is a road for travel, and may be a portion of one or more different routes. When numbered or named as a highway running from one point to another, it becomes a route. Virginia Stage Lines v. Commonwealth, 186 Va. 1066, 45 S.E.2d 318, 1947 Va. LEXIS 223 (1947). Meaning of public convenience and necessity.  The word convenience, as connected with the word necessity in a former version of this section is so connected, not as an additional requirement, but to modify and qualify what might otherwise be taken as the strict significance of the word necessity. In the phrase public convenience and necessity the word necessity means that which is needful, essential, requisite or condu cive to public convenience. When more convenient and adequate service is offered to the public, it would seem that necessity requires such public convenience should be served. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 799, 71 S.E.2d 146, 19 52 Va. LEXIS 192 (1952). Necessity means reasonably necessary and not absolutely imperative. The convenience of the public must not be circumscribed by holding the term necess ity in a former version of this section to mean an essential requisite. It is necessary if it appears reasonably requisite, is suited to and tends to promote the accommodation of the public. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 799, 71 S.E .2d 146, 1952 Va. LEXIS 192 (1952). A certificate to operate over irregular routes as a motor vehicle carrier of either pass engers or property is not contemplated or authorized by a former version of this chapter. O.C. Wiley &amp; Sons v. Commonwealth, 189 Va. 982, 55 S.E.2d 44, 1949 Va. LEXIS 234 (1949). Vi rginia-to-Virginia traffic routed through West Virginia.  Where an interstate motor carrier certificated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but without a permit from Virginia allowing intrastate operations, was fined by the Corporation Commission for carrying shipments originating at points in Virginia and destined for points in Virginia but routed through West Virginia, the Corporation Commission having found that the routes thus employed were a subterfuge to evade state law, and the fine was upheld by the Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court reversed on the ground that the interpretation of the carriers interstate commerce certificate should first be litigated before the Interstate Commerce Commissi on, which had interpreted the certificate as authorizing the Virginia-to-Virginia traffic routed through West Virginia. If Virginia believed that the operation was not bona fide interstate, it had a remedy by filing a complaint with the Interstate Commer ce Commission under the Interstate Commerce Act. Service Storage &amp; Transf. Co. v. Virginia, 359 U.S. 171, 79 S. Ct. 714, 3 L. Ed. 2d 717, 1959 U.S. LEXIS 1778 (1959). Receipts excluded from tax base.  Receipts from interurban bus line conducted by electric railway corporation under certificate of public convenience and necessity granted pursuant to former § 56-278 et seq., and not under any franchise, were properly excluded from base of franchise tax under former § 58-520 and §§ 58-660 through 58-671.

For related discussion, see 3B M.J. Carriers, § 103. CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 56. The State Corporation Commission has wide discretion in the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity to carriers, and its judgments are presumed correct. Atlantic Greyhound Corp. v. Commonwealth, 196 Va. 183, 83 S.E.2d 379, 1954 Va. LEXIS 212 (1954). Issuance of certificate to competing carrier.  Where the proposed route of a carrier applying for a certificate under a former version of this article and the route held under such a certificate by another car rier lay between totally different terminal points, and the only relation between the two routes was the fact that they occupied the same highway or roadway for a few miles through a distinctly agricultural community, the Commission was not justified, un der this section, in refusing a certificate for the portion of a roadway where the proposed and the established routes coincided. Virginia Stage Lines v. Commonwealth, 186 Va. 1066, 45 S.E.2d 318, 1947 Va. LEXIS 223 (1947). Under a former version of this article, until an opportunity has been afforded the existing certificate holder to remedy any inadequacy, the State Corporation Com mission has no power to issue another certificate over the same route. Virginia Stage Lines v. Commonwealth, 185 Va. 390, 38 S.E.2d 576, 1946 Va. LEXIS 208 (1946). This section and § 56-282 inapplicable if competing carriers operate over different routes.  A carrier was authorized to carry interstate passengers between Roanoke and Lynchburg over Routes 24, 122 and 297, through Bedford, and to operate intrastate pass enger service over all but 23 miles in the center of this route, leading into and out of Bedford. The State Corporation Commission, on a finding of convenience and necessity, issued the carrier a certificate for intrastate service over the 23 miles with authority to carry passengers between Lynchburg and Roanoke over this route. This action of the Commission was proper, and did not involve any duplication of the service of another carrier, which operated between Lynchburg and Roanoke over Route 460, or infringe upon the latters rights. Since the two carriers operated over different routes, a former version of this section and former § 56-282 were inapplicable. Atlantic Greyhound Corp. v. Commonwealth, 196 Va. 183, 83 S.E.2d 379, 1954 Va. LEXIS 2 12 (1954). When additiona l certificates should not be granted.  If the public convenience and necessity are being reasonably and adequately served by a certificated carrier, additional certificates on the same route that injur e or jeopardize the initial certificate holder should not be granted. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Commonwealth, 193 Va. 799, 71 S.E.2d 146, 1952 Va. LEXIS 192 (1952). Denial of application held prima facie correct.  Since the State Corporation Commission found that there is no evidence that existing multiple carrier service is inadequate and that the facts in support of publi c convenience and necessity do not justify the requested certificate, as required under a former version of this article, the Commissions denial of an application for a new line over an existing one is prima facie just, reasonable and correct. Caroli na Coach Co. v. SCC, 214 Va. 422, 201 S.E.2d 797, 1974 Va. LEXIS 151 (1974). Extension of certifica te of competing carrier.  Under a former version of this article, a carrier was entitled to an opportunity and reasonable time to correct any inadequacy in service before the certificate o f another carrier, operating between the same cities but over a different route, was extended to authorize delivery of freight to a plant located on the first carriers route.

The Department shall issue no more certificates than the public convenience and necessity require, and shall place such restrictions upon such certificates as may be reasonably necessary to protect any existing regular or irregular route common carrier certificate holders operating within the proposed service area, but shall not deny a certificate solely on the ground that the applicant will operate in the same service area that an existing regular or irregular route common carrier certificate holder is operating. Certificates issued hereunder shall be restricted to operation of vehicles with a passenger-carrying capacity not to exceed 15 persons, including the driver. Certificates hereunder shall also be rest ricted to prohibit pickup or delivery of passengers at their personal residence in the City of Norfolk, except that this restriction shall not apply to specially equipped vehicles for the transportation of disabled persons. A motor carrier receiving a notice of intent to award a contract under the Virginia Public Procurement Act (§ 2.2-4300 et seq.) for irregular route common carrier se rvice to or from a public-use airport located in the City of Norfolk or the County of Henrico is entitled to a conclusive presumption of a need for such service.

The case annotated below was decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 56. The test of the exemption does not include any reference to size of the operation or the method, or to the number of carriers engaged therein. That test is whether the terminal is operated in connection with and incidental to its business as a common carrier of passengers by motor vehicles and not for profit. The language of the exemption is in the plural and manifestly contemplates the joint use of bus terminals. Atlantic Greyhound Corp. v. City of Winchester, 195 Va. 302, 78 S.E.2d 666, 1953 Va. LEXIS 200 (1953). Operation of terminal held within exemption.  Where common carrier operated a bus terminal in which it leased space for locker and restaurant facilities and which it allowed other carriers to use in return fo r a percentage of their ticket sales, no profit being shown however, such operation was incidental to its business as a common carrier and not for profit; hence carrier was exempt from payment of license taxes assessed by the city on the operation of the terminal and entitled to refund of taxes paid.

CASE NOTES Motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce.  When read as a whole, § 46.2-2143 is clearly outlining financial responsibility requirements for motor carriers who are registered in the state of Virginia; th erefore, when § 46.2-2143 is considered in conjunction with the other provisions in the chapter, specifically the exemption in subdivision 2 of § 46.2-2101, it is evident that nonresident motor carriers who are engaged in interstate commerce and wh ose vehicles are principally garaged and registered in another state are exempt. Canal Ins. Co. v. Barker, No. 3:07CV339, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84474 (E.D. Va. Nov. 14, 2007), aff'd, 358 Fed. Appx. 470, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 28732 (4th Cir. 2009). Insurance requirements and nonresident interstate trucking companies.  Defendants contended that a collective reading of a policy, particularly its Out of State Insurance provision, Virginias minimum insurance requirement s for interstate trucking businesses, and applicable federal regulations, placed the policy limits at $750,000; however, the Out of State Insurance provision was not ambiguous and it clearly stated that if the laws of any state or province required a non resident to maintain insurance with respect to use of a motor vehicle in such state or province, then the policy limits would increase  the provision was aimed at protecting insureds from increased insurance requirements imposed by state law on nonre sidents, not federal law. Virginia law did not apply and the policy complied with the minimum amounts under Georgia law, thus even if defendants were permitted to reform the contract to comply with applicable law, the limits of the policy would still be $100,000.

Therefore, the carrier has not been deprived of an asset without due process of law. Metro Van &amp; Storage Co. v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 544, 221 S.E.2d 127, 1976 Va. LEXIS 164 (1976) (decided under prior law). When a household carrier merged, it ceased to exist as a corporation, thus it necessaril y follows that the carrier ceased to furnish services as a household goods carrier. Failure to furnish such services without Commission approval amounted to discontinuance of service in violation of the Commission Rules and Regulations. This acti on is willful within the meaning of a former version of this section, since the merger was approved by both corporations through resolutions of their boards of directors. Hence, the Commission had authority to revoke the certificate of the merged carrier . Metro Van &amp; Storage Co. v. Commonwealth, 216 Va. 544, 221 S.E.2d 127, 1976 Va.

Canal Ins. Co. v. Barker, No. 3:07CV339, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84474 (E.D. Va. Nov. 14, 2007), aff'd, 358 Fed. Appx. 470, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 28732 (4th Cir. 2009). Plain terms of § 46.2-2143, when read in their entirety, and even without reference to other sections of the Code, made clear that it was a registration statut e. Subsection B of § 46.2-2143 provided that all motor carriers shall keep in force at all times insurance, a bond or bonds, in an amount required by § 46.2-2143, and subsection C of § 46.2-2143 provided that the minimum insurance for motor carr iers operating in interstate commerce shall equal the minimum required by federal law, rule, or regulation. Canal Ins. Co. v. Barker, 358 Fed. Appx. 470, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 28732 (4th Cir. 2009). Out of state insurance provision.  Defendants contended that a collective reading of the policy, particularly its Out of State Insurance provision, Virginias minimum insurance requireme nts for interstate trucking businesses, and applicable federal regulations placed the policy limits at $750,000; however, the Out of State Insurance provision was not ambiguous and it clearly stated that if the laws of any state or province required a no n-resident to maintain insurance with respect to use of a motor vehicle in such state or province, then the policy limits would increase  the provision was aimed at protecting insureds from increased insurance requirements imposed by state law on non residents, not federal law. Virginia law did not apply and the policy complied with the minimum amounts under Georgia law, thus even if defendants were permitted to reform the contract to comply with applicable law, the limits of the policy would still b e $100,000. Canal Ins. Co. v. Barker, No. 3:07CV339, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84474 (E.D. Va. Nov. 14, 2007), aff'd, 358 Fed. Appx. 470, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 28732 (4th Cir. 2009). District court did not err in its interpretation that § 46.2-2143 was a registration statute that set forth the financial responsibility and insurance requirem ents before the Department of Motor Vehicles could issue registration for a vehicle operated by a motor carrier. As the insured was under no obligation to register the tractor-trailer involved in the accident in Virginia, and instead had registered and p rincipally garaged it in another state, § 46.2-2143 did not apply to the insured; therefore, § 46.2-2143 did not require the liability limit of the policy, through its out-of-state insurance provision, to be increased above the $100,000 face value of the policy. Canal Ins. Co. v. Barker, 358 Fed. Appx. 470, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 28732 (4th Cir. 2009). § 46.2-2143.1. Insurance requirement for motor carriers. Text A. All motor c arriers shall keep in force at all times insurance, a bond, or bonds in an amount required by this section. However, motor carriers exempt under subdivision 6 of § 46.2-2101 shall only be required to keep in force insurance, a bond, or bonds in the am ount required by this section that provide primary coverage (i) when the motor carrier or person acting on behalf of the motor carrier is available to transport property for compensation and (ii) from the time the motor carrier or a person acting for or on behalf of the motor carrier accepts the request to transport property and the vehicle is en route to pick up the property until the time the property has been removed from the vehicle and delivered to its final destination. B. The minimum public liability financial responsibility requirements for motor carriers operating in intrastate commerce shall be based on the gross vehicle weight rating of the vehicle as follows: for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of 10,000 p ounds, the minimum requirement is $750,000; for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of 7,500 pounds but not in excess of 10,000 pounds, the minimum requirement is $300,000; for passenger cars, motorcycles, autocycles, and vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 7,500 pounds or less, the minimum requirement for clause (i) of subsection A is $25,000 per person, $50,000 per incident for death and bodily injury and $20,000 for property damage and for clause (ii) of subsection A is $ 100,000 per person and $300,000 per incident for death and bodily injury and at least $50,000 for property damage. The minimum insurance for motor carriers operating in interstate commerce shall equal the minimum required by federal law, rule, or regulat ion. C. Notwithstan ding subsection B, the minimum public financial responsibility requirements for household goods carriers required to obtain a certificate of fitness pursuant to this chapter shall be $750,000. D. The minimum cargo insurance required for motor carriers operating in intrastate commerce shall be $50,000.
