CASE NOTES In general.  A surety can never charge a creditor with laches until he has in vain prompted the creditor to pursue the principal. The creditor need not move until he has been notified; and the same is true as to the suretys heirs and distributees. Alexander v. Byrd, 85 Va. 690, 8 S.E. 577, 1889 Va. LEXIS 82 (1889) (see Updike v. Lane, 78 Va. 132 (1883); Coles v. Ballard, 78 Va. 139 (1883); Weems v. Carter, 30 F.2d 202 (4t h Cir. 1929)). Purpose of statutes.  The mischief the statutory provisions now contained in this section and § 49-26 were intended to remedy was that a creditor, having his debt secure and being c areless whether he made it out of the real debtor or the surety, would often delay to sue till the debtor became insolvent and the whole burden was thrown on the surety. The purpose is to inform the creditor that there is danger to the sureties in his fu rther indulgence, and that if he gives it, he must do so at his own hazard. Wright v. Stockton, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 153, 1834 Va. LEXIS 28 (1834); Wright v. Snead, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 705, 1880 Va. LEXIS 70 (1880). The object of the provision for notice being protection to the sureties, it must be given a liberal construction. Wright v. Stockton, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 153, 1834 Va. LEXIS 28 (1834). It does not take away any remedy to which the surety was entitled before. Croughton v. Du val, 7 Va. (3 Call) 69, 1801 Va. LEXIS 24 (1801). Receiver not a creditor under this section.  A person appointed by a court of equity, in a pending cause, a receiver to collect the purchase money of lands sold by him as commissioner under a previous decree in the cause, and for which he had taken a bond with surety to himself as commissioner, is not a creditor in the sense of this statute, to whom a surety on the bond may give the notice to bring suit upon it. If the receiver was such a creditor, he could only have authority to sue after giving the security required of him in the decree appointing him receiver. In the absence of clear and satisfactory proof that he had given the security required, the notice to him is not sufficient to release the surety . Wright v. Snead, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 705, 1880 Va. LEXIS 70 (1880). Must sue all solvent, resident sur eties.  Under this section and § 49-26, a lender bank had to sue all solvent resident sureties, guarantors and endorsers upon default of two loans, and could not elect to sue only one guarantor. Where the bank sued only one guarantor and refused to sue another party after the guarantor demanded that it do so, the bank was precluded from enforcing the guarantors warranty. Colonial Am. Nat'l Bank v. Kosnoski, 617 F. 2d 1025, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 20618 (4th Cir. 1980). Failure to sue resident sureties precludes suing nonresident alone.  Creditor should have sued all the other solvent, resident sureties, guarantors and endorsers, upon the written demand by nonresident guarantor, and failing to do so, it is precluded from enforcing guaranty against the nonresident alone. Colonial Am. Nat'l Bank v. Kosnoski, 617 F.2d 1025, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 20618 (4th Cir. 1980). The mere delay of a creditor to enforce his claim against the principal debtor does not discharge the surety for the reason that the latter might have paid the debt and sued the principal himself, or else, by giving the creditor notice under this section, he might have required the creditor to sue within a reasonable time under the penalt y of losing his claim against the surety. Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. v. Lackland, 175 Va. 178, 8 S.E.2d 306, 1940 Va. LEXIS 160 (1940). Insufficient compliance with statute .  A notice to sue under this section, in order to release an endorser on a note, must comply substantially with the statute, and must show a clear, unequivocal and distinct demand upon or command to the creditor to institute suit upon the note. A notice to take such action as is necessary to get the endorsers name off the note, or to sue one of the parties to the note, is not a sufficient compliance wit h the statute. Edmonson v.

Ballard, 78 Va. 139, 1883 Va. LEXIS 21 (1883). Obligation of creditor.  Upon notice to the creditor by a surety, the creditor is not required to pursue the estate of the principal in equity to impeach alleged fraudulent conveyances, o r to subject an equity of the principal to the payment of his debt, or to exhaust his remedies against the principal before he can have satisfaction out of the estate of the surety. Harrison v. Price, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 553, 1874 Va. LEXIS 78 (1874). No obligation to sue out execution.  Where one surety in a bond gives notice to the obligee to sue the obligor, the statute does not peremptorily require the obligee, after obtaining judgment, to sue out execution upon it. It only requires him to use due diligence in prosecuting suit to judgment, and by execution. Harrison v. Price, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 553, 1874 Va. LEXIS 78 (1874). Must sue all solvent, resident sur eties.  Under § 49-25 and this section, a lender bank had to sue all solvent resident sureties, guarantors and endorsers upon default of two loans, and could not elect to sue only one guarantor. Where the bank sued only one guarantor and refused to sue another party after the guarantor demanded that it do so, the bank was precluded from enforcing the guarantors warranty. Colonial Am. Nat'l Bank v. Kosnoski, 617 F. 2d 1025, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 20618 (4th Cir. 1980).

Countermand of exe cution does not release surety.  A mere countermand of an execution by a creditor after it goes into the hands of the sheriff, but before it is levied, does not release a surety of the execution debtor. Humphrey v. Hitt, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 509, 1850 Va. LEXIS 3 (1850). Discharge of some sureties dis charges all.  Wherever some of several sureties are discharged by any act or omission of the obligee, the other sureties are also discharged. Wright v. Stockton, 32 Va. (5 Leig h) 153, 1834 Va. LEXIS 28 (1834). Suit required only against sol vent debtor.  This statute requires a creditor to bring suit against a principal debtor only if that debtor is not insolvent; a debtor is insolvent, within the meaning of this section, when it has insufficient property to pay all its debts. Courson v. Simpson, 251 Va. 315, 468 S.E.2d 17, 1996 Va. LEXIS 41 (1996).

CASE NOTES In general.  If there has been no judgment, but a note has been paid off by surety, the surety cannot take an assignment thereof to himself so as to enforce the note as such a gainst his principal, but would have to rely on the implied undertaking of his principal to indemnify him. Grizzle v. Fletcher, 127 Va. 663, 105 S.E. 457, 1920 Va. LEXIS 78 (1920). Form of recovery.  If a surety who has paid a debt, in whole or in part, wishes to subject the personal property of his principal by writ of fieri facias, he should proceed under th is section which gives him the right to recover from the principal the amount he has paid with interest from the time of payment and five percent damages on said amount. Grizzle v. Fletcher, 127 Va. 663, 105 S.E. 457, 1920 Va. LEXIS 78 (1920). A surety upon paying the debt to his principal, may recover the same back from the principal, in most cases after judgment or execution against him, by the statut ory proceeding by motion. Ayres v.

Amount of recovery.  The surety is entitled to judgment against the principal, for the same specific thing which he has been adjudged to pay himself. Graves v. Webb, 5 Va. (1 Call) 44 3, 1798 Va. LEXIS 34 (1798). This section does not authorize sureties to bring an action against the devisees of their principals. Bacchus v. Gee, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 68, 1830 Va. LEXIS 10 (1830). Surety deemed assignee of creditors rights and remedies for collection of amount paid.  A surety or other party secondarily liable, upon payment of the debt of his principal, may be substituted to and become the owner of all of the rights and remedie s of the creditor for the enforcement and collection of the amount or amounts so paid, and shall be deemed the assignee thereof. In re Worley, 251 F. Supp. 725, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6917 (W.D. Va. 1966). Equity will allow the surety upon payment of the debt of his principal to treat the original debt to the creditor as still subsisting and to be subrogated to the rights of the creditor for the repayment of any funds expended on behalf of the principal if the creditor possessed any special coign of advantage such as a deed of trust. These rights are not based upon the instrument evidencing the original obligation; however, they are merely additional remedies given to enforce the implied obligation of the person whose primary duty it was to pay the debt, as between the two obligors. Thus the surety or accommodation party is entitled to use these methods to collect whatever he has paid, and only that amount. In re Worley, 251 F. Supp. 725, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6917 (W.D.
