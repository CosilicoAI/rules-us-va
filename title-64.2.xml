Notice of a sellers marital status, or notice of the existence of a premarital or marital agreement, does not affect the status of a bona fide purchaser. A purchaser is one who acquires property by sale, lease, discount , negotiation, mortgage, pledge, or lien or who otherwise deals with property in a voluntary transaction, other than a gift. A purchaser gives value for property acquired in return for a binding commitment to extend credit to the transferor or an other as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a pre-existing claim, or in return for any other consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. Fiduciary includes a guardian, committee, trustee, executor, conservator, or personal representative. Personal representative includes the executor under a will or the administrator of th e estate of a decedent, the administrator of such estate with the will annexed, the administrator of such estate unadministered by a former representative, whether there is a will or not, any person who is under the order of a circuit court to take into his possession the estate of a decedent for administration, and every other curator of a decedents estate, for or against whom suits may be brought for causes of action that accrued to or against the decedent. Trustee means a trustee under a probated will or an inter vivos trust instrument. Will includes any testament, codicil, exercise of a power of appointment by will or by a writing in the nature of a will, or any other testamentary disposition.

Acts 2012, c. 614, effective October 1, 2012, recodified Titles 26, 31, and 64.1, as well as Chapters 10 (§ 37.2-1000 et seq.) and 10.1 (§ 37.2-1031 et seq. ) of Title 37.2 and Chapters 2.1 (§ 55-34.1 et seq.), 15 (§ 55-268.11et seq.), 15.1 (§ 55-277.1 et seq.), 16 (§ 55-278 et seq.), 22 (§ 55-401 et seq.), and 31 (§ 55-541.01 et seq.) of Title 55. In addition to revision by Acts 2012, c. 6 14, the recodified sections were also amended by other acts passed at the 2012 Session. As required by § 30-152, the Code Commission has incorporated the majority of these amendments into the new sections. Where appropriate, the historical citations t o former sections have been added to corresponding new sections. For tables of corresponding former and new sections, see the tables in Volume 10.

CASE NOTES Will defined.  The essence of the various definitions of the word will, as applied to the disposition of ones property after death, by lexicographers, text writers a nd in the decided cases is: The legal declaration of a persons mind as to the manner in which he would have property or estate disposed of after his death; the written instrument legally executed, by which a man makes disposition of his estate, t o take effect after his death. Smith v. Smith, 112 Va. 205, 70 S.E. 491, 1911 Va. LEXIS 72 (1911) (decided under prior law); Seefried v. Clarke, 113 Va. 365, 74 S.E. 204, 1912 Va. LEXIS 45 (1912).

LEXIS 236 (1948) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Power of attorney.  If what distinguishes a valid will from a contract or an inter-vivos trust is the absence of any transfer of the testators property during the testators l ifetime, it stands to reason that a power of attorney is equally distinguishable on those grounds.

An ad opted person is the child of an adopting parent and not of the biological parents, except that adoption of a child by the spouse of a biological parent has no effect on the relationship between the child and either biological parent. 2. The parentage of a child resulting from assisted conception is determined as provided in Chapter 9 (§ 20-156 et seq.) of Title 20. 3. Except as otherwise provided by subdivision 1 or 2, a person born out of wedlock is a child of the mother. That person is also a child of the father, if: a. The biological parents participated in a marriage ceremony before or after the birth of the child, even though the attempted marriage was prohibited by law, deemed null or void, or dissolved by a court; or b. Paternity is established by clear and convincing evidence, including scientifically reliable genetic testing, as set forth in § 64.2-103; however, paternity established pursuan t to this subdivision is ineffective to qualify the father or his kindred to inherit from or through the child unless the father has openly treated the child as his and has not refused to support the child. 4. No claim of succession based upon the relationship between a child born out of wedlock and a deceased parent of such child shall be recognized unless, within one year of the date of th e death of such parent (i) an affidavit by such child or by someone acting for such child alleging such parenthood has been filed in the clerks office of the circuit court of the jurisdiction wherein the property affected by such claim is located and (ii) an action seeking adjudication of parenthood is filed in an appropriate circuit court. The one-year limitation period runs notwithstanding the minority of such child; however, it does not apply in those cases where the relationship between the chil d born out of wedlock and the parent in question is established by (a) a birth record prepared upon information given by or at the request of such parent; (b) admission by such parent of parenthood before any court or in writing under oath; or (c) a prev iously entered judgment establishing such parents paternity by a court having jurisdiction to determine his paternity. 5. Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, an order terminating residual parental rights under § 16.1-283 terminates the rights of the parent to take from or through the child in question but the order does not otherwise affect the rights of the child, the childs kindred, or the parents kindred to take from or through the parent or the rights of the parents kindred to take from or through the child.

General Consideration. II. Adopted Children. III. Illegitimate Children. I.General Consideration. Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under prior law. The statute of descent and distribution is not a canon of presumptive intent. It cannot be employed for that purpose and thus have its terms substituted for testators intent. Newsome v. Scott, 200 Va. 833, 108 S.E.2d 369, 1959 Va. LEXIS 175 (1959). Issue is defined as natural descendants of a common ancestor. Vicars v. M ullins, 227 Va. 432, 318 S.E.2d 377, 1984 Va. LEXIS 211 (1984). II.Adopted Children. Legislature may give and take away right to inherit.  The legislature may give to adopted children the right to share in the estate of their foster parents, and it may take this right away. McFadden v. McNorton, 193 Va. 455, 69 S.E.2d 445, 1952 Va. LEXIS 154 (1952). And right is determined by law in force at death of ancestor.  The right of an adopted child to inherit is to be determined by the law in force at the death of the person from whom the inheritance is claimed. McFadden v. McNo rton, 193 Va. 455, 69 S.E.2d 445, 1952 Va. LEXIS 154 (1952). Statutory steps are essential to the creation of the artificial relationship of parent and child, out of which relationship alone the mutual rights of inheritance spring. The new relationship is founded upon the preceding actions of the parties, but it is created by the courts decree alone. Clarkson v. Bliley, 185 Va. 82, 38 S.E.2d 22, 1946 Va. LEXIS 182 (1946). Adopted child is on same footing as natural child.  The words from and through as used in this section have a plain, simple and unmistakable meaning, with two significations, which cannot be ignored. The un ited words imply, in connection with inheritance, not only the obvious meaning that an adopted child shall inherit from the adopting parents, but that the adopting parents shall be the medium through which he may inherit from their relatives. Considered in connection with the broad and comprehensive language employed, they emphasize the specific intention to put an adopted child on the same footing as the natural child, thus giving him the right to take by representation what his adopting parent would h ave taken had he been alive, or what the natural child would have taken, had there been one, upon the death of his father intestate. McFadden v. McNorton, 193 Va. 455, 69 S.E.2d 445, 1952 Va. LEXIS 154 (1952). And may inherit from remote ancestors.  A legally adopted child is entitled to inherit, according to the statutes of descent and distribution, the real estate of a deceased sister of his adopting father . McFadden v. McNorton, 193 Va. 455, 69 S.E.2d 445, 1952 Va. LEXIS 154 (1952). In Fletcher v. Flanary , 185 Va. 409, 38 S.E.2d 433 (1946), after stating that adopted children take from their foster parents, who die intestate, what children born in wedlock would take, the opinion states but they take nothing as heirs or distributees from r emote ancestors. The latter statement was not necessary to the decision of the case, which turned on the construction of a deed, and the Supreme Court does not adopt it as a construction of this section. Mott v. National Bank of Commerce, 190 Va. 100 6, 59 S.E.2d 97, 1950 Va. LEXIS 189 (1950) (see McFadden v. McNorton, 193 Va. 455, 69 S.E.2d 445 (1952)). And the statute of descents and distributions may not be altered by a private contract to adopt, whether written or oral. So a contract merely to adopt a child cannot be reasonably construed as conferring upon him the right to succeed to any part of the estate of another. Clarkson v. Bliley, 185 Va. 82, 38 S.E.2d 22, 1946 Va. LEXIS 182 (1946). When used in a will the term heir is subject to different meanings dependent upon the over-all context of the will, construed to give effect to the testators intent. It may include legal heirs under the statute of descent and distribution, or may include heirs of the body only, excluding heirs general and adopted children. Newso me v. Scott, 200 Va. 833, 108 S.E.2d 369, 1959 Va. LEXIS 175 (1959); Merson v. Wood, 202 Va. 485, 117 S.E.2d 661, 1961 Va. LEXIS 133 (1961). The words but if she should die without heir were not intended to include an adopted child. Newsome v. Scott, 200 Va. 833, 108 S.E.2d 369, 1959 Va. LEXIS 175 (1959). It would be unreasonable to say that a testatrix had in mind at the time of the execution of her will and at the time of her death that by the use of the word heirs she intended to include an adult adopted long after her death. Since there was nothing in the will to show such intention it was presumed that the testatrix intended that her property would go according to the law of natural descent, and no t according to the relationship created by law. Merson v. Wood, 202 Va. 485, 117 S.E.2d 661, 1961 Va. LEXIS 133 (1961). Issue does not include adopted children unless intent to include them is expressly or reasonably implied by the language of the will or may be reasonably inferred from extrinsic evidence properly before the court. Vicars v. Mullins, 227 Va. 432, 318 S.E.2d 377, 1984 Va. LEXIS 211 (1984). Right fixed by contract.  The legislature may from time to time change the course of descents and distributions. It may give to adopted children the right to participate in the intestate e states of their foster parents, and it may take this right away, but it cannot change a right which an ancestor by adoption can fix by contract. Fletcher v. Flanary, 185 Va. 409, 38 S.E.2d 433, 1946 Va. LEXIS 210 (1946). III.Illegitimate Children. Applicability.  Although the intestate decedents children who were born out of wedlock were required to establish in a partition suit that the children were the decedents children to prove their title to the subject real property under § 64.1-1, the statute of descents, the children were not bound by the requirements of subdivision 4 of § 64.1-5.1 applicable to the settlement of the decedents estate. Jenkins v. Johnson, 276 Va. 30, 661 S.E.2d 484, 2008 Va. LEXIS 64 (2008). This section and § 64.1-5.2 treat maternal kindred of illegitimates differently from paternal kindred. This classification is not regarded as suspect, and the Commonwealth need only show a rational basis for the disparate treatment. King v...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-103"><akn:num>§ 64.2-103</akn:num><akn:heading>Evidence of paternity</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. For the pur poses of this title, paternity of a child born out of wedlock shall be established by clear and convincing evidence, and such evidence may include the following: 1. That he cohabited openly with the mother during all of the 10 months immediately prior to the time the child was born; 2. That he gave consent to a physician or other person, not including the mother, charged with the responsibility of securing information for the preparation of a birth record that his na me be used as the father of the child upon the birth record of the child; 3. That he allowed by a general course of conduct the common use of his surname by the child; 4. That he claimed the child as his child on any statement, tax return, or other document filed and signed by him with any local, state, or federal government or any agency thereof; 5. That he admitted before any court having jurisdiction to determine his paternity that he is the father of the child; 6. That he voluntarily admitted paternity in writing under oath; 7. The results of scientifically reliable genetic tests, including DNA tests, weighted with all the evidence; or 8. Other medical, scientific, or anthropological evidence relating to the alleged parentage of the child based on tests performed by experts. B. A judgment establishing a fathers paternity made by a court having jurisdiction to determine his paternity is sufficient evidence of paternity for the purposes of this section.

This classification is not regarded as suspect, and the Commonwealth need only show a rational basis for the disparate treatment. King v. Commonwealth, 221 Va. 251, 269 S.E.2d 793, 1980 Va. LEXIS 242 (1980). Burden is on child, regardless of form of proceeding, to establish paternity by showing that the putative father gave consent to someone, other than the mother, responsible for providing vital statistics for the childs birth certificate that his name be listed as the father. Johnson v. Branson, 228 Va. 65, 319 S.E.2d 735, 1984 Va. LEXIS 173 (1984). Exhumation in determining parentage for inheritance purposes.  Use of the word may in subsection C of § 32.1-286 is not discretionary because there is nothing in the statute to suggest that the trial court has the discretion to deny an exhumation to a person who has met the statutes stated requirements; the only discretion is limited to determining whether a petitioner is a party attempting to prove parentage for inheritance purposes under §§ 64. 1-5.1 and 64.1-5.2.Martin v. Howard, 273 Va. 722, 643 S.E.2d 229, 2007 Va. LEXIS 51 (2007). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Putative father entitl ed to administer estate.  Putative father established that he was the biological father of the decedent, and thus, was entitled to serve as the estate administrator of decedents estate where he showed enough paternity factors to establish paternity by clear and convincing evidence. Williams v. Harris, 59 Va. Cir. 369, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 245 (Fairfax County Aug. 19, 2002). Putative fathers listing of decedent as his daughter, and designating her as a beneficiary on an enrollment form he submitted to the state retirement system s hortly before the decedent died was further evidence that he established paternity, and thus, that he was entitled to administer decedents estate.

B. The followi ng powers, in addition to all other powers granted by law, may be incorporated in whole or in part in any will or trust instrument by reference to this section: 1. To ke ep and retain any or all investments and property, real, personal or mixed, including stock in the fiduciary, if the fiduciary is a corporation, in the same form as they are at the time the investments and property come into the custody of the fiduciary, regardless of the character of the investments and property, whether they are such as then would be authorized by law for investment by fiduciaries, or whether a disproportionately large part of the trust or estate remains invested in one or more types of property, for such time as the fiduciary deems best, and to dispose of such property by sale, exchange, or otherwise as and when such fiduciary deems advisable. 2. At the discretion of the fiduciary, to receive additions to the estate from any source, in cash or in kind, and to hold, administer, and distribute such additions as a part of and unde r the same terms and conditions as the estate then currently held. 3. To sell, assign, exchange, transfer and convey, or otherwise dispose of, any or all of the investments and property, real, personal or mixed, that are included in, or may at any time b ecome part of the trust or estate upon such terms and conditions as the fiduciary, in his absolute discretion, deems advisable, at either public or private sale, either for cash or deferred payments or other consideration, as the fiduciary determines. Fo r the purpose of selling, assigning, exchanging, transferring, or conveying such investments and property, the fiduciary has the power to make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all instruments of conveyance, deeds of trust, or assignments in suc h form and with warranties and covenants as the fiduciary deems expedient and proper; and in the event of any sale, conveyance, exchange, or other disposition of any of the trust or estate, the purchaser shall not be obligated in any way to see to the ap plication of the purchase money or other consideration passing in connection therewith. 4.

Any lease made by the fiduciary may extend beyond the term of the trust or administration of the estate and, for the purpose of leasing such real estate, the fiduciary has the power to make, execute, acknowledge, and deliv er any and all instruments, in such form and with such covenants and warranties as the fiduciary deems expedient and proper. 6.

Such loans or advancements may be secured or unsecured, and the trustee is not liable in any way for any loss resultin g to the trust or estate by reason of the exercise of this authority. 9.

To repair, alter, improve, renovate, reconstruct, or demolish any of the buildings on the real estate held by the fiduciary and to construct such buildings and improvements thereon as the fiduciary in his discretion deems advisable. 12. To employ and compensate, out of the principal or income, or both as to the fiduciary seems proper, agents, accountants, brokers, attorneys-in-fact, attorneys-at-law, tax specialist s, licensed real estate brokers, licensed salesmen, and other assistants and advisors deemed by the fiduciary to be needful for the proper administration of the trust or estate, and to do so without liability for any neglect, omission, misconduct, or def ault of any such agent or professional representative provided he was selected and retained with reasonable care. 13. To rely upon any affidavit, certificate, letter, notice, telegram, or other paper or upon any telephone conversation believed by the fiduciary to be genuine and upon any other evide nce believed by the fiduciary to be sufficient, and to be protected and held harmless for all payments or distributions required to be made hereunder if made in good faith and without actual notice or knowledge of the changed condition or status of any p erson receiving payments or other distributions upon a condition. 14. To retain any interest held by the fiduciary in any business, whether as a stockholder or security holder of a corporation, a partner, a sole proprietor, or otherwise, for any lengt h of time, without limitations, solely at the risk of the trust or estate and without liability on the part of the fiduciary for any losses resulting therefrom; including the power to (i) participate in the conduct of such business and take or delegate t o others discretionary power to take any action with respect to its management and affairs that an individual could take as the owner of such business, including the voting of stock and the determination of any or all questions of policy; (ii) participat e in any incorporation, reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, or liquidation of the business; (iii) invest additional capital in, subscribe to additional stock or securities of, and loan money or credit with or without security to, suc h business out of the trust or estate property; (iv) elect or employ as directors, officers, employees, or agents of such business, and compensate, any persons, including the fiduciary or a director, officer, or agent of the fiduciary; (v) accept as corr ect financial or other statements rendered by the business from time to time as to its conditions and operations except when having actual notice to the contrary; (vi) regard the business as an entity separate from the trust or estate with no duty to acc ount to any court as to its operations; (vii) deal with and act for the business in any capacity, including any banking or trust capacity and the loaning of money out of the fiduciarys own funds, and to be compensated therefor; and (viii) sell or liq uidate such interest or any part thereof at any time. If any business shall be unincorporated, contractual and tort liabilities arising out of such business shall be satisfied, first, out of the business, and second, out of the trust or estate; but in no event shall there be a liability of the fiduciary, and if the fiduciary is held liable, the fiduciary is entitled to indemnification from, first, the business, and second, the trust or estate. The fiduciary is entitled to such additional compensation as is commensurate with the time, effort, and responsibility involved in his performance of services with respect to such business. Such compensation for services rendered to the business may be paid by the fiduciary from the business or from other assets or from both as the fiduciary, in his discretion, determines to be advisable; however, the amount of such additional compensation is subject to the final approval of the court. 15. To do all other acts and things not inconsistent with the provisions of the will or trust in which these powers are incorporated that the fiduciary deems necessary or desirable for the proper management of the trusts herein created, in the same manner and to the same extent as an individual could do with respect to his o...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-106"><akn:num>§ 64.2-106</akn:num><akn:heading>Grant of certain powers to personal representative or trustee by circuit court</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Upon the mo tion of a personal representative or trustee, a circuit court may grant to the personal representative or trustee all or a part of the powers that may be incorporated by reference pursuant to § 64.2-105. If there is more than one personal representati ve or trustee, the court may specify as to whether the consent of all personal representatives or trustees or a majority thereof shall be required to act, and in absence of such specification, the consent of all such personal representatives or trustees to act shall be required. B. Such motion shall be filed in the circuit court in which the personal representative or trustee qualified, or if there was no qualification, the circuit court for the jurisdiction in which the grantor resides or resided at the time of his death, a trustee resides, or a corporate trustee has an office. Such motion may be ex parte; however, the court, in its discretion, may require such notice to and the convening of interested parties as it may deem proper in each case. Notwithstanding the granting of or the failur e to grant such powers, the court shall have continuing jurisdiction to confer powers in addition to those previously granted or to revoke any or all such powers previously granted by the court. Such additional grant or revocation may also be ex parte. C. The court m ay, in granting or withholding such powers, consider (i) whether the personal representative or trustee was nominated by the decedent, the grantor, or the beneficiaries; (ii) the number and capacity of the beneficiaries and their ability or inability to consent to the acts of the personal representative or trustee which are otherwise within the scope of § 64.2-105; (iii) the relationship of the personal representative or trustee to the beneficiaries; (iv) the character of the estate to be administere d, including any real estate which would be within the scope of the powers granted by the provisions of § 64.2-106; and (v) the capacity of the personal representative or trustee to perform under the powers conferred and to answer for any acts for whi ch he might be held accountable under his bond.The court, in its discretion, may attach further conditions to such grant of power in any manner which it shall deem necessary and proper. D. In no case shall a court grant any powers, if the grant of such powers would be contrary to the intention of the testator or grantor as implied from or as expressed in the will or trust instrument, or would otherwise be inconsistent with the disposition made in the will or trust instrument.

Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, 44 Va. App. 51, 602 S.E.2d 426, 2004 Va. App. LEXIS 454 (2004) (decided under prior law). Administrator could sell real property belonging to the decedent.  Circuit court erred in its restrictive interpretation of the term estate in subdivision (1)(b) of § 64.1-57 as not including real property owned by the intestate decedent at the time of her death. Although title to the real property vested immediately in her heirs, it was still part of the estate and could be sold by the administrator if he was granted the power pursuant to § 64.1-57.1.In re Bullock , 2003 Va. LEXIS 118 (Va. Apr. 17, 2003) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Administrator could not be granted the power to sell real property th at testatrix did not make part of her estate.  Section 64.1-57 does not allow an administrator to sell real property that is not part of a decedents estate; thus, where a testatrixs will directed the p ayment of her debts, but did not make her real property part of her estate, the real property vested in her devisees upon her death, and, accordingly, the trial court denied the estate administrators petition pursuant to §§ 64.1-57 (1) (b) and 64.1-57.1, to grant the administrator the power to sell the real property to satisfy the debts of the estate.

Construction of next of kin.  A court may loosely describe as next of kin the parties who, in a particular instance, are the ones who take under the statute, but when the actual phrase is employed in an instrument it is to be construed strictly, in its commonly accepted meaning, as nearest in blood. Fletcher v. Washington &amp; Lee Univ., 706 F.2d 475, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 28453 (4th Cir. 1983). Kindred similar to next of kin.   Kindred is not a highly technical term whose primary meaning is determined by reference to the statute of descent and distribution. It is similar to the p hrase next of kin, which is a nontechnical term whose commonly accepted meaning is nearest in blood. Elmore v. Virginia Nat'l Bank, 232 Va. 310, 350 S.E.2d 603, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1275, 1986 Va. LEXIS 258 (1986). Kindred retains its commonly accepted meaning when used in an instrument. Elmore v. Virginia Nat'l Bank, 232 Va. 310, 350 S.E.2d 603, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1275, 1986 Va. LEXIS 258 (1986). Phrase nearest living paternal kindred in a trust agreement referred, to those b lood relatives on her fathers side in the closest degree of kinship to the grantor. Elmore v. Virginia Nat'l Bank, 232 Va. 310, 350 S.E.2d 603, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1275, 1986 Va. LEXIS 258 (1986). The common-law course of descent is entirely repealed and abrogated. Tomlinson v. Dilliar d, 7 Va. (3 Call) 105, 1801 Va. LEXIS 29 (1801); Browne v. Turberville, 6 Va. (2 Call) 390, 1800 Va. LEXIS 35 (1800); Stones v. Keeling, 9 Va. (5 Call) 143, 1804 Va. LEXIS 13 (1804); Owen v. Cogbill, 14 Va.

Core's Adm'r, 16 Va. (2 Munf) 279, 1811 Va. LEXIS 47 (1811); Davis v. Rowe, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 355, 1828 Va. LEXIS 23 (1828); Garland v. Harrison, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 368, 1837 Va. LEXIS 26 (1837); Medley v. Medley, 81 Va. 265, 1886 Va. LEXIS 95 (1886). This section abrogated the whole of the common-law regulating descents. However, this was with regard to statutory descent, intestacy. Fletcher v. Washington &amp; Le e Univ., 706 F.2d 475, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 28453 (4th Cir. 1983). This section did not purport to change the meaning of recognized common-law words, even when they were used in a will. Fletcher v. Washington &amp; Lee Univ., 706 F.2d 475, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 28453 (4th Cir. 1983). Descent in Virginia is fixed by statute. Common-law analogies are not helpful, as that s ystem has been superseded by statute, and with it went primogeniture and all its concepts of feudal tenure. Williams v. Knowles, 178 Va. 84, 16 S.E.2d 316, 1941 Va. LEXIS 146 (1941). Legislature may change course of descents.  The legislature may, from time to time, change the course relating to descents and distributions. McFadden v. McNorton, 193 Va. 455, 69 S.E.2d 445, 1952 Va. LEXIS 154 (1952). Statutes of descent should be construed as a whole and so as to give effect to the obvio us intent of the legislature. Browne v. Turberville, 6 Va. (2 Call) 390, 1800 Va. LEXIS 35 (1800). Statute in force at the time of death of an intestate governs the disposition of his estate. Harrison v. Allen, 7 Va. (3 Call) 289, 1802 Va. LEXIS 27 (1802); Dilliard v. Tomlinson, 15 Va. (1 Munf) 183, 1810 Va. LEXIS 49 (1810); Hauenstein v. Lynham, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 62, 1877 Va. LEXIS 54 (1877), rev'd, 100 U.S. 483, 25 L. Ed. 628, 1879 U.S. LEXIS 1841 (1880). Therefore the statute of descents does not have a retrospective operation. Dickinson v. H olloway, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 422, 1819 Va. LEXIS 42 (1819); Blankenbeker v. Blankenbeker, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 427, 1819 Va. LEXIS 44 (1819). Theory of the statute of descent and distribution is that the estate of the ancestor at his death, subject to the rights of the widow if there be one, passes in coparcenary equally to his children. Corbitt v. Wright, 120 Va. 471, 91 S.E. 612, 1917 Va. LEXIS 132 (1917). New classes in the course of descents cannot be constructed out of the subsequent explanatory provisions (§§ 64.1-2 through 64.1-10) and contrary to the previously established course of descents generally, as prescribed by this section. Moore v. Conner, 20 S.E. 936, 1890 Va. LEXIS 119 (Va. 1890). In every case arising under the statute of descents, reference must first be had to this section to ascertain to which class it belongs. The other divisions (§§ 64.1-2 through 64.1-10) are but explanatory of how the estate shall be partitioned under the proper class when discovered, especially when some of those entitled to take are descendants of deceased members of the class or some of the class are collaterals of the half blood. Moore v. Conner, 20 S.E. 936, 1890 Va. LEXIS 119 (Va. 1890).

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 8A M.J. Executors and Administrators, § 98. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. Origin of statutes regulating succession to property.  See Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919). Upon the death of a parent intestate his personalty passes according to the statute of distributions. Mort v. Jones, 105 Va. 668, 51 S.E. 220, 1905 Va. LEXIS 60 (1905). Payment of debts.  This section in effect declares that there shall be no distribution of the personal estate of an intestate until after the costs of administration, funeral expens es and debts of the decedent have been paid. Hall v. Stewart, 135 Va. 384, 116 S.E. 469, 1923 Va. LEXIS 21 (1923) (see also Scott v. Ashlin, 86 Va. 581, 10 S.E. 751 (1890); Alexander v. Byrd, 85 Va. 690, 8 S.E. 577 (1889)). Under the statute law of Virginia the personal estate (as is also the real estate), of a decedent, is expressly made assets for the payment of his debts. Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919). Judgment for alimony constitutes a debt within the meaning of this section. Whether such a judgment is a debt for which the debtor cannot be imprisoned, or a debt from which he may not be discharged in bankruptcy, or not, it is nevertheless an obligation which must be deducted before the estate of a decedent can be distributed under this se ction. Searles v. Gordon, 156 Va. 289, 157 S.E. 759, 1931 Va. LEXIS 192 (1931). Alleged debt deemed a legacy in disguise, and therefore not sufficient to bar the widow of her right to one third of the personal property so given. Ruth v. Owens, 23 Va. (2 Rand.) 507, 1824 Va. LEXIS 32 (1824). Surplus as certained only after funeral expenses paid.  When the estate is entirely personal, its surplus passes to distributees, but that surplus cannot be ascertained until funeral expenses have been met. Edwards v. Cuthbert, 184 Va. 502, 36 S.E.2d 1, 1945 Va. LEXIS 169 (1945). Right to bar spouses share.  A conveyance by a husband, by which he parts absolutely with an interest in personal property, though it is not to take effect until his death, and though he reta ins the power to sell and reinvest or account, and also the power to reappoint among specified objects, is valid to bar the wife of her distributable share therein. Gentry v. Bailey, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 594, 1850 Va. LEXIS 9 (1850). A wife has not such an interest in that portion of the personal estate of her husband, to which she may be entitled in the event of his dying intestate, or leavin g a will which she may renounce, as that an absolute and irrevocable, though merely voluntary, deed thereof, executed by him to his children by a former marriage, can be considered a fraud on her rights, or be set aside at her instance. Lightfoot's Ex'rs v. Colgin, 19 Va. (5 Munf) 42, 1816 Va. LEXIS 13 (1816). The right given by the statutes to a widow to share in the surplus of her deceased husbands personal estate cannot be defeated by a device whereby he retains up until the time of his death full ownership and enjoyment of his personal property, and merely executes and transfers to a trustee his bare promise under seal, unsupported by an actual consideration, to pay to the trustee after his (the husbands) d eath, for the benefit of designated beneficiaries, a sum of money equivalent to the corpus of his personal estate, or the major portion thereof. Norris v. Barbour, 188 Va. 723, 51 S.E.2d 334, 1949 Va. LEXIS 243 (1949). Where prior to death a husband who was majority stockholder in a family corporation created an irrevocable trust of his stock with the corporation as trustee, res erving in himself the right to vote the stock and providing for himself as life beneficiary of the trust and that on his death the stock would become treasury stock of the corporation, the trust so created was valid, and it was immaterial that the husban ds purpose may have been to prevent his wife from obtaining any of the stock on his death. Freed v. Judith Realty &amp; Farm Prods. Corp., 201 Va. 791, 113 S.E.2d 850, 1960 Va. LEXIS 161 (1960). A man cannot disinherit his heirs or next of kin, in any other way than by giving his estate to someone else. Boisseau v. Aldridges, 32 Va. (5 Leigh) 222, 1834 Va. LEXIS 34 (1834). Will discovered after distribution.  It is the duty of an administrator to distribute the personal estate after the payment of debts. It is also his right. If he acts with reasonable diligence to asc ertain whether a will exists, and when acting with reasonable prudence in that regard, does not think and has no reasonable ground to think that a will exists, he may safely distribute the estate, so far as persons taking under a then unknown and unrecor ded will are concerned, whether it be within the year (now six months) of, or after the expiration of the year (now six months) from the qualifications, mentioned in § 64.1-177. Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919). Rights of action.  It seems, that the executor or administrator of a husband who had survived his wife, but had never taken administration on her estate, may sue the guardian of the wife for her estate committed to him. Templeman v. Fauntleroy, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 434, 1825 Va. LEXIS 27 (1825). Distributees of a decedent may maintain a bill in equity to assert their rights in the decedents estate. In such suit the personal representative of the deced ent and the other distributees are necessary parties. Richardson's Ex'r v. Hunt, 16 Va. (2 Munf) 148, 1811 Va. LEXIS 20 (1811); Frazier v. Frazier's Ex'rs, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 642, 1831 Va. LEXIS 25 (1831); Samuel v. Marshall, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 567, 1832 Va. LEXIS 10 (1832); Moore's Adm'r v. George's Adm'r, 37 Va. (10 Leigh) 228, 1839 Va. LEXIS 31 (1839); Sillings v. Bumgardner, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 273, 1852 Va. LEXIS 29 (1852); Robertson v. Gillenwaters, 85 Va. 116, 7 S.E. 371, 1888 Va. LEXIS 17 (1888). Since the statute of distributions the executor is not, in any case, entitled to the residuum of his testators personal estate not actually bequeathed away by the will. Shelton v. Shelton, 1 Va. (1 Wash.) 53, 1 Wash. 53, 1791 Va. LEXIS 25 (1791); Hendren v. Colgin, 18 Va. (4 Munf) 231, 1814 Va. LEXIS 32 (1814); Paup's Adm'r v. M ingo, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 163, 1833 Va. LEXIS 7 (1833). Section defi nes statutory share of renouncing widow.  The statutory share of a widow who renounces the provisions made for her in her husbands will is defined in this section and § 64.1-16. Alexandria Nat'l Ba nk v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). Renouncing widow is entitled to one third of the income earned on all the assets of the estate during the period of administration which is not used to pay funeral expenses, costs of administration and debts. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). A surviving spouse who has elected to take against the will of the deceased spouse is entitled to her statutory share of the income earned on all the personal ass ets of decedents estate during the period of administration. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). This section must be read along with § 64.1-161. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). Surviving spouse allowed federal estate tax marital deduction.  See Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). Thus, charges of administration and debts do not include federal estate taxes.  It is evident that the phrase charges of administration and debts found in this section was not intended to include the payment of the federal estate taxe s before determining a surviving spouses statutory share. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). Hay.  Sixteen hundred bales of hay left on the decedents land at the time of her death were assets of the intestate estate. The hay was tangible personal property, and because it was unnamed in the will, it passed under the laws of descent and distribution to the decedents two sons and four daughters. Teed v.

Effect of former provisions.  While the common law wholly excluded collaterals of the half blood from the inheritance, this section calls them along with those of the whole blood but gives the m half portions only. Davis v. Rowe, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 355, 1828 Va. LEXIS 23 (1828); Moore v. Conner, 20 S.E. 936, 1890 Va. LEXIS 119 (Va. 1890). Meaning of per capita.  Whenever persons are entitled to participation per capita they take by persons and share equally in the estate. Davis v. Rowe, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 355, 1828 Va. LEXI S 23 (1828); Ball v. Ball, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 325, 1876 Va. LEXIS 27 (1876); Dickinson v. Hoomes, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 302, 1844 Va. LEXIS 38 (1844); Moore v. Conner, 20 S.E. 936, 1890 Va.

Meaning of per stirpes.  Whenever persons entitled to participation take per stirpes, or by stocks, they take the share which their deceased ancestor if living would have taken. Taliaferr o v. Burwell, 8 Va. (4 Call) 321, 1803 Va. LEXIS 30 (1803); Davis v. Rowe, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 355, 1828 Va. LEXIS 23 (1828); Dickinson v. Hoomes, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 302, 1844 Va. LEXIS 38 (1844); Ball v.

This section does not supersede the fifth paragraph of § 64.1-1 but supplements it. W henever, in tracing descent, designated conditions prevail, an estate must be divided into moieties, and to each of these moieties then attaches the provisions of this section. These conditions attach to each moiety as a separate entity but not to the es tate theretofore divided as a single unit, although this may sometimes result in an inequality of inheritance by those who are in fact of the same degree of kinship. Williams v. Knowles, 178 Va. 84, 16 S.E.2d 316, 1941 Va. LEXIS 146 (1941). Nothing in this section favors the construction that it deals with the subject of partition of the inheritance into moieties, which partition is fixed by the prov isions of § 64.1-1. This section refers to and deals with the shares in the subject inherited of the various persons succeeding thereto, with relation to one another, whether the subject inherited be the whole or a moiety of the estate. Williams v. Kn owles, 178 Va. 84, 16 S.E.2d 316, 1941 Va. LEXIS 146 (1941). Effect of deaths within class.  When the class in the course of inheritance which is entitled to the intestates estate has been determined, no number of deaths in it, short of its total exti nction, will affect the interest of any survivor of that class. Moore v. Conner, 20 S.E. 936, 1890 Va. LEXIS 119 (Va. 1890). Determination of distribution.  Half-uncle took one-half of the decedents estate because the half-uncle, who was the only member of the class to which the decedents paternal side moiety passed under § 64.2-200, took the entirety of the decedents paternal side moiety, and the paternal side moiety was one-half of the decedents entire estate. Sheppard v. Junes, 287 Va. 397, 756 S.E.2d 409, 2014 Va. LEXIS 56 (2014). Section held inapplicable.  Statute did not affect distribution of the decedents paternal side moiety because the decedents paternal side moiety passed to a class comprised of only o ne heir; even though the half-uncle was a half-blood collateral heir, no whole-blood collateral heir existed as part of that class to which the decedents paternal side moiety passed; and, without such a whole-blood collateral, no whole-blood inherita nce existed to provide a statutory basis for applying the statute to reduce the decedents inheritance.

Presumption. D. Completed Transfer. E. Change of Gift to Advancement. III. Intestacy. IV. To What Property Applicable. V. Accounting. I.General Consideration. Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. The intent of this section is to bring about, as nearly as may be, an equal division of the estate of a decedent among his children or other descendants, except so far as he may have himself distributed his estate unequally. Payne v. Payne, 128 Va. 33, 104 S.E. 712, 1920 Va. LEXIS 91 (1920); Rowe v. Rowe, 144 Va. 816, 130 S.E. 771, 1925 Va. LEXIS 235 (1925). Essential elements.  This section is operative if the decedent dies intestate as to part of his property and one or more of his descendants, who have received gifts by way of advancem ent, also claim the right to participate in the distribution of the property which has not been disposed of, either in the lifetime of the decedent or by his will. Payne v. Payne, 128 Va. 33, 104 S.E. 712, 1920 Va. LEXIS 91 (1920) (see also Puryear v. Ca bell, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 260 (1874); Biedler v. Biedler, 87 Va. 300, 12 S.E. 753 (1891)). The Virginia doctrine of hotchpot, found in this section, prevails notwithstanding an agreement or covenant may have been entered into by a descendant with his ancestor at the time of the advancement, that he, by the acceptance of the advancement, relinquishes all interest in or claim to any portion of the estate then owned or which m ight be thereafter acquired by the ancestor and as to which he may die intestate. Ratliff v. Meade, 184 Va. 328, 35 S.E.2d 114, 1945 Va. LEXIS 153 (1945). II.What Constitutes An Adv ancement. A.In General. Definition.  In its strictest technical sense an advancement is a perfect and irrevocable gift, not required by law, made by a parent during his lifetime to his child, with th e intention on the part of the donor that such gift shall represent a part or the whole of the portion of the donors estate that the donee would be entitled to on the death of the donor intestate. Hill v. Stark, 122 Va. 280, 94 S.E. 792, 1918 Va. LEX IS 95 (1918) (see also Chinn v. Murray, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 348 (1848); Nicholas v. Nicholas, 100 Va. 660, 42 S.E. 669 (1902)). Two elements are essential to constitute an advancement, a gift by the parent to the chi ld and the intention by the donor that the gift shall be an advancement. But the latter may be inferred from the former. Nevertheless, a gift, in contradistinction to a transfer for valuable consideration, is indispensable. Hill v. Stark, 122 Va. 280, 94 S.E. 792, 1918 Va. LEXIS 95 (1918). Illustrative cases.  See Gregory v. Winston's Adm'r, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 102, 1873 Va. LEXIS 26 (1873); Watkins v. Young, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 84, 1878 Va. LEXIS 29 (1878); Biedler v. Bi edler, 87 Va. 300, 12 S.E. 753, 1891 Va. LEXIS 70 (1891); Poff v. Poff, 128 Va. 62, 104 S.E. 719, 1920 Va. LEXIS 93 (1920). B.Intention. The intention of the testator determines the question as to whether or not the gift is an advancement. And the difficulties of solving the question are generally found in the kind of evidence by which such intention is to be proved. Watkins v. Young, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 84, 1878 Va. LEXIS 29 (1878); Payne v. Payne, 128 Va. 33, 104 S.E. 71 2, 1920 Va. LEXIS 91 (1920). If, from all the circumstances surrounding a particular case, it can be said that a parent intended a transfer of property to a child to represent a portion of th e childs supposed share in the parents estate, such transfer will be treated in law as an advancement. The converse is, as a matter of course, true; hence, where it appears that the ancestor intended that a gift to his child should not be treated as an advancement, such intention will be respected and enforced. Payne v. Payne, 128 Va. 33, 104 S.E. 712, 1920 Va. LEXIS 91 (1920). The statements of the grantor at the time, or subsequently, are competent evidence to sh ow what was his intention. Watkins v. Young, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 84, 1878 Va. LEXIS 29 (1878); McDearman v. Hodnett, 83 Va. 281, 2 S.E. 643, 1887 Va. LEXIS 64 (1887). C.Presumption. The presumption that a gift of an ancestor to a descendant is a gift by way of advancement is one of law and is based upon the supposed intention or desire of the ancestor that any inequalities in the division of his whole estate among his heirs at law and distributees, according to the statute of descents and distributions, occasioned by gifts made by way of advancement, shall be corrected as far as practicable in the subsequent division of that portion of the donors estate of which he dies intestate. Poff v. Poff, 128 Va. 62, 104 S.E. 719, 1920 Va. LEXIS 93 (1920). A gift from a parent to a child, supposing the gift to be adapted to advance the child in life, would seem to create a prima facie presumption that the gift is intended as an advancement. This presumption must be rebutted by affirmative proof that the gift was not intended to be a gift by way of advancement. Watkins v. Young, 72 Va. ( 31 Gratt.) 84, 1878 Va. LEXIS 29 (1878); Poff v. Poff, 128 Va. 62, 104 S.E. 719, 1920 Va. LEXIS 93 (1920) (see also Rowe v. Rowe, 144 Va. 816, 130 S.E. 771 (1925)). And so, such a gift to a son-in-law is prima facie an advancement to the daughter. McDear man v. Hodnett, 83 Va. 281, 2 S.E. 643, 1887 Va. LEXIS 64 (1887). D.Completed Transfer. There is embraced in every definition of advancement the idea that the parent has irrevocably parted from his title in the subject advanced. Williams v. Stonestreet, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 559, 1825 Va. LEXIS 48 (1825); Christian v. Coleman's Adm'r, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 30, 1831 Va. LEXIS 32 (1831); Kean v. Welch, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 403, 1845 Va. LEXIS 8 (1845); Darne v. Lloyd, 82 Va. 859, 5 S.E. 87, 1887 Va. LEXIS 155 (1887). E.Change of Gift to Advancement. A donor may change a gift or debt to an advancement. Darne v. Lloyd, 82 Va. 859, 5 S.E. 8 7, 1887 Va. LEXIS 155 (1887). III.Intestacy. Partial intestacy only nec essary.  Under the Virginia statute the doctrine of hotchpot has been greatly enlarged. At the common law, it only applied when the decedent died wholly intestate, while u nder this section it is only necessary that there be a partial intestacy. Payne v. Payne, 128 Va. 33, 104 S.E. 712, 1920 Va. LEXIS 91 (1920). The statute does not assume to interfere with the freedom of the ancestor to prefer one or more of his descendants in the distribution of his estate, but applies only where, having distributed a part of his estate to them, he has left part of it undisposed of, to be distributed under the statute of descents and distributions. Payne v. Payne, 128 Va. 33, 104 S.E. 712, 1920 Va. LEXIS 91 (1920). Advancements, properly speaking, are gifts by anticipation from a parent to a child. Total intestacy was formerly necessary, but partial intestacy is now sufficie nt. Garrett v. Andis, 159 Va. 150, 165 S.E. 657, 1932 Va. LEXIS 180 (1932). IV.To What Property Applicable. Neither rents nor profits of land, given as an advancement, ought to be brought into hotchpot. But where a father shall permit a child to rent out his land and to receive the rents thereof for his or her use, such rents shall be brought into hotchpot as an advancement of personal estate. Williams v. Stonestreet, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 559, 1825 Va. LEXIS 48 (1825). Children who held land as tenants at will of mother, the life tenant, were not bound to account for rents and profits, as an advancement, in the settlement of the mothers estate. Christian v. Coleman's Adm'r, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 30, 1831 Va. LEXIS 32 (1831). Interest or increase not affected.  Where a child receives an advancement he need not bring into hotchpot the interest or increase. For as he must sustain the loss by accounting for the value of the property when given, and by caring for the property, so he is entitled to the increase. Chinn v. Murray, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 348, 1848 Va. LEXIS 10 (1848). Construed with § 55-2.  In considering what advancements are to be brought into hotchpot under the provisions of this section regard must also be had to § 55-2 forbidding parol gifts of land. Nicholas v. Nicholas, 100 Va. 660, 42 S.E. 669, 1902 Va. LEXIS 72 (1902). V.Accounting. The descendant who has received an advancement is not required to submit to a redivision of the property by giving up what he has already received, but is only subjected to the alternative of so surrendering what he has received, or of being excluded from any participation in the residue of the decedents estate which has not been dispo sed of. Payne v. Payne, 128 Va. 33, 104 S.E. 712, 1920 Va. LEXIS 91 (1920); Poff v. Poff, 128 Va. 62, 104 S.E. 719, 1920 Va. LEXIS 93 (1920). When advancement real estate.  The election by a child not to bring an advancement of real property into hotchpot does not debar him from participating in the division of his fathers person al estate where such advancement does not exceed his share of the real estate. McCoy v. McCoy, 105 Va. 829, 54 S.E. 995, 1906 Va. LEXIS 91 (1906). How value of advancement computed.  The general rule is that advanceme...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-300"><akn:num>§ 64.2-300</akn:num><akn:heading>Applicability; definitions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Virginia Forms (Matthew Bender). No. 15-447 Claim for Elective Share of Augmented Estate. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. Rights subordinate to pa yment of estate debts.  This section plainly expresses the intent that rights be subordinate to payment of estate debts. The debtors interest, regardless of when it vests, is in the value of the augmented estate. Murray v. Mares, 147 Bankr. 688, 1992 Bankr. LEXIS 1839 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1992). Separate interest.  Trial court did not err in finding that the late wifes separate property, as identified in the premarital agreement she entered into with the husband, was not to be included in his elective share upon her death, as the plain language of the premarital agreement compelled that result; the husbands claim that the property had to be maintained or repaired in order to keep it separate had to be rejected, as t he language of this section referred to keeping a legal interest in the property separate, which the late wife did. Dowling v. Rowan, 270 Va. 510, 621 S.E.2d 397, 2005 Va. LEXIS 97 (2005). Burden of proof.  Trial court did not err by placing the burden of proving that investment accounts and land which a spouse owned when she died should be excluded from her augmente d estate, pursuant to § 64.1-16.1, or by finding that the deceased spouses estate did not meet its burden of proof. Chappell v. Perkins, 266 Va. 413, 587 S.E.2d 584, 2003 Va. LEXIS 102 (2003). A petition to establish the amount of an elective share may be filed by the surviving spouse, the decedents personal representative, or any party in interest. Regardless of who files the petition invoking judicial intervention, the party seeking inclusion of property under subsection A of § 64.1-16.1 has the burden of proof under that subsection and the party seeking exclusion of property under subsection B of § 64.1-16.1 carries the burden of establishing such exclusion. Chappell v. Perkins, 266 Va. 413, 587 S.E.2d 584, 2003 Va. LEXIS 102 (2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. No waiver of right to claim elec tive share.  Decedents husband was awarded his elective share of the decedents estate, plus his spousal allowances, because the absence of a written premarital or mari tal agreement, in which the husband waived his right to claim his elective share of the decedents augmented estate, was fatal to the estates argument that the husbands claims for his elective share and for the family allowance be denied due t o concerns of fairness to the decedents son, daughter, and grandson. Higham v. Williams, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 27 (Fairfax County Mar. 28, 2008). Group life insurance policy included within estate property.  The terms estate and property include, within their given definitions, group life insurance policies. Felix-Aranibar v. Felix, 59 Va. Cir. 357, 20 02 Va. Cir. LEXIS 231 (Arlington County Aug. 12, 2002). Pre-marriage transfers.  Because § 64.1-16.1 did not include any pre-marriage transfers in a decedents augmented estate, the surviving spouse was not entitled to an elective share distribution § 64.1-16.2 in property that the decedent had transferred to a trust before their marriage. Estate of Shoemaker-Liebel, 70 Va. Cir. 361, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Fairfax County Apr. 11, 2006). Transferred property included in augmented estate because spouses co nsent to transfer was not in writing.  Where a decedent had transferred real estate to her daughter, under § 64.1-16.1, the value of this property had to be included in the augmented estate because the decedent reserved a life estate in the property and it was gratuitously transferred less than five years before her death. That her husband did not object to the transfer was immaterial; as he did not consent to the transfer in writing, the property could not be excluded under § 64.1-16.1.Reed v. Reed, 71 Va. Cir. 78, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 119 (Rockingham County May 25, 2006). Widow raised fact issue as to whether decedents real property was maintained as his separate property.  Summary judgment was denied on the issue of whether real property which was willed to the decedent and was titled in the decedents name only was part of the d ecedents augmented estate; the widow was entitled to the opportunity to prove that at least part of the value of the real estate was attributable to the personal efforts of either party during the marriage or to contributions of marital property as d escribed in subdivision A 1 of § 20-107.3.Kibler v. Kibler, 60 Va. Cir. 266, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 265 (Shenandoah County Oct. 24, 2002). Titling of real estate is not conclusive as to whether the property is maintained as separate property.  Titling of real estate in an individual name is only one consideration in determining whether the property has been maintained as separate property under clause ( ii) of subsection B of § 64.1-16.1.Kibler v. Kibler, 60 Va. Cir. 266, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 265 (Shenandoah County Oct. 24, 2002). Decedents separate property transmuted into marital property by spouses contributions.  Value of a house a decedent had gratuitously transferred was part of the augmented estate. Though it was her separate property when she married, as her husband s wages were used to make improvements and repairs to the house, it was transmuted into marital property, thereby rendering the separate property limitation of § 64.1-16.1 inapplicable. Reed v. Reed, 71 Va. Cir. 78, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 119 (Rockin gham County May 25, 2006). Fair market value of fractiona l interests.  Although the trial court denied the motion to reconsider most parts of its ruling that identified the owners of property due to the death of the decedent, that se t the amount of the augmented estate, that determined the amount of the surviving spouses elective share, and that calculated the amount of the respective contributions from those responsible for satisfying the elective share, it granted that motion regarding its failure to evaluate the evidence of additional charges and expenses, and because it did not address the impact that such evidence had on the fair market value of the fractional interests in the property designated on the statements setting forth the required contributions. Estate of Smith, 69 Va. Cir. 259, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 156 (Madison County Nov. 4, 2005). Decedents husband was awarded his elective share of the decedents estate, plus his spousal allowances, because the value of bank accounts in the decedent s name, which were payable on her death to her son or her grandson, were included in the decedents augmented estate; the full value of accounts the decedent owned as joint tenants with rights of survivorship with her son, daughter, and grandson w ere also included in the augmented estate because the son, daughter and grandson had no practical access to the accounts when they remained the decedents assets solely controlled by her. Higham v. Williams, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 27 (Fairfax County Mar. 28, 2008). Property included in augmented estat e.  Decedents husband was awarded his elective share of the decedents estate, plus his spousal allowances, because the entire value of properties the decedent owned with her son and daughter as joint tenants were included in her augmented estate; the estate failed to meet its burden of proving the value of the sons interest in the property he owned with the decedent, and the daughter paid no part of the c ons...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-301"><akn:num>§ 64.2-301</akn:num><akn:heading>Dower or curtesy abolished</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The interests of dower and curtesy are abolished.

The annotations below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior provisions. Some of the cases were decided prior to the abolition of dower and curtesy. Section defines the right of a surviving spouse in the decedents real property as a dower or curtesy interest and fixes the scope of that interest. Carter v. King, 233 Va. 60, 353 S.E.2d 738, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1905, 1987 Va. LEXIS 170 (1987). The 1977 amendment did not convert right to dower or curtesy into right of inheritance.  The General Assembly did not intend the 1977 amendment to this section to convert the right to dower or curtesy, a marital right, into a right of inheritance. Car ter v. King, 233 Va. 60, 353 S.E.2d 738, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1905, 1987 Va. LEXIS 170 (1987). Although the 1977 amendment to former § 64.1-19 redefined the dimensions of the dower or curtesy interest, it did not change its character. Carter v. King, 233 Va. 60, 353 S.E.2d 738, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1905, 1987 Va. LEXIS 170 (1987). Former § 64.1-19 did not apply where the widow accepts jointure provided for her by a will or a deed. Newton v. Newton, 199 Va. 785, 102 S.E.2d 312, 1958 Va. LEXIS 126 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L. Rev. 1393 (1958)). Necessary character of spouses estate of inheritance.  Where a woman marries a man lawfully seized at any time during the coverture of an estate of inheritance, while it is not necessary, in order that the wife may ta ke dower, that there should be any issue of the marriage, it is essential that the husbands inheritance be of such character that it may descend upon the issue of the marriage, should there be any, as heirs of the husband. Snidow v. Snidow, 192 Va. 6 0, 63 S.E.2d 620, 1951 Va. LEXIS 154 (1951). Seisin of sp ouse must be beneficial.  A legal title in the husband is nothing as regards the wifes right of dower, unless accompanied by the beneficial ownership; and the beneficial ownership is e verything, though separated from the legal title. Wilson v. Davisson, 41 Va. (2 Rob.) 384, 1843 Va. LEXIS 40 (1843); James v. Upton, 96 Va. 296, 31 S.E. 255, 1898 Va. LEXIS 91 (1898). And either act ual or constructive.  Without seisin in the husband during the coverture, either actual or constructive, that is to say, without seisin in law or seisin in fact in the husband, there c an be no right to dower in the wife. Grant v. Sutton, 22 S.E. 490 (Va. 1895). Ascertainment of estate in which deceased spouse had seisin does not necessarily determine dower interest of surviving spouse. A prior encumbrance will reduce the amount of dower. Devers v. Chateau Corp., 792 F.2d 1278, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 26249 (4th Cir. 1986). Dower or curtesy where spouse had defeasible fee.  Where a wife was seized of a defeasible fee in real estate devised to her, it was an estate of inheritance and her husband was entitled to curtesy, his right not having been lawfully barred or relinquished. Newsome v. Scott, 200 Va. 833, 108 S.E.2d 369, 1959 Va. LEXIS 175 (1959). Where a wife conveyed to her husband real property in which she had a defeasible fee, her husbands curtesy interest in that parcel of real estate was not exti nguished by merger into the defeasible fee since it was not until her death, when the defeasible fee was obliterated, that he acquired an estate by the curtesy. The two estates never met or united in him at one and the same time. Newsome v. Scott, 200 Va . 833, 108 S.E.2d 369, 1959 Va. LEXIS 175 (1959). Where a devise of land was defeasible by the death of the devisee without lawful issue o f his body, and the devisee so died, his widow was held entitled to dower in the land. Snidow v. Snidow, 192 Va. 60, 63 S.E.2d 620, 1951 Va. LEXIS 154 (1951). Right of entry in fa vor of widow.  Dower is an interest in land for which a right of entry exists in favor of a widow under Virginia law. Devers v. Chateau Corp., 748 F.2d 902, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 16567 (4th Cir. 1984). Wife entitled to dower in rent and reversion when husban d conveyed property without her knowledge or consent.  Where husband, at the time he married wife, owned a piece of real estate subject to a 99-year lease for a rent of $5,000 per month and a reversionary interest in the land and the apartment building on it, and he subsequently conveyed the property to the lessees and cancelled the lease without his wifes knowledge or consent, wife was entitled to dower in one-third of the rents and the reversion. Devers v. Chat eau Corp., 792 F.2d 1278, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 26249 (4th Cir. 1986). Dower prior to assignment.  Until the widows dower has been assigned to her, her dower right is merely a right to sue for and compel the setting aside to her of her dower interest, and i s not an estate in itself. First Nat'l Exch. Bank v. United States, 335 F.2d 91, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 4625 (4th Cir. 1964). Specific performance of a written contract to sell real estate owned in fee by a wife whose husband refuses to release his inchoate curtesy interest should not be decreed unless the purchaser is willing to accept a deed without the relinquishment of such curtesy interest, and asks no abatement in the purchase price set forth in the cont ract. God v. Hurt, 218 Va. 909, 241 S.E.2d 800, 1978 Va. LEXIS 245 (1978). The heirs could not compel a widow to pay the debts of the estate in order to preserve f or herself the life interest allowed as dower under the former law, and, incidentally, to preserve for the heirs the reversionary interest in the property which might be subjected by the creditors. The election was one for the widow and not for the heirs . She could elect to pay the debts and enjoy the income from the property, but she was not bound to do so to protect her interest, nor could the heirs compel her to do so to protect their interest. Morrison v. Morrison, 177 Va. 417, 14 S.E.2d 322, 1941 V a. LEXIS 228 (1941). Widow can exercise her dower rights either at law or in equity. The fact that an equitab le remedy exists in addition to a legal remedy does not mean that the statute of limitations for entry to land does not apply. Devers v. Chateau Corp., 748 F.2d 902, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 16567 (4th Cir. 1984). Statute of limitations.  The 15-year statute of limitations (§ 8.01-236) applies to an action to insure the dower rights of a widow. Devers v. Chateau Corp., 748 F.2d 902, 1984 U.S. Ap p. LEXIS 16567 (4th Cir. 1984). II.Synonymous Terms. Husband can acquire sole and separate equitable estate.  Former § 64.1-19.1 was ambiguous and incomplete as to the treatment to be given words that may be associated with dower and curtesy in statutes . But when this section and former § 64.1-21 were read together, it was manifest and a husband could acquire a sole and separate equitable estate in realty in Virginia. Jacobs v. Meade, 227 Va. 284, 315 S.E.2d 383, 1984 Va. LEXIS 244 (1984). No right to dower in equitable separate estate where excluded by instrumen t creating it.  Former § 64.1-21 when construed with former § 64.1-19.1 provided that a surviving wife should not be entitled to dower in the equitable separate estate of t he deceased husband if such right thereto had been expressly excluded by the instrument creating the same, or if such instrument described the estate as his sole and separate equitable estate. Jacobs v. Meade, 227 Va. 284, 315 S.E.2d 383, 1984 Va. LEXIS 244 (1984). III.Desertion. Justifiable desertion.  Where the wife left the husband because of frequent and continued drunken sprees during which he was quarrelsome, disorderly and dangerous, and inflicted great cr uelty upon her, she did not of her own free will desert her husband, refusing to return to him without just cause, and former § 64.1-23 was not applicable. Harman v. Harman, 139 Va. 508, 124 S.E. 273, 1924 Va. LEXIS 127 (1924). The mere facts that the wife leaves the home and that her husband remains there do not make this section applicable. If the leaving of the home by the wife is caused by such conduct on the part of the husband that the husband is guilty of constructive desertion of the wife, certainly where such constructive desertion consists of actual, physical cruelty on the part of the husband, in such a degree as to cause the wife to leave, and justify her in leaving the home to protect herself therefrom, it is not a voluntary leaving. Harman v. Harman, 139 Va. 508, 124 S.E. 273, 1924 Va. LEXIS 127 (1924). Former § 64.1-23 had no application where damages are sought under the death by wrongful act statutes (§§ 8.01-50 through 8.01-56), because the damages recoverable in such an action are no part of the estate of the decedent. Porter v. VEPCO, 183 Va. 108, 31 S.E.2d 337, 1944 Va. LEXIS 135 (1944). IV.Surplus After Lien. Purpose.  Prior to reenactment, was to give the wife in her husbands lif...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-302"><akn:num>§ 64.2-302</akn:num><akn:heading>When and how elective share may be claimed by surviving spouse</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. A surviving spouse may claim an elective share regardless of whether (i) any provision for the surviving spouse is made in the decedents will or (ii) the decedent dies intestate. B. The survivi ng spouse of a decedent who dies domiciled in the Commonwealth may claim an elective share in the decedents augmented estate within six months from the later of (i) the time of the admission of the decedents will to probate or (ii) the qualificat ion of an administrator on the decedents intestate estate. The claim to an elective share shall be made either in person before the court having jurisdiction over administration of the decedents estate, or by a writing recorded in the court or th e clerks office thereof, upon such acknowledgment or proof as would authorize a writing to be admitted to record under Chapter 6 (§ 55.1-600 et seq.) of Title 55.1. C. The right, if any, of the surviving spouse of a decedent who dies domiciled outside of the Commonwealth to take an elective share based upon the value of property in the Commonwealth is governed by the law of the decedents domicile at death.

No. 5-1104 Complaint for an Accounting Following Election Under Augmented Estate, et seq.; No. 6-715 Checklist for Guardian ad li tems Report; No. 15-447 Claim for Elective Share of Augmented Estate, et seq. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. This section and §§ 64.1-14 and 64.1-16 are confined to personal property. Blunt v. Gee, 9 Va. (5 Call) 481, 1805 Va. LEXIS 17 (1805); Ambler v. Norton, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 23, 1809 Va. LEXIS 27 (1809); Wiseley v. Findlay, 24 Va. (3 Rand.) 361, 1825 Va. LEXIS 22 (1825). These sections were enacted on the theory that it was the natural inclination of a survi ving consort to accept and follow the wishes of the deceased consort as expressed in a will. Simmons v. Simmons, 177 Va. 629, 15 S.E.2d 43, 1941 Va. LEXIS 248 (1941). Widows right is absolute and certa in.  The widows right to her share of her deceased husbands estate secured to her by the statute allowing renunciation is an absolute, paramount and certain ri ght which her husband may not deny her. First Nat'l Exch. Bank v. Hughson, 194 Va. 736, 74 S.E.2d 797, 1953 Va. LEXIS 142 (1953). The one-year (now six-month) limitation in this section merely restricts the time in which the right may be availed of and does not lessen its certainty. First Na t'l Exch. Bank v. Hughson, 194 Va. 736, 74 S.E.2d 797, 1953 Va. LEXIS 142 (1953). Acknowledgment requirement.  Because a widows original petition for contribution to enforce her right to an elective share was not acknowledged, it failed to comply with the requirements of §§ 64.1-13 and 55-106; because a later filing was not filed within the six-month time period required by § 64.1-13, the trial court properly sustained a sons demurrer. Haley v. Haley, 272 Va. 703, 636 S.E.2d 400, 2006 Va. LEXIS 103 (2006) . Effect of agreement in bar of dower.  By an agreement in contemplation of marriage, the intended husband bound his estate to pay to his intended wife certain sums of money if she survived him, which w ere to be in bar of and in full compensation for her dower. This agreement, although a bar to her claiming dower in her husbands real estate, does not deprive her of her distributive share of his personal estate. Findley's Ex'rs v. Findley, 52 Va. (1 1 Gratt.) 434, 1854 Va. LEXIS 33 (1854). Defeating distributive share during lifetime.  The husband had the power according to the modern common law to alienate by sale or gift in his lifetime the whole or any part of his personal estate and thereby exclude his wife from any interest therein. This power is impliedly recognized by the statutes. Gentry v. Bailey, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 594, 1850 Va. LEXIS 9 (1850). While a husband cannot by will defeat his wifes claim to her distributive share in his personal estate, he may do so by an irrevocable disposition of his prop erty in his lifetime, although he secures a life estate to himself and his purpose is to defeat the claim of his wife as one of his distributees. An irrevocable deed of trust is not to be considered a will in disguise merely because it disposes of nearly all of grantors personal estate and reserves to the grantor the possession and control of the property during his life. Hall v. Hall, 109 Va. 117, 63 S.E. 420, 1909 Va. LEXIS 9 (1909) (see also Lightfoots Exrs v. Colgin, 19 Va. (5 Munf.) 42 (1813); Ruth v. Owens, 23 Va. (2 Rand.) 507 (1824); Gentry v. Bailey, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 594 (1850); Freed v. Judith Realty &amp; Farm Prods. Corp., 201 Va. 791, 113 S.E.2d 850 (1960)). Two circumstances must concur to render the gift testamentary in its nature: one is, tha t it is not to be substantially effective till his death; and the other is, that the husband does not divest himself of the capacity to recall it, and so resume to himself or his estate the ownership granted. Ruth v. Owens, 23 Va. (2 Rand.) 507, 1824 Va. LEXIS 32 (1824). Deed of settle ment and necessity of renouncing will.  A husband made a deed of settlement of property upon his wife, and then by will made a disposition of the property, different from that made by the deed of settle ment, and far less beneficial to the wife, and died. The wife took administration with the will annexed. The widow may claim under the deed of settlement, without having renounced the provision made for her by the will according to the statute. Taylor v. Browne, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 419, 1830 Va. LEXIS 52 (1830). Clear proof of election must be furnished, and ambiguous acts and conduct will in genera l not be so construed unless in those cases where the interests of others have been affected by the acts. Simmons v. Simmons, 177 Va. 629, 15 S.E.2d 43, 1941 Va. LEXIS 248 (1941). Election of widow to take under will may be express or implied from acts and conduct, su ch as acceptance and acquiescence. There are no steps, formal or otherwise, prescribed by this section for an election to accept the testamentary provisions. No action  mere silence  for a year is conclusive. Simmons v. Simmons, 177 Va. 629, 15 S .E.2d 43, 1941 Va. LEXIS 248 (1941). But it must have been with a knowledge of her rights, and with the intention of electing . Election to take under will was revocable where widow did not know what her statutory rights were and also was ignorant to a large extent of the amount of her husbands estate. Simmons v. Simmons, 177 Va. 629, 15 S.E.2d 43, 1941 Va. LEXIS 248 (1941) . Widow must know or have opportunity to ascertain relative values of property.  The legislature intended that, in order for an election to be effective, the party required to elect must know or have full opportunity to ascertain the relative values accruing before making an election. Batleman v. Rubin, 199 Va. 156, 98 S.E.2d 519, 1957 Va. LEXIS 174 (1957) (quoting Simmons v. Simmons, 177 Va. 629, 15 S.E.2d 43 (1941)). Manner of renouncing.  A widow cannot effectually renounce the provision made for her by the will of her husband, so as to entitle herself as distributee, but by declaration made within one year after the husbands death, before the general court, or court having jurisdiction of the probate of the will, or by deed executed in the presence of two or more credible witnesses (now, under § 64.1-13, by acknowledged, or proven, and rec orded writing). Kinnaird Ex'r v. Williams's Adm'r, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 400, 1836 Va. LEXIS 70 (1836). Under the circumstances of the case the widow was within her rights in renouncing the will, and the paper signed, acknowledged and recorded by her, and exhibited with the bill, was sufficient evidence of election and renunciation under this section. Showalter v. Showalter, 107 Va. 713, 60 S.E. 48, 1908 Va. LEXIS 132 (1908). Effect of acceptance.  The testator by his will, gave real and personal estate to his wife, and left part of his personal estate undisposed of. The wife did not renounce, but accepted, the provision made for her by the will. She was excluded, by the statute, from any share of her husbands personal estate undisposed of by his will. Dupree's Adm'r v. Cary, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 36, 1835 Va. LEXIS 11 (1835); Thornton v. Winston, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 152, 1833 Va. LEXIS 6 (1833). When the widow fails to renounce within a year, and thus by her inaction elects to abide by the will and accept the provisions, if any, made for her therein, she is not a mere donee under the instrument. She is considered a purchaser for value of the property willed to her for she has, by taking under the will, given up and released the absolute and paramount right secured her by statute which she could obtain by renunciation. First Nat'l Exch. Bank v. Hughson, 194 Va. 736, 74 S.E.2d 797, 1953 Va. LEXIS 142 (1953).

Such additional period within which to make a claim for an elective share shall not exceed 90 days after a final order has been entered in such suit, eith er by a trial court or any appellate court to which it is appealed.

CASE NOTES Suit to construe will of doubtful import.  A widow brought suit against the executor of the estate of her deceased husband, and the beneficiaries named in his will, praying that the court construe an anten uptial contract made between her and testator, and certain parts of the will, and to declare: (1) whether the antenuptial contract was valid and binding on her; (2) whether the will cancelled or terminated the antenuptial contract; (3) whether $15,000 fo und in testators safe deposit box was an asset of testators estate or the property of two of the respondents; (4) whether she was under any obligation to assume in whole or in part the cost of maintaining the house formerly occupied by her and he r husband. The suit was one to construe a will of doubtful import, and therefore the court had jurisdiction to extend the time within which she could accept or renounce the will. Batleman v.

The surviving spouse is entitled to interest at the legal rate specified in § 6.2-301 from the date of the d ecedents death to the date of satisfaction of the elective share. History History.

The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. Effect of renunciation.  Widows renunciation of will will not disappoint testators will and unsettle his disposition of his property further than may be necessary to enforce her r ights. Mitchells v. Johnsons, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 461, 1835 Va. LEXIS 42 (1835); Morriss v. Garland, 78 Va. 215, 1883 Va. LEXIS 31 (1883). An election to take under the statute forfeits all rights enjoyed and provisions made for the widow or widower in the consorts will. First Nat'l Exch. Bank v. Hughson, 194 Va. 736, 74 S.E.2d 797, 1953 Va. LEXIS 142 (1953). Section defi nes statutory share of renouncing widow.  The statutory share of a widow who renounces the provisions made for her in her husbands will is defined in this section and § 64.1-11. Alexandria Nat'l Ba nk v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). A renouncing widow is entitled to one third of the income earned on all the assets of the estate during the period of administration which is not used to pay funeral expenses, costs of administration and debts. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). A surviving spouse who has elected to take against the will of the deceased spouse is entitled to her statutory share of the income earned on all the personal ass ets of decedents estate during the period of administration. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). Compensation to legatees.  Where the widow renounced the will, the profits of the property, real and personal, given to the wife for life by the will, which accrued during her life, shall b e applied to compensate those of the testators devisees and legatees out of whose devises and legacies the widows dower and distributive share were taken. Mitchells v. Johnsons, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 461, 1835 Va. LEXIS 42 (1835). Where the widow renounced the will, two thirds of the land remaining after the assignment of the widows dower were to be applied to indemnify the legatees of the personal estate for the loss they sustained by the widows renunciation of the provision made for her by the will, and claim of her third of the personal estate. For this purpose the two thirds of the land were to be rented out and the proceeds ap plied to the satisfaction of the legatees. McReynolds v. Counts, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 242, 1852 Va. LEXIS 36 (1852). Husband by his will gave to his wife certain personal estate absolutely and a tract of land for life, but after his death she renounced the will in the mode presc ribed by the statute. She was not entitled to take under the will what was thereby given to her. But the property bequeathed to her was to be applied to compensate the legatees who were disappointed by her taking distributable share of the personal estat e. Findley's Ex'rs v. Findley, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 434, 1854 Va. LEXIS 33 (1854). Widow who does not renounce takes only what will gives her.  When personal property is given to the wife by a will which she does not renounce, she takes only what the will gives her, according to the specific provision of this section, and necessarily the general provision of § 64.1-11, dealing with cases where there is no will or one that does not dispose of all personal property, does not apply. Newton v. Newton, 199 Va. 785, 102 S.E.2d 312, 1958 Va. LEXIS 126 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L. Rev. 1393 (1958)). And is not entitled to share in property as to which husband died intestate.  Where a testator by his will gave to his wife one third of his personal property, and his disposition of the other two thirds was declared void so that as to it h e in effect died intestate, his widow, unless she renounced the will, would take only the one third share that it gave her, and there was no merit to her argument that she was entitled, independently of the will, to the remaining two thirds by virtue of § 64.1-11. Newton v. Newton, 199 Va. 785, 102 S.E.2d 312, 1958 Va. LEXIS 126 (1958) (commented on in 44 Va. L. Rev. 1393 (1958)). Increase in value of estate where renunciation not recognized.  Where executor-beneficiaries refused to recognize the right of the husband to receive his share of his wifes estate at the time of his wifes death or at t he date of his renunciation and the estate increased in value, the executor-beneficiaries should not be permitted to profit by their own recalcitrant attitude. Edwards v. Cuthbert, 184 Va. 502, 36 S.E.2d 1, 1945 Va. LEXIS 169 (1945). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Discount of fractional shares conv eyed.  Where those liable for an elective share did not select the option to pay cash, but conveyed fractional interests in real estate to an heir, the value conveyed of the fractional interests meant ascertaining their fair market value on an individual basis without reference to what impact the transfer of such interest had on those who held title to the property as tenants in common. In re Estate of Smith, 67 Va. Cir . 33, 2005 Va. Cir.

The augment ed estate means the decedents entire estate passing by will or intestate succession, real and personal, after payment of allowances and exemptions under Article 2 (§ 64.2-309 et seq.) of this chapter, funeral expenses, charges of administration th at shall not include federal or state transfer taxes, and debts, and to which is added the following amounts: 1. The v alue of property, other than tangible personal property received by gift and the proceeds thereof, owned or acquired by the surviving spouse at the decedents death, to the extent the property is derived from the decedent by any means other than by wi ll or intestate succession without full consideration in money or moneys worth; 2. The value of property, other than tangible personal property received by gift and the proceeds thereof, derived by the surviving spouse from the decedent without full consideration in money or moneys worth by any means other than by will or intestate succession, and transferred by the surviving spouse at any time during the marriage to a person other than the decedent, which would have been includable in the surviving spouses augmented estate if the surviving spouse had predeceased the decedent; and 3. The value of property transferred to anyone other than a bona fide purchaser by the decedent at any time during the marriage to the surviving spouse, to or for the benefit of any perso n other than the surviving spouse, to the extent that the decedent did not receive full consideration in money or moneys worth for the transfer, if the transfer was any of the following types: a. Any transfer under which the decedent retained for his life, for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death, or for any period which does not in fact end before his death, the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to income from, the property; b. Any transfer to the extent that the decedent retained for his life, for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death, or for any period which does not in fact end b efore his death, the power, either alone or in conjunction with any other person, to revoke or to consume, invade, or dispose of the principal for his own benefit; c. Any transfer whereby property is held at the time of the decedents death by the decedent and another with right of survivorship; or d. Any transfer made to or for the benefit of a donee within the calendar year of the decedents death or any of the five preceding calendar years to the extent that the aggregate value of the transfers to the donee exceeds the amount specified in § 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for that calendar year, without regard to whether the federal gift tax exclusion applies to the transfer. B. Notwithstan ding the provisions of this section, the augmented estate shall not include (i) the value of any property transferred by the decedent during marriage with the written consent or joinder of the surviving spouse; (ii) the value of any property, its income, or proceeds received by the decedent, before or during the marriage to the surviving spouse, by gift, will, intestate succession, or any other method or form of transfer to the extent it was (a) received without full consideration in money or moneys worth from a person other than the surviving spouse, and (b) maintained by the decedent as separate property; (iii) any transfer made to anyone other than the surviving spouse prior to January 1, 1991, to the extent that such transfer was irrevocable on that date; or (iv) the value of any property excluded from the augmented estate pursuant to § 64.2-317. C. Property is valued as of the decedents death, except that property irrevocably transferred during the lifetime of the decedent is valued as of the date the transferee came into possession or enjoyment of the property if such date precedes the date of the decede nts death. 1. Life estates and remainder interests are valued in the manner prescribed in Chapter 5 (§ 55.1-500 et seq.) of Title 55.1, and deferred payments and estates for years are discounted to present value using the interest rate specified in § 55.1-500. 2. The value of an insurance policy that is irrevocably transferred during the lifetime of a decedent is the cost of a comparable policy on the date of the transfer or, if such a policy i s not readily available, the policys interpolated terminal reserve. The value of any premiums paid on an insurance policy owned by another person is only the amount of the premiums paid and not the insurance purchased or maintained with such premiums . 3. An initial interest in property owned as a joint tenant with survivorship is valued at the time the interest is acquired, and a further interest received upon the death of a cotenant i s valued at the time of the cotenants death. Property owned jointly by persons married to each other is rebuttably presumed to have been acquired with contributions of equal value by each tenant. The mere creation of an indebtedness secured by jointl y owned property is not a contribution to its acquisition, but any satisfaction of such an indebtedness is a contribution. An interest in a tenancy by the entireties is valued as if it were an interest in a joint tenancy with survivorship. Joint accounts in financial institutions are valued in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 (§ 6.2-604 et seq.) of Chapter 6 of Title 6.2.

The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. Applicability.  In arguing that her joint tenancy with her mother was owned unequally, a Chapter 7 debtors reliance on § 64.2-305 was misplaced, as that provision confined its applicability to married spouses. Scott v. Hoole (In re Hoole), No. 17-50262, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 810 (Bankr. W.D. Va. Mar. 21, 2018). Rights subordinate to pa yment of estate debts.  This section plainly expresses the intent that rights be subordinate to payment of estate debts. The debtors interest, regardless of when it vests, is in the value of the augmented estate. Murray v. Mares, 147 Bankr. 688, 1992 Bankr. LEXIS 1839 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1992). Indebtedness.  Where both decedent and her husband, as co-makers of a $50,000 note, became personally liable to the holder of the note for the full amount owed and as between th emselves, jointly and severally liable, and because both decedent and her husband became subject to a common burden to be borne equally, each was entitled to the right of contribution from the other for one-half of the joint indebtedness evidenced by the note, the husband should not have been charged with more than one-half of the total indebtedness. Tuttle v. Webb, 284 Va. 319, 731 S.E.2d 909, 2012 Va. LEXIS 162 (2012). Separate interest.  Trial court did not err in finding that the late wifes separate property, as identified in the premarital agreement she entered into with the husband, was not to be included in his elective share upon her death, as the plain language of the premarital agreement compelled that result; the husbands claim that the property had to be maintained or repaired in order to keep it separate had to be rejected, as t he language of this section referred to keeping a legal interest in the property separate, which the late wife did. Dowling v. Rowan, 270 Va. 510, 621 S.E.2d 397, 2005 Va. LEXIS 97 (2005). Burden of proof.  Trial court did not err by placing the burden of proving that investment accounts and land which a spouse owned when she died should be excluded from her augmente d estate, pursuant to § 64.1-16.1, or by finding that the deceased spouses estate did not meet its burden of proof. Chappell v. Perkins, 266 Va. 413, 587 S.E.2d 584, 2003 Va. LEXIS 102 (2003).

In determin ing the elective share, the value of property included in the augmented estate that passes or has passed to the surviving spouse, or that would have passed to the spouse but was disclaimed, is applied first to satisfy the elective share in order to reduc e any contributions due from other recipients of transfers included in the augmented estate. B. The recipie nts of the remaining property of the augmented estate are liable to contribute the balance of the elective share and any interest thereon in proportion to the value of their interests. C. The only pe rsons subject to contribution to make up the elective share are (i) an original transferee from or appointee of the decedent, and any subsequent gratuitous inter vivos donee or person claiming by will or intestate succession, to the extent such person ha s the property or its proceeds on or after the date of the decedents death, and (ii) a fiduciary, as to the property under the fiduciarys control at or after the time a fiduciary receives notice that a surviving spouse has claimed an elective sha re in the decedents estate. A corporate fiduciary shall not be considered to have notice until it receives notice at its address as shown in the decedents estate papers in the clerks office or, if there are no such papers or no address is sho wn therein, at the office of its registered agent.No other party is subject to contribution to make up the elective share even though the party makes a payment or transfers an item of property or other benefit to any person with actual knowledge that a s urviving spouse has claimed an elective share in the decedents estate. D. Upon the pe tition of the surviving spouse, the decedents personal representative, or any party in interest, the court having jurisdiction over the administration of the decedents estate shall determine the amount of the elective share and the ratable portio n of the elective share attributable to each person liable to contribution. Such petition may be brought against fewer than all persons from whom relief could be sought, but no person is subject to contribution in any amount greater than that which he wo uld have been if relief had been secured against all persons subject to contribution. E. Within 30 d ays after the courts determination of the contributions due under subsection D becomes final and not subject to further appeal, any person liable to the surviving spouse for contribution may file with the court a written statement specifying any of t he following methods for satisfying his contribution and interest liability: 1. Conve yance to the surviving spouse of a portion of the property included in the augmented estate equal in value to his liability on the date the contribution statement is filed, or if, on the date of filing, the value of the property included in the augmented estate is less than his liability, conveyance to the surviving spouse of the entire property included in the augmented estate in full satisfaction; 2. Payment of the value of his liability in cash or, upon agreement of the surviving spouse, other property; or 3. Partial conveyance and partial payment under subdivisions 1 and 2, provided that the value conveyed and paid is equal to his liability.In the event a contribution statement is not file d within 30 days, the court shall enter an order specifying the method by which a persons liability to the surviving spouse shall be satisfied.

CASE NOTES Burden of proof.  A petition to establish the amount of an elective share may be filed by the surviving spouse, the decedents personal representative, or any party in interest. Regardless of who files the petition invoking judicial intervention, the party seeking inclusion of property under subsection A of § 64.1-16.1 has the burden of proof under that subsection and the party seeking exclusion of property under subsection B of § 64.1-16.1 carries the burden of establishing such exclusion. Chappell v. Perkins, 266 Va. 413, 587 S.E.2d 584, 2003 Va. LEXIS 102 (2003) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  Some of the cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. Designation of beneficiary.  Where a state employee had designated an ex-wife as beneficiary of any accumulated retirement contributions and because the parties divorce was prior to July 1, 1993, §§ 20-111.1, 64.1-16.2 C, and 64.1-59 did not apply; as a result, the designation in favor of the ex-wife was not revoked when the parties were divorced. Va. Ret. Sys. v. Bonaparte, 61 Va. Cir. 304, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 129 (Richmond Mar. 7 , 2003). Discount of fractional shares conv eyed.  Where those liable for an elective share did not select the option to pay cash, but conveyed fractional interests in real estate to an heir, the value conveyed of the fractional interests meant ascertaining their fair market value on an individual basis without reference to what impact the transfer of such interest had on those who held title to the property as tenants in common. In re Estate of Smith, 67 Va. Cir . 33, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Madison County Feb. 1, 2005). Fair market value of fractiona l interests.  Although the trial court denied the motion to reconsider most parts of its ruling that identified the owners of property due to the death of the decedent, that se t the amount of the augmented estate, that determined the amount of the surviving spouses elective share, and that calculated the amount of the respective contributions from those responsible for satisfying the elective share, it granted that motion regarding its failure to evaluate the evidence of additional charges and expenses, and because it did not address the impact that such evidence had on the fair market value of the fractional interests in the property designated on the statements setting forth the required contributions. Estate of Smith, 69 Va. Cir. 259, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 156 (Madison County Nov. 4, 2005). Proceeds from sa le of property in augmented estate.  Half of the proceeds from the sale of property a husband and a wife jointly owned was included in the wifes augmented estate; because it was not established t hat the deposit of the wifes share into the husbands savings account fell under one of the exceptions in the statute, her share of the proceeds was unaffected by the husbands deposit into his savings account. Grubb v. Yacoub, 88 Va. Cir. 98, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Mar. 18, 2014). Pre-marriage transfers.  Because § 64.1-16.1 did not include any pre-marriage transfers in a decedents augmented estate, the surviving spouse was not entitled to an elective share distribution under § 64.1-16.2 in property that the decedent had transferred to a trust before their marriage. Estate of Shoemaker-Liebel, 70 Va. Cir. 361, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Fairfax County Apr. 11, 2006). Assets in decedents checking account received by spouse by right of survivorship.  Pursuant to § 64.1-16.2, a decedents assets in checking accounts that her husband received by right of survivorship were applied first to satisfy his elect ive share. Reed v. Reed, 71 Va. Cir. 78, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 119 (Rockingham County May 25, 2006). Surviving spouse protected.  Husband was protected because any transfers by the husband, the surviving spouse, did not put him at risk of disinheritance, and the decision to not include trans fers from joint bank accounts in the wifes augmented estate preserved the purpose of the statute. Grubb v. Yacoub, 88 Va. Cir. 98, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Mar. 18, 2014). Joint annuity account.  Transferred total of money into a joint annuity account could be marital property rather than separate and individual contributions because funds from a wifes retirement account and a husbands retirement account were deposited into the wifes savings account, a joint account, before being transferred into the annuity account; it was not established by clear and convincing evidence that a wife and a hus band intended a joint annuity account to be divided unequally. Grubb v. Yacoub, 88 Va. Cir. 98, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Mar. 18, 2014). Money transferred to private accounts marital property.  Money transferred out of a joint account to the husbands private accounts constituted marital property belonging to the husband, not separate property, becaus e there was no evidence rebutting the presumption that the original amount remained segregated.

For related discussion, see 8A M.J. Executors and Administrators, §§ 12.1, 12.2. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. Definition of abandonment.  Mindful of the definition of the term abandonment in domestic relations cases, when resolving whether a spouse seeking an elective share of the augmented estate of a deceased spouse abandoned the deceased spouse, the word abandonment means a termination of the normal indicia of a marital relationship combined with an intent to abandon the marital relationship. Purce v. Patterson, 275 Va. 190, 654 S.E.2d 885, 2008 Va. LEXIS 3 (2008). Willful abandonment.  Spouse seeking an elective share of the augmented estate of a deceased spouse was not entitled to such relief because the spouse willfully abandoned the decedent before and continuing until the decedents death, as, properly considering facts occurring both before and after the spouse and decedent voluntarily separated, the spouses conduct showed a lack of support for the decedent and the marital relations hip, because: (1) while living together or apart, the spouse gave the decedent little or no support or care during the decedents illnesses and recoveries; (2) financially, the decedent managed rental properties the decedent brought into the marriage alone while living with the spouse, who did not contribute to the decedents support in this regard; (3) after the parties separation, the spouse apparently did not communicate with the decedent in any meaningful way since the spouse did not know the decedent lived in another state and did not acknowledge the decedents final illness; (4) the spouse did not support the decedent financially, emotionally, or physically; (5) nothing showed the spouse tried or intended to reconcile with the decede nt; and (6) when the decedent died, the spouse had ceased any marital duties. Purce v. Patterson, 275 Va. 190, 654 S.E.2d 885, 2008 Va. LEXIS 3 (2008). Time period for determining aban donment.  When determining whether a spouse seeking an elective share of the augmented estate of a deceased spouse willfully abandoned the deceased spouse, the relevant tim e period for determining abandonment for purposes of § 64.1-16.3 extends to the time of the deceased spouses death and is not limited to the moment of separation, or the filing of a petition for divorce, as it is when abandonment is the ground upo n which a divorce is sought. Purce v. Patterson, 275 Va. 190, 654 S.E.2d 885, 2008 Va. LEXIS 3 (2008). Clear language of subsection A of § 64.1-16.3 requires a court to determine whether a spouses willful desertion or abandonment of a deceased spouse of whos e estate the living spouse claims a share continued until the death of the spouse, and that determination is not limited to consideration of actions occurring prior to a separation, should one have occurred. Purce v. Patterson, 275 Va. 190, 654 S.E.2d 88 5, 2008 Va. LEXIS 3 (2008). Agreed separation or petition for divorce.  When determining whether a spouse seeking an elective share of the augmented estate of a deceased spouse willfully abandoned the deceased spouse, an agreed separa tion or petition for divorce is relevant evidence of the termination of cohabitation, but is not evidence that defeats a finding of willful abandonment. Purce v. Patterson, 275 Va. 190, 654 S.E.2d 885, 2008 Va. LEXIS 3 (2008). Mixed question of fact and law.  Whether a spouse seeking an elective share of a deceased spouses augmented estate abandoned the deceased spouse is a mixed question of law and fact, so a revi ewing court gives deference to a trial courts findings of fact and views the facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, but the reviewing court reviews the trial courts application of the law to those facts de novo. Purce v. Patte rson, 275 Va. 190, 654 S.E.2d 885, 2008 Va. LEXIS 3 (2008). Abandonment not shown.  Widow was permitted to make the elections for homestead and personal property allowances because she had not abandoned her husband; a separation was for a relativ ely short time, there were telephone conversations about the wife returning, and there were attempts made to visit the husband in a nursing home. The widow rejected a suggestion that she consider a divorce and expressed love for her husband. Phillips v. Good, 94 Va. Cir. 504, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 221 (Shenandoah County Nov. 22, 2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Right to augmented estate.  Where a wife left the marital home after being told by her husband to get out, she did not willfully desert or abandon the husband and did not forfeit her right t o the husbands augmented estate. Royer v. Royer, 65 Va. Cir. 476, 2004 Va. Cir. LEXIS 280 (Richmond Sept. 16, 2004). Presumption of marriage not rebutted.  Husband could be the administrator of a decedents estate because a certified copy of the marriage between the husband and decedent was admitted into evidence, and it created a presumption of a lawful marriage; the presumption of marriage had not been rebutted, and thus, the husband was the surviving spouse of the decedent and her sole heir because the decedent left the marital home due to medical conditions, and allegations of drunkenness and abuse were undermined by multiple witnesses.

The provisi ons of this article shall apply to determining the elective share of a surviving spouse for decedents dying on or after January 1, 2017. B. As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:Decedents non-probate transfers to others means the amounts that are included in the augmented estate under § 64.2-308.6.Fractional interest in property held in joint tenancy with the right of survivorsh ip, whether the fractional interest is unilaterally severable or not, means the fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which, if the decedent was a joi nt tenant, is one plus the number of joint tenants who survive the decedent and which, if the decedent was not a joint tenant, is the number of joint tenants.Marriage, as it relates to a transfer by the decedent during marriage, means any marriage of the decedent to the decedents surviving spouse. Non-adverse party means a person who does not have a substantial beneficial interest in the trust or other property arrangement that would be adversely affected by the exercise or non-exercise of the power that he possesses respecting the trust or other property arrangement. A person having a general power of appointment over property is deemed to have a beneficial interest in the property. Power or power of app ointment includes a power to designate the beneficiary of a beneficiary designation.Presently exe rcisable general power of appointment means a power of appointment under which, at the time in question, the decedent, whether or not he then had the capacity to exercise the power, held a power to create a present or future interest in himself, his creditors, his estate, or creditors of his estate, and includes a power to revoke or invade the principal of a trust...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-309"><akn:num>§ 64.2-309</akn:num><akn:heading>Family allowance</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. In addition to any other right or allowance under this article, upon the death of a decedent who was domiciled in the Commonwealth, the surviving spouse and minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money ou t of the estate for their maintenance during the period of administration, which allowance shall not continue for longer than one year if the estate is inadequate to discharge all allowed claims. The family allowance may be paid as a lump sum not to exce ed $24,000, or in periodic installments not to exceed $2,000 per month for one year. It is payable to the surviving spouse for the use of the surviving spouse and minor children or, if there is no surviving spouse, to the person having the care and custo dy of the minor children. If any minor child is not living with the surviving spouse, the family allowance may be made partially to the spouse and partially to the person having the care and custody of the child, as their needs may appear. If there are n o minor children, the allowance is payable to the surviving spouse. B. The family allowance has priority over all claims against the estate. C. The family allowance is in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or minor children by the will of the decedent, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share. D.

If a will r efers to a written statement or list to dispose of items of tangible personal property not otherwise specifically bequeathed, the statement or list shall be given effect to the extent that it describes items of tangible personal property and their intend ed recipients with reasonable certainty and is signed by the testator although it does not satisfy the requirements for a will. Bequests of a general or residuary nature, whether referring only to personal property or to the entire estate, are not specif ic bequests for the purpose of this section. B. The written statement or list may be (i) referred to as one that is in existence at the time of the testators death, (ii) prepared before or after the execution of the will, (iii) altered by the testator at any time, and (iv) a writing that has no significance apart from its effect on the dispositions made by the will.

A personal representative shall not be liable for any distribution of tangible personal property to the apparent legatee under the testators will made without actual knowledge of the existence of a written statement or list, nor shall he have any duty to recove r property so distributed. However, a person named to receive certain tangible personal property in a written statement or list that is effective under this section may recover that property, or its value if the property cannot be recovered, from an appa rent legatee to whom it has been distributed in an action brought for that purpose within one year after the probate of the testators will.

Rev. 1069 (2000). CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. The right to make a will of chattels is a common-law right. McDaniel v. Guthrie, 16 Va. L . Reg. 659 (1911). A blind person may make will.  A blind person is, so far as such disability is concerned, perfectly competent to make a will. Boyd v. Cook, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 32, 1831 Va. LEXIS 33 (1831) (see al so Neil v. Neil, 28 Va. (1 Leigh) 6 (1829)). After-acquired property is devisable.  Under the present statutes, any estate, right or interest is devisable to which the testator may be entitled subsequently to the execution of the will, a will bei ng declared by statute, with reference to the real as well as the personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will. Ran dolph v. Wright, 81 Va. 608, 1886 Va. LEXIS 128 (1886). A wife to whom a husband gives property by will may by that will be authorized to make a valid will disposing of it in his lifetime. And such will is presumed to have been made under that power. Thorndike v. Reynolds, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 21, 1872 Va. LEXIS 2 (1872). Right of entry or action.  A right of entry or of action held devisable under our statutes. Taylor's Devisees v. Rightmire, 35 Va. (8 Leigh) 468, 1836 Va. LEXIS 77 (1836). Under this section a possibility of reverter may now be disposed of by will before termi nation of the base or determinable fee. County School Bd. v. Dowell, 190 Va. 676, 58 S.E.2d 38, 1950 Va. LEXIS 254 (1950). Householder cannot dispose of articles enumerated in § 34-26.  Where a householder dies leaving a widow or infant children, such of these as there may be take an absolute title to the articles enumerated in § 34-26, regard less of any provisions of the will of the householder. McDaniel v. Guthrie, 16 Va. L. Reg. 659 (1911). Requisites of mental capacity.  A testator, in making his will, must be capable of understanding the nature of the business he is engaged in, and the elements his will is composed of, and the di sposition of his property thereby provided for, both as to the property and the persons he means to give it to, and how it is to be disposed of among them. Tucker v. Sandridge, 85 Va. 546, 8 S.E. 650, 1888 Va. LEXIS 70 (1888); Huff v. Welch, 115 Va. 74, 78 S.E. 573, 1913 Va. LEXIS 11 (1913); Mercer v. Kelso's Adm'r, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 106, 1847 Va. LEXIS 30 (1847) (see also Greer v. Greer, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 330 (1852); Whitesel v. Whitesel, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 904 (1873); Young v. Barner, 68 Va. (27 Gratt .) 96 (1876); Chappell v. Trent, 90 Va. 849, 19 S.E. 314 (1893); Lester v. Simpkins, 117 Va. 55, 83 S.E. 1062 (1915)). The test applied in Virginia for mental capacity to execute a will emphasizes ability to know and do certain things. Thomason v. Carlton, 221 Va. 845, 276 S.E.2d 171, 1981 Va. LEXIS 219 (1981). For testamentary capacity to exist, it is sufficient that at the time the testator execu ted his will, he was capable of recollecting his property, the natural objects of his bounty, and their claims upon him, and knew the business about which he was engaged and how he wished to dispose of his property. Fields v. Fields, 255 Va. 546, 499 S.E .2d 826, 1998 Va. LEXIS 60 (1998). Law only requires testamentary capacity at time will is made.  This is the controlling factor. Eyber v. Dominion Nat'l Bank, 249 F. Supp. 531, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6483 (W.D. Va. 1966). The testimony of lay witnesses which indicate incapacity generally and not as evidence of incapacity on the date the will was executed, will not overthrow the tes timony of the witnesses to the execution of the will where the latter evidence is clear as to the testators capacity at the time the will was executed. Fields v. Fields, 255 Va. 546, 499 S.E.2d 826, 1998 Va. LEXIS 60 (1998). A testator is not rendered incompetent to make a will merely because he may be incompete nt to safely transact the general business affairs of life. Wooddy v. Taylor, 114 Va. 737, 77 S.E. 498, 1913 Va. LEXIS 138 (1913). Subsequent determination of incompetency not determinative.  Testamentary capacity must exist when the testatrix executes the will. A pending competency hearing or subsequent determination of incompetency does not determine whether testamentary capacity existed at the time the will was executed. Likewise, the appointment of a guardian cannot be regarded as prima facie evidence of mental incapacity. Gibbs v. Gibbs, 239 Va. 197, 387 S.E.2d 499, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1164, 1990 Va. LEXIS 9 (1990). Insanity.  Mental capacity to execute a will may factually exist and be shown, even though the testator has been adjudged insane. Eyber v. Dominion Nat'l Bank, 249 F. Supp. 531, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6483 (W.D. Va. 1966). Old age and eccentricity are not invalidating. Wood v. Wood, 109 Va. 470, 63 S.E. 994, 19 09 Va. LEXIS 57 (1909); Howard v. Howard, 112 Va. 566, 72 S.E. 133, 1911 Va. LEXIS 120 (1911); Huff v. Welch, 115 Va. 74, 78 S.E. 573, 1913 Va. LEXIS 11 (1913). Neither sickness nor impaired intellect is sufficient, standing alone, to render a will invalid; thus, if at the time of its execution the testatrix was capable of recollecting her property, the natural objects of her bounty and their claims upon her, knew the business about which she was engaged and how she wished to dispose of her pr operty, that is sufficient. Thomason v. Carlton, 221 Va. 845, 276 S.E.2d 171, 1981 Va. LEXIS 219 (1981). Where an 88-year-old woman with physical ailments, but who was deemed to be mentally alert and competent, devised all of her property to her son to the exclusion of her daughter, her will was valid since the evidence overwhelmingly showed that she possessed testamentary capacity at the time she executed it. Thomason v. Carlton, 221 Va. 845, 276 S.E.2d 171, 1981 Va. LEXIS 219 (1981). Burden of proof requirements.  In a case in which contestant challenged the authenticity of a will alleging testamentary capacity, the proponent of the will was entitled to a presumption that t estamentary capacity existed by proving compliance with all statutory requirements for the valid execution of the will. Once the presumption exists, the contestant then bears the burden of going forward with evidence to overcome this presumption, althoug h the burden of persuasion remains with the proponent. Gibbs v. Gibbs, 239 Va. 197, 387 S.E.2d 499, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1164, 1990 Va. LEXIS 9 (1990). Burden of proving capacity is on the propounder of the will. Nothing short of clear and convincing evidence will suffice. Riddell v. Johnson's Ex'r, 67 Va. (26 Gratt.) 152, 1875 Va. LEXIS 11 (1875); Tucker v. Sandridge, 85 Va. 546, 8 S.E. 650, 1888 Va. LEXIS 70 (1888). Burden of proof improperly placed.  Instruction, which directed jury to find that the will in question was not the last will of the testatrix if the contestants proved by clear and convincing eviden ce that the testatrix did not possess the requisite testamentary capacity at the time the will was made, improperly placed the burden of proof on contestants to prove the testatrixs incapacity by clear and convincing evidence. Gibbs v. Gibbs, 239 Va. 197, 387 S.E.2d 499, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1164, 1990 Va. LEXIS 9 (1990). Where will wholly in handw riting of testator.  The circumstance that a writing exhibited for probate as a last will and testament was wholly written by the testator himself was prima facie evidence that he was in his senses and able to make a will, so that the burden of proof to repel that presumption lay on those who wished to impugn it. Temple v. Temple, 11 Va. (1 Hen. &amp; M.) 476, 1807 Va. LEXIS 38 (1807) (see Mercer v. Kelsos Admr, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 106 (1847); Beverley v. Walden, 61 Va. (20 Gratt.) 147 (1870)). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Early Alzheimers or mild dementia insufficient to prove lack of capacity.  Although the decedent was suffering from early Alzheimers or mild dementia at the time of the will execution, the decedent had the requisite testamentary capa city under § 64.1-47; the attorneys testimony that the decedent wanted to increase the bequest to the son established that the decedent read the decedents will, understood the scope of the decedents property, the objects of the decedent s bounty, and how the decedent wished to dispose of the property. Rudwick v. Lloyd, 69 Va. Cir. 139, 2005 Va. Cir.

The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. As to the history of certain statutory provisions relating to the execution of wills, se e Selden v. Coalter, 4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 553 (1818); Waller v. Waller, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 454, 1845 Va. LEXIS 12 (1845); Perkins v. Jones, 84 Va. 358, 4 S.E. 833, 1888 Va. LEXIS 88 (1888). Purpose.  The purpose of the statutory requirements with respect to the execution of wills was to throw every safeguard deemed necessary around a testator while in the perf ormance of this important act, and to prevent the probate of a fraudulent and suppositious will instead of the real one. To accomplish this, the statute must be strictly followed. It is, however, quite as important that these statutory requirements shoul d not be supplemented by the courts with others that might tend to increase the difficulty of the transaction to such an extent as practically to destroy the right of the uninformed layman to dispose of his property by will. Savage v. Bowen, 103 Va. 540, 49 S.E. 668, 1905 Va. LEXIS 24 (1905); French v. Beville, 191 Va. 842, 62 S.E.2d 883, 1951 Va. LEXIS 141 (1951). The ceremonies required were not intended to restrain or abridge the power of testators, but to guard and protect them in the exercise of that power. Moon v. Norv ell, 184 Va. 842, 36 S.E.2d 632, 1946 Va. LEXIS 147 (1946); Bell v. Timmins, 190 Va. 648, 58 S.E.2d 55, 1950 Va. LEXIS 158 (1950); French v. Beville, 191 Va. 842, 62 S.E.2d 883, 1951 Va. LEXIS 141 (1951). The purpose of this section is to prevent mistakes, imposition, fraud or deception. Moon v. Norvell, 184 Va. 842, 36 S.E.2d 632, 1946 Va. LEXIS 147 (1946); Bell v . Timmins, 190 Va. 648, 58 S.E.2d 55, 1950 Va. LEXIS 158 (1950); French v. Beville, 191 Va. 842, 62 S.E.2d 883, 1951 Va. LEXIS 141 (1951). The purpose of the statute in requiring subscription of a will by competent witnesses in the presence of the testator is to prevent fraud, deception, mistake, and the substitution of a surreptitious document; however, these requirements are not intended to restrain or abridge the power of a testator to dispose of his property. They are intended to guard and protect him in the exercise of that power. Robinson v. Ward, 239 Va. 36, 387 S.E.2d 735, 6 Va. Law Rep. 971, 1990 Va. LEXIS 25 (1990). The purpose of this statute is to prevent fraud, mistake, or the substitution of documents; it is not intended to place restraints on the power to execute a will but to guard and protect that power. Draper v. Pauley, 253 Va. 78, 480 S.E.2d 495, 1997 Va. LEXIS 18 (1997). Section must be complied with.  The protective requirements of this section, designed to insure testamentary disposition of property against fraud and impositions, must be of general application , and must be proven to have been complied with. Triplett v. Triplett, 161 Va. 906, 172 S.E. 162, 1934 Va. LEXIS 313 (1934). The provisions of this section must be complied with in order that a will may be valid. Moyers v. Gregory, 175 Va. 230, 7 S.E.2d 881, 1940 Va. LEXIS 165 (1940). While this section must be strictly followed, it is vital that the provisions not be construed in a manner which would increase the difficulty of the transact ion to such an extent as to practically destroy the right of the uninformed lay person to dispose of property by will; the statute should be given a sound and fair construction with rigid insistence upon substantial compliance with its re quirements. Robinson v. Ward, 239 Va. 36, 387 S.E.2d 735, 6 Va. Law Rep. 971, 1990 Va. LEXIS 25 (1990). The safeguards of this section are not designed to make the execution of wills a mere tr ap and pitfall, and their probate a mere game. Robinson v. Ward, 239 Va. 36, 387 S.E.2d 735, 6 Va. Law Rep. 971, 1990 Va. LEXIS 25 (1990). This section and § 64.1-45 require the same formalities in the execution of a codicil as in the execution of the will itself. Fenton v. Davis, 187 Va. 463, 47 S.E.2d 372, 1948 Va. LEXIS 236 (1948). Invalidity of a codicil does not affect the validity of a will which has been executed i n the manner prescribed by this section. Fenton v. Davis, 187 Va. 463, 47 S.E.2d 372, 1948 Va. LEXIS 236 (1948). Joint wills are valid. Williams v. Williams, 123 Va. 643, 96 S.E. 749, 1918 Va. LEXIS 56 (1918). Section not applicable to bank deposit payable to survivor.  This section does not apply to a bank deposit made in the name of a depositor payable on death to a named survivor. Use of accounts payable on death to a survivor is a valid method of transferring property upon death, irrespective of the provisions of this section. Virginia Nat'l Bank v. Harris, 220 Va. 336, 257 S.E.2d 867, 1979 Va. LEXIS 269 (1979). II.Testamentary Intent and Knowledge of Contents of Will. Testamentary intent is essential to the validity of a will, and the mere fact of the for mal signature and acknowledgment of an instrument, though strictly in accord with the requirements of the statute of wills, is not conclusive upon this question of testamentary intent. One may execute a paper with every formality known to the law, but un less he intends that very paper to take effect as a will, it is no will. Clark v. Hugo, 130 Va. 99, 107 S.E. 730, 1921 Va. LEXIS 144 (1921), overruled, Poindexter v. Jones, 200 Va. 372, 106 S.E.2d 144, 1958 Va. LEXIS 198 (1958) (see also Waller v. Waller , 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 454, 1845 Va. LEXIS 12 (1845); Hocker v. Hocker, 45 Va. (4 Gratt.) 277, 1848 Va. LEXIS 5 (1848); Early v. Arnold, 119 Va. 500, 89 S.E. 900, 1916 Va. LEXIS 124 (1916). Although the testator had signed will before the document contained the disposition of her property, there was no dispute that the signature was hers, and that fo llowing the transcription of the statement and its recitation back to her, testator stated that the document was exactly what she wanted. Under these circumstances, the signature was intended as a signature and the will acknowledged by th e testator in the presence of two competent witnesses in satisfaction of the requirements for a valid will contained in this section. Draper v. Pauley, 253 Va. 78, 480 S.E.2d 495, 1997 Va. LEXIS 18 (1997). See, however,.Gooch v. Gooch, 134 Va. 21, 113 S.E. 873 (1922), where it is said that it is not necessary that a testator should intend to perform, or be aware tha t he has performed, a testamentary act . Requirement of testamentary intent applies to wills and codic ils.  The requirement of testamentary intent which applies to a will extends with like force and effect to a codicil. Delly v. Seaboard Citizens Nat'l Bank, 202 Va. 764 , 120 S.E.2d 457, 1961 Va. LEXIS 176 (1961). Intention to make and sign will must be concurrent.  There must be a concurrence of the animus testandi and the animus signandi  that is, the intention to make a will and the intention to sign the instrument as and for a will. Hamlet v. Hamlet, 183 Va. 453, 32 S.E.2d 729, 1945 Va. LEXIS 192 (1945). Testamentary intent must appear from face of paper.  It is elementary that to constitute a valid will a paper offered for probate must have been designed or intended to operate as a disposition of the testators property to take effect after his death. In this jurisdiction such testamentary intent must appear from the face of the paper itself. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings, 209 Va. 158, 163 S.E.2d 178, 1968 Va. LEXIS 209 (1968). Testamentary capacity.  Trial court erred in ruling that a testator lacked testamentary capacity when executing a contested will as the evidence did not support such a finding. The trial court erred in placing more weight on the testimony of the testators doctor and her children who were not present when she executed the will than it did on the testimony of the witnesses, the notary, and the will proponent who were present when the will wa...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-404"><akn:num>§ 64.2-404</akn:num><akn:heading>Writings intended as wills</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Although a document, or a writing added upon a document, was not executed in compliance with § 64.2-403, the document or writing shall be treated as if it had been executed in compliance with § 64.2-403 if the proponent of the document or writing establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the decedent intended the document or writing to constitute (i) the decedents will, (ii) a partial or complete revocation of the will, (iii) an addition to or an alteration of the will, or (iv) a partial or compl ete revival of his formerly revoked will or of a formerly revoked portion of the will. B. The remedy granted by this section (i) may not be used to excuse compliance with any requirement for a testators signature, except in circumstances where two persons mistakenly sign each others will, or a person signs the self-proving certificate to a will instead of signing the will itself and (ii) is available only in proceedings brought in a circuit court under the appropriate provisions of this title, filed within one year from the decedents date of death and in which all interested persons are mad e parties.

CASE NOTES Application.  Son was entitled to attempt to establish a 2005 writing made by his mother as a subsequent, superseding holographic will because the mother did not die until Sept ember 2008, and a determination whether the writing offered for probate was a valid will should have applied the law in effect at date of the makers death, including § 64.1-49.1, which became effective in 2007. Schilling v. Schilling, 280 Va. 146, 695 S.E.2d 181, 2010 Va. LEXIS 59 (2010) (decided under prior law). Lack of testamentary intent.  Decedent did not execute the holographic writing with testamentary intent because, if he intended and believed the writing to be an effective codicil, it was reas onable to conclude that he would have mentioned it in his notes to his brother, who was the executor of the decedents estate; and the decedents failure to do so, along with his failure to sign the writing in the same manner as his will, suggested that he did not consider the writing to have binding testamentary effect. Irving v. Divito, 294 Va. 465, 807 S.E.2d 741, 2017 Va. LEXIS 174 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  This section applied to a document that petitioners sought to admit as the decedents will where the document was neither wholly in the decedents handwriti ng nor signed by two witnesses, thus, it did not meet the requirements of § 64.2-403, and § 64.2-404 served to relieve strict compliance with the witness requirements of § 64.2-403. Woodle v. Woodle, 104 Va. Cir. 440, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 612 (Vi rginia Beach Aug. 3, 2017). Limitations met.  Limitations under subsection B of § 64.2-404 were satisfied where the decedent had signed the document at issue, and all three witnesses testified that they wi tnessed the decedent sign the document. Woodle v. Woodle, 104 Va. Cir. 440, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 612 (Virginia Beach Aug. 3, 2017). Presumption of loss.  Plaintiffs exhibit 1, a photocopy of the decedents 2011 will, was admitted to probate; the presumption of loss applied because the original was left on th e kitchen table, and there was no credible evidence to rebut the presumption of loss. Palesis v. Hlouverakis, 88 Va. Cir. 293, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 75 (Henrico County May 29, 2014). Codicil requirements met.  Although testators letter that purported to be a codicil to will was not a valid codicil under Va. Code Ann. § 64.2-403 because it was not signed by the te stator, it was a valid codicil under Va. Code Ann. § 64.2-404 because there was clear and convincing evidence that the testator intended the writing to constitute a codicil. In re Estate of Asmuth, 109 Va. Cir. 136, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 350 (Fairfax Co unty Dec. 7, 2021). Codicil requirements not found.  Writing did not comply with statutory requirements in that it was not manifest that the name on the writing was intended as the decedents signature; the writi ng, which removed the decedents son from the will entirely, was handwritten in cursive on a tab-divider in a binder, the writing established a thought of the decedent to make a change to his will and was tentative in nature, and thus testamentary int ent to create a codicil had not been established by clear and convincing evidence. Irving v. Divito, 94 Va. Cir. 226, 2016 Va. Cir. LEXIS 143 (Chesapeake Sept. 2, 2016), aff'd, 294 Va. 465, 807 S.E.2d 741, 2017 Va. LEXIS 174 (2017). Testamentary intent established.  Clear and convincing evidence established that the decedent intended the document to constitute her will where even though it lacked a dispositive provision, its language clearly showed that intent, the testimony showed that decedent intended to revoke her prior estate plan. Woodle v. Woodle, 104 Va. Cir. 440, 2017 Va. Cir. LEXIS 612 (Virginia Beach Aug. 3, 2017). § 64.2-404.1. Reformation of will to correct mistakes or achieve decedents tax objectives. Text A. The court m ay reform the terms of a decedents will, or any codicil thereto, even if unambiguous, to conform the terms to the decedents intention if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence that both the decedents intent and the terms of the will we re affected by a mistake of fact or law, whether in expression or inducement. B. If shown by clear and convincing evidence, the court may modify the terms of a decedents will to achieve the decedents tax objectives in a manner that is not contrary to the decedents probable intention. C. Notice must be given and a person may represent and bind another person in proceedings under this section to the same extent that a person may represent and bind another person in proceedings brought under § 64.2-733 or 64.2-734 relating to trusts. D. The remedie s granted by this section are available only in proceedings brought in a circuit court under the appropriate provisions of this title, filed within one year from the decedents date of death and in which all interested persons are made parties. E. This sectio n applies to all wills and codicils regardless of the date of their execution and all judicial proceedings regardless of when commenced, except that this section shall not apply to any judicial proceeding commenced before July 1, 2018, if the court finds that its application would substantially interfere with the effective conduct of the judicial proceeding or prejudice the rights of the parties.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Joint testators not competent to serve as witnesses to their own joint will.  Trial court rejected a surviving partners claim that the surviving partner and a deceased partner made a valid joint will when they signed an agreement which gave the deceased partners interest in a warehouse to the surviving partner because the partners could not serve as witnesses to their own joint will. Quenza v. Baum, 62 Va. Cir. 284, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 295 (Norfolk July 14, 2003) (decided under pr ior law). Beneficiary permitted to witness wil l.  Clerk was directed to admit the decedents November 4, 2017, will to probate because the will was entirely in the handwriting of the decedent; the will met all the requirements for due execution of a will as no form of attestation was required, and the decedent wrote and signed the will in the presence of two witnesses who immediately signed the will in the presence of each other; it was irrelevant that the pr oponent of the will was both a witness and beneficiary to the will; and the will clearly demonstrated testamentary intent to leave the property to the proponent of the will when the decedent passed away and could not be interpreted as making a present gi ft, a draft, a memorandum, or instruction to an attorney for a future will.

Destruction or Cancellation of Will. III. Revocation By Subsequent Will, Codicil or Writing. I.General Consideration. Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. The General Assembly has precisely defined the several methods by which revocation may be accomplished. McKenzie v. Francis, 214 Va. 104, 197 S.E.2d 221, 1973 Va. LEXIS 263 (1973). Section must be complied with.  In order that the revocation of a will may be valid the provisions of this section must be followed. Moyers v. Gregory, 175 Va. 230, 7 S.E.2d 881, 1940 Va. LEXIS 165 (1940); Bradshaw v. Bangley, 194 Va. 794, 75 S.E.2d 609, 1953 Va. LEXIS 148 (1953). A commission of lunacy against a testator is not a revocation of a will which he made wh en of sound mind. Hughes v. Hughes' Ex'r, 16 Va. (2 Munf) 209, 1811 Va. LEXIS 32 (1811). Death of a husband was no revocation of the will of his wife validly made in his lifetim e. Thorndike v. Reynolds, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 21, 1872 Va. LEXIS 2 (1872). In the absence of contract, joint wills are revocable by either testator at pleasure. Wi lliams v. Williams, 123 Va. 643, 96 S.E. 749, 1918 Va. LEXIS 56 (1918). Revocation based on erroneous advice.  The fact that a testator had been erroneously advised on a point, and thereby induced to revoke his will, is no ground for avoiding the revocation. Skipwith v. Ca bell's Ex'r, 60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 758, 1870 Va. LEXIS 19 (1870). Revocation by enactment of law.  The fact that a will is ambulatory and speaks as of the makers death does not preclude the General Assembly from enacting laws which revoke and declare a null ity an existing will upon the occurrence of a specified event such as marriage. After such a revocation, unless the will is revived in a manner prescribed by law, the will never speaks. Wilson v. Francis, 208 Va. 83, 155 S.E.2d 49, 1967 Va. LEXIS 187 (19 67). Revocation by implication is not favored. Bradshaw v. Bangley, 194 Va. 794, 75 S.E.2d 609 , 1953 Va. LEXIS 148 (1953). II.Destruction or Ca ncellation of Will. Cancellation requires physical defacement or mutilation.  The revocation of a will by cancellation, within the meaning of this section, contemplates marks or lines across the written parts of the instrument, or a physica l defacement, or some mutilation of the writing itself, with the intent to revoke. If written words are used for the purpose, they must be so placed as to physically affect the written portion of the will, not merely on blank parts of the paper on which the will is written. If the writing intended to be the act of cancelling does not mutilate, or erase, or deface, or otherwise physically come in contact with any part of a written word of the will, it cannot be given any greater weight than a similar wri ting on a separate sheet of paper, which identifies the will referred to just as definitely as does the writing on the back. If a will may be revoked by writing on the back, separable from the will, it may be done by a writing not on the will, and this t he statute forbids. Thompson v. Royall, 163 Va. 492, 175 S.E. 748, 1934 Va. LEXIS 197 (1934); Franklin v. McLean, 192 Va. 684, 66 S.E.2d 504, 1951 Va. LEXIS 216 (1951). Revocation of a will by cancellation, within the meaning of former § 64.1-58, contemplated marks or lines across the written parts of the instrument, or a phys ical defacement, or some mutilation of the writing itself, with the intent to revoke. Jessup v. Jessup, 221 Va. 61, 267 S.E.2d 115, 1980 Va. LEXIS 216 (1980). Revocation by mutilation can be accomplished only when the act of mutilation is performed in accordance with this section. If ratification of mutilation by accident or by the act of some person outside the presence of the testator or without his direction is to become one of the methods by which a properly executed will may be revoked, i t must remain for the legislature to say so. McKenzie v. Francis, 214 Va. 104, 197 S.E.2d 221, 1973 Va. LEXIS 263 (1973). Act and intent are essential to revocation.  To effect revocation of a duly executed will, in any of the methods prescribed by this section, two things are necessary: (1) the doing of one of the acts specifi ed, (2) accompanied by the intent to revokethe animus revocandi. Proof of either, without proof of the other, is insufficient. Thompson v. Royall, 163 Va. 492, 175 S.E. 748, 1934 Va. LEXIS 197 (1934). Revocations effective if support cancellation inference.  Whenever any of the statutory methods are employed by the testator with an intent to revoke, the changes are effective, even though made after execution of a duly attested will, provided they sufficiently support an inference of cancellation. Goriczynski v. Poston, 248 Va. 271, 448 S.E.2d 423, 1994 Va. LEXIS 112 (1994). Mere writing upon will is not cancellation.  The great weight of authority is to the effect that the mere writing upon a will which does not in anywise physically obliterate or cancel the same is insufficien t to work a destruction of a will by cancellation, even though the writing may express an intention to revoke and cancel. This appears to be the better rule. Thompson v. Royall, 163 Va. 492, 175 S.E. 748, 1934 Va. LEXIS 197 (1934). Intent to revoke by mutilation can, under certain carefully defined circumstances, be presumed. McKenzie v. Francis, 214 Va. 104, 197 S.E.2d 221, 1973 Va. LEXIS 263 (1973). Pencil marks presumed made with intent to revoke.  Contestants brought suit to set aside a paper writing which had been admitted to probate ex parte, as the last will of decedent, on the ground that it had been fo und among decedents effects in her possession in a canceled and mutilated condition. The proponents submitted evidence that deceased a year before her death while sick in a hospital requested her attorney to secure and care for certain papers then lo cated in her home. He found among the papers the purported will, dated about seventeen years before, written and signed wholly in deceaseds handwriting in ink, but which had pencil lines extending through each and every line, including the signature. From those facts it was presumed that the pencil marks were made by decedent with the intention of revoking the instrument in a manner required by this section. Since appellants offered no evidence to rebut that presumption, it prevailed. Franklin v. Mc Lean, 192 Va. 684, 66 S.E.2d 504, 1951 Va. LEXIS 216 (1951). Burden of rebutting presumption.  Whatever presumption arises from acts of cancellation or mutilation, it is rebuttable, but the burden of the rebuttal rests upon the proponent. Jessup v. Jessup, 221 Va. 61, 267 S.E.2d 115, 1980 Va. LEXIS 216 (1980). The presumption casts upon proponents of a will the burden of producing evidence to the contrary. McKenzie v. Francis, 214 Va. 104, 197 S.E.2d 221, 1973 Va. LEXIS 263 (1973). Evidence to the contrary need not be testimonial evidence and may be physical and circum stantial. McKenzie v. Francis, 214 Va. 104, 197 S.E.2d 221, 1973 Va. LEXIS 263 (1973). Partial obliteration is evidence to the contrary.  Had obliteration of the will been total, the presumption that it was an act performed by the testator with the intention of revoking would be strong. Sinc e total obliteration could have been achieved as readily as partial obliteration, partial obliteration is evidence to the contrary. McKenzie v. Francis, 214 Va. 104, 197 S.E.2d 221, 1973 Va. LEXIS 263 (1973); Jessup v. Jessup, 221 Va. 61, 267 S.E.2d 115, 1980 Va. LEXIS 216 (1980). Partia l mutilation.  A mutilated will seldom is one that is completely destroyed. There usually remain words, phrases, paragraphs and even pages that are legible and unmarked. The mer e fact that the mutilation is only partial does not of itself satisfy or neutralize the presumption of a revocation. The presumption remains until it is overcome. Jessup v. Jessup, 221 Va. 61, 267 S.E.2d 115, 1980 Va. LEXIS 216 (1980). Tampering with will by cutting, tearing or burning.  The presumption of revocation does not apply only where there is a complete destruction, obliteration or cancellation of a will; it also applies to a will which h as been tampered with in some manner by cutting, t...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-411"><akn:num>§ 64.2-411</akn:num><akn:heading>Revival of wills after revocation</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Any will or codicil, or any part thereof that has been revoked pursuant to § 64.2-410 shall not be revived unless such will or codicil is reexecuted in the manner re quired by law.

The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. Destruction of subsequent inconsistent will containing no express revocation.  Wills were not revoked by subsequent inconsistent holographic writings, containing no express revocation of prior wills, where the subsequent writings, though tes tamentary in character, had been destroyed by testatrix animo revocandi. Such writings were ambulatory until death, and having been revoked prior to death they never constituted wills within the intent of that portion of former § 64.1-58 (see now § 64.1-58.1) which provides for revocation by subsequent will or codicil, and their execution did not revoke the earlier wills. Poindexter v. Jones, 200 Va. 372, 106 S.E.2d 144 (1958), overruling, Clark v. Hugo, 130 Va. 99, 107 S.E. 730 (1921). Section states com mon law as to revival by codicil.  This section merely adopted the settled rule at common law as to the revival of wills by codicil, and the concluding provision, that a revoked will shall be reviv ed only to the extent to which an intention to revive the same is shown, was merely meant to provide a statutory rule that a codicil shall not operate, proprio vigore, to revive a revoked will, where the intention so to do does not appear on the face of the will, or otherwise, either expressly or impliedly. Gooch v. Gooch, 134 Va. 21, 113 S.E. 873, 1922 Va. LEXIS 141 (1922). Codicil must show testamentary inten t.  A paper writing, which the testatrix referred to as a codicil to a prior will, but which made no disposition of property, and directed no act of a testamentary na ture, did not operate to revive the prior will to which it referred. Delly v. Seaboard Citizens Nat'l Bank, 202 Va. 764, 120 S.E.2d 457, 1961 Va. LEXIS 176 (1961). Republicat ion implied from codicil referring to will.  Where the testator in a codicil refers to a will and gives sufficient demonstration that when making the codicil he considered the will as his will, a republicati on of the will may be implied. Gooch v. Gooch, 134 Va. 21, 113 S.E. 873, 1922 Va. LEXIS 141 (1922); Triplett v. Triplett, 161 Va. 906, 172 S.E. 162, 1934 Va. LEXIS 313 (1934). Will revoked b y birth of children revived by codicil.  A will revoked by the birth of children was revived under this section by a codicil admitted to be of such nature as to have effected revival prior to the enactme nt of this section. Gooch v. Gooch, 134 Va. 21, 113 S.E. 873, 1922 Va. LEXIS 141 (1922). Due execution is required.  In order that a codicil may establish a will not duly executed and be a republication thereof, its execution must be such as would have sufficed for the will, if the will had been so executed. See examples in this case. Gibson v. Gibson, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 44, 1877 Va. LEXIS 52 (1877). No particular words are necessary to be used in a codicil to effect a republication of t he will to which it is annexed. It is only necessary that it shall appear that the testator referred to and considered the paper as his will at the time he executed the codicil; where this so appears, even though the codicil refers to personal property o nly, it may operate as a republication, as to realty, even so as to pass after-acquired lands. Corr v. Porter, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 278, 1880 Va. LEXIS 41 (1880). Codicil need not show knowledge by testator of revocation of will.  It is not necessary to a revival of a revoked will by a codicil thereto that the codicil should show that the testator knew that his will had been revoked. The es sential thing to be shown by the codicil is that, as expressed therein or to be implied therefrom, the codicil conveys the meaning that the will still expresses the testamentary intention of the testator as of the time of the execution of the codicil, an d to what extent the will still expresses that intention, whether to the extent of the whole will, and, if not, to what extent. Gooch v. Gooch, 134 Va. 21, 113 S.E. 873, 1922 Va. LEXIS 141 (1922). Or intention that writing operate as codicil.  The fact that a testator did not intend the language used in a codicil reviving a will revoked by the birth of children to operate as a codicil is immaterial. Goo ch v. Gooch, 134 Va. 21, 113 S.E. 873, 1922 Va. LEXIS 141 (1922). Statement on Masonic form held to revive will.  A statement, made on a Masonic form, duly signed and witnessed, that signer had made a will in his wifes favor, was a sufficient codicil to revive that will u nder this section, when it had been made inoperative under § 64.1-70 by subsequent birth of children. Gooch v. Gooch, 134 Va. 21, 113 S.E. 873, 1922 Va. LEXIS 141 (1922). A revived will speaks as of the date of the codicil. Corr v. Porter, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 2 78, 1880 Va. LEXIS 41 (1880); Hatcher v. Hatcher, 80 Va. 169, 1885 Va. LEXIS 53 (1885). And the law in force when the codicil was executed governs. Corr v. Porter, 74 Va. (33 Gr att.) 278, 1880 Va. LEXIS 41 (1880). Revocation Subsequent will and c odicils.  Decedent died intestate because the decedents second will expressly revoked the defendants first will and because the decedents subsequent codicils ch anging the executors named in the second will to the executors named in the first will revoked the second will. The codicils, however, did not revive the first will because there was an absence of any reasonably clear indication that the original will as a whole continued to express the decedents testamentary intention.

App. Oct. 11, 2022).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-412"><akn:num>§ 64.2-412</akn:num><akn:heading>Revocation by divorce or annulment; revival upon remarriage; no revocation by other change</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. For the pur poses of this section, the terms revocable, settlor, trust instrument, and trustee have the same meanings as provided in § 64.2-701. B. If, after m aking a will, the testator is divorced from the bond of matrimony or his marriage is annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse. Unless the will expressly provides otherwise , any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse or nominating the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator, or guardian is also revoked. C. Property pr evented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation pursuant to subsection B shall pass as if the former spouse failed to survive the testator. Provisions of a will conferring a power or office on the former spouse shall be interpreted as if th e former spouse failed to survive the testator. D. Unless the trust instrument expressly provides otherwise, if a settlor creates a revocable trust and if, after such creation: 1. The s ettlor is divorced from the bond of matrimony or the settlors marriage is annulled and the trust was revocable immediately before the divorce or annulment, then a provision of such revocable trust transferring property to or conferring any beneficial interest on the settlors former spouse is revoked upon the divorce or the annulment of the settlors marriage, and such property or beneficial interest shall be administered as if the former spouse failed to survive the divorce or annulment; or 2. An action is filed (i) for the divorce or annulment of the settlors marriage to the settlors spouse or for their legal separation or (ii) by either the settlor or the settlor s spouse for separate maintenance from the other, and the trust was revocable at the time of the filing, then a provision of such revocable trust conferring a power, including a power of appointment, on the spouse or nominating or appointing the spou se as a fiduciary, including trustee, trust director, conservator, or guardian, is revoked upon the filing, and such provision shall be interpreted as if the former spouse failed to survive the filing. E. If the prov isions of the will or revocable trust instrument are revoked solely pursuant to this section, and there is no subsequent will, trust revocation, other than under this section, or inconsistent codicil or amendment, the provisions shall be revived upon the testators or settlors remarriage to the former spouse. Nothing in this section shall prevent a testator or settlor from transferring property to, conferring any beneficial interest on, conferring a power on, or nominating or appointing as a fidu ciary a spouse or former spouse subsequent to a revocation under this section. F. Except as p rovided in this section, no change of circumstances shall be deemed to revoke a will or trust instrument. G.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Public policy.  It is a statutory declaration of public policy concerning wills of divorced testators, which provides without condition, reservation or qualification that a divor ced spouse is to be denied any benefits under a will executed prior to divorce. Papen v. Papen, 216 Va. 879, 224 S.E.2d 153, 1976 Va. LEXIS 219 (1976). The obvious purpose of this section was to incorporate into statute the presumed intent of a testator that any provision in his will for the benefit of his spouse be terminated in the event of their divorce. Papen v. Papen, 216 Va. 879, 224 S.E.2d 153, 1976 Va. LEXIS 219 (1976). This section shifts to the testator the burden of taking affirmative action to reverse the intent implicit in the law. Papen v. Papen, 216 Va. 879, 224 S.E.2d 153, 1976 Va. LEXIS 219 (1976). This section applies to wills executed and divorces obtained before, as well as after, the effective date of the statute. Papen v. Papen, 216 Va. 879, 224 S.E.2d 153, 1976 Va. LEXIS 219 (1976). How property p asses after revocation under section.  Property devised to a former spouse, which is prevented from passing because of statutory revocation, shall pass as if the former spouse failed to survive the dec edent unless a contrary intention is apparent from the provisions of the will. Jones v. Brown, 219 Va. 599, 248 S.E.2d 812, 1978 Va. LEXIS 218 (1978). Where the applicable provisions of a will manifested a clear intent on the part of the testator to first prefer his wife, but, after her, to prefer his first heir at law to the exclusion of the other heirs at law, and divorce revoked the devise to the former wife just as surely as if she had died, it was proper to construe the will so that the first heir took the entire estate under the will as though the testato rs former wife predeceased him, since such a construction not only would carry out the testators clear intent, but would avoid intestacy, which is not favored in the law. Jones v. Brown, 219 Va. 599, 248 S.E.2d 812, 1978 Va. LEXIS 218 (1978). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Designation of beneficiary.  Where a state employee had designated an ex-wife as beneficiary of any accumulated retirement contributions and because the parties divorce was prior to July 1, 1993, §§ 20-111.1, 64.1-16.2 c, and 64.1-59 did not apply; as a result, the designation in favor of the ex-wife was not revoked when the parties were divorced.

Effect of conditional contract where condition fulfilled after death.  Where the decedent devised an interest in real estate by will, and subsequently entered into conditional contracts to convey the land, the doctrine of equitable c onversion will not be applied to adeem the devise where the condition is fulfilled after the death of the decedent. Therefore, proceeds from the sale devolve upon the devisees, not upon the residuary legatees. Bauserman v. DiGiulian, 224 Va. 414, 297 S. E.2d 671, 1982 Va.

The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Ordinarily, wills speak as of the date of the death, etc., of the testator and are to be examined from every angle. Murchison v. Wallace, 156 Va. 728, 159 S.E. 106, 1931 Va. LEXIS 228 (1931). Consistent with § 64.1-62, requiring that wills be construed as if the testator died immediately before death, unless the will showed a contrary intent, inter vivos trusts were to be construed according to the law in effect at the time the trust was executed, absent language showing a contrary intent, as such a rule recognized that the interests of trust beneficiaries accrued when the trust was executed and pr otected those interests, and such a rule was compelled by § 1-16 [see now § 1-239], mandating that no new law should be construed in any way whatever to affect any right accrued, or claim arising before the new law took effect. McGehee v. Edwards, 268 Va. 15, 268 Va. 23, 597 S.E.2d 99, 2004 Va. LEXIS 96 (2004). But question is one of intention.  When a will may be construed to speak and take effect is a question of intention, in a qualified sense. Thorndike v. Reynolds, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 21, 1872 Va. LEX IS 2 (1872). Where the language of testatrixs will showed her intention to give to the legatees of certain corporate stock the proportionate interest she had in the corpor ations at the time of the execution of her will, thereby making the legacies specific, this showed testatrixs intent to have her will speak as of the date of its execution, which made inapplicable the statutory rule of construction that a will ordina rily speaks as of the date of death. Thus, additional shares the testatrix received as a result of stock splits passed to such legatees. Warner v. Baylor, 204 Va. 867, 134 S.E.2d 263, 1964 Va. LEXIS 132 (1964). Will intended to take effect imm ediately.  A clause in a will of a husband giving to his wife the power to make a will of his property must have been intended to take effect from its date; and so the will of the wife as an execution of the power will be intended to take effect from its date, though not to divest and pass the title in the lifetime of her husband and herself. Thorndike v. Reynolds, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 21, 1872 Va. LEXIS 2 (1872). This section is declaratory of the common-law rule as to personalty but changes it as to realty. Wildberger v. Cheek, 94 Va. 517, 27 S.E. 441, 1897 Va. LEXIS 103 (1897). It puts realty and persona lty on same footing.  The obvious effect of this section was to make wills speak with respect to real estate, as they had done under the common law with respect to personal estate, as of the death of the testator, thus sweeping away the distinction which had theretofore been held to exist with respect to bequests of personalty and devises of real estate. Kent v. Kent, 106 Va. 199, 55 S.E. 564, 1906 Va. LEXIS 121 (1906). As to void or lapsed devises or lega cies.  The effect of this section is to put real estate and personal property on the same footing as to void or lapsed devises or legacies. Kent v. Kent, 106 Va. 199, 55 S.E. 564, 1906 Va. LEXIS 121 (1906). Legacy to dead legatee does not fail.  A legacy bequeathed to a legatee who was dead at the time the will was written does not lapse or become void, but, under the provisions of this section and former § 64.1-64, passes to the issue of the legatee who survives the testator, unless a different disposition thereof is made or required by the will. Wildberger v. Cheek, 94 Va. 517, 27 S.E. 441, 1897 Va. LEXIS 103 (1897). Will passes after-acquired property.  The will of a married woman, though made in her husbands lifetime, disposing of all her estate, passes that acquired from her husband under his will, he dying first. The will speaks as of the time of her death, and there is always a strong presumption for complete testacy. Bowe v. Bowe, 118 Va. 28, 86 S.E. 856, 1915 Va. LEXIS 119 (1915). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Change in status of beneficiary.  Where a hospital, a beneficiary of a charitable testamentary trust, had been at the time the testator executed his will an acute general care hospital that did no t bill its patients, and before his death became a physical rehabilitation hospital that billed patients but also provided free or reduced-cost treatment to the indigent, the trustees claim that its changed character disqualified it from receiving tr ust money failed, as: (1) The will spoke as of the testators death, not the date he signed the will; and (2) The hospital continued to serve indigent patients, which was the purpose the trust fund was intended to support. Mattox v. Annabella R. Jenki ns Found., 61 Va. Cir. 492, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 124 (Richmond May 6, 2003) (decided under prior law).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-415"><akn:num>§ 64.2-415</akn:num><akn:heading>How certain trust provisions, bequests, and devises to be construed; nonademption in certain cases</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. As used in this section:Incapacitated means impairment by reason of mental illness, intellectual disability, physical illness or disability, chronic use of drugs, chronic intoxication, or other cause to the extent of lacking sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible decisions. Revocable, settlor, trust instrument, and trustee have the same meanings as provided in § 64.2-701. B. Unless a co ntrary intention appears in the will or trust instrument: 1. A beq uest or trust provision requiring distribution by reason of the settlors death of specific securities, whether or not expressed in number of shares, shall include as much of the securities as is part of the estate or is or becomes part of the trust b y reason of the testators or settlors death, any additional or other securities of the same entity owned by the testator or trustee by reason of action initiated by the entity, excluding any securities acquired by the exercise of purchase options , and any securities of another entity acquired with respect to the specific securities mentioned in the bequest or trust provision as a result of a merger, consolidation, reorganization, or other similar action initiated by the entity; 2. A bequest, devise, or trust provision requiring distribution by reason of the settlors death of specific property shall include the amount of any condemnation award for the taking of the property that remains unpaid at death and any proceeds unpaid at death on fire and casualty insurance on the property; and 3. A bequest or devise of specific property shall, in addition to such property that remains part of the estate of the testator, be deemed to be a bequest of a pecuniary amount if such sp ecific property, during the life of the testator and while he is under a disability, was sold by a conservator, guardian, or committee for the testator, or if proceeds of fire or casualty insurance as to such property are paid to the conservator, guardia n, or committee for the testator. For purposes of this subdivision, the pecuniary amount shall be the net sale price or insurance proceeds, reduced by the sums received under subdivision 2. This subdivision shall not apply if, after the sale or casualty, it is adjudicated that the disability of the testator had ceased and the testator survived the adjudication by one year. C. Unless a co ntrary intention appears in a testators will or durable power of attorney, a bequest or devise of specific property shall, in addition to such property that remains part of the estate of the testator, be deemed to be a bequest of a pecuniary amount i f such specific property, during the life of the testator and while he is incapacitated, was sold by an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for the testator, or if proceeds of fire or casualty insurance as to such property ar e paid to the agent. For purposes of this subsection, (i) the pecuniary amount shall be the net sale price or insurance proceeds, reduced by the sums received under subdivision B 2, (ii) no adjudication of the testators incapacity before death is nec essary, and (iii) the acts of an agent within the authority of a durable power of attorney are rebuttably presumed to be for an incapacitated testator. This subsection shall not apply (a) if the agents sale of the specific property or receipt of the insurance proceeds is thereafter ratified by the testator or (b) to a power of attorney limited to one or more specific purposes. D. Unless a co ntrary intention appears in the will, a devise that would describe a leasehold estate, if the testator had no freehold estate that could be described by the devise, shall be construed to include such a leasehold estate. E. Unless a co ntrary intention appears in the trust instrument, a provision requiring distribution of specific property by reason of the death of the settlor shall, in addition to such property that is or becomes part of the trust by reason of the settlors death, be deemed to be a distribution of a pecuniary amount if, while the settlor was incapacitated, (i) such specific property was sold by the trustee or (ii) the proceeds of fire or casualty insurance as to such property were paid to the trustee. For purposes of this subsection, the pecuniary amount shall be the net sale price or insurance proceeds, reduced by the sums received under subdivision B 2. For purposes of this subsection, no adjudication of the settlors incapacity before death is necessary. Th is subsection shall not apply if the trustees sale of the specific property or receipt of the insurance proceeds is thereafter ratified by the settlor. F. This sectio n applies to trusts and trust provisions only to the extent the trust instrument or provision is revocable immediately before the settlors death on or after July 1, 2018, and the distribution occurs by reason of the settlors death and is of prope rty that is or becomes part of the trust by reason of the settlors death.

CASE NOTES Section puts devises on same footing as legacies of personalty.  At common law, a general residue of personal property comprehends everything not otherwise effectually disposed of by the will, and since the revisal of 1849 we h ave had a statute in Virginia which puts devises of real estate on the same footing in this particular with legacies of personalty. Gallagher v. Rowan, 86 Va. 823, 11 S.E. 121, 1890 Va. LEXIS 48 (1890) (decided under prior law). See Stonestreet v. Doyle, 75 Va. 356, 1881 Va. LEXIS 19 (1881) (decided under prior law). Determination that life tenants interest in residuary estate failed and passed to th e residuary devisees under this section ignored the early vesting rule which provides that unless the intention to postpone vesting is clearly indicated in the will, all devises and bequests are to be construed as vesting at testators death. Therefor e, a life tenant may own a remainder in testators residuary estate. Coleman v. Coleman, 256 Va. 64, 500 S.E.2d 507, 1998 Va. LEXIS 94 (1998) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Void gift.  When gifts in a clause were made to a boy and others who may render future service, the gifts were void for uncertainty and the shares were to pas s to other residuary legatees. Freeman v. Anderson, 55 Va. Cir. 353, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 297 (Richmond June 28, 2001) (decided under prior law). Revoked gift.  Executor was instructed that: (1) a decedent revoked her testamentary gift to a residuary beneficiary by obliterating his name on her will with an opaque correcti on fluid, (2) the unrevoked portions of the will remained in effect, and (3) under subsection B of this section and to avoid a partial intestacy, the residue was to be divided proportionally between the remaining two residuary beneficiaries as: (i) the d ecedent devised the residue of her estate to two or more persons, (ii) nothing in the will suggested that the decedent had an intention contrary to the provisions of § 64.1-65.1, and (iii) it was settled law in Virginia that a gift that had been revok ed was one that failed for any reason. Estate of Doughtie, 70 Va. Cir. 329, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 48 (Roanoke Mar. 27, 2006) (decided under prior law). Residuary estate.  Entirety of decedents estate was within the residuary estate as certain devises and bequests in the decedents will failed when the designated beneficiary predeceased the decedent and, thus, did not share in the residuary estate as contemplated by the will. Because the charitable trust created by the will was a valid trust with the beneficiary as the designated trustee, a principal beneficiary was not requ ired, the charities maintained an equitable interest in the trust corpus, and a new trustee was to be appointed to oversee the trust.

The cases annotated below were decided under former law, prior to the enactment of this section. For the history of this section, see Harrison v. Harrison, 171 Va. 224, 198 S.E. 902, 19 38 Va. LEXIS 275 (1938). The doctrine of hotchpot has been enlarged by this section to apply in certain circumsta nces to any person, although advancements, properly speaking, are gifts by anticipation from a parent to a child. Garrett v. Andis, 159 Va. 150, 165 S.E. 657, 1932 Va. LEXIS 180 (1932). A conveyance to a legatee is presumed to be in satisfaction of the legacy. Harrison v. Ha rrison, 171 Va. 224, 198 S.E. 902, 1938 Va. LEXIS 275 (1938). But rule does not apply to gift made before will.  Where the gift is given before the making of the will, and the will does not charge it as an advancement, the court cannot so charge it in settling the estate. St rother v. Mitchell, 80 Va. 149, 1885 Va. LEXIS 50 (1885). And presumption is rebuttable.  The presumption that a subsequent conveyance to a legatee was intended to satisfy the legacy is, under the express terms of this section, liable to be repelled by circumstantial evidence. Harrison v. Harrison, 171 Va. 224, 198 S.E. 902, 1938 Va. LEXIS 275 (1938). When a legacy is given to a child, and afterwards an advancement is made to that child, the advancement is taken as a satisfaction of the legacy; but this presump tion may be rebutted by evidence.

For the pur poses of this section, the terms revocable, settlor, trust instrument, and trustee have the same meanings as provided in § 64.2-701. B. Unless a co ntrary intention appears in the will or trust instrument, if a beneficiary, including a beneficiary under a class gift, is (i) a grandparent or a descendant of a grandparent of the testator or settlor and (ii) dead at the time of execution of the will or trust instrument or dead at the time of the testators or settlors death, the descendants of the deceased beneficiary who survive the testator or settlor take in the place of the deceased beneficiary. The portion of the testators estate or th e trust that the deceased beneficiary was to take shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are (a) surviving descendants in the closest degree of kinship to the deceased beneficiary and (b) deceased descendants, if any, in the same degree of k inship to the deceased beneficiary who left descendants surviving at the time of the testators or settlors death. One share shall pass to each such surviving descendant and one share shall pass per stirpes to such descendants of deceased descenda nts. C. This sectio n applies to trusts and trust provisions only to the extent the trust instrument or provision is revocable immediately before the settlors death on or after July 1, 2018, and the beneficiary would have taken by reason of the settlors death if the beneficiary survived the settlor.

For article, Wills, Trusts, and Estates, see 53 U. Rich. L. Rev. 179 (2018). CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases annotated below were decided under former law. This section made a sweeping change from the common-law doctrine of lapsed or void legac ies, declaring what the law should be in the future in no uncertain language, and our courts cannot make exceptions and uphold distinctions where the plain letter of the law recognizes none. Wildberger v. Cheek, 94 Va. 517, 27 S.E. 441, 1897 Va. LEXIS 10 3 (1897). The general doctrine, at common law, is that a devise lapses in all cases where the devisee dies before the testator. And if the devise be to several, as tenants in common, and one of them dies in the testators lifetime, his share lapses. In Virginia the only modification of the doctrine is found in this section. Gardner v. Gardner, 152 Va. 677, 148 S.E. 781, 1929 Va. LEXIS 200 (1929). It is to be liberally construed.  This section is in furtherance of what may fairly be presumed to have been the intention of the testator, and, in order to effect its object, it should be constru ed liberally. Hester v. Sammons, 171 Va. 142, 198 S.E. 466, 1938 Va. LEXIS 266 (1938). It is not for the benefit of the dead legatee, but is intended to safeguard the interest s of those who take under such legatee. Hester v. Sammons, 171 Va. 142, 198 S.E. 466, 1938 Va. LEXIS 266 (1938). The issue of a deceased legatee takes as substituted legatees of the deceased ancestor j ust as if their names had been inserted in the will by the testator himself. Hester v. Sammons, 171 Va. 142, 198 S.E. 466, 1938 Va. LEXIS 266 (1938). The word estate covers every property of every kind which the decedent might hav e had. Hester v. Sammons, 171 Va. 142, 198 S.E. 466, 1938 Va. LEXIS 266 (1938). This section takes no account of precedent events, other than the death of the devisee o r legatee, and does not restrict its operation to cases only in which the death of the devisee or legatee occurs after the execution of the will and before the death of the testator. The only conditions it imposes are: The devisee or legatee must have di ed before the testator, leaving issue who survive the testator. It does not impose the condition that the devisee or legatee shall be in esse at the date of the will, but the policy of the law is plainly disclosed, viz.: to uphold and give effect to a devise or legacy rather than to allow it to fail for the want of a person in esse to take it. Wildberger v. Cheek, 94 Va. 517, 27 S.E. 441, 1897 Va. LEXIS 103 (1897). Legacy to one dead when will written does not lapse.  A legacy bequeathed to a legatee who was dead at the time the will was written does not lapse or become void, but, under the provisions of this section and § 6 4.1-62 passes to the issue of the legatee who survives the testator, unless a different disposition thereof is made or required by the will. Wildberger v. Cheek, 94 Va. 517, 27 S.E. 441, 1897 Va. LEXIS 103 (1897). This section can not enlarge a power of appointment.  It was contended that although the donee of a power was restricted in her selection to the nieces and nephews of her husband, yet this section enabled her to do i ndirectly what she could not do directly, i.e., select from the class deceased members to be the beneficiaries, and by the provisions of § 64.1-45 and this section the issue of such deceased parties would be entitled to the property. It was held that this section did not enlarge the power of appointment, and it was error to hold that a grandniece was entitled to one third of the real estate as issue of her father. Daniel v. Brown, 156 Va. 563, 159 S.E. 209, 1931 Va. LEXIS 212 (1931). Appointment under a power, made by will, lapses by the appointees death in the testa tors lifetime. Burruss v. Nelson, 132 Va. 17, 110 S.E. 254, 1922 Va. LEXIS 3 (1922). Unless power is general and appointee leaves issue.  If a power had been general in the donee to select the objects of the bounty and the donee of the power had exercised her discretion and the devisees named by her had died prior to her death, then this section would have prevented the lapse of such devises, in favor of the issue. Daniel v. Brown, 156 Va. 563, 159 S.E. 209, 1931 Va. LEXIS 212 (1931). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Testatrix intended to dispose of lapsed devise by will.  Will read as a whole and interpreted under the presumption against intestacy showed that a testatrix intended to avoid the operation of this section and to dispos e of her entire estate through her will rather than through intestacy; she therefore intended for a share of her residual estate left in trust for a son who predeceased her to be distributed among the other residuary beneficiaries, rather than through in testacy, even though the will did not provide for disposition of his share if he died before she did.

Portion of pretermitted child is raised by proportionate contribution.  The portion of a posthumous child is not to be raised by a division of the estate into equal parts, but by a proportionate contribution by the devisees and legate es and those claiming under them. Armistead v. Dangerfield, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 20, 1811 Va. LEXIS 112 (1811). Purchasers from the devisees and legatees are not exempted from contributing to make up the portion of a posthumous child by their having purchased without notice of the claim. Armistead v.

A devise or bequest, including the exercise of a power of appointment, may be made by a will to the trustees of an inter vivos trust or testamentary trust, whether the trust was established by the testator, by the testator and another, or by some other person if: 1. In th e case of an inter vivos trust, the trust is identified in the testators will and its terms are set forth in a written instrument, other than a will, executed before or concurrently with the execution of the testators will; or 2. In the case of a testamentary trust, the trust is identified in the testators will and its terms are set forth in the valid last will of a person who has predeceased the testator a nd whose will was executed before or concurrently with the execution of the testators will.In either event, at the time the devise or bequest is to be distributed to the trustees at least one trustee of the trust shall be (i) an individual or (ii) an entity authorized to do a trust business in the Commonwealth. However, prior to distribution of the devise or bequest to the trustees, each nonresident individual or entity shall file with the clerk of the circuit court of the jurisdiction wherein the t estators will was admitted to probate, a consent in writing that service of process in any action against him as trustee or any other notice with respect to administration of the trust in his charge, may be by service upon the clerk of the court in w hich he is qualified or upon a resident of the Commonwealth at such address as he may appoint in the written instrument filed with the clerk. Where any nonresident qualifies pursuant to this subsection, bond with surety shall be required in every case un less at least one other trustee is a resident or the court in which the nonresident qualifies waives surety under the provisions of § 64.2-1411.An entity not authorized to do a trust business in the Commonwealth at the time the devise or bequest is to be distributed shall not, in any case, be a trustee of such trust. B. The inter v ivos trust may be an unfunded trust, and for the purposes of this section: 1. An in ter vivos trust shall be deemed established upon execution of the instrument creating such trust; and 2. An inter vivos trust may contain provisions whereby the amount of corpus to be allocated to any particular portion of the trust will be determined, measured, or affected by the adjuste d gross estate of the settlor or testator for federal estate tax purposes, by the amount of the marital deduction allowable to the settlors or testators estate, by the amount of deductions or credits available to the estate of the settlor or test ator for federal estate tax purposes, by the value of such estate for federal estate tax purposes, or by any other method, and that an unfunded trust shall not be deemed to be testamentary for that reason. C. The devise or bequest shall not be invalid because (i) the trust is amendable or revocable or both by the settlor or any other person, either prior or subsequent to the testators death, (ii) the trust instrument or any amendment thereto was not executed in the manner required for wills, or (iii) the trust was amended after the execution of the will or after the death of the testator. D. Unless the testators will provides otherwise, the property so devised or bequeathed: 1. Shall not be deemed held under a testamentary trust of the testator, but shall become a part of the corpus of the trust to which it is given or, if the will so specifies, the property shall become a part of any one or more particular portions of the corpus; a nd 2. Shall be administered and disposed of (i) in accordance with the terms of the trust as they appear in writing at the testators death, including any amendments thereto made before t he death of the testator, regardless of whether made before or after the execution of the testators will, or (ii) if the testator expressly specifies in his will, as such terms are amended after the death of the testator. E. In the even t that the settlor or other person having the right to do so revokes or otherwise terminates the trust pursuant to a power to do so reserved in the trust instrument, and such revocation or termination is effected at a date subsequent to the death of a te stator who has devised or bequeathed property to such trust, the revocation or termination shall be ineffective as to property devised or bequeathed to such trust by a testator other than the settlor, unless the testators will expressly provides to t he contrary. F. The devise or bequest shall not be valid should the entire trust not be operative for any reason at the testators death. If the devise or bequest is to augment only one or more portions of the trust, the devise or bequest shall not be valid should the trust not be operative for any reason as to such portion at the testators death. G. In any case in which the devise or bequest to the trustee of a trust fails to take effect by reason of the fact that there is no qualified trustee acting at the time the devise or bequest is to be distributed, or that one or more of the trustees then acting is an e ntity not authorized to do a trust business in the Commonwealth, the court having jurisdiction with respect to the probate of the will or the administration of the testators estate, upon sufficient evidence of the existence of a trust estate for admi nistration, independent of the testators estate, and of the validity of the trust established by virtue of such separate written instrument, may determine that the trusts declared by such separate written instrument are the trusts upon which the devi se or bequest is made to the same extent and with like effect as if such trust provisions had been extensively incorporated in the testamentary documents, and that such trusts do not fail for want of a qualified trustee to administer the trust estate so devised or bequeathed. The court may then grant such further and ancillary relief as the nature of the case may require, including the appointment of a qualified trustee to perform the trusts with respect to the estate so devised or bequeathed, and grant ing instruction and guidance to the trustee so appointed in the performance of his duties. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize any such trustee to be excused from any obligations of accounting or performance as are required by law of fiduciaries, nor to prevent the transfer of the trust estate to a trustee appointed by or qualified in a court of record in a foreign state in accordance with the provisions of § 64.2-706. H. This sectio n shall apply to any devise or bequest under the will of a decedent dying on or after July 1, 1994, and before July 1, 1999. History History.

The devise or bequest is not invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable, or because the trust was amended after the execution of the will or the testators death. B. Unless the testators will provides otherwise, property devised or bequeathed to a trust described in subsection A is not held under a testamentary trust of the testator but it becomes a part of the trust to which it is devised or bequeathed, and shall be admini stered and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the governing instrument setting forth the terms of the trust, including any amendments thereto made before or after the testators death. C. Unless the testators will provides otherwise, a revocation or termination of the trust before the testators death causes the devise or bequest to lapse. D. Unless at l east one trustee of the trust is an individual resident of the Commonwealth or an entity authorized to do a trust business in the Commonwealth, at the time the devise or bequest is to be distributed to the trust, the testators personal representative shall not make any distribution to the trust until each nonresident individual or entity files with the clerk of the circuit court of the jurisdiction wherein the testators will was admitted to probate, a consent in writing that service of process i n any action against the trustee or any other notice with respect to administration of the trust in the trustees charge may be by service upon a resident of the Commonwealth at such address as the trustee may appoint in the written instrument filed w ith the clerk.

If property passes from the decedent or is acquired from the decedent by reason of the decedents death under a will executed before September 12, 1981, or a trust created before September 12, 1981, and such will or trust contains a formula providing that the sp ouse of the decedent is to receive the maximum amount of property qualifying for the marital deduction allowable under federal law, but no more than will reduce such federal estate tax to zero or any other pecuniary or fractional share of property determ ined with reference to the marital deduction, then such provision reducing such bequest to such amount necessary to reduce the federal tax to zero or any other pecuniary or fractional share of property determined with reference to the marital deduction, shall be construed as referring to a computation done as of December 31, 1981, that would have reduced the federal estate tax to zero if the decedent had died on December 31, 1981, unless the court shall find that the decedent intended the computation to be made as of the date of death, provided that such will or trust is not amended on or after September 12, 1981, and before the death of the decedent to refer to the federal estate tax on a date later than September 12, 1981. C. The proceed ing to determine whether the decedent intended that the computation under subsection A or B be made as of the date of death, rather than the earlier 1981 date, shall be filed within 12 months following the death of the testator or grantor. It may be file d by the personal representative or any affected beneficiary under the will or other instrument. History History. 1982, c. 622, § 64.1-62.1; 1983, c. 512; 1987, c. 504; 2012, c . 614.

Certain formula clauses to be construed to refer to federal estate and generation-skipping transfer tax laws applicable to estates of decedents dyi ng after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011. Text A. A will, tru st, or other instrument of a decedent who dies after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, that contains a formula referring to the unified credit, estate tax exemption, applicable exemption amount, applicable credit amount, applicable exclusion amount, generation-skipping transfer tax exemption, GST exemption, marital deduction, maximum marital deduction, unlimited marital deduction, inclusion ratio, ap plicable fraction, or any section of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax, or that measures a share of an estate or trust based on the amount that can pass free of federal estate taxes or th e amount that can pass free of federal generation-skipping transfer taxes, or that is otherwise based on a similar provision of federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax law, shall be deemed to refer to the federal estate tax and generation- skipping transfer tax laws as they apply with respect to estates of decedents dying in 2010 regardless of whether the decedents personal representative or other fiduciary elects not to have the estate tax apply with respect to the estate. This provis ion shall not apply with respect to a will, trust, or other instrument that manifests an intent that a contrary rule shall apply. B. The persona l representative, trustee, other fiduciary, or any affected beneficiary under the will, trust, or other instrument may bring a proceeding to determine whether the decedent intended that the will, trust, or other instrument be construed in a manner other than as provided in subsection A. A proceeding under this section shall be commenced prior to January 1, 2012. In such a proceeding, the court may consider extrinsic evidence that contradicts the plain meaning of the will, trust, or other instrument. The court shall have the power to modify a provision of a will, trust, or other instrument that refers to the federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax laws as described in subsection A to (i) conform the terms to the decedents intention or (ii) achieve the decedents tax objectives in a manner that is not contrary to the decedents probable intention. The court may provide that its decision, including any decision to modify a provision of a will, trust, or other instrument, shall be effective as of the date of the decedents death. A person who commences a proceeding under this section has the burdens of proof, by clear and convincing evidence, and persuasion in establishing the decedents intention that the will, trust, or o ther instrument be construed in a manner other than as provided in subsection A. C. For purpose s of this section, interested persons may enter into a binding agreement to determine whether the decedent intended that the will, trust, or other instrument shall be construed in a manner other than as provided in subsection A, and to conform the terms of the will, trust, or other instrument to the decedents intention without court approval as provided in subsection B. Any interested person may petition the court to approve the agreement or to determine whether all interested persons are parties to the agreement, either in person or by adequate representation where permitted by law, and whether the agreement contains terms the court could have properly approved. In the case of a trust, the agreement may be by nonjudicial settlement agreement pursu ant to § 64.2-709. Interested person means any person whose consent is required in order to achieve a binding settlement were the settlement to be approved by the court.

Cox. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Probate is wholly dependent on statu te.  The whole subject of probate of wills rests upon and is regulated by statute law, and the courts, in admitting a will to probate, are confined to the simple quest ion, whether the paper admitted to probate is the true last will and testament of the deceased, and their jurisdiction cannot be extended further, for the jurisdiction of a court to probate is not to ascertain and enforce rights of property, but to estab lish, preserve and perpetuate an important muniment of title. Tyson v. Scott, 116 Va. 243, 81 S.E. 57, 1914 Va. LEXIS 27 (1914) (see Coalters Exr v. Bryan, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 18 (1844); Lamberts v. Coopers Exr, 70 Va. (29 Gratt.) 61 (1877) ; Kirby v. Kirby, 84 Va. 627, 5 S.E. 539 (1888)). A probate court is a special tribunal of limited and strictly construed jurisdiction and has no powers other than those expressly conferred by the statute creatin g it. Eyber v. Dominion Nat'l Bank, 249 F. Supp. 531, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6483 (W.D. Va. 1966). What constit utes estate within meaning of section.  A deposit to the credit of decedent in a bank, United States Savings Bonds and Treasury Bonds found in the lockbox in that bank, and the location in the same city of a partnership business in which decedent was interested, constituted estate within the meaning of this section such as to give the lower court jurisdiction to entertain a proceeding to admit decedents will to probate. Dominion Nat'l Bank v. Jones, 202 Va. 502, 118 S.E.2d 672, 1961 Va. LEXIS 134 (1961). This section contemplates four distinct conditions, each of which would confer jurisdict ion, and none of which depends upon legal domicile as distinguished from residence: (a) The decedent may have a mansion house, which implies residence, and if he has a mansion house which is his residence, the court of the county in which that mansion ho use is located has jurisdiction; (b) the decedent may have no mansion house, and yet he may live with a friend or relative, or in a boardinghouse, and so have a known place of residence, and the establishment of this fact gives jurisdiction to the court of that locality; (c) the section contemplates that the decedent may have neither such a mansion nor such a place of residence, and then the court of the county or corporation wherein any of his real estate lies has jurisdiction to appoint his administra tor; (d) if neither of these conditions appears, then the court of the county or corporation in which the decedent dies or has estate may appoint his administrator. Wilkinson v. Spiller, 143 Va. 267, 129 S.E. 235, 1925 Va. LEXIS 264 (1925). Known place of residence const rued.  A soldier, not originally a resident of Roanoke, married in that city, and after the marriage, so long as he remained in Roanoke, regarded the home of his mother- in-law, with whom his wife resided, as his home. Prior to the marriage he agreed with his future wife that he would make Roanoke his home after his discharge from military service. Shortly after the marriage he went with his company to France. His wife r emained in Roanoke with her mother, and in letters from France he reiterated his purpose of returning to live there permanently. It was held that the soldier was a resident of Roanoke within this section, conferring jurisdiction of the probate of wills o n the circuit and corporation courts in the county or corporation wherein the decedent had a known place of residence. Rice v. Freeland, 131 Va. 298, 109 S.E. 186, 1921 Va. LEXIS 24 (1921). A probate court is authorized to determine where a decedent was domiciled at his death w hen the proceeding is initiated under this section. French v. Short, 207 Va. 548, 151 S.E.2d 354, 1966 Va. LEXIS 258 (1966). Probate of wills of persons domiciled outside Virginia.  This section makes no distinction between the probate of wills of persons domiciled in Virginia and the probate of wills of persons domiciled outside Virginia. Fr ench v. Short, 207 Va. 548, 151 S.E.2d 354, 1966 Va. LEXIS 258 (1966). Where gene ral jurisdiction exists probate is not void.  The fact that the court had no jurisdiction to admit a particular will to probate will not render a judgment admitting it to probate void, the court having jurisd iction over the subject of admitting wills to probate. Fisher v. Bassett, 36 Va. (9 Leigh) 119, 1837 Va. LEXIS 65 (1837); Hutcheson v. Priddy, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 85, 1855 Va. LEXIS 8 (1855) (see Burnleys Representatives v. Duke, 41 Va. (2 Rob.) 102 ( 1843)). There is no statute placing any limitation of time upon the probate of a will. Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919) (see note of this case under § 64.1-95). A will devising lands lying in Virginia, may be proved in Virginia, although declared vo id in some other of the United States. Rice v. Jones, 8 Va. (4 Call) 89, 1786 Va. LEXIS 3 (1786). Situs of debt due decedent is residence or location of debtor.  Generally for probate purposes, under statutes such as this section, which gives jurisdiction to a court of the locality wherein a decedent has estate, th e situs of a debt due the decedent is the residence or location of the debtor. Dominion Nat'l Bank v. Jones, 202 Va. 502, 118 S.E.2d 672, 1961 Va. LEXIS 134 (1961). This section establishes no mandatory duty in original proceedings to probate a foreign will because there are assets in the jurisdiction, absent special circumstances such as existence of real estate or creditors in Virginia. Hence where the proper court of decedents domicile had assumed jurisdiction the lower court did not ab use its discretion in refusing probate. Dominion Nat'l Bank v. Jones, 202 Va. 502, 118 S.E.2d 672, 1961 Va. LEXIS 134 (1961). Decedent's will properly a dmitted to probate.  Circuit court properly admitted the decedents will to probate and appointed an administrator because a charity alleged that the decedent had estate in the jur isdiction in that the charity alleged that the transfer on death designation on a brokerage account was invalid as the decedent lacked the capacity to make such a designation  and therefore the brokerage account was part of the estate  and becaus e the charity qualified as a substantial legatee in that the charity alleged that the charity was the decedents sole heir. Taylor v. Aids-Hilfe Koln, e.V., 878 S.E.2d 385, 2022 Va. LEXIS 70 (Va. 2022). Jurisdiction of federa l court sitting in State.  Since the legislature of Virginia has not chosen to make probate a part of the general equity jurisdiction of the courts of Virginia, a federal court sitting in t he State will be limited in the same manner as the State equity court. Eyber v. Dominion Nat'l Bank, 249 F. Supp. 531, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6483 (W.D. Va. 1966). Jurisdiction of a court of probate does not extend to the ascertainment and enforcement of rights of property, but only to establish, preserve and perpetuate an important muniment of title. Smith v. Mustian, 217 Va. 980, 234 S.E.2d 292, 1977 Va. LEXIS 269 (1977). Circuit co urt orders not subject to collateral attack.  A circuit court is a court of general jurisdiction regarding probate and the grant of administration of estates and even if it errs in taking jurisdiction in a pa rticular case, the order generally is not void, but only voidable and cannot be questioned in any collateral proceeding. Bolling v. D'Amato, 259 Va. 299, 526 S.E.2d 257, 2000 Va. LEXIS 51 (2000). Jurisdiction of co unty commissioner of accounts.  County commissioner of accounts had subject matter jurisdiction to hear a petition for aid and direction filed initially with him because the circuit court had su bject matter jurisdiction over the case, and the supreme court reviewed decisions of the circuit court, not decisions of the commissioner; a commissioners authority to assist the circuit court with the settlement of estates was an extension of the ci rcuit courts subject matter jurisdiction to administer estates. Gray v. Binder, 294 Va. 268, 805 S.E.2d 768, 2017 Va. LEXIS 157 (2017). Will construction.  Ordinarily, the subject of will construction is beyond the province and jurisdiction of the probate court in the probate proceeding. In some cases, however, it is necessary and proper for the probate court to construe the document in order to determine questions such as whether the instrument is testamentary in character. Smith v. Mustian, 217 Va. 980, 234 S.E.2d 292, 1977 Va. LEXIS 269 (1977).

Judgment of clerk is judgment in rem.  The judgment of the clerk of a circuit court appointing an administrator is a judgment in rem, whose validity can only be questioned in the manner provided for by the following section. Beavers v. Beavers, 185 Va. 418, 39 S.E.2d 288, 1946 Va. LEXIS 212 (1946). In admitting a will to probate the clerk acts in a judicial capacity and the order made by him, admitting or rejecting a will, is as much a judgment as though ent ered by the court. His judgment is a judgment in rem whose validity can be drawn in question only in the manner and within the time prescribed by law. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings, 209 Va. 158, 163 S.E.2d 178, 1968 Va. LEXIS 209 (1968); Conrad v. Carter, 224 Va. 485, 297 S.E.2d 706, 1982 Va. LEXIS 318 (1982). It is well settled in this jurisdiction and elsewhere that an order or judgment of a clerk, or court having jurisdiction of the matter, admitting a paper to proba te is a judgment in rem, binding not only the immediate parties to the proceeding in which the order is had, but all other persons and all other courts with respect to property within the jurisdiction of the probate court. Such an order of probate cannot be attacked collaterally and can be assailed only in the manner provided by law. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings, 209 Va. 158, 163 S.E.2d 178, 1968 Va. LEXIS 209 (1968). Effect of clerk s order admitting paper to probate.  The clerks order admitting the paper to probate as the true last will and testament of the testatrix was an adjudication not only that the will was duly execu ted, but of all other questions necessary to the validity of the testamentary act. It was necessarily a finding that the paper was testamentary in character, for without such finding it could not have been admitted to probate as the true last will an d testament of testator. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings, 209 Va. 158, 163 S.E.2d 178, 1968 Va. LEXIS 209 (1968). Demurrer as collat eral attack on order of probate.  In a suit to construe a holographic will that had been admitted to probate by the clerk of the probate court, the lower court erred in sustaining a demurrer and d ismissing the bill of complaint upon the stated holding that the paper writing admitted to probate lacks testamentary intent. The court was without authority or jurisdiction to entertain the demurrer, which constituted a collateral attack on the order of probate. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings, 209 Va. 158, 163 S.E.2d 178, 1968 Va. LEXIS 209 (1968). The clerk properly admitted to probate only the undeleted portions of a holographic will, for the testator could change a holographic will as he chose and there was nothing equivocal about his act in the instant case, it being his clear intent to cancel the bequests to the persons whose names were deleted. Sheltering Arms Hosp. v. First &amp; M erchants Nat'l Bank, 199 Va. 524, 100 S.E.2d 721, 1957 Va. LEXIS 221 (1957). There is no li mitation of time on the probate of a will.  Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593 (1919). As to protection of bona fide purchasers, see § 64.1-95 . Alternative pleading permitted.  Because a stepmother essentially sought alternative theories of recovery, as prescribed by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:4(k), and §§ 64.1-77 and 64.1-88, the trial cou rt properly denied the childrens motion to dismiss her appeal of a clerks order concerning a 1995 will based on allegations of approbation and reprobation on her part.

The matter shall be heard de novo by the court and a copy of its final order shall be entered into the clerks order or will book. At any time after such appeal is allowed, the court may enter an order for the protection of the persons interested in the probate of the will or for the protection or preservation of any property involved as it finds necessary.

Executors and Administrators, § 29. CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Section applies to probate of will theretofore probated in another state.  The provisions of this section apply to the probate of a copy of a will theretofore probated in another state as well as the probate of a domestic will. Horn v. H orn, 195 Va. 912, 81 S.E.2d 593, 1954 Va. LEXIS 169 (1954). Words such an order include any order entered by the clerk or his deputy in the performance of the duties authorized by § 64.1-77, and in the manner therein directed, whether it relates to the probate of a domestic will under the authority of that section, or to the copy of a foreign will under the authority of § 64.1-92. Horn v. Horn, 195 Va. 912, 81 S.E.2d 593, 1954 Va. LEXIS 169 (1954). Virginia statutes provide two ways in which an order of probate may be assailed and a pr oper attack must follow one of them. Under this section Any person interested may, within six months after the entering of such an order, appeal therefrom as a matter of right . . . to the court whose clerk, or deputy, has made the order. The sta tute further provides that in such a proceeding the court shall hear and determine the matter as though it had been presented to it in the first instance. Under § 64.1-88 a person interested, who was not a party to the probate proceeding, may proceed by a bill in equity to impeach or establish the will. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings, 209 Va. 158, 163 S.E.2d 178, 1968 Va. LEXIS 209 (1968). Proceeding is in the nature of an ap peal.  The right of appeal under this section is more in the nature of an appeal than a writ of error. It is assimilated to an appeal in that there is a continuation of the same case upon the same evidence, and the case is simply heard de novo in the higher tribunal. Tyson v. Scott, 116 Va. 243, 81 S.E. 57, 1914 Va. LEXIS 27 (1914). Court hears and determines matte r de novo.  On appeal under this section, the court takes jurisdiction and hears and determines the matter as though it had been presented to said court in the first inst ance. All appropriate remedies provided by law with respect to the probate of wills by courts may then be called into activity, and all rights and reservations which pertain to such case are preserved. Saunders v. Link, 114 Va. 285, 76 S.E. 327, 1912 Va. LEXIS 137 (1912). On appeal from the clerks order the lower court hears the matter de novo and consequently the propriety of its ruling is to be determined as of the time of th at hearing. Dominion Nat'l Bank v. Jones, 202 Va. 502, 118 S.E.2d 672, 1961 Va. LEXIS 134 (1961). Where on appeal the proponent of the will offered no evidence of its valid execution, probate was properly denied, since the cause was heard de novo. Horn v. Horn , 195 Va. 912, 81 S.E.2d 593, 1954 Va. LEXIS 169 (1954). But appeal is not new su it within § 8.01-229.  The appeal is not the bringing of a new suit, but a prolongation and continuance of the old one, and hence the time for taking the appeal prescribed by th is section is not extended by the provisions of § 8.01-229 giving an extension in certain cases if there be occasion to bring a new suit. Tyson v. Scott, 116 Va. 243, 81 S.E. 57, 1914 Va. LEXIS 27 (1914). Appeal is perfected up on entry of order by clerk.  Upon an application for an appeal the clerk is required to enter forthwith an order allowing the appeal. When this is done the appeal is perfected. Convening the other interested parties before the court is accomplished after the appeal has been perfected. Blalock v. Riddick, 186 Va. 284, 42 S.E.2d 292, 1947 Va. LEXIS 151 (1947). Any interested party may demand a jury .  In every proceeding relating to the probate of a will, whether it be a proceeding on an appeal from the action of a clerk of a court in admitting a will to probat e or whether it has reference to a motion made to the court in the first instance to probate a will, any interested party may demand a jury trial. McGlothlin v. Keen, 140 Va. 84, 124 S.E. 451, 1924 Va. LEXIS 158 (1924). Sole issue is whether pa per is decedents will.  The sole issue is whether the paper offered for probate is or is not the will of the decedent. When this question is decided the function of the proceeding is exh austed, and the court should not decide other questions not connected with that issue. Eason v. Eason, 204 Va. 347, 131 S.E.2d 280, 1963 Va. LEXIS 155 (1963). Hence, p roceeding is not res judicata as to other issues.  A proceeding under this section was not res judicata with respect to a later suit for specific performance of certain agreements allegedly made by decedent. Evide nce relating to the release of such agreements was introduced in the probate proceeding, but the issues relating to the agreements were not actually litigated and determined. Eason v. Eason, 204 Va. 347, 131 S.E.2d 280, 1963 Va. LEXIS 155 (1963). Jurisdiction of a court of probate does not extend to the ascertainment and enforcement of rights of property, but only to establish, preserve and perpetuate an important muniment of title. Smith v. Mustian, 217 Va. 980, 234 S.E.2d 292, 1977 Va. LEXIS 269 (1977). Will construction.  Ordinarily, the subject of will construction is beyond the province and jurisdiction of the probate court in the probate proceeding. In some cases, however, it is necessary and proper for the probate court to construe the document in order to determine questions such as whether the instrument is testamentary in character. Smith v. Mustian, 217 Va. 980, 234 S.E.2d 292, 1977 Va. LEXIS 269 (1977). The courts, trial and appellate, in the exercise of their probate jurisdiction, are strictly and severely limited to deciding the question whether or not the pape r was the will of the decedent. Smith v. Mustian, 217 Va. 980, 234 S.E.2d 292, 1977 Va. LEXIS 269 (1977). As to apportionment of costs in a proceeding brought under this section, see Bowen v.

A person of fering, or intending to offer, to a circuit court or to the clerk of the circuit court a will for probate, may request that the clerk of such court summon any person interested in the probate of the will to appear to show cause why the will should not be admitted to probate. Upon such request, the clerk shall, or in the absence of such request the court may, summon all persons interested in the probate of the will to appear to show cause why the will should not be admitted to probate. B. The court s hall hear the motion to admit the will to probate when all persons interested in the probate of the will have been summoned or otherwise appear as parties. Upon the request of any person interested in the probate of the will, the court shall order a tria l by jury to ascertain whether any paper produced is the will of the decedent. The court shall enter a final order as to the probate. C. In the abse nce of a request that the clerk summon any person interested in the probate of the will to appear to show cause why the will should not be admitted to probate, the court in which the will is offered for probate may proceed to admit or reject the will wit hout summoning any party.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Section is mandatory as to jury trial.  This section giving a right of trial by jury is manifestly intended to be put on the same plane as § 64.1-88, wherein it is provided, a person interested . . . may proceed by bill in equity to impeach or establish a will, on which bill a trial by jury shall be ordered. McGlothlin v. Keen, 140 Va. 84, 124 S.E. 451, 1924 Va. LEXIS 158 (1924). This section evinces the legislative purpose and intent that the issue of devisavit vel non shall be submitted to a jury if desired. Tate v. Chumbley, 190 Va. 480 , 57 S.E.2d 151, 1950 Va. LEXIS 146 (1950). And any interested party may dem and a jury.  In every proceeding relating to the probate of a will whether it be an appeal from the action of the clerk of a court in admitting a will to probate or whether it has reference to a motion made to the court in the first instance to probate a will, an interested party may demand the jury, and an heir at law is an interested party. This section is mandatory and deprives the court of all discretion when a request fo r a jury is made. McGlothlin v. Keen, 140 Va. 84, 124 S.E. 451, 1924 Va. LEXIS 158 (1924). Mo de of proceeding is as for trial of issue devisavit vel non.  Upon the trial provided by this section the mode of proceeding is substantially the same as the trial of an issue devisavit vel non. In other words the question i nvolved should be tried as is now provided by statute for the trial of civil cases by a jury. McGlothlin v. Keen, 140 Va. 84, 124 S.E. 451, 1924 Va. LEXIS 158 (1924). Finality of verdict.  Where the case has been fairly presented and there is credible evidence to support the conclusion reached by the jury, neither the trial court nor the Supreme Cou rt may disturb the verdict. Eason v. Eason, 203 Va. 246, 123 S.E.2d 361, 1962 Va. LEXIS 134 (1962). Dete rmination of testamentary capacity; res adjudicata.  The effect of this section and § 64.1-88 is that an interested party may have the actual mental capacity of a testator to make a will factually decided through the procedure afforded in this chapter, and that right cannot be foreclosed by estoppel of record or rendered res adjudicata in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding to which such interested person may be a party, other than by one of probate. The i ssue of whether or not a testator had mental capacity to make a particular will can be rendered res adjudicata in a probate proceeding and none other. Tate v. Chumbley, 190 Va. 480, 57 S.E.2d 151, 1950 Va. LEXIS 146 (1950); Eyber v. Dominion Nat'l Bank, 249 F. Supp. 531, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6483 (W.D. Va. 1966). Trial of the rights of all interested parties in one proceeding was expressly allowed by this section, where two wills executed by testatrix were involved and her testamentary capacity at the time of the execution of the second will was the dominant issue. Tate v. Chumbley, 190 Va. 480, 57 S.E.2d 151, 1950 Va. LEXIS 146 (1950). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Notice.  Although a party moved to set aside the appointment of the administrator of the estate of the decedent, because the pleadings did not establish actual notice of a n attempt to probate the decedents purported will, and actual notice would not have equated to an appearance in any event, the administrator of the estate of the decedent could proceed in the administrators attempt to impeach the will.

The deposit ion of a witness who subscribed a will attesting that the will is the will of the testator, or in the case of a holographic will, a witness attesting that the will is wholly in the handwriting of the testator, may be admitted as evidence to prove the wil l if the witness (i) resides outside of the Commonwealth or (ii) resides in the Commonwealth but is unable to testify for any reason before the court or clerk where the will is offered. For the purpose of taking such depositions, the person offering the will for probate shall be permitted to withdraw the will temporarily, leaving an attested copy with the court or clerk, or the clerk may give such person a certified copy of the will. B. The deposit ion of such witnesses shall be taken and certified in accordance with § 8.01-420.4 and the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia, except that no notice of the time and place of taking the deposition need be given unless the probate is opposed by some per son interested in the probate of the will. Such deposition may be taken prior to the time that the will is offered for probate and may be filed at the same time the will is offered for probate, provided, that if probate is opposed by some person interest ed in the probate of the will, such person shall have the right to examine such witness.

In re Wil l of Bentley, 175 Va. 456, 9 S.E.2d 308, 1940 Va. LEXIS 191 (1940). This section confers both a right of action and remedy. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 169 Va. 77, 192 S.E. 774, 1937 Va. LEXIS 158 (1937). Virginia statutes provide two ways in which an order of probate may be assailed and a pr oper attack must follow one of them. Under § 64.1-78 Any person interested may, within six months after the entering of such an order, appeal therefrom as a matter of right . . . to the court whose clerk, or deputy, has made the order. The sta tute further provides that in such a proceeding the court shall hear and determine the matter as though it had been presented to it in the first instance. Under this section a person interested, who was not a party to the probate proceeding, may proceed by a bill in equity to impeach or establish the will. First Church of Christ, Scientist v. Hutchings, 209 Va. 158, 163 S.E.2d 178, 1968 Va. LEXIS 209 (1968). Section presupposes that will in question was offered for probate.  The provisions of this section that a person interested, who was not a party to the proceeding may proceed by bill in equity to impeach or establish the will  contemplates and presupposes, as does the limitation found in § 64.1-89, that the will in question was offered for probate to the court or clerk. It does not mean that some will other than that tendered may not be probated when more than a year has elapsed after the entry of an order allowing or refusing probate of a different will. Nor does it state or mean that a lost will may not be established in a court of equity under its general equity jurisdiction. Hawkins v. Tampa, 197 Va. 22, 8 7 S.E.2d 636, 1955 Va. LEXIS 190 (1955). The suit authorized is merely a continuation of the probate proceedings before the judge and is therefore a matter over which federal courts have no jurisdiction. Guilfoil v. Hayes, 86 F.2d 544, 1936 U.S. App. LEXIS 3784 (4th Cir. 1936), cert. denied, 300 U.S. 669, 57 S. Ct. 511, 81 L. Ed. 876, 1937 U.S. LEXIS 209 (1937). Probate is a judgment in rem, which cannot be collaterally attacked, but only assailed i n the manner provided by statute. Eyber v. Dominion Nat'l Bank, 249 F. Supp. 531, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6483 (W.D. Va. 1966). Decree or order under § 64.1-85 or under § 64.1-77.  This section permits the filing of a bill to impeach or establish a will only after a decree or order has been entered under § 64.1-85 or under § 64.1-77. S ection 64.1-85 authorizes a court to probate a will or reject a will from probate in an ex parte proceeding. The court may do so either on original presentation or on appeal from a clerks order. Section 64.1-77 authorizes a clerk to probate a will or reject a will from probate in an ex parte proceeding. Thomas v. Best, 209 Va. 103, 161 S.E.2d 803, 1968 Va. LEXIS 202 (1968). This section, which designates the courts having jurisdiction to entertain suits under § 64.1-88 and prescribes the time-limitation for instituting such suits, also refers to the decree or order made by the court or clerk, that is, to an order entered under § 64.1-85 or § 64.1-77. Thomas v. Best, 209 Va. 103, 161 S.E.2d 803, 1968 Va. LEXIS 202 (1968). Consent of some, but not all, heirs and distributees.  The court should not have probated the decedents will on the basis of the consent of some, but not all, of the decedents heirs and distributees. Thomas v. Best, 209 Va. 103, 161 S.E.2d 803, 1968 Va. LEXIS 202 (1968). Section 8.01-322.  Section 8.01-322, which permits a direct attack by a party served by publication who did not appear, does not require a petitioner to allege or prove misrepresent ation, fraud, or deceit as a condition to his right to a rehearing. Thomas v. Best, 209 Va. 103, 161 S.E.2d 803, 1968 Va. LEXIS 202 (1968). Section 8.01-322 permits a court upon a rehearing to correct any injustice in the proceedings. An injustice was done to the petitioners and to other heirs and distributees who were not parties to a compromise agreement in a suit under this section. By the compromise agreement the parties sought to settle a suit to impeach the decedents will, which suit if successful would have resulted in benefits for all the decedents heirs and distributees. But the compromise agreement provided that certain heirs and distributees, parties to the agreement, should receive shares of the decedents estate and that the balance of her estate should be distributed in accordance with the will. The agreement was unjust because it benefited the heirs and distributees who were parties to the agreement, but provided no benefit for the other heirs and distributees. Thomas v. Best, 209 Va. 103, 161 S.E.2d 803, 1968 Va. LEXIS 202 (1968). Extrinsic evidence.  Where the words of a will are plain, clear and unambiguous, extrinsic evidence shall not be considered. Virginia Nat'l Bank v. United States, 307 F. Supp. 1146, 1 969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13372 (E.D. Va. 1969), aff'd, 443 F.2d 1030, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 9598 (4th Cir. 1971). Altern ative pleading permitted.  Because a stepmother essentially sought alternative theories of recovery, as prescribed by Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:4(k), and §§ 64.1-77 and 64.1-88, the trial cou rt properly denied the childrens motion to dismiss her appeal of a clerks order concerning a 1995 will based on allegations of approbation and reprobation on her part. Matthews v. Matthews, 277 Va. 522, 675 S.E.2d 157, 2009 Va. LEXIS 58 (2009). This section modifies §§ 64.1-88 and 64.1-89 as well as § 64.1-84 by permitting an interested person, who at the time of the sentence (now decree) or order was an infant or of unsound mind, to bring a suit devisavit vel non within one year after he becomes of age or is restored to sanity, and by permitting an intere sted person, who at that time was a nonresident or was proceeded against by order of publication, to bring a suit devisavit vel non within two years after such sentence (now decree) or order. The quoted words refer back to the tim e of a sentence (decree) or order mentioned in § 64.1-88, that is, to a sentence (decree) or order entered ex parte by the court (§ 64.1-85) or by the clerk (§ 64.1-77). Those words do not refer to a decree entered by a court probating or reject ing a will in a suit devisavit vel non. Thomas v. Best, 209 Va. 103, 161 S.E.2d 803, 1968 Va. LEXIS 202 (1968). Person interested.  The term person interested means that an individual must have a legally ascertainable, pecuniary interest, which will be impaired by probating a will or b enefited by setting aside the will, and not a mere expectancy.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. This section applies only to the record of what has been proved or deposed in court. It does not apply to what has been proved or deposed before a clerk. The record of what is proved or deposed means the record of what the witnesses said, not the conclusion of the clerk as to the effect of what they said. Grady v. Fauls, 18 9 Va. 565, 53 S.E.2d 830, 1949 Va. LEXIS 200 (1949). And to jury cases.  This section applies only to cases tried by a jury. Grady v. Fauls, 189 Va. 565, 53 S.E.2d 830, 1949 Va. LEXIS 200 (1949). Section admits only evidence given at first probate.  This section was intended to admit as evidence on the trial of an issue devisavit vel non the record of the testimony of only those witnesses who gave evi dence in court at the time of the first probate, and the depositions of only those witnesses lawfully taken out of court at the first probate, who on account of death or other good cause cannot be produced at the trial of said issue. Dickens v. Bonnewell , 160 Va. 194, 168 S.E. 610, 1933 Va. LEXIS 199 (1933). Ex parte o rder of probate does not shift burden of proof.  Even when the ex parte order of probate can be considered admissible as evidence under this section, the order does not shift the burden of proof, and it is still incumbent upon the propounder to introduce evidence sufficient to prove the due execution and validity of the will in dispute. Dickens v. Bonnewell, 160 Va. 194, 168 S.E. 610, 1933 Va. LEXIS 199 (1933) (see Brown v. Hall, 85 Va. 146, 7 S.E. 182 (1888)). This section does not seem to have been intended as an original and independent remedy, but merely to afford an ancillary means of facilitating the probate of wills, and it furnishes no authority to a court to require a legatee under a will, which no one is seeking to have probated, to transfer the possession thereof to its clerk merely for safekeeping. This construction of this section is manifest when read in connection with the other sections of the Code by which it is surrounded. In re Nichols, 116 Va. 949, 83 S.E. 368, 1914 Va. LEXIS 108 (1914). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Notice.  Although a party moved to set aside the appointment of the administrator of the estate of the decedent, because the pleadings did not establish actual notice of a n attempt to probate the decedents purported will, and actual notice would not have equated to an appearance in any event, the administrator of the estate of the decedent could proceed in the administrators attempt to impeach the will.

If such copy indicates that the will was admitted to probate in a court of another jurisdiction and was so executed as to be a valid will of real estate in the Commonwealth by the law of the Commonwealth, such copy may be admitted to probate as a will of real estate. An authenticated copy of any will which has been self-proved under the laws of another state shall, when offered with its authenticated certificate of probate, be admitted to probate as a will of personal estate and real estate.

Rev. 369 (1981). CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Due authentication of copy is determined by admission to probate.  The fact of the due authentication of the copy is determined by its admission to probate, and this determination is conclusive on all persons and all courts until it is reversed in some appropriate proceeding. It cannot be collaterally assailed. Bryan v. Nash, 110 Va. 329, 66 S.E. 69, 1909 Va. LEXIS 147 (1909). A probate court is authorized to determine where a decedent was domiciled at his death w hen the proceeding is initiated under § 64.1-75. French v. Short, 207 Va. 548, 151 S.E.2d 354, 1966 Va. LEXIS 258 (1966). A Virginia probate court may determine domicile when proceeding under this section, even though this section does not expressly confer jurisdiction upon the court to make that determination. French v. Short, 207 Va. 548, 151 S.E.2d 354, 1966 Va. LEXIS 258 (1966). And it is not required to probate will proved in another state if decedent was not domiciled therein.  This section does not require a Virginia court to probate a will, even as to personalty, on the basis of an order of probate entered by the court of another state , if the Virginia court should determine from the evidence adduced before it that the decedent was not domiciled in that other state.

The curator shall ensure that the estate is not wasted before the qualification of an e xecutor or administrator, or before such estate lawfully comes into possession of such executor or administrator. The curator may demand, sue for, recover, and receive the decedents personal estate and all debts due to the testator. The curator may l ease or receive the rents and profits of any real estate that the decedent possessed when he died. The curator shall pay debts, to the extent that there are sufficient assets to do so in the order of payment prescribed by law, and may be sued in the same manner as an executor or administrator. Upon the qualification of an executor or administrator, the curator shall account for and pay and deliver to him such estate as he controls or may be liable for. History History.

CASE NOTES Section does not p rotect purchaser of personalty.  There is no provision of statute in favor of or saving any rights of persons taking personal property under an unknown and unrecorded will, as against distributee s, as there is of the rights of persons taking real estate under an unknown and unrecorded will. By this section, such a saving of rights in real estate is made for a period of seven years (now one year). Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919) (decided under prior law). Purchaser entitled to protection absent record notice and information put ting prudent person on inquiry.  Where the clerks records were silent and the purchaser could not be charged with any knowledge imputed from them and there is no evidence that the purchaser p ossessed any information which would put a prudent person on inquiry as to the existence of any flaw in the apparent devolution of title to the seller by intestate succession, the purchaser was entitled to the protection of this section. Cheatham v. Gre gory, 227 Va. 1, 313 S.E.2d 368, 1984 Va. LEXIS 259 (1984) (decided under prior law). Checking of records does not imply advance knowledge of what might be disclosed.  The fact that the purchaser checked the land records, on his attorneys advice, to ascertain whether a will was filed, gives rise to no inference that he had r eason to believe such a will existed. A check of the land records before recording a deed is an act of simple prudence customary among lawyers. It is a neutral fact which furnishes no basis for an inference that the examiner either has, or lacks, advance knowledge of the facts such an examination might disclose. Cheatham v. Gregory, 227 Va. 1, 313 S.E.2d 368, 1984 Va. LEXIS 259 (1984) (decided under prior law). Purchaser need only pay value.  A purchaser seeking the protection of the recording acts is not required to pay fair and adequate consideration. The statute applies if he simply has paid value.

Renunciation may be made expressly or impliedly.  The renunciation of an executorship may not only be made expressly, but may also be implied from the acts or conduct of the executor, such as refusing or neglecti ng to qualify. Thornton v. Winston, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 152, 1833 Va. LEXIS 6 (1833) (see Geddy v. Butler, 17 Va. (3 Munf.) 345 (1812); Nelson v. Carrington, 18 Va. (4 Munf.) 332 (1813); Burnleys Admr v. Duke, 22 Va. (1 Rand.) 108 (1822); Thompsons v. Meek, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 419 (1836)). As to what acts will amount to a virtual renunciation of an executorship, see Burnley's Adm'r v. Duke, 22 Va. (1 Rand.) 108, 1822 Va. LEXIS 14 (1822). It need not be by matter of record.  The renunciation of the executorship need not be by matter of record. Geddy v. Butler, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 345, 1812 Va. LEXIS 57 (1812); Thornton v. Winston, 31 Va. (4 Leigh) 152, 1833 Va. LEXIS 6 (1833); Thompsons v. Meek, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 419, 1836 Va. LEXIS 50 (1836). And may be proved by parol evidence.  If the grant of administration with the will annexed is alleged to be irregular upon the ground that the executor had not renounced, the fact of such renunciation may be established by parol evidence. Thompsons v. Meek, 34 Va. (7 Leigh) 419, 1836 Va. LEXIS 50 (1836). Ad ministrator once appointed can be removed only for cause.  Under this section and § 64.1-118 a distributee who applies for administration and is appointed and qualifies can only be removed for cause, and the same princ iple applies to an appointee in whose favor a distributee waives his right to qualify. When the appointment, either of a distributee or of some other person designated by him, has been made and the appointee has qualified, the power of the court or clerk is exhausted and no further appointment can be made until a vacancy occurs in the office in some way recognized by law. Beavers v. Beavers, 185 Va. 418, 39 S.E.2d 288, 1946 Va. LEXIS 212 (1946). Substantial legatee.  Circuit court properly admitted the decedents will to probate and appointed an administrator because a charity alleged that the decedent had estate in the jur isdiction in that the charity alleged that the transfer on death designation on a brokerage account was invalid as the decedent lacked the capacity to make such a designation  and therefore the brokerage account was part of the estate  and becaus e the charity qualified as a substantial legatee in that the charity alleged that the charity was the decedents sole heir. Taylor v. Aids-Hilfe Koln, e.V., 878 S.E.2d 385, 2022 Va. LEXIS 70 (Va. 2022). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statute of limitations not tolled where plaintiff not qualified as personal representative.  Plaintiff parents did not qualify as the personal representatives of their deceased childs estate under subsection B of § 8.01-50 and, therefore, in their wrongful death action brought against a property management corporation, the corporations plea in bar was granted with prejudice since the two-year statute of limitations had expired the day after the parents brought suit, thereby preventing joinder of a personal representative, who had been appointed 10 months after the suit was filed. The court refused to apply the law of Japan, as urged by the parents, because Japanese law did not require any additional step to qualify a person to bring suit on b ehalf of a decedent, which directly conflicted with Virginia law which required the appointment of a fiduciary.

The court o r the clerk who would have jurisdiction as to the probate of a will, if there were a will, has jurisdiction to hear and determine the right of administration of the estate in the case of a person dying intestate. Administration shall be granted as follow s: 1. Durin g the first 30 days following the decedents death, the court or the clerk may grant administration to a sole distributee, or his designee, or in the absence of a sole distributee, to any distributee, or his designee, who presents written waivers of t he right to qualify from all other competent distributees. 2. After 30 days have passed since the decedents death, the court or the clerk may grant administration to the first distributee, or his designee, who applies, provided, that if, duri ng the first 30 days following the decedents death, more than one distributee notifies the court or the clerk of an intent to qualify after the 30-day period has elapsed, the court or the clerk shall not grant administration to any distributee, or hi s designee, until the court or the clerk has given all such distributees an opportunity to be heard. 3. After 45 days have passed since the decedents death, the court or the clerk may grant administration to any nonprofit charitable organization that operated as a conservator or guar dian for the decedent at the time of his death if such organization certifies that it has made a diligent search to find an address for any sole distributee and has sent notice by certified mail to the last known address of any such distributee of its in tention to apply for administration at least 30 days before such application, or, that it has not been able to find any address for such distributee. However, if, during the first 45 days following the decedents death, any distributee notifies the co urt or the clerk of an intent to qualify after the 45-day period has elapsed, the court or the clerk shall not grant administration to any such organization until the court or the clerk has given all such distributees an opportunity to be heard. Qualific ation of such nonprofit charitable organization is not subject to challenge on account of the failure to make the certification required by this subdivision. 4. After 60 days have passed since the decedents death, the court or the clerk may grant administration to one or more of the creditors or to any other person, provided such creditor or person other than a distributee certifies that he has made a diligent search to find an address for any sole distributee and has sent notice by certified mail to the last known address of any such distributee of his intention to apply for administrati on at least 30 days before such application, or that he has not been able to find any address for such distributee. Qualification of a creditor or person other than a distributee is not subject to challenge on account of the failure to make the certifica tion required by this subdivision. B. When granti ng administration, if the court determines that it is in the best interests of a decedents estate, the court may depart from the provisions of this section at any time and grant administration to such person as the court deems appropriate. C. The court o r clerk may admit to probate a will of the decedent after a grant of administration. If administration has been granted to a creditor or person other than a distributee, the court or clerk may grant administration to a distributee who applies for adminis tration and who has not previously been refused administration after reasonable notice has been given to such creditor or other person previously granted administration. Admission of a will to probate or the grant of administration pursuant to this subse ction terminates any previous grant of administration. D. The court o r clerk shall not grant administration to any person unless satisfied that he is suitable and competent to perform the duties of his office. The clerk shall require such person to sign under oath that such person is not under a disability as defined in § 8.01-2 or, regardless of whether his civil rights have been restored, has not been convicted of a felony offense of (i) fraud or misrepresentation or (ii) robbery, extortion, burglary, larceny, embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, perjury, bribery, treason, or racketeering. However, if the person convicted of such felony offense is the sole distributee of the estate, then the court or clerk may grant administration to such person if he is otherwise suitable and competent to perform the duties of hi s office. E. If any bene ficiary of the estate objects, a spouse or parent who has been barred from all interest in the estate because of desertion or abandonment as provided under § 64.2-308 or 64.2-308.17, as applicable, may not serve as an administrator of the estate of th e deceased spouse or child.

Letters granted without jurisdiction are voidable only.  Letters of administration granted by a court having no jurisdiction to grant them are merely voidable. If the letters were granted by a court having general juris diction of the subject matter, a party affected by its action cannot be permitted in any collateral proceeding to show that the court has come to an erroneous conclusion. Schultz v. Schultz, 51 Va. (10 Gratt.) 358, 1853 Va. LEXIS 57 (1853) (overruling E x parte Barker, 1830 Va. LEXIS 63, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 719 (1830)). Court appointing administrator has exclusive jurisdiction to appoi nt administrator d.b.n.  When administration of a decedents estate has been duly granted by any court of competent jurisdiction, that same court only, upon the death of the administra tor, has the jurisdiction to grant administrator de bonis non. Ex parte Lyons, 29 Va. (2 Leigh) 761, 1830 Va. LEXIS 75 (1830). Circuit court orders not subject to collateral attack.  A circuit court is a court of general jurisdiction regarding probate and the grant of administration of estates and even if it errs in taking jurisdiction in a pa rticular case, the order generally is not void, but only voidable and cannot be questioned in any collateral proceeding. Bolling v. D'Amato, 259 Va. 299, 526 S.E.2d 257, 2000 Va. LEXIS 51 (2000). Domicile of decedent.  Where one owned land in both of two counties, was employed, voted, and paid taxes in one of them, while retaining a room in a house on his property in the other c ounty for use over the weekends, and where he terminated his employment five months before his death expecting to spend his remaining days in the other county, even though he was prevented from doing so by illness and the directions of his physician, the latter county had jurisdiction to appoint an administrator under this section and § 64.1-77. Wilkinson v. Spiller, 143 Va. 267, 129 S.E. 235, 1925 Va. LEXIS 264 (1925).

Nonresident decedent having claim against Commonwealth.  A resident of Kentucky died intestate there, having no estate in Virginia but a claim on this Commonwealth for money. It was held that the circuit court of Henric o County, wherein is the seat of government, has jurisdiction to grant administration of such decedents estate. Commonwealth v. Hudgin, 29 Va.

Court may exercise discretion in fixing amount of bond.  By this section it was intended that the court granting administration on an estate, or admitting an executor to qualify as such, should have a discretion in rega rd to the amount of the security. And the general practice of requiring the security in double the estimated value of the estate, is a proper exercise of that discretion. Atkinson v. Christian, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 448, 1847 Va.

The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. In Virginia no distinction is made between executors and administrators in the matter of requiring security, unless the testator directs that the executor shall not be required to give security, in which case the court should not require it of him, unless, upon complaint of some person interested, or from its own knowledge it thinks securit y ought to be required.

Section confers wide discret ion upon court.  Under the provisions of this section, courts of probate are clothed with a wide discretion in the matter of requiring security of executors where the will directs that none shall be given, and the exercise of it should not be disturbed except in a case of plain abuse. It may be required on the application of any person interested. Schnurman v. Biddle &amp; Co., 109 Va. 702, 64 S.E. 977, 1909 Va. LEXIS 85 (1909).

If you make written request therefor to the personal representatives, they must mail copies of these documents (not including any supporting vouchers, but including a copy of the decedents will) to you at the same time the inventory or account is filed with the commissioner of accounts unless (i) you would take only as an heir at law in a case where all of the decedents probate estate is disposed of by will or (ii) your gift has been satisfied in full before the time of such filing.

E. Failure to give the notice required by this section shall not (i) affect the validity of the probate of a decedents will or (ii) render any person required to give notice, who has acted in good faith, liable to any person entitled to receive notice.

Section modifies common law.  The common-law rule as to powers of an executor or administrator before qualification has been greatly modified by statute, and is restricted in Virginia to the b urial of the decedent, payment of reasonable funeral expenses, and the performance of such acts as are necessary for the preservation of the estate. Monroe v. James, 18 Va. (4 Munf) 194, 1814 Va. LEXIS 23 (1814). Sale by ex ecutor who dies before qualification is void.  The provisions of the Code of 1879, §§ 21, 23, p. 379, ch. 104, were construed so as to mean that a sale by an executor named, who had not qualified and die d before qualification, was void as against an executor who afterwards qualified. Monroe v. James, 18 Va. (4 Munf.) 194 (1814). To conform to the judicial construction in this case the law has been amended to its present form. Gibson v. Beckham, 57 Va. ( 16 Gratt.) 321, 1862 Va. LEXIS 4 (1862). Sale by majority of duly q ualified executors.  Where two out of three nominated executors qualify and sell and convey real estate to purchasers, who pay the purchase money in full, and after the sale the third qualifies and consents to the sale by sharing the commissions, the title of the purchaser is valid, at least in equity. Mills v. Mills' Ex'rs, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 442, 1877 Va. LEXIS 80 (1877). Declaratory judgment action.  Trial court properly sustained an executors demurrer to a sons complaint, seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to the interpretation of the will of the sons father. Since the son alleged in his complaint that the attorney who drafted his fathers will had not qualified as the executor of his fathers will, as required by § 64.1-136, the son failed to plead the existence of an actual co ntroversy pursuant to § 8.01-184.

Grasty v. Clare, 210 Va. 21, 168 S.E.2d 261, 1969 Va. LEXIS 190 (1969). Collection of assets.  One of the primary obligations of the personal representative is to collect the assets of the estate, which, of course, includes the duty to reduce choses in acti on to judgment.

Grasty v. Clare, 210 Va. 21, 168 S.E.2d 261, 1969 Va. LEXIS 190 (1969). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Self-dealing.  Spouse engaged in self-dealing and violated the spouses fiduciary duties under § 64.1-139 when the spouse raised the spouses salary after the decedent s death, raised the rent for a warehouse owned by the decedent and the spouse and rented to the decedents business, and continued to operate the business; the spouse had operated the business for six years, and had reduced the business to insolve ncy and dissipated the net worth of the business. Estate of Spears v. Spears, 2008 Va. Cir. LEXIS 149 (Fairfax County Nov. 3, 2008) (decided under prior law). Breach of fiduciary duty.  Demurrer by the executrix of the decedents estate was overruled because the complaint by the decedents adult child stated a sufficient basis to establish a cause of action breach of the executrixs fiduciary duty as the decedents will provided that all residue of the estate was to be divided equally between the executrix and the decedents adult child, but the decedents adult child alleged t hat the executrix wasted and converted estate assets.

Any claim for the rescission of a transaction between the decedent and a trustee belonged to the decedents estate as it would have belonged to the decedent, a nd, upon the decedents death, any viable claim relating to the sale of the decedents minority interest in a limited liability company passed to the decedents estate and only may have been pursued by the estates personal representative.

Meador, 197 Va. 807, 91 S.E.2d 645, 1956 Va. LEXIS 157 (1956). It changes the common law.  By this section the common-law rule as to what actions survive has been enlarged. Trust Co. v. Fletcher, 152 Va. 868, 148 S.E. 785, 1929 Va. LEXIS 218 (1929). And enlarges the class o f actions that survive.  The purpose of this section was remedial, and it enlarged, rather than restricted, the classes of action that survived at common law. Barnes Coal Corp. v. Retail Coal Merchants Ass'n, 128 F.2d 645, 1942 U.S. App. LEXIS 3662 (4th Cir. 1942); Rowe v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 421 F.2d 937, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11044 (4th Cir. 1970). To include actions involving injury to a person in his property or business.  As a result of this section and the decisions construing it, the class of actions which survive has been enlarged to include those which involve injury to a perso n in his property or business, as distinguished from purely personal wrongs. Barnes Coal Corp. v. Retail Coal Merchants Ass'n, 128 F.2d 645, 1942 U.S. App. LEXIS 3662 (4th Cir. 1942); Rowe v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 421 F.2d 937, 1970 U.S. App. L EXIS 11044 (4th Cir. 1970). Real nature of injur y or claim should be regarded.  In determining whether a cause of action survives to the personal representative, the real nature of the injury or claim ought to be regarded, and not the form of the remedy by which it is sought to be redressed or enforced. Lee v. Hill, 87 Va. 497, 12 S.E. 1052, 1891 Va. LEXIS 100 (1891). Word goods includes money.  The term goods is broad enough to include money, and as used in this section must be held to be so inclusive. Patton v. Brady, 184 U.S. 608, 22 S. Ct. 493 , 46 L. Ed. 713, 1902 U.S. LEXIS 2264 (1902). Estate covers ever y kind of property right.  The word estate is broad enough to cover every description of vested right and interest attached to and growing out of property. Lee v. Hill, 87 Va. 497, 12 S.E. 1052, 1891 Va. LEXIS 100 (1891). Direct or indirect damage.  Before the 1977 amendment to this section, it was held that while the language of this section was comprehensive, and embraced damage of any kind or degree to the estate, real or personal, of the person aggrieved, the damage must be direct, and not the consequential injury or loss to the estate which flowed from a wrongful act directly affecting the person only. Patton v. Brady, 184 U.S. 608, 22 S. Ct. 493, 46 L. Ed. 713, 1902 U.S. LEXIS 2264 (1902). Before the 1977 amendment, this section was construed to provide for survival only where the damage to property for which recovery was sought was the direct resul t of the wrong. Where such damage was an indirect result of the wrong the action did not survive. Richmond Redevelopment &amp; Hous. Auth. v. Laburnum Constr. Corp., 195 Va. 827, 80 S.E.2d 574, 1954 Va.

In cases of torts affecting property rights, survivability depended upon a direct, as opposed to an indirect or consequential, injury to the property. Coleman v. Kroger Co., 399 F. Supp. 724, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16449 (W.D. Va. 1975) (decided prior to 1977 amendment to this section). Action for wrongful interference with right to enter into contract will survive.  See Zoby v. American Fid. Co., 137 F. Supp. 38, 1955 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2280 (D. Va. 1955), aff'd, Zoby v. American Fidelity Co., 242 F.2d 76, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 2765 (4th Cir. 1957). As will action for maliciously conspiring to breach contract.  An action for compensatory and punitive damages for malicious acts of defendant in conspiring to breach contract not to engage in teaching dancing within two year s after defendants employment with plaintiffs ended was one for damages to plaintiffs estate which would survive under this section. Worrie v. Boze, 198 Va. 533, 95 S.E.2d 192, 1956 Va. LEXIS 239 (1956). Action for malicious prosecution.  An action against a defendant for maliciously and without probable cause suing out an injunction against a plaintiff whereby the operation of his mill was suspend ed could not be maintained against his personal representative under this section as it stood before the 1977 amendment. Mumpower v. City of Bristol, 94 Va. 737, 27 S.E. 581, 1897 Va. LEXIS 133 (1897). Action for loss of use of land.  The loss of the use of land and the timber thereon, occasioned by the fraudulent misrepresentations of a joint purchaser that he had secured a right-of-way over a n adjoining tract, did not give rise to such a cause of action as survived to personal representatives under this section as it stood before the 1977 amendment. Cover v. Critcher, 143 Va. 357, 130 S.E. 238, 1925 Va. LEXIS 272 (1925). Trover may be sustained against a personal representative as such, though the goods neve r came into his hands. Ferrill v. Brewis' Adm'r, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 765, 1875 Va. LEXIS 88 (1875). And so may assumpsit or trespa ss on the case.  Where one was wrongfully discharged by decedent, trespass on the case may be maintained under this section against the executor or administrator, or assumpsit for breach of contract at common law. In either case the action survives. And when defendant dies pending the action, it may be revived against the personal representative. Lee v. Hill, 87 Va. 497, 12 S.E. 1052, 1891 Va.

The cases below were decided under prior law. For the history of this section, see Mills v. Mills' Ex'rs, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 442, 1877 Va. LEXIS 80 (1877) (see also Brown v. Armistead, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 594 (1828)). The object of this section was to prevent the necessity of resorting to a court of equit y for the appointment of a trustee, by devolving the execution of the power upon the executors, who are supposed to be fit and proper persons for the execution of it. Elys v. Wynne, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 224, 1872 Va. LEXIS 15 (1872). This section does not operate as a conveyance of the estate, or any interest therein, to the executors, but merely to give them power to make any sale of real estate which the will directs to be sold, without empowering any particular person to make the sale. Elys v. Wynne, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 224, 1872 Va. LEXIS 15 (1872). Executor has only a power of sale.  A direction in a will that land be sold by executors gives them only a power of sale, and no interest in the land. A suit to recover the land must be brought by t he heirs. The title to the land devolves upon the heirs upon the death of the testator, subject to be divested only by lawful execution of the power of sale. Coles v. Jamerson, 112 Va. 311, 71 S.E. 618, 1911 Va. LEXIS 85 (1911). Or a power coupled with an interest.  In a case where a will directed executors to sell land, it was held that the will vested in the executors an interest and a trust, which survived them, and it was the duty of the administrator c.t.a. to take possession of the land and to account for the rents and profits until sold. Mosby's Adm'r v. Mosby's Adm'r, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 584, 1853 Va. LEXIS 9 (1853). Upon this question of the construction of a will, as to when the power given the executors is not a mere naked one, but one that is coupled with an interest, see Elys v. Wynne, 63 Va. (22 Gratt.) 224, 1872 Va. LEXIS 15 (1872); Mills v. Mills' Ex'rs, 69 Va. (28 Gratt.) 442, 1877 Va. LEXIS 80 (1877). Administrator c.t.a. May make sale.  A testator, being about to leave the country, made his will, and devised that in case of his death, or if he should not be heard of for ten years, his land should be sold for the best price that could be got, as was directed by a letter of attorney to J. H. of the same date with the will, and the proceeds divided among the testators four sisters. It was held that the administrator with the will annexed had po wer to sell the land, under this section. Broadus v. Rosson, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 12, 1831 Va. LEXIS 31 (1831). Administrator without the will annexed.  If one dies leaving a will, and the executor fails to qualify, and another is appointed administrator only on his estate, without the will annexed, the ad ministrator does not succeed to the powers of the executor with reference to the sale of the estate, and the validity of the appointment for any purpose may well be doubted.

The case annotated below was decided under prior law. Law will not conclusively pres ume payment.  Where an executor is insolvent when he qualifies and remains so through the entire administration of his testators estate the law will not conclusively presum e that his debt to the estate is paid and is cash in his hands to be disbursed. Glens Falls Indem. Co. v. Wall, 163 Va. 635, 177 S.E. 901, 1934 Va. LEXIS 203 (1934). The bond of an administrator or executor covers a personal debt owed by the principal to the decedent only to the extent that it binds him to a faithful performance of his duties as administrator; that is, he must exercise due diligence and honesty in the collection of debts, including a debt owed by himself, and the sureties are liable for his failure to do so. But where it appears that the debtor-representative is unable to pay, the debt becomes uncollectible, and the sureties on the bond are not liable therefor. Glens Falls Indem. Co. v. Wall, 163 Va. 635, 177 S.E. 901, 1934 Va. LEXIS 2 03 (1934).

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. History of section.  This statute has been in force in the same form (except for the insertion of the words or private sale in 1966) since the Code of 1849, § 16, page 543, and was theretofore the same in substance back to 1 Revised Code of 1819, § 47, page 387. Herelick v. Southern Dry Goods &amp; Notion Co., 139 Va. 121, 123 S.E. 529, 1924 Va. LEXIS 90 (1924). General authority to sell.  The statutory authority of the personal representative to sell assets of the estate is confined to this section and §§ 64.1-153 and 64.1-155. Virginia Trust Co. v. Evans, 193 Va. 425, 69 S.E.2d 409, 1952 Va. LEXIS 151 (1952). This section is broad enough to authorize the sale of stocks, bonds and other property, as are likely to be impaired in value by keeping. Any further righ t to sell arises from the duty of the personal representative to protect and conserve the assets of the estate, or to make correct distribution to the legatees or distributees. Virginia Trust Co. v. Evans, 193 Va. 425, 69 S.E.2d 409, 1952 Va. LEXIS 151 ( 1952). Power to sell stocks.  So long as executors, in good faith and in exercise of reasonable discretion, consider it to the best interest of the estate to retain stocks, though of a somewha t speculative character, they enjoy no right to sell (there being no testamentary direction nor any actual necessity to sell). Pritchett v. First Nat'l Bank, 195 Va. 406, 78 S.E.2d 650, 1953 Va. LEXIS 212 (1953). Determining perishability of goods.  In determining which of the goods and chattels of a testator, or intestate, shall be sold as likely to be impaired in value by keeping, some latitude of d iscretion must be allowed to the executor or administrator; and his conduct appearing to be fair, and, probably, proceeding from a good intention, ought to be sanctioned by a court of equity. M'Call v. Peachy's Adm'r, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 288, 1812 Va. LEXIS 51 (1812). Security need not be bond.  Under this section if the length of credit is reasonable the circumstance that the security taken was not a bond is immaterial, certainly in equity, if th e security taken was regarded as good security at the time, by the personal representative acting in good faith and with reasonable diligencethat is, acting in the exercise of a fair discretion and in the same manner that a reasonably prudent business man would have acted under the same circumstances had the subject been his own property. Herelick v. Southern Dry Goods &amp; Notion Co., 139 Va. 121, 123 S.E. 529, 1924 Va. LEXIS 90 (1924). Executor is ch argeable for failure to take security.  An administrator selling chattels of his decedent, taking neither cash nor security for the purchase money, is chargeable therewith. Clark v. Wells' Adm'r, 47 Va. (6 Gratt.) 475, 1850 Va. LEXIS 1 (1850). Improper surety.  A partner in trade of the buyer is not such a person as the executor or administrator can properly take as surety on a note given for the price of the property so ld. Southall's Adm'r v. Taylor, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 269, 1858 Va. LEXIS 50 (1858). Devastavit in giving credit.  An administrator sold the stock of goods and store fixtures of his decedent for a sum, terms cash. The purchaser paid part cash and told the administrator he coul d not pay the rest but that a bank had agreed to loan him the remaining amount on condition that the administrator would deposit the same in the bank and allow it to remain there for thirty days. The judge before whom the administrator qualified was a di rector in this bank and solicited him to make this deposit. The administrator had never heard any rumors to the effect that the bank was not financially sound, though there were such rumors. It was held that under this section the administrator was not g uilty of a devastavit in giving the credit he gave the purchaser in this manner for the balance. Herelick v. Southern Dry Goods &amp; Notion Co., 139 Va. 121, 123 S.E. 529, 1924 Va. LEXIS 90 (1924). Personalty is primary fund for payment of debts.  The plain interpretation of this section is that the personal estate of a decedent is the natural and primary fund for the payment of his debts and legacies, and, as a general rule, must be first exhausted before the real estate can be made liable; and the personal estate will not be exonerated in charging the real estate, even when there is a specific lien for a debt on the real estate, unless there are express words or a plain intent in the will to make such exoneration.

Provisions of this section are mandatory; they cannot be changed or disregarded by the c ourt. Trevillian v. Guerrant, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 525, 1879 Va. LEXIS 19 (1879); Deering &amp; Co. v.

They are binding upon the testator.  Wills must conform to this section as to the order in which personalty shall be applied in the payment of a decedents debts; and it is beyond the power of a t estator to affect the legal order of payment by a direction in his will. Deering &amp; Co. v. Kerfoot, 89 Va. 491, 16 S.E. 671, 1892 Va. LEXIS 124 (1892). And upon the personal representative.  It is the duty of a personal representative to pay the debts of the decedent in their order of priority as prescribed by law, and if he pays an inferior debt, lea ving a debt of a preferred class unpaid, the payment constitutes a devastavit in case of a deficiency of assets. Mayo v. Bentley, 8 Va. (4 Call) 528, 1800 Va. LEXIS 53 (1800); Nimmo's Ex'r v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 57, 1809 Va. LEXIS 28 (1809 ); McCormick v. Wright, 79 Va. 524, 1884 Va.

Funeral expenses and costs of administration have priority.  This section in effect declares that no part of a decedents estate shall be applied to his debts until the costs of administration of his estate and his funer al expenses have been paid. Hall v. Stewart, 135 Va. 384, 116 S.E. 469, 1923 Va. LEXIS 21 (1923). Executors and administrators ought to be allowed all reasonable charges and disbursement s for the benefit of the estate they represent, and a reasonable recompense for their personal trouble, in preference to the claim of any creditor of the decedent. Nimmo's Ex'r v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 57, 1809 Va. LEXIS 28 (1809). Fees paid counsel.  An executor or administrator ought to be credited in his administration account for fees paid to counsel, notwithstanding those fees were more than the law allowe d. Lindsay v. Howerton, 12 Va. (2 Hen. &amp; M.) 9, 1807 Va. LEXIS 57 (1807). Claim of State against estate of defaulting officer.  The fourth clause of this section (see now subdivision 6), referring to taxes and levies assessed on a decedent prior to his death does not apply to the claim of the State against the estate of a deceased defaulting sheriff for taxes collected and unaccounted for by him. Spilman v. Payne, 84 Va. 435, 4 S.E. 749, 1888 Va. LEXIS 93 (1888). Subdivision preferring fiduciary debts was only prospective in its operation, and will n ot authorize the placing of decedents debts as trustee in the preferred class, where the decedent died before the passage of the act though the estate is not distributed until afterwards. Price's Ex'r v. Harrison's Ex'r, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 114, 1878 Va. LEXIS 32 (1878). It accords priority only when fiduciary has qualified.  The wards of a guardian de son tort are not entitled, under this section, to any priority over the general creditors of such guardian in the distribution of his p ersonal estate after his death. The language of this section plainly accords priority only where there has been a qualification, and that qualification has been in this State, and the section cannot be extended by construction. Watts v. Newberry, 107 Va. 233, 57 S.E. 657, 1907 Va. LEXIS 31 (1907). Term trustee must be understood in the restricted sense of an express trustee, a s distinguished from trustee in a general sense, by construction or implication of law. But a trustee de facto, by qualifying, becomes an express trustee, and liable as such for the amount which he owed the estate while acting as trustee de facto, and sh ould have paid to himself. Brown v. Lambert, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 256, 1880 Va. LEXIS 39 (1880). It does not include a construc tive trustee.  When a commissioner received the proceeds of the sale of an infants lands under such circumstances as to make him a constructive or de facto trustee for the i nfant, the claim for these funds does not, upon his death, become a preferred debt under this section, as the statute does not contemplate a preference in favor of the debts of constructive trustees. Pope v. Prince, 105 Va. 209, 52 S.E. 1009, 1906 Va. LE XIS 26 (1906). Character of debt is not changed by giving bond.  B was the guardian of J, and upon Js coming of age had a settlement with J of his account as guardian, and being found indebted on the account, executed bonds , for the amount of the balance due. B paid the interest during his life, and a part of the principal, and was up to the war able to pay the whole. It was held that the giving and taking of these bonds was not a novation of the debt, but the debt due fro m B to J continued to be a fiduciary debt, and was entitled to rank as such in the administration of Bs estate. Smith v. Blackwell, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 291, 1879 Va. LEXIS 5 (1879) (see also Hamlins Admr v. Atkinson, 27 Va. (6 Rand.) 574 (1828 ); Yerby v. Lynch, 44 Va. (3 Gratt.) 460 (1847)). Fi duciary obligation has priority over partnership debts.  Where a deceased partners separate assets are insufficient to pay all his debts, those due by him in a fiduciary capacity are to be paid before firm debts. Ro binson v. Allen, 85 Va. 721, 8 S.E. 835, 1889 Va. LEXIS 85 (1889). Debt attributable to decedents estate.  The estate was liable to pay the mortgage debt based on two questions: (1) whether the decedent had a personal obligation to pay the debt; and (2) whether the mor tgage debt was secured by real property owned by the decedent upon his death. The answer to the first question was that the decedent was personally and solely liable for the note that he signed, and therefore, the mortgage debt was a debt of his estate. In answer to the second question, the mortgage debt was not secured by real property owned by the decedent upon his death. The decedents ownership interest did not survive his death. The spouses owned the property as tenants by the entirety with the right of survivorship. Therefore, the property passed to the surviving spouse by operation of law and was not part of the estate. Dolby v. Dolby, 280 Va. 132, 694 S.E.2d 635, 2010 Va. LEXIS 69 (2010). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Prio rity of claims for elective share and exempt property.  Estate and a surety company were ordered to pay claims by the wife of a decedent under §§ 64.1-151.1 and 64.1-151.2, as the executor breached her duties by paying claims against the estate other than death taxes and administrative costs prior to paying the wifes claims, as the wifes claims had priority under § 64.1-157. Hill v. Clarke, 71 Va. Cir. 377, 2006 Va. Cir. LEXIS 260 (Hopewell Aug. 16, 2 006).

Repres entative may not prefer one creditor over another.  The representatives right to prefer one creditor over another is generally abolished and all debts of the same class are made payable pro rata in case of defi ciency of assets. Scott v. Cheatham, 78 Va. 82, 1883 Va. LEXIS 13 (1883). He must take notice of judgments.  An executor was required at his peril, to take notice of a judgment against his testator, and if he exhausts the assets by paying inferior debts (now within 12 mo nths of his qualification), he must satisfy such judgment de bonis propriis.

Debts waiving homestead exemptions.  After the exempted property has been set apart, the residue shall be applied towards paying all the decedents debts ratably, unless there be some entitled to priority under § 64.1-157, and after the residue has been exhausted the exempted property may be subjected to pay such portions of the homestead-waived debts as remain unpaid.

Unless a co ntrary intent is clearly set out in the will or in a transfer on death deed, (i) real or personal property that is the subject of a specific devise or bequest in the will or (ii) real property subject to a transfer on death deed passes, subject to any mo rtgage, pledge, security interest, or other lien existing at the date of death of the testator, without the right of exoneration. A general directive in the will to pay debts shall not be evidence of a contrary intent that the mortgage, pledge, security interest, or other lien be exonerated prior to passing to the legatee. B. The persona l representative may give written notice to the creditor holding any debt to which subsection A applies that there is no right of exoneration for such debt pursuant to this section. Such notice shall include a copy of this section. Any such notice shall be sent by certified mail (i) to the address the creditor last provided to the debtor as the address to which notices to the creditor are to be sent; (ii) if the personal representative cannot reasonably determine the address to which notices to the cred itor are to be sent, to the address the creditor last provided to the debtor as the address at which payments to the creditor are to be made; or (iii) if the personal representative cannot reasonably determine either the address to which notices to the c reditor are to be sent or at which payments to the creditor are to be made, to (a) the address of the creditors registered agent on file with the Virginia State Corporation Commission or (b) if there is no such registered agent on file, to the credit ors last known address. The creditor holding such debt may file a claim for such debt with the commissioner of accounts pursuant to § 64.2-552 on or before the later of one year after the qualification of the personal representative of the deceden ts estate or six months after the personal representative gives such written notice to the creditor. Once the personal representative has given notice to the creditor as provided in this section, unless the creditor files a timely claim against the e state as set forth in this subsection, the liability of a personal representative or his surety for such debt shall not exceed the assets of the decedent remaining in the possession of the personal representative and available for application to the debt pursuant to § 64.2-528 at the time the creditor presents a demand for payment of such debt to the personal representative. Nothing in this section shall affect either the liability of the estate for such debt to the extent of the decedents assets remaining at the time a claim is filed or the liability of the beneficiaries that receive the decedents assets to the extent of such receipt.In the event that any such claim is timely filed with the commissioner of accounts, the personal representat ive shall give the specific beneficiary receiving such real or personal property written notice, within 90 days after such claim is filed, to obtain from the creditor the release of the estate from such claim. The notice to a beneficiary may be made to t he personal representative of a deceased beneficiary whose estate is a beneficiary, an attorney-in-fact for a beneficiary, a guardian or conservator of an incapacitated beneficiary, a committee of a convict or insane beneficiary, or the duly qualified gu ardian of a minor or, if none exists, a custodial parent of a minor. If the estate has not been released from such claim after the later of 180 days from such notice or one year from qualification, the personal representative may (a) sell the real or per sonal property that is the subject of a specific devise or bequest and that is also subject to the claim, (b) apply the proceeds of sale to the satisfaction of the claim, and (c) distribute any excess proceeds from such sale of the specific beneficiary o f such property. If the proceeds of such sale are insufficient to satisfy the debt in full, the deficiency shall remain a debt of the estate to be satisfied from the other assets of the estate in accordance with applicable law. If such real property is s ubject to a transfer on death deed and is also subject to the claim, the personal representative may proceed as provided in § 64.2-634 to enforce the liability for such claim against such property. C. Subsection A shall not apply to any mortgage, pledge, security interest, or other lien existing at the date of death of the testator against any specifically devised or bequeathed real or personal property, or any real property subject to a transfer on death deed, that was granted by an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for the testator while the testator was incapacitated. For the purposes of this section, (i) no adjudication of the testators incapacity is necessary, (ii) the ac ts of an agent within the authority of a durable power of attorney are rebuttably presumed to be for an incapacitated testator, and (iii) an incapacitated testator is one who is impaired by reason of mental illness, intellectual disability, physical illn ess or disability, chronic use of drugs, chronic intoxication, or other cause creating a lack of sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible decisions. This subsection shall not apply (a) if the mortgage, pledge, security inte rest, or other lien granted by the agent on the specific property is thereafter ratified by the testator while he is not incapacitated or (b) if the durable power of attorney was limited to one or more specific purposes and was not general in nature. D. Subsection A shall not apply to any mortgage, pledge, security interest, or other lien existing at the date of the death of the testator against any specific devise or bequest of any real or personal property, or any real property subject to a transfer on death dee d, that was granted by a conservator, guardian, or committee of the testator. This subsection shall not apply if, after the mortgage, pledge, security interest, or other lien granted by the conservator, guardian, or committee, there is an adjudication th at the testators disability has ceased and the testator survives that adjudication by at least one year. E. Nothing in this section shall affect the priority of a secured debt with respect to the collateral securing such debt.

The cases below were decided under prior law. Purpose.  The object of this section was to do away with the distinction between debts chargeable on decedents lands at common law and simple contract debts, and not to disarrange the order of liability of the assets of a decedents estate, which had been firmly established by a long line of adjudication. McCandlish v. Keen, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 615, 1857 Va. LEXIS 23 (1857); Peirce v. Graham, 85 Va. 227, 7 S.E. 189, 1888 Va. LEXIS 32 (1888); Frasier v. Littleton, 100 Va. 9, 40 S.E. 108, 1901 Va. LEXIS 2 (1901). Personal estate pr imary fund for payment of debts.  The Supreme Court has held repeatedly since this section, making real estate of a decedent assets for the payment of his debts, went into effect that personal est ate is the primary fund for the payment of debts. Duerson's Adm'r v. Alsop, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 229, 1876 Va. LEXIS 19 (1876); Lewis v. Overby's Adm'r, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 601, 1879 Va. LEXIS 24 (1879); Ryan's Adm'r v. McLeod, 73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 367, 1879 Va. LEXIS 73 (1879); Edmunds v. Scott, 78 Va. 720, 1884 Va. LEXIS 45 (1884). This section recognizes the common-law right of the ancestor to indicate the charges he wishes to make upon the land for such of his debts as he may prefer, but i t does not alter or enlarge the common-law liability of the personalty of a decedent as the primary fund for the payment of his debts, or give to a testator the right to prefer his creditors out of his personal assets, as it does in the case of realty. D eering &amp; Co. v. Kerfoot, 89 Va. 491, 16 S.E. 671, 1892 Va. LEXIS 124 (1892). Hence, there can be no resort to decedents real estate to pay his debts until his personalty has been exhausted. When that has been exhausted, whether by devastavit or distribution, the real estate in the hands of his heirs may be subjected. Scott v. Ashlin, 86 Va. 581, 10 S.E. 751, 1890 Va. LEXIS 15 (1890). This section makes real estate assets merely, to be disposed of as personal assets; and a creditor has no lien upon the assets. He has a right to have the whole applied in a due course of administration. Peirce v. Graham, 85 Va. 227, 7 S.E. 189, 1888 Va. LEXIS 32 (1888). But need not be distributed as p ersonalty.  Real assets often come to the hands of the personal representative and it is his duty when he receives such to pay the same to such persons as are entitled theret o. They are, however, assets in his hands, the same as personal assets for the payment of the decedents debts and need not be distributed as personalty. Johnson v. Coleman, 1 Va. L. Reg. 191 (1915). Under this section the words all lawful demands against his estate mean charges or lawful demands against the decedent and not those incurred as expenses in the administration of the estate. United States v. Willcox, 73 F.2d 781, 1934 U.S. App. LEXIS 2813 (4th Cir. 1934). Debts need not be reduced to judgment.  Under this section the real estate of a decedent is an asset for the payment of his debts regardless of whether such debts have been reduced to judgment. Morrison v. Morrison, 177 Va. 417, 14 S.E.2d 322, 1941 Va. LEXIS 228 (1941). This section does not apply to real estate on which debtor has created a lien.  This section does not apply, except subject to the encumbrance, to the real estate on which the debtor has created a bona fide lien, which is good against himself . Hence, where the decedent has subjected his whole estate to the payment of his debts, his general creditors must take the real estate under the charge in the will and must take it in the plight and condition in which he held it; and it is equitable ass ets, though the statute would have subjected it to the payment of his debts if there had been no such charge in the will. McCandlish v. Keen, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 615, 1857 Va. LEXIS 23 (1857). This section does not alter the rule that no judgment against the personal representative can bind the heirs, or in any manner affect them. It makes real estate descended or devised (not charged by the will with debts) legal assets in the hands of the heirs and devisees; but there would seem to be the same lack of privity now as before bet ween the personal representatives and the heir or devisee. Peirce v. Graham, 85 Va. 227, 7 S.E. 189, 1888 Va. LEXIS 32 (1888); Brewis v. Lawson, 76 Va. 36, 1881 Va. LEXIS 71 (1881); Daingerfield v. Smith, 83 Va. 81, 1 S.E. 599, 1887 Va. LEXIS 42 (1887). Lack of privity between personal representative and heirs or devisees unaffected.  Under this section there would seem to be lack of privity as before between the personal representatives and the heirs or devisees. The executor is charged as suc h with the administration of the personal assets and such real assets as may be charged with the payment of debts by the will; but otherwise his relations to the land descended or devised remain as heretofore; that is, as such he has no concern with them whatever. Peirce v. Graham, 85 Va. 227, 7 S.E. 189, 1888 Va. LEXIS 32 (1888); Brewis v. Lawson, 76 Va. 36, 1881 Va. LEXIS 71 (1881); McCandlish v. Keen, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 615, 1857 Va. LEXIS 23 (1857) (see also Scott v. Ashlin, 86 Va. 581, 10 S.E. 751 (1890)). Ex ecutor may not maintain suit against heirs to sell realty.  An executor, who is given no power as to the realty under the will, is not authorized by this section to maintain a suit against the heirs to sell the realty to p ay debts, nor, as next friend to the infant heirs, uniting the widow, to compel the creditors to have the realty sold to pay debts. Peirce v. Graham, 85 Va. 227, 7 S.E. 189, 1888 Va. LEXIS 32 (1888) (see also Tennents Heirs v. Pattons, 33 Va. (6 Leig h) 196 (1835); McCandlish v. Keen, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 615 (1857); Brewis v. Lawson, 76 Va. 36 (1881); Litterall v. Jackson, 80 Va. 64 (1885); Daingerfield v. Smith, 83 Va. 81, 1 S.E. 599 (1887); Beckham v. Duncan, 1 Va. Dec. 694, 9 S.E. 1002 (1889); Catr on v. Bostic, 123 Va. 355, 96 S.E. 845 (1918)). The creditors have their remedy against the heirs to subject the real estate which is ma de assets for the payment of their debts by this section, but the administrator has no such right. Catron v. Bostic, 123 Va. 355, 96 S.E. 845, 1918 Va. LEXIS 37 (1918). And creditors claiming under this section are not included in § 55-96. McCandlish v. K een, 54 Va. (13 Gratt.) 615, 1857 Va. LEXIS 23 (1857). Dower lands exempt as assets.  After exhaustion of decedents personalty, his lands in possession of his heirs or devisees are liable for his debts, but not his land in possession of his wid ow as her dower during her estate therein. Alexander v. Byrd, 85 Va. 690, 8 S.E. 577, 1889 Va. LEXIS 82 (1889). Sufficiency of rents not an issue.  In a suit to subject the lands of a decedent to the payment of his debts, under this section, the sufficiency of the rents to discharge a judgment debt is not an issue. Peatross v. Gray, 181 Va. 847, 27 S.E.2d 203, 1943 Va. LEXIS 233 (1943). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Decedent as a joint tenant.  Surviving joint tenants are neither heirs nor devisees. Since subsequent provisions of the statute indicate that Va. Code Ann. § 64.2-532 applies to real esta te of the decedent held by an heir or a devisee, and this does not encompass property that passes to a surviving joint tenant through the right of survivorship because surviving tenants fall into neither category, it can reasonably be inferred that the l egislature did not intend for § 64.2-532 to apply to abrogate the common law. First Nat'l Bank v. Price, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 674 (Floyd County Sept. 30, 2020). This section did not apply to real estate held in a joint tenancy when the deceased debtor was one of the joint tenants and the complaint was filed after the debt or tenants death. First Nat'l Bank v. Price, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 674 (Floyd County Sept. 30, 2020). At decedents death, her interest in the real estate immediately transferred to the surviving joint tenants by operation of law and when the bank filed its com plaint, almost a year later, the statute did allow for the bank to proceed against all real estate of the decedent. However, all real estate of the decedent no longer included the deceased joint tenants previously held joint interest, as that joint interest had left her estate almost a year earlier.

This section is to be read in connection with §§ 8.01-268, 8.01-269, and the comme ncement of a suit for administration of assets will not carry notice unless the required memorandum of lis pendens has been filed. Easley v. Barksdale, 75 Va. 274, 1881 Va. LEXIS 12 (1881). It was intended by the legislature that lands sold and conveyed by an heir or devisee, a fter report filed, shall be liable in the hands of the purchaser for the debts of the decedent, while lands sold and conveyed pendente lite to a purchaser, without actual notice of the lis pendens, shall not be bound by such lis pendens, unless the provi sions of §§ 8.01-268, 8.01-269 are complied with. Easley v. Barksdale, 75 Va. 274, 1881 Va. LEXIS 12 (1881). Purpose and effect.  The object and effect of this section are twofold: First, to protect the creditor or other person entitled to be paid out of the real estate declared to be assets , by making the heir or devisee personally liable for the value, with interest, of such estate when sold and conveyed of him; second, to protect a bona fide purchaser of such estate under a conveyance made before the commencement of suit for the administ ration of the assets, or the filing of any such report as is described. Easley v. Barksdale, 75 Va. 274, 1881 Va. LEXIS 12 (1881). Creditor has quasi lien.  The provision that no alienation of estate within one year after death of decedent shall be valid gives the creditor a quasi lien on the realty of the decedent fo r a period of one year. Heeke v. Allan, 127 Va. 65, 102 S.E. 655, 1920 Va. LEXIS 32 (1920). It is not affected by partition in kin d.  Under this section a partition in kind, in pais, among the parties could not defeat the valid lien of the creditors, nor could the lien be affected by a partition in kind ordered by the court. Lowry v. Noell, 177 Va. 238, 13 S.E.2d 312, 1941 Va. LEXIS 211 (1941). Effect of conveyance within one year as between the parties thereto.  Although the heir or devisee cannot within one year make a valid conveyance, as against creditors of the decedent, he can make a conveyance which is valid as betw een the parties, and the alienee can, after the expiration of the year, transfer title to a bona fide purchaser free from the claim of the decedents creditors, if no suit is pending and no report of debts has been filed.

B. Any sale an d conveyance of real estate that is an asset for the payment of a decedents debts or lawful demands against his estate pursuant to § 64.2-532 made within one year after the death of the decedent is valid against creditors of such decedent, if such real estate is sold and conveyed pursuant to a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction in an action for partition, sale of lands of persons under a disability, or other judicial sale, and the net proceeds of sale are paid to a special commissioner a ppointed by the court. C. The special commissioner shall hold the net proceeds paid to him in lieu of the real estate subject to the claims of the decedents creditors in the same manner and to the same extent as such real estate would have been if not sold until at least one year after the death of the decedent. If no claim has been asserted against the net proceeds, the special commissioner shall distribute the net proceeds to those creditors entitled thereto in proportion to their interest in the real estate upon (i) the expiration o f the one-year period or (ii) at any time within the one-year period upon posting bond with such surety as may be prescribed by the court to secure any claims against the real estate or net proceeds. D. A purchaser of any real estate sold and conveyed in accordance with this section is not required to see to the application of the purchase money. E. The special commissioner who receives and holds such net proceeds or refunding bond shall give such bond as required by the court appointing him. History History.

Except as p rovided in subsection B, whenever it appears upon any settlement of accounts or in any other appropriate action or proceeding that an executor, administrator, curator, trustee, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity has paid an estate tax levied or assessed under the provisions of any estate tax law of the Commonwealth, any other state, or the United States, upon or with respect to any property required to be included in the gross estate of a decedent under the provisions of any such law, the am ount of the tax so paid, together with any interest and penalty required by the taxing authority to be paid, shall be prorated among the persons interested in the estate to whom such property is or may be transferred or to whom any benefit accrues. Such apportionment shall be made in the proportion that the value of the property, interest, or benefit of each such person bears to the total value of the property, interests, and benefits received by all such persons interested in the estate. However, in ma king such proration each person shall have the benefit of any exemptions, deductions, and exclusions allowed by law in respect of the person or the property passing to him, and where a trust is created or other provision is made giving a person an intere st in income, an estate for years, an estate for life, or any other temporary interest or estate in any property or fund, the tax on such temporary interest or estate shall be charged against and paid out of the corpus of such property or fund without ap portionment between the temporary interests or estates and any remainder interests, and any interest and penalty required by the taxing authority to be paid may be charged against either the temporary interest, estate, or corpus, or partially against the temporary interest, estate, or corpus, as determined by the fiduciary paying the tax, provided that the determination is made so as to fairly balance all interests in the property or fund. B. The amount of tax paid upon or with respect to property included in the decedents gross estate under § 2044 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or any successor provision relating to certain property for which the marital deduction was previously allow ed, shall be the excess of (i) the total estate tax levied or assessed under the provisions of the estate tax laws of the Commonwealth, any other state, and the United States over (ii) the estate tax that would have been levied or assessed under those pr ovisions if the § 2044 property had not been included in the gross estate. The tax paid upon or with respect to the § 2044 property shall be prorated according to subsection A as if no other estate tax were payable under the laws of the Commonwealt h, any other state, and the United States, and as if the § 2044 property constituted the entire gross estate; but it shall be prorated only among the persons interested in the estate to whom such property is or may be transferred or to whom any benefi t of such property accrues. The tax determined under clause (ii) shall be prorated according to subsection A as if no other estate tax were payable under the laws of the Commonwealth, any other state, and the United States, and as if the § 2044 proper ty were not included in the gross estate. This subsection shall apply only to estates of persons dying on or after July 1, 1986. C.

Purpose.  The Virginia apportionment statute was designed to give to the widow the benefit of any exemptions, deductions and exclusions allowed by federal law. However, § 64.1-165 expressly preserves the right of a testator to designate such part of his assets as he desires to bear the burden of all taxes. Baylor v. National Bank of Commerce, 194 Va. 1, 72 S.E.2d 282, 1952 Va. LEXIS 200 (1952). The Virginia apportionment statutes were designed to give a widow the benefit of any exemptions, deductions and exclusions allowed by federal law, unless the dece dent directs otherwise as provided in § 64.1-165. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). Estate taxes should be equitably apportioned among taxable legatees.  This section is based on the principle that estate taxes should be equitably apportioned among the taxable legatees. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 V a. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). Without an apportionment statute, the burden of estate taxes, unless otherwise directed by the testator, would fall upon the residuary estate, which ordinarily benefits the natural objects of the testators generosity. To correct this apparent inequity, Virginia, along with a number of other states, has enacted an apportionment statute. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). Taxes are paid by fund bearing administration expenses where there is no express designation of the fund to be burdened with the taxes. Testators command, I desire, is implicitly addressed to the executors, and, therefore, where there is no express designation of the fund to be burdened with taxes, there is an implied dire ction that the taxes are to be paid from the fund which bears the burden of debts and administration expenses. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). This section is subsequent in time to the passage of § 64.1-11, and when a later act of the legislature is clear and unambiguous in its terms and deals fully and completely with the subject, if there is any repugnancy between it and an earlier statute the earlier yields to the later expression of the legislative will. Alexandria Nat'l Ba nk v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). Legislature intended to give a surviving spouse the benefit of the marital deduction all owed under the federal estate tax law. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). Thus, statutory share of widow not burdened by federal estate taxes.  See Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). This section is based on the principle that federal estate taxes should be borne by those who receive property which has been included in the taxable estate, and that property which has not been included in determining the tax shall not bear any part of the tax burden. Alexandria Nat'l Bank v. Thomas, 213 Va. 620, 194 S.E.2d 723, 1973 Va. LEXIS 197 (1973). When determining whether a will falls under the apportionment or anti-apportionment statute, the pertinent inquiry is whether the will discloses an intention by the testator that the burden of estate taxes should fall entirely upon the probate estate, contrary to the statutory rule of apportionment. In responding to this query, cou rts apply ordinary rules of construction relating to wills. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). Language of will held to relieve executors from the necessity of complyin g with the apportionment statute.  The trial court correctly ruled that the language of the testators will demonstrated the testators intention to relieve the executors from the necessity o f complying with the requirements of the apportionment statute where the will provided: I desire my just debts and all expenses of the administration of my estate, including such taxes . . . paid as soon after my death as practicable. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). Testator demonstrated intent that charges not be apportioned.  By specifying in will that estate taxes, debts, funeral expenses, and administration costs be paid from the residuary estate, testator demonstrated his intent tha t all these charges be treated in the same manner, thus satisfying the requirements of the anti-apportionment statute. Any estate taxes outstanding after exhaustion of the residuary estate, therefore, should not be apportioned but should be charged gener ally against the probate estate. Stickley v. Stickley, 255 Va. 405, 497 S.E.2d 862, 1998 Va. LEXIS 50 (1998).

Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). Taxes are paid by fund bearing administration expenses where there is no express designation of the fund to be burdened with the taxes. Testators command, I desire, is implicitly addressed to the executors and therefore where there is no express designation of the fund to be burdened with taxes, there is an implied directi on that the taxes are to be paid from the fund which bears the burden of debts and administration expenses. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). When determining whether a will falls under the apportionment or anti-apportionment statute, the pertinent inquiry is whether the will discloses an intention by the testator that the burden of estate taxes should fall entirely upon the probable estate, contrary to the statutory rule of apportionment. In responding to this query, co urts apply ordinary rules of construction relating to wills. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). Precatory words expressing desire, recommendation, or request are uniformly considered imperative when addressed to an executor. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). Language of will held to relieve executors from necessity of complying with apportionment statute.  Trial court correctly ruled that the language of testators will demonstrated the testators intention to relieve the executors from the necessity of comply ing with the requirements of the apportionment statute where the will provided: I desire my just debts and all expenses of the administration of my estate, including such taxes . . . paid as soon after my death as practicable. Lynchburg College v. Central Fid. Bank, 242 Va. 292, 410 S.E.2d 617, 8 Va. Law Rep. 1213, 1991 Va. LEXIS 163 (1991). Intent contrary to statutory rule shown.  Will held to disclose intention that payment of taxes should be made contrary to the statutory rule. Simeone v. Smith, 204 Va. 860, 134 S.E.2d 281, 1964 Va. LEXIS 131 (1964). Testator demonstrated intent that charges not be apportioned.  By specifying in will that estate taxes, debts, funeral expenses, and administration costs be paid from the residuary estate, testator demonstrated his intent tha t all these charges be treated in the same manner, thus satisfying the requirements of the anti-apportionment statute. Any estate taxes outstanding after exhaustion of the residuary estate, therefore, should not be apportioned but should be charged gener ally against the probate estate. Stickley v. Stickley, 255 Va. 405, 497 S.E.2d 862, 1998 Va. LEXIS 50 (1998). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Language contained in both will and pour over trust showed that a testator intended that federal and state estate taxes should be paid by the non-charitable beneficiaries of the pour over trust rather than from the residuary estate prior to its transfer to the trust. Johnson v. Trust Co., 61 Va. Cir. 306, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 153 (Roanoke Co unty Mar. 10, 2003). Where testator did not demonstrate intent regarding apportionment of estate taxes.  Testator did not manifest an intention regarding how the payment of taxes for his estate should be apportioned, and, thus, payment of the estate taxes was to be a pportioned to all beneficiaries under § 64.1-161 based on the principle that estate taxes should be equitably apportioned among the taxable legatees in proportion that the value of the interest each such person bore to the interest received by all suc h persons interested in the estate.

This section is retrospective as to the issuing and return of the execution, as well as the recovery of judgment. Allen v. Cunningham, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 395, 1831 Va. LEXIS 60 (1831). Creditor of decedent may sue.  A creditor of a decedent, who has obtained a decree de bonis testatoris against the executor, on which an execution has issued, and has been returned nulla bona, may maintain an action against the executor, and his sureties on the executorial bond. Kent's Adm'r v. Cloyd's Adm'r, 71 Va. (30 Gratt.) 555, 1878 Va. LEXIS 82 (1878); Braxton v. Winslow, 8 Va. (4 Call) 308, 1791 Va. LEXIS 34 (1791); Meade v. Brooking, 1 7 Va. (3 Munf) 548, 1811 Va. LEXIS 127 (1811); Bush v. Beale, 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 229, 1844 Va. LEXIS 29 (1844). This section applies to creditors by decree, as well as those by judgment. Bush v. Beale , 42 Va. (1 Gratt.) 229, 1844 Va. LEXIS 29 (1844). Administrator de bonis non.  Where an administrator recovers judgment against an administratrix on a debt due plaintiffs intestate, and sues out a fieri facias which is returned nulla bon a, and plaintiff dies and administrator de bonis non is granted, an action of debt lies at the relation of the administrator de bonis non on defendants administration bond, and not at the relation of the representative of plaintiffs administrator . Allen v. Cunningham, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 395, 1831 Va. LEXIS 60 (1831). The administrator de bonis non need not, in order to entitle himself to put the administration bond in suit, bring scire facias or action of debt on the judgment recovered by the first administrator. Allen v. Cunningham, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 395, 1831 Va. LEXIS 60 (1831). Assignee of legatee.  An action cannot be maintained on an executors bond at the relation of an assignee of a legatee of a decree for a legacy, such action only being maintainable at the relation of the person who has the legal right to the debt. Burnett v. Harwell, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 89, 1831 Va. LEXIS 38 (1831). Uniform practice in Virginia permits a legatee to join in one suit, an executor and his surety wherever there is an attempt to discover assets or to surcharge and falsify an ex parte settlement. Koteen v. Bickers, 163 Va. 676, 177 S.E. 904, 1934 Va. LEXIS 208 (1934). Necessity for demand on executor.  Although in the case of a creditor, a demand must be established against an executor before a suit can be brought on the administration bond, yet in the case of a legatee, a suit in equity may be brought upon it in the first instance, because the decree can be made so as to operate against the executor in the first instance, and an account of the assets can be taken at once. Koteen v. Bickers, 163 Va. 676, 177 S. E. 904, 1934 Va. LEXIS 208 (1934). Proof of devastavit may be supplied by an ex parte settlement, for such settlement is pr ima facie evidence of matters there set out. Koteen v. Bickers, 163 Va. 676, 177 S.E. 904, 1934 Va. LEXIS 208 (1934). Return of nulla bona.  A fieri facias on judgment against an administrator was returned no unadministered or unencumbered effects found; this was a return nulla bona, to entitle the plaintiff to an action on the administrators bond. Allen v. Cunningham, 30 Va. (3 Leigh) 395, 1831 Va. LEXIS 60 (1831). Equitable relief against judgment.  Notwithstanding a judgment against administrators, as such, in an action of debt, to which they pleaded payment by the intestate, and a subsequent judgmen t, against them personally, in an action suggesting a devastavit, to which they pleaded no waste, relief in equity was granted them on the grounds that the peculiar and perplexed state of the assets made it difficult, if not impracticable, to ple ad in relation thereto, at law; and that, at the trial of the second action, their principal counsel was absent, and their assistant counsel withdrew from the cause, in consequence whereof they were wholly undefended, and a verdict, perhaps contrary to j ustice, was obtained against them, without any negligence or default on their part. Pendleton's Adm'rs v. Stuart, 20 Va. (6 Munf) 377, 1819 Va. LEXIS 28 (1819). For unexpected depreciation of p roperty.  Where an executor confesses judgments, and gives forthcoming bonds, for debts due by his testator, under the belief that the assets of the estate are amply suffic ient to pay all claims against it, but afterwards, by an unexpected depreciation of property, the amount of assets proves inadequate, the executor will be relieved in equity.

A commissio ner of accounts who has for settlement the accounts of a personal representative of a decedent shall, when requested to so do by a personal representative or any creditor, legatee, or distributee of a decedent, or may at any other time determined by the commissioner of accounts, even though no accounting is pending, conduct a hearing for receiving proof of debts and demands against the decedent or the decedents estate. The commissioner of accounts shall publish notice of the hearing at least 10 days before the date set for the hearing in a newspaper published or having general circulation in the jurisdiction where the personal representative qualified. and shall also post a notice of the time and place of the hearing at the front door of the courth ouse of the court of the jurisdiction where the personal representative qualified. The commissioner of accounts may adjourn the hearing from time to time as necessary. B. The persona l representative shall give written notice by personal service or by regular, certified, or registered mail at least 10 days before the date set for the hearing to any claimant of a disputed claim that is known to the personal representative at the last address of the claimant known to the personal representative. The notice shall inform the claimant of his right to attend the hearing and present his case, his right to obtain another hearing date if the commissioner of accounts finds the initial date in appropriate, and the fact that the claimant will be bound by any adverse ruling.

Personal representative has the right to waive a refunding bond, but the intention to do so must be very clear. He does not waive bond by assenting to a specific legacy. Nelson's Adm'r v. Cornwell, 52 Va. (11 Gratt.) 724, 1854 Va. LEXIS 53 (1854). But wa iver may render him personally liable to creditors.  Where the assets in the hands of an executor are insufficient to pay all the debts of the estate and he makes distribution of the estate without requiring a refun ding bond from the legatees or distributees, he is personally liable to creditors for the funds so improperly distributed. Lewis v. Overby's Adm'r, 72 Va. (31 Gratt.) 601, 1879 Va. LEXIS 24 (1879); Morrison v. Lavell, 81 Va. 519, 1886 Va. LEXIS 120 (1886 ). Where there is insufficient personal estate to pay all debts, the administrator, although he may have no actual notice of their existence, takes the risk of perso nal liability for payment of debts if he distributes the personal estate before awaiting the 12 (now six) months allowed by statute for presentation of debts and before then obtaining protection from personal liability therefor by refunding bonds, or bef ore such protection is afforded him by order of court under § 64.1-179, unless the creditors laches or other conduct thereafter should bar the demand. Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919); Herelick v. Southern Dry Goo ds &amp; Notion Co., 139 Va. 121, 123 S.E. 529, 1924 Va. LEXIS 90 (1924). Where there are creditors, and where the administrator has not, but merely expects to have in hand, or expects that there will be from some other source, sufficie nt assets to pay all debts, and, from any cause whatever, other than vis major, there is not such sufficiency of assets, the rule in the above paragraph is applicable. Herelick v. Southern Dry Goods &amp; Notion Co., 139 Va. 121, 123 S.E. 529, 1924 Va. LEXIS 90 (1924). Section sets time when legacies and interest payable.  Pursuant to this section, a general legacy payable in no special manner, where the will is silent as to time of payment and as to when interest is to begin to run , is not payable until one year (now six months) after the executors qualification, and does not bear interest until payable. Moorman v. Crockett, 90 Va. 185, 17 S.E. 875, 1893 Va. LEXIS 33 (1893) (see Rosenberger v. Rosenberger, 184 Va. 1024, 37 S.E .2d 55 (1946)). Representative may distribute estate as soon as all debts are paid.  It is the duty of an administrator to distribute the personal estate after the payment of debts. It is also right so to do. It is out of regard for creditors only that administrators cannot be compelled to make distribution of the estate within the year (now six months) from their qualification. So that where there are no creditors there is nothing in our statute law to forbid an administrator from distri buting the personal estate within the year (now six months). And the true policy of the law, in the absence of such a statute, would seem to favor a reasonably prompt distribution amongst those entitled under the statute of distributions, rather than a h olding of the estate by the fiduciary for the year (now six months). Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919). Distribution before will discovered.  If an administrator acts with reasonable diligence to ascertain whether a will exists, and when acting with reasonable prudence in that regard, does not think and has no reasonable ground to think that a will exists, he may safely distribute the estate, so far as persons taking under a then unknown and unrecorded will are concerned, whether it be within the year (now six months) of, or after the expiration of the year (now six months) from, the qualification. Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-555"><akn:num>§ 64.2-555</akn:num><akn:heading>When fiduciaries are protected by refunding bonds</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If any personal representative pays any legacy made in the will or distributes any of the estate of the decedent and a proper refunding bond for what is so paid or dist ributed, with sufficient surety at the time it was made, is filed and recorded pursuant to § 64.2-554, such personal representative shall not be personally liable for any debt or demand against the decedent, whether it be of record or not, unless, wit hin six months from his qualification or before such payment or distribution, he had notice of such debt or demand. However, if any creditor of the decedent establishes a debt or demand against the decedents estate by judgment therefor or by confirma tion of a report of the commissioner of accounts that allows the debt or demand, a suit may be maintained on such refunding bond, in the name of the obligee or his personal representative, for the benefit of such creditor, and a recovery shall be had the reon to the same extent that would have been had if such obligee or his personal representative had satisfied such debt or demand.

When a repo rt of the accounts of any personal representative and of the debts and demands against the decedents estate has been filed in the office of a clerk of a court, whether under §§ 64.2-550 and 64.2-551 or in a civil action, the court, after six mo nths from the qualification of the personal representative, may, on motion of the personal representative, or a successor or substitute personal representative, or on motion of a legatee or distributee of the decedent, enter an order for the creditors an d all other persons interested in the estate of the decedent to show cause on the day named in the order against the payment and delivery of the estate of the decedent to his legatees or distributees. A copy of the order shall be published once a week fo r two successive weeks, in one or more newspapers, as the court directs; the costs of such publication shall be paid by the petitioner or applicant. On or after the day named in the order, the court may order the payment and delivery to the legatees or d istributees of the whole or a part of the money and other estate not before distributed, with or without a refunding bond, as it prescribes. However, every legatee or distributee to whom any such payment or delivery is made, and his representatives, may, in a suit brought against him within five years after such payment or delivery is made, be adjudged to refund a due proportion of any claims enforceable against the decedent or his estate that have been finally allowed by the commissioner of accounts or the court, or that were not presented to the commissioner of accounts, and the costs of the recovery of such claim. In the event any claim becomes known to the fiduciary after the notice for debts and demands but prior to the entry of an order of distri bution, the claimant, if the claim is disputed, shall be given notice in the form provided in § 64.2-550 and the order of distribution shall not be entered until after expiration of 10 days from the giving of such notice. If the claimant, within such 10-day period, indicates his desire to pursue the claim, the commissioner of accounts shall schedule a date for hearing the claim and for reporting thereon if action thereon is contemplated under § 64.2-550. B. Any persona l representative who has in good faith complied with the provisions of this section and has, in compliance with or, as subsequently approved by, the order of the court, paid and delivered the money or other estate in his possession to any party that the court has adjudged entitled thereto shall not be liable for any demands of creditors and all other persons. C. Any persona l representative who has in good faith complied with the provisions of this section and has, in compliance with, or as subsequently approved by, the order of the court, paid and delivered the money or other estate in his possession to any party that the court has adjudged entitled thereto, even if such distribution shall be prior to the expiration of the period of one year provided in § 64.2-302, Article 1.1 (§ 64.2-308.1 et seq.) of Chapter 3, or § 64.2-313, 64.2-448, or 64.2-457, shall not be liable for any demands of spouses, persons seeking to impeach the will or establish another will, or purchasers of real estate from the personal representative, provided that the personal representative has contacted any surviving spouse known to it hav ing rights of renunciation and ascertained that the surviving spouse had no plan to renounce the will, such intent to be stated in writing in the case of renunciation under § 64.2-302 or Article 1.1 (§ 64.2-308.1 et seq.) of Chapter 3, as applicabl e, and that the personal representative has not been notified in writing of any persons intent to impeach the will or establish a later will in the case of persons claiming under § 64.2-448 or 64.2-457 or under a later will. D. In the case of such distribution prior to the expiration of such one-year period, the personal representative shall take refunding bonds, without surety, to the next of kin or legatees to whom distribution is made, to protect against the contingencies specified in this section.

CASE NOTES This section did not apply to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) because it was not a cr editor of the decedents estate. Instead, the IRS was a creditor of the taxpayer, a legatee under the will. United States v. Cameron, 248 Va. 290, 448 S.E.2d 410, 1994 Va. LEXIS 130 (1994) (decided under prior law). Section protects representative against subsequent claims of distributees.  An administrator who has acted in good faith, and complied with every requirement of this chapter, and, in obedience to an order of the court of his appointment, has paid over (without a refunding bond) the funds in his hands to one whom the court has adjudged to be the sole distributee of the estate, will be protected against the demands of those who come in several years thereafter claiming to be entitled to sh are in the distribution of the estate. While this chapter does not expressly mention distributees, the legal effect of compliance therewith is to give protection as fully as though the chapter had so declared in express terms. This chapter is full, ample and complete, and guards and protects every interest as amply as could be done by a formal suit in chancery. Carter v. Skillman, 108 Va. 204, 60 S.E. 775, 1908 Va. LEXIS 26 (1908) (decided under prior law). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Estate never closed and action was available against adminstratrix who was also a legatee of the estate.  Action was available against adminstratrix since she was also legatee of the estate of a decedent and even though the estate funds had been disbursed; an estate w as never closed in Virginia.

Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Legality of this section has never been questioned. Drake v. National Bank of Commerce, 1 68 Va. 230, 190 S.E. 302, 1937 Va. LEXIS 219 (1937). Commitment cannot be attac ked collaterally.  Where the court has general jurisdiction to grant administration to public administrators, the act of the court in committing the estate to the sheriff (now any p erson) cannot be questioned in any collateral proceeding. Hutcheson v. Priddy, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 85, 1855 Va. LEXIS 8 (1855). It is not imperative on the court to grant administration to a distributee after the est ate has been committed to the sheriff (now any person); there is a legal discretion in the court. Hutcheson v. Priddy, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 85, 1855 Va. LEXIS 8 (1855). Notice of transfer.  An estate having been committed to the sheriff (now any person), the court cannot grant the administration to a distributee without notice to the sheriff (now any person) of the application. Hutcheson v. Priddy, 53 Va. (12 Gratt.) 85, 1855 Va. LEXIS 8 (1855). Extent of power and authority.  One of the executors having died and the other having been removed, and the administration with the will annexed having been committed to the sheriff (now any per son), he was authorized as such administrator to execute the power and trust, and is therefore bound to account for the rents and profits. The case, though not within the letter of the statute, is within its spirit and meaning. Mosby's Adm'r v. Mosby's A dm'r, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 584, 1853 Va.

Applicability.  Subsection A of § 55-541.02, which was part of the Uniform Trust Code, had no application to a college, which was not an express inter vivos trust, charitable trust, or noncharitable trust created pursuant to a statute, judgment, or decree. Section 2.2-507.1 did not transform every nonstock charitable corporation in Virginia, or that did business in Virginia, into a trust that was subject to the Uniform Trust Code. Dodge v. Trs. of Randolph-Macon Woman's College, 276 Va. 10, 661 S.E.2d 805, 2008 Va. LEXIS 85 (2008). Nonstock charitable corporation.  Students who had donated money to a college were not beneficiaries of a charitable trust; the college was a nonstock charitable corporation and was not converted into a charitable trust that was subject to subsection B of § 55-541.02.Dodge v. Trs. of Randolph-Macon Woman's College, 276 Va. 10, 661 S.E.2d 805, 2008 Va. LEXIS 85 (2008). Authority of a circuit court.  Although a circuit court could exercise jurisdiction over the supervision or administration of trusts, subsection B of § 55-541.02 did not authorize a circuit court to declare by judicial fiat that a nonstock charitable corporation was a trust. Dodge v. Trs. of Randolph-Macon Woman's College, 276 Va. 10, 661 S.E.2d 805, 2008 Va. LEXIS 85 (2008). Self-settled trust s ineffective to shield assets.  The restriction that a trust can not operate to the prejudice of any existing creditor of the creator of such trust is the self-settled rule and has been consistently interpreted to prevent a self-settled trust from being exempt from the settlor-beneficiarys creditors; a spendthrift trust cannot be created by the beneficiary to shield his own assets from claims of his own creditors. In re Bissell, 255 Bankr. 402, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 1407 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2000). Trust must be used for support and maintenance of beneficiary.  The statutory language protects the corpus of a spendthrift trust, the income of a trust, or both, from the beneficiaries creditors only if the moneys of the trust are to be used for the support and maintenance of the beneficiary.

For article on 2007 and 2008 legislative and judicial developments in the areas of wills, trusts, and estates, see 43 U. Rich. L. Rev. 435 (2008). CASE NOTES Intent.  Uniform Trust Code has not altered the fundamental principles that in construing, enforcing and administrating wills and trusts, the testators or settlors intent prevails over the desires of the beneficiaries, and that intent is to be ascertained by the language the testator or settlor used in creating the will or trust because the Uniform Trust Code has not so altered the law as to permit beneficiaries, after the death of a testator, to defeat the terms of his will that postpone their enjoyment of his bounty, merely because they would rather have their money today than wait. Ladysmith Rescue Squad, Inc. v. Newlin, 280 Va. 195, 694 S.E.2d 604, 2010 Va. LEXIS 71 (2010) (decided under prior law). No-contest clause.  Circuit court did not err when it denied a trustees demurrer and ruled that it was proper for the circuit court to determine whether the trustee acted in conf ormity with the authority granted under the terms of the trust. There was sufficient evidence upon which a court could determine that the trustees decision to find the testators sons in violation of the trusts no contest clause was not motiva ted by a desire to carry out the testators intent or to protect the beneficiaries and was therefore done in bad faith. Rafalko v. Georgiadis, 290 Va. 384, 777 S.E.2d 870, 2015 Va. LEXIS 154 (2015). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Trust provision prevailed.  In a case alleging a mismanagement of irrevocable trusts, a demurrer was sustained on a claim that a trustee breached a duty by failing to file causes of action f or legal malpractice and conversion because the language of the trust provision at issue made it clear that the trustee retained the option of instituting litigation until it was indemnified against all costs and liabilities, and the complaint failed to allege that the trustee was ever indemnified in such a manner. The trust provision prevailed over statutory law. Burton v. Dolph, 89 Va. Cir. 101, 2014 Va. Cir.

Because the charitable trust created by the will was a valid trust with the beneficiary as the designated trustee, a principal beneficiary was not requ ired, the charities maintained an equitable interest in the trust corpus, and a new trustee was to be appointed to oversee the trust.

For related discussion, see 3B M.J. Charitable Trusts, § 7. CASE NOTES Editors note. Most of the cases below were decided under prior comparable provisions. Intention of legislature was to broaden scope of charitable trusts.  When the provisions of former § 26-54 are considered, they lend weight to the view that the General Assembly intended by the act to broaden the scope of charit able trusts and prevent their failure even though they are general and indefinite. Under former similar provisions, trusts which depend upon the discretion and personal confidence of the trustee in their exercise, where he refuses or fails to act, may be enforced by a substituted trustee who is given the power to exercise the discretion and personal confidence which was vested in the original trustee. Moore v. Downham, 166 Va. 77, 184 S.E. 199, 1936 Va. LEXIS 166 (1936). Factors in deter mining general charitable intent.  The background of the testator, his interest and spirit in community projects, his education and business acumen, may all be considered in determining his general charitable intent, unless the same is foreclosed by the precise language of the will. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963). Limiting uses by words none other does not foreclose consideration of such intent.  Where the testator devised and bequeathed his estate to his executors to be held by them for the following uses and purposes and none other, use of the wo rds none other does not foreclose any consideration of general charitable intent. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963) (decided under prior law). The fact that the gift is for an indefinite number of persons is characteristic of a charitable or public trust. McClure v. Carter, 202 Va. 191, 116 S.E.2d 260, 1960 Va. LEXIS 205 (1960). Charitable trust upheld.  A trust for indigent widows and maiden ladies was a charitable trust notwithstanding a suggestion in the will which created the trust as to who the benefi ciaries might be. McClure v. Carter, 202 Va. 191, 116 S.E.2d 260, 1960 Va. LEXIS 205 (1960). Trust held not to show charitable intent.  Attempted trust for school children was held to show not charitable but merely benevolent intent creating private express trust which court was not empowered by t he predecessor statute to transform into charitable trust to evade rule against perpetuities. Shenandoah Valley Nat'l Bank v. Taylor, 192 Va. 135, 63 S.E.2d 786, 1951 Va. LEXIS 162 (1951) (commented on in 9 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 310 (1952)). High sch ool converted to residential treatment center.  The trustees of a charitable trust establishing a Home and School of Arts and Trades for Orphan Boys had the authority, under the doctrine of cy pres, to cease the operations of the high school created under the trust, and to commence the operation of a residential treatment center directed toward aiding children with educational, emotional, behavioral, or social problems.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Creation of charitable trust.  Entirety of decedents estate was within the residuary estate as certain devises and bequests in the decedents will failed when the designated beneficiary predeceased the decedent and, thus, did not share in the residuary estate as contemplated by the will. Because the charitable trust created by the will was a valid trust with the beneficiary as the designated trustee, a principal beneficiary was not requ ired, the charities maintained an equitable interest in the trust corpus, and a new trustee was to be appointed to oversee the trust.

Funds from the trust may be applied to any outstanding expenses of the trust and for burial or other postdeath expenditures for animal beneficiaries as provided for in the instrument creating the trust. B. The instrum ent creating the trust shall be liberally construed to bring the transfer within the scope of trusts governed by this section, to presume against the merely precatory or honorary nature of the disposition, and to carry out the general intent of the trans feror. Extrinsic evidence is admissible in determining the transferors intent. C. A trust aut horized by this section may be enforced by a person appointed in the terms of the trust or, if no person is so appointed, by a person appointed by the court. A person having an interest in the welfare of the animal may request the court to appoint a pers on to enforce the trust or to remove a person appointed. The appointed person shall have the rights of a trust beneficiary for the purpose of enforcing the trust, including receiving accountings, notices, and other information from the trustee and provid ing consents. Reasonable compensation for a person appointed by the court may be paid from the assets of the trust. D. Except as o rdered by a court or required by the trust instrument, no filing, report, registration, periodic accounting, separate maintenance of funds, appointment, or surety bond shall be required by reason of the existence of the fiduciary relationship of the trus tee. E. Property of a trust authorized by this section may be applied only to its intended use, except to the extent the court determines that the value of the trust property exceeds the amount required for the intended use. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of the trust, property not required for the intended use shall be distributed to the settlor, if then living. If the settlor is deceased, such property shall be distributed pursuant to the residuary clause of the settlors will if the trust for the animal w as created in a preresiduary clause in the will or pursuant to the residuary provisions of the inter vivos trust if the trust for the animal was created in a preresiduary clause in the trust instrument; otherwise, such property shall be distributed to th e settlors successors in interest.

If upon pet ition the court finds that the settlor and all beneficiaries consent to the modification or termination of a noncharitable irrevocable trust, the court shall enter an order approving the modification or termination even if the modification or termination is inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. A settlors power to consent to a trusts modification or termination may be exercised by an agent under a power of attorney only to the extent expressly authorized by the power of attorney or the terms of the trust; by the settlors conservator with the approval of the court supervising the conservatorship if an agent is not so authorized; or by the settlors guardian with the approval of the court supervising the guardianship if an age nt is not so authorized and a conservator has not been appointed. B. A noncharit able irrevocable trust may be terminated upon consent of all of the beneficiaries if the court concludes that continuance of the trust is not necessary to achieve any material purpose of the trust. A noncharitable irrevocable trust may be modified upon c onsent of all of the beneficiaries if the court concludes that modification is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust. C. Upon termin ation of a trust under subsection A or B, the trustee shall distribute the trust property as agreed by the beneficiaries. D. If not all of the beneficiaries consent to a proposed modification or termination of the trust under subsection A or B, the modification or termination may be approved by the court if the court is satisfied that: 1. If al l of the beneficiaries had consented, the trust could have been modified or terminated under this section; and 2. The interests of a beneficiary who does not consent will be adequately protected. History History. 2005, c. 935, § 55-544.11; 2012, c. 614. Annotations CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Termination.  As the beneficiaries of the trust consented to the termination of the trust, under the statute the court could terminate if it appeared that continuance was not n ecessary to achieve any material purpose of the trust. Saunders v. AMG Nat'l Trust Bank (In re Vandeventer Trust), 88 Va. Cir. 389, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Norfolk June 23, 2014). Mere inclusion of a spendthrift restriction was insufficient alone to establish a presumption of a material purpose that prevented termination by consent of the b eneficiaries; the material purpose of the trust was to provide income for the individuals life, and such purpose was not defeated by termination of the trust, inasmuch as she could enjoy that income at a reduced cost to her if the trust was terminate d, and the beneficiaries were entitled to termination of the trust. Saunders v. AMG Nat'l Trust Bank (In re Vandeventer Trust), 88 Va. Cir. 389, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Norfolk June 23, 2014). Restatement.  Language of the actual Restatement section is almost identical to the statute, suggesting that Virginia law does not diverge from Restatement principles in this a rea. Saunders v. AMG Nat'l Trust Bank (In re Vandeventer Trust), 88 Va. Cir. 389, 2014 Va. Cir. LEXIS 50 (Norfolk June 23, 2014).

CASE NOTES Modification improper.  Circuit court erred in granting trustees motions to divide a testamentary trust and to commute and terminate the charitable trust created by the division beca use under subsection A of § 55-544.12, the burden was upon the trustees to prove that the circumstances upon which they relied to justify modification of the trust were not anticipated by the testator, but they failed to carry that burden; the modific ations the circuit court made would not further the purposes of the trust but completely frustrate them.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Burden of proof.  Moving party did not meet its burden to show that a decedents trust should be modified to eliminate the requirement that the trust be administered by an insti tutional trustee. It seemed clear that the decedent intended for the trust to always have a non-individual trustee overseeing the administration of the trust. In re Estate of Brown, 87 Va. Cir. 353, 2013 Va. Cir.

B. A provision in the terms of a charitable trust that would result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable beneficiary prevails over the power of the court under subsection A to apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust only if, when the provisi on takes effect: 1.

CASE NOTES Editors note.  The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. Former version of this section is called the cy pres statute. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp . 434, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963). Former similar provisions were intended to prevent failure of charitable trusts.  They were enacted to aid in the supervision and enforcement of charitable trusts to prevent their failure occasioned by impossibility of specific performance. Smi th v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963). But it did not bring to life a trust that had failed or been declared invalid. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963). Charitable gifts are viewed with peculiar favor by the courts in Virginia and every pres umption consistent with the language contained in the instruments of gift will be employed in order to sustain them. All doubts will be resolved in their favor. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963). And legislature may authorize courts to apply cy pres doctrine.  The legislature cannot terminate a charitable trust, nor change its administration on the ground of expediency, nor seek to control its disposition under the doct rine of cy pres. However, this does not suggest that the legislature cannot properly reserve to the judicial branch of government the power to do these acts. Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9367 (E.D. Va. 1963). Prerequisites for invoking doctrine.  Before invoking the cy pres doctrine, it is necessary that there be (1) a valid charitable trust without a gift over, (2) an existing general charitable intent, a nd (3) the beneficiaries must be indefinite or uncertain, or (4) the purpose of the trust must be indefinite, impossible to perform, or so impracticable of performance as to characterize the fulfillment of the purpose as impossible. Smith v.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Standing.  Because the cy pres doctrine precluded the corpus of a testamentary trust from reverting to the decedents estate under subdivision A 3 of § 13.1-907 and fo rmer § 55-31, the decedents cousin lacked standing to file a lawsuit to be allowed to inspect the records of the charity.

CASE NOTES Self-settled trust s ineffective to shield assets.  The restriction that a trust can not operate to the prejudice of any existing creditor of the creator of such trust is the self-settled rule and has been consistently interpreted to prevent a self-settled trust from being exempt from the settlor-beneficiarys creditors; a spendthrift trust cannot be created by the beneficiary to shield his own assets from claims of his own creditors. In re Bissell, 255 Bankr. 402, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 1407 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2000) (decided under prior law). Trust must be used for support and maintenance of beneficiary.  The statutory language protects the corpus of a spendthrift trust, the income of a trust, or both, from the beneficiaries creditors only if the moneys of the trust are to be used for the support and maintenance of the beneficiary.

A spendthri ft provision is valid only if it restrains both voluntary and involuntary transfer of a beneficiarys interest. B. A term of a trust providing that the interest of a beneficiary is held subject to a spendthrift trust, or words of similar import, is sufficient to restrain both voluntary and involuntary transfer of the beneficiarys interest. C. A beneficia ry may not transfer an interest in a trust in violation of a valid spendthrift provision and, except as otherwise provided in this article, a creditor or assignee of the beneficiary may not reach the interest or a distribution by the trustee before its r eceipt by the beneficiary. History History. 2005, c. 935, § 55-545.02; 2012, c. 614. Annotations CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Spendthrift trusts are recognized as valid in Virginia. Alderman v. Virginia Trust Co., 1 81 Va. 497, 25 S.E.2d 333, 1943 Va. LEXIS 200 (1943); Allen v. Wilson, 3 Bankr. 439, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5433 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). It would seem that spendthrift trusts can now be created in Virginia under former version of this section. Dunlop v. Dunlops Exrs, 144 Va. 297, 132 S.E. 351 (1926). But prior to the enactment of the predecessor section such trusts were not valid in Virginia. Thomas v. House, 145 Va. 742, 134 S.E. 673, 1926 Va. LEXIS 431 (1926). Virginia law recognizes as valid a trust held for support and maintenance which the beneficiary cannot assign and his creditors cannot disturb. In re Hersch, 57 B ankr. 667, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 6722 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1986). The purpose of the spendthrift trust is to prevent alienation and to free the income fro m claims of the beneficiarys creditors. Colonial-American Nat'l Bank v. United States, 243 F.2d 312, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 5117 (4th Cir. 1957). This section permits a donor to create such a trust within the statutory limitation, irr espective of the station in life of the beneficiary or his current needs. Alderman v. Virginia Trust Co., 181 Va. 497, 25 S.E.2d 333, 1943 Va. LEXIS 200 (1943). Former version of this section contemplates that a testator may provide that the whole of the income or the corpus of a trust estate, not exceeding the statutory amount in actual value, shall be held free from his debts and expended for the support and maintenance of a cestui que trust, whether such amount be reasonably necessary or proper for his support and maintenance or not. Where the trustee is given the pow er to pay to him the income for such purposes as she may consider proper, but it is plain that the dominant purpose is to provide a support and maintenance for him, as against his creditors, the trustee may expend or pay to him for his support and mainte nance only so much of the income as may be reasonably necessary or proper for such purpose. Rountree v. Lane, 155 F.2d 471, 1946 U.S. App. LEXIS 2962 (4th Cir. 1946). Breach of fiduciary duty by beneficiary not an exception to spendthrift protection.  A court cannot add an exception for a beneficiarys breach of fiduciary duty because that decision is solely within the province of the general assembly. Jacks on v. Fid. &amp; Deposit Co., 269 Va. 303, 608 S.E.2d 901, 2005 Va. LEXIS 28 (2005). Surety that obtained judgment against a testatrixs son after paying a bond due to the sons defalcation as estate administrator was not entitled to garnish his spendthrift trust as (1) the will clearly manifested the testatrixs intent that the trust could not be alienated, and (2) breach of fiduciary duty was not among the exceptions to spendthrift protection set out under former § 55-19. Jackson v. Fid. &amp; Deposit Co., 269 Va. 303, 608 S.E.2d 901, 2005 Va. LEXIS 28 (2005). The spendthrift trust statute is not to be given a strict interpretation, especially if the settlors intent is adduced from the instrument, and the intent may be implied from the instrument itself so long as it is not strictly construed or rigidly applied against the validity of spendthrift provisions. Allen v. Wilson, 3 Bankr. 439, 198 0 Bankr. LEXIS 5433 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). Spirit of section must be followed.  The spirit of the spendthrift trust statute must be followed and not simply the letter of the statute because to follow the letter many times would defeat the int ent of the legislature when the statute was enacted. Allen v. Wilson, 3 Bankr. 439, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5433 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). Requisites of creation and validity.  In order to be a valid spendthrift trust, it is essential that the trust comply with the requisites pertaining to its creation and validity, and these elements in clude a competent settlor and trustee, an ascertainable trust res, and certain beneficiaries. Allen v. Wilson, 3 Bankr. 439, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5433 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). The defining characteristics of a spendthrift trust are three in number. The trust must provide for the support and maintenance of its beneficiary. In addition, the settlor must intend, whether evidenced by express provision or implied from the four corners of the trust instrument, to protect the trust from the beneficiarys creditors. L astly, the settlor must intend also to prevent the beneficiarys voluntary or involuntary alienation. In re Hersch, 57 Bankr. 667, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 6722 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1986). A spendthrift trust has three defining characteristics: First, the trust must provide for the support and maintenance of its beneficiary; second, the settlor must intend to protect the trust from the beneficiarys creditor; and third, the settlor must intend to prevent the beneficiarys voluntary or involuntary alienation of trust property. Levey v. First Va. Bank, 845 F.2d 80, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 5436 (4t h Cir. 1988). Instrument con strued to carry out intent of settlor.  Once it has been established that the requisite formalities of a spendthrift trust have been complied with, a court must focus its attention on the intent of the settlor when he created the trust at issue, and further, the court is bound to construe the instrument as far as possible to carry out the intention and purpose of the settlor. Allen v. Wilson, 3 Bankr. 439, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5433 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). Intent to create trust must be manif est.  The settlor must not only intend to create a trust but must clearly manifest the intention to create it with the applicable spendthrift provisions. Allen v. Wilso n, 3 Bankr. 439, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5433 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). And may be gleaned from instru ment as whole.  The intention to create a spendthrift trust may be based on construction of, and inference from, the trust instrument read as a whole. Allen v. Wilson, 3 Bankr. 4 39, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5433 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). It is immaterial whether the intent is expressed in terms or by implication. Allen v. Wil son, 3 Bankr. 439, 1980 Bankr. LEXIS 5433 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1980). s Former version of this section does not expressly or by necessary implication restrict the trusts for support and maintenance to which provisions against alienation and freedom from debts may lawfully be attached to those in which the remainder in the trust property is given to some other person or reverts to the creator or his estate. Th ere is nothing in the language of the former section which would make such provisions invalid in a devise giving property in trust to a trustee for the support and maintenance of a person either for a term of years or for his life with remainder to him i n the trust property upon the termination of the prospective trust. Sheridan v. Krause, 161 Va. 873, 172 S.E. 508, 1934 Va. LEXIS 312 (1934). Will creating spendthrift trust need not follow precise terms of statute.  A bequest in trust obviously intended for the support and maintenance of the beneficiary falls within the terms of this section, although the will does not follow the precise terms of the statute and does not require the trustee to apply the income or corpus to the support and maintenance of the beneficiary and directs the trustee to pay the funds directly to the beneficiary. Rountree v. Lane, 155 F.2d 471, 1946 U.S. App. LEXIS 2962 (4th Cir. 1946). A spendthrift trust is not invalid, if the provision of the trust is that the trustee shall pay the income or corpus to the cestui que trust for his support and maintenance instead of providing that it shall be applied by the trustee to his support and maintenance. Sheridan v. Krause, 161 Va. 873, 172 S.E. 508, 1934 Va. LEXIS 312 ( 1934); Rountree v. Lane, 155 F.2d 471, 1946 U.S. App. LEXIS 2962 (4th Cir. 1946). An equitable fee simple or absolute equitable estate may be given to a person subject to any spendthrift trust for his benefit for his life, or a lesser period, which would be good if the remainder in the trust property were given to another. Sheridan v. Krause, 161 Va. 873, 172 S.E. 508, 1934 Va. LEXIS 312 (1934); Alderman v. Virginia Trus t Co., 181 Va. 497, 25 S.E.2d 333, 1943 Va. LEXIS 200 (1943). No distinction is made by the legislature between the policy of protection of income and protection of corpus, nor does there seem to be any logical distinction between either, so long as the trust fund remains in the hands of the trustee subject to the provisions of the trust instrument. Alderman v. Virginia Trust Co., 181 Va. 497, 25 S.E. 2d 333, 1943 Va. LEXIS 200 (1943). Corpus and income are stated both in the conjunctive and disjunctive. The provision is double-barrelled. Both or either of them may be held and applied for the su pport and maintenance of beneficiaries without being subject to their liabilities or to alienation by them. The words and and or either of them emphasize the inclusion of both within the protection of the predecessor statute. Alde rman v. Virginia Trust Co., 181 Va. 497, 25 S.E.2d 333, 1943 Va. LEXIS 200 (1943).

In this sec tion, child includes any person for whom an order or judgment for child support has been entered in this or another state. B. Even if a t rust contains a spendthrift provision, a beneficiarys child who has a judgment or court order against the beneficiary for support or maintenance, or a judgment creditor who has provided services for the protection of a beneficiarys interest in th e trust, may obtain from a court an order attaching present or future distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. C. Subject to the limitations of § 64.2-745, no spendthrift provision shall operate to the prejudice of the United States, the Commonwealth, or any county, city, or town. D. A claimant against which a spendthrift provision cannot be enforced may obtain from a court an order attaching present or future distributions to or for the benefit of a beneficiary. The court may limit the award of such relief as is appropriate under the circumsta nces. History History. 2005, c. 935, § 55-545.03; 2007, c. 216; 2012, c. 614. Annotations CASE NOTES Breach of fiduciary duty by beneficiary not an exception to spendthrift protection.  Surety that obtained judgment against a testatrixs son after paying a bond due to the sons defalcation as estate administrator was not entitled to garnish his spendthrift trust as (1) the will clearly manifested the testatrixs intent that the trust could not be alienated, and (2) breach of fiduciary duty was not among the exceptions to spendthrift protection set out in former § 55-19.

Notwithstan ding any contrary provision in the trust instrument, if a statute or regulation of the United States or Commonwealth requires a beneficiary to reimburse the Commonwealth or any agency or instrumentality thereof, for public assistance, including medical a ssistance, furnished or to be furnished to the beneficiary, the Attorney General or an attorney acting on behalf of the state agency responsible for the program may file a petition in the circuit court having jurisdiction over the trustee requesting reim bursement. The petition may be filed prior to obtaining a judgment. The beneficiary, the guardian of his estate, his conservator, or his committee shall be made a party. B. Following i ts review of the circumstances of the case, the court may: 1. Order the trustee to satisfy all or part of the liability out of all or part of the amounts to which the beneficiary is entitled, whether presently or in the future, to the extent the beneficiary has the right under the trust to compel the trustee to pay inco me or principal to or for the benefit of the beneficiary; or 2. Regardless of whether the beneficiary has the right to compel the trustee to pay income or principal to or for the benefit of the beneficiary, order the trustee to satisfy all or part of the liability out of all or part of any future payments that the trustee chooses to make to or for the benefit of the beneficiary in the exercise of discretion under the trust.

A settlor m ay transfer assets to a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust and retain in that trust a qualified interest, and, except as otherwise provided in this article, § 64.2-747 shall not apply to such qualified interest. B. Section 64. 2-747 shall continue to apply with respect to any interest held by a settlor in a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust, other than a qualified interest. C. A settlor s transfer to a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust shall not, to the extent of the settlors qualified interest, be deemed to have been made with intent to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors, for purposes of § 55.1-400, merely because it is made to a trust with respect to which the settlor retains a qualified interest and merely because it is made without consideration. A settlors transfer to a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust may, however, be set aside under § 55.1-400 o r 55.1-401 on other bases, such as if the transfer renders the settlor insolvent. D. A settlor s creditor may bring an action under § 55.1-402 to avoid a transfer to a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust or otherwise to enforce a claim that existed on the date of the settlors transfer to such trust within five years after the date of the settlors transfer to such trust to which such claim relates. E. A creditor shall have only such rights with respect to a settlors transfer to a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust as are provided in this section. No creditor and no other person shall have any claim or cause of action against any trustee, trust adviser, trust director, or any person involved in the counseling, drafting, preparation, or execution of, or transfers to a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust. F. If a settlo r makes more than one transfer to the same qualified self-settled spendthrift trust, the following rules shall apply: 1. The s ettlors making of a subsequent transfer shall be disregarded in determining whether a creditors claim with respect to a prior transfer is valid under this section; 2. With respect to each subsequent transfer by the settlor, the five-year limitations period provided in subsection D, with respect to actions brought under Chapter 4 (§ 55.1-400 et se q.) of Title 55.1 with respect to the subsequent transfer, commences on the date of such subsequent transfer; and 3. Any distribution to a beneficiary is deemed to have been made from the latest such transfer. G. The movemen t to the Commonwealth of the administration of an existing trust, which, after such movement to the Commonwealth, meets for the first time all of the requirements of a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust, shall be treated, for purposes of this secti on, as a transfer to this trust by the settlor on the date of such movement of all of the assets previously transferred to the trust by the settlor.

Definitions; vacancies; right to withdraw. Text A. As used in this article, unless the context requires a different meaning:Independent qualified trustee means a qualified trustee who is not, and whose actions are not, subject to direction by: 1. The s ettlor; 2. Any natural person who is not a resident of the Commonwealth; 3. Any entity that is not authorized under Title 6.2 to engage in trust business within the Commonwealth; 4. The settlors spouse; 5. A parent of the settlor; 6. Any issue of the settlor; 7. A sibling of the settlor; 8. An employee of the settlor; 9. A business entity in which the settlors holdings represent at least 30 percent of the total voting power of all interests entitled to vote; 10. A subordinate employee of the settlor; or 11. A subordinate employee of a business entity in which the settlor is an executive.Qualified interest means a settlors interest in a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust, to the extent that such interest entitles the settlor to receive distributions of income, principal, or both, in the sole discretion of an independent qualified trustee. A settlor may have a qualified interest in a qualified self-settled spendthrift trust and also have an interest in the same trust that is not a qualified interest, and the rules of § 64.2-747 shall apply to each interest of the settlor in the same trust other than the settlors qualified interest.Qualified self-settled spendthrift trust means a trust if: 1. The trust is irrevocable; 2. The trust is created during the settlors lifetime; 3. There is, at all times when distributions could be made to the settlor pursuant to the settlors qualified interest, at least one beneficiary other than the settlor (i) to whom inco me may be distributed, if the settlors qualified interest relates to trust income, (ii) to whom principal may be distributed, if the settlors qualified interest relates to trust principal, or (iii) to whom both income and principal may be distrib uted, if the settlors qualified interest relates to both trust income and principal; 4. The trust has at all times at least one qualified trustee, who may be, but need not be, an independent qualified trustee; 5. The trust instrument expressly incorporates the laws of the Commonwealth to govern the validity, construction, and administration of the trust; 6. The trust instrument includes a spendthrift provision, as defined in § 64.2-743, that restrains both voluntary and involuntary transfer of the settlors qualified interest; and 7. The settlor does not have the right to disapprove distributions from the trust.Qualified trustee means any person who is a natural person residing within the Commonwealth or a legal entity authorized to engage in trust business within the Commonwealth and who maintains or arranges for custody within the Commonwealth of some or all of the property that has been transferred to the trust by the settlor, maintains records within the Commonwealth for the trust on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis, prepares or arranges for the prepara tion within the Commonwealth of fiduciary income tax returns for the trust, or otherwise materially participates within the Commonwealth in the administration of the trust. A trustee is not a qualified trustee if such trustees authority to make distr ibutions of income or principal or both are subject to the direction of someone who, were that person a trustee of the trust, would not meet the requirements to be a qualified trustee. B. A vacancy i n the position of qualified trustee that occurs for any reason, whether or not there is then serving another trustee, shall be filled in the following order of priority: 1.

Except as o therwise provided in subsection C and § 64.2-745, whether or not a trust contains a spendthrift provision, a creditor of a beneficiary may not compel a distribution that is subject to the trustees discretion, even if: 1. The d iscretion is expressed in the form of a standard of distribution; or 2. The trustee has abused the discretion. C. To the exte nt a trustee has not complied with a standard of distribution or has abused a discretion: 1. A dis tribution may be ordered by the court to satisfy a judgment or court order against the beneficiary for support or maintenance of the beneficiarys child; and 2. The court shall direct the trustee to pay to the child such amount as is equitable under the circumstances but not more than the amount the trustee would have been required to distribu te to or for the benefit of the beneficiary had the trustee complied with the standard or not abused the discretion. D. This sectio n does not limit the right of a beneficiary to maintain a judicial proceeding against a trustee for an abuse of discretion or failure to comply with a standard for distribution. E. A creditor may not reach the interest of a beneficiary who is also a trustee or cotrustee, or otherwise compel a distribution, if the trustees discretion to make distributions for the trustees own benefit is limited by an ascertainable standard.

Whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision, the following rules apply: 1. Durin g the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlors creditors. 2. With respect to an irrevocable trust, except to the extent otherwise provided in §§ 64.2-745.1 and 64.2-745.2, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlors benefit. If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlors interest in the portion of the trust attributable to t hat settlors contribution. A trustees discretionary authority to pay directly or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal that is payable by the settlor shall not be considered to be an amount that can be distributed to o r for the settlors benefit, and a creditor or assignee of the settlor shall not be entitled to reach any amount solely by reason of this discretionary authority. 3. After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlors right to direct the source from which liabilities will be paid, the property of a trust that was revocable at the settlor s death is subject to claims of the settlors creditors, costs of administration of the settlors estate, the expenses of the settlors funeral and disposal of remains, and statutory allowances to a surviving spouse and children including th e family allowance, the right to exempt property, and the homestead allowance to the extent the settlors probate estate is inadequate to satisfy those claims, costs, expenses, and allowances.

Moore v. Downham, 166 Va. 77, 184 S.E. 199, 1936 Va. LEXIS 166 (1936) (decided under former § 26-54); SeeRol ler v. Shaver, 178 Va. 467, 17 S.E.2d 419, 1941 Va. LEXIS 182 (1941). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Appointment of successor trustee.  Where the three original testamentary trustees had discretionary powers, the trust could be implemented in accordance with its terms by the surviving trustees pur suant to former § 26-54; the court, therefore, declined to appoint a successor trustee to replace a deceased trustee under § 26-48. In re Trust of Sams, 59 Va. Cir. 322, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 376 (Richmond Aug. 7, 2002) (decided under prior law). Practice and procedure.  Successor trustee sufficiently pleaded claims against the former and initial trustee of the trust for breach of fiduciary duty because the successor trustee alleg ed that an insurance policy to fund a trust lapsed due to lack of a premium payment by the former and initial trustee.

Investments proper at time made.  Where there is nothing in the trust instruments to indicate that the trustor intended to restrict investments to those enumerated in the statutes in effect at the time of the execution of the instruments, it is the natural and legal presumption that the trustor intended that the trustees could make such investments as were lawful and proper under the statutes in effect at the time the investments were made. To gi ve effect to such intention impairs no contract and takes away no vested property right. Goodridge v. National Bank of Commerce, 200 Va. 511, 106 S.E.2d 598, 1959 Va. LEXIS 133 (1959). Prudent man rule governs trustees obligations regarding productivity of assets.  Although management discretion afforded a trustee under § 64.1-57 and former § 55-253 et seq. [see now § 55-277.1 et seq.] is extensive, that discretion is subject to the requirements of the prudent man rule; the restatement principles define a trustees obligations under the prudent man rule regarding productivity of trust assets. Sturgis v. Stinson, 241 Va. 531, 404 S.E.2d 56, 7 Va. Law Rep. 2395, 1991 Va. LEXIS 68 (1991). Liability under former s ubsection B of § 31-48.  Custodians of three childrens account under the Virginia Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, § 31-37 et seq., a father and an uncle, were liable for losses to the childrens accounts where the uncle abdicated his custodial duties and the father violated the custodial standard of care provided in former subsection B of § 31-48, the Prudent Person Rule, by speculating in airline stock when he knew that th e airline was on the verge of bankruptcy. Carlson v. Wells, 281 Va. 173, 705 S.E.2d 101, 2011 Va. LEXIS 30 (2011). Effect of waiver.  In order to impose liability against a trustee in regard to its investments of assets of a marital trust created by a will in which the testator granted the wides t discretionary powers to the trustee and waived the prudent man rule, it would have to be alleged and proved that the trustee acted dishonestly or in bad faith, or abused the discretion vested in it. Hoffman v. First Va. Bank, 220 Va. 834, 263 S .E.2d 402, 1980 Va. LEXIS 174 (1980). Constructive fraud through m isuse of funds.  Administratrix, acting in her fiduciary capacity, whether as the personal representative of the deceased or under an agreement between the beneficiaries of the wi ll, did not meet the prudent man standard required of her by this section where her handling of the estate amounted to constructive fraud through a flagrant misuse of the funds entrusted to her, especially the authorization of a 331/3% contingenc y fee to her attorneys which she concealed from the other beneficiaries. Kitchen v. Throckmorton, 223 Va. 164, 286 S.E.2d 673, 1982 Va. LEXIS 185 (1982). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Default rule.  The Prudent Investor Act in subsection B of § 26-45.3, provides merely a default rule that may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the provisions of a trust. This intent could be demonstrated in a variety of ways, though a general authorization in a will or trust authorizing a fiduciary to invest in such assets as the fiduciary, in his sole discretion, may deem best, will not suffice. Hartman v. Walker, 73 Va. Cir. 245, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 212 (Charlottesville Apr. 5, 2007) (decided under prior law). Breach of fiduciary duty.  Court found that defendant breached his fiduciary duties and specifically violated the prudent investor rule by his unauthorized day trading and purchases of stoc k on margin, and that defendants actions were reckless.

In making a n allocation or determination or exercising discretion under this chapter, a fiduciary shall: 1. Act i n good faith, based on what is fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries; 2. Administer a trust or estate impartially, except to the extent the terms of the trust manifest an intent that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more beneficiaries; 3. Administer the trust or estate in accordance with the terms of the trust, even if there is a different provision in this chapter; and 4. Administer the trust or estate in accordance with this chapter, except to the extent the terms of the trust provide otherwise or authorize the fiduciary to determine otherwise. B. A fiduciary s allocation, determination, or exercise of discretion under this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all beneficiaries. A fiduciary may exercise a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust, a nd an exercise of the power that produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this chapter does not create an inference that the fiduciary abused the fiduciarys discretion. C. A fiduciary shall: 1. Add a receipt to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the receipt between income and principal; and 2. Charge a disbursement to principal, to the extent neither the terms of the trust nor this chapter allocates the disbursement between income and principal. D. A fiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under § 64.2-1038, convert an income trust to a unitrust under subdivision A 1 of § 64.2-1041, change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under subdivision A 2 of § 64.2-1041, or convert a unitrust to an income trust under subdivision A 3 of § 64.2-1041 if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power will assist the fiduciary to administer the trust or estate impartially.

As used in this section, fiduciary decision means: 1. A fid uciarys allocation between income and principal or other determination regarding income and principal required or authorized by the terms of the trust or this chapter; 2. The fiduciarys exercise or nonexercise of a discretionary power regarding income and principal granted by the terms of the trust or this chapter, including the power to adjust unde r § 64.2-1038, convert an income trust to a unitrust under subdivision A 1 of § 64.2-1041, change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under subdivision A 2 of § 64.2-1041, or convert a unitrust to an income trust under s ubdivision A 3 of § 64.2-1041; or 3. The fiduciarys implementation of a decision described in subdivision 1 or 2. B. The court m ay not order a fiduciary to change a fiduciary decision unless the court determines that the fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciarys discretion. C. If the cour t determines that a fiduciary decision was an abuse of the fiduciarys discretion, the court may order a remedy authorized by law, including § 64.2-792. To place the beneficiaries in the positions the beneficiaries would have occupied if there had not been an abuse of the fiduciarys discretion, the court may order: 1. The f iduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to adjust under § 64.2-1038; 2. The fiduciary to exercise or refrain from exercising the power to convert an income trust to a unitrust under subdivision A 1 of § 64.2-1041, change the percentage or method used to calculate a unitrust amount under subdivision A 2 of § 64.2-1041, or convert a unitrust to an income trust under subdivision A 3 of § 64.2-1041; 3. The fiduciary to distribute an amount to a beneficiary; 4. A beneficiary to return some or all of a distribution; or 5. The fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to a beneficiary. D. On petition by a fiduciary for instruction, the court may determine whether a proposed fiduciary decision will result in an abuse of the fiduciarys discretion. If the petition describes the proposed decision, contains sufficient information to inform the benefi ciary of the reasons for making the proposed decision and the facts on which the fiduciary relies, and explains how the beneficiary will be affected by the proposed decision, a beneficiary that opposes the proposed decision has the burden to establish th at it will result in an abuse of the fiduciarys discretion.

Except as o therwise provided in the terms of a trust or this section, a fiduciary, in a record, without court approval, may adjust between income and principal if the fiduciary determines the exercise of the power to adjust will assist the fiduciary to administer t he trust or estate impartially. B. This sectio n does not create a duty to exercise or consider the power to adjust under subsection A or to inform a beneficiary about the applicability of this section. C. A fiduciary that in good faith exercises or fails to exercise the power to adjust under subsection A is not liable to a person affected by the exercise or failure to exercise. D. In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust under subsection A, a fiduciary shall consider all factors the fiduciary considers relevant, including relevant factors in subsection E of § 64.2-1036 and the application of subsection I of § 64.2-1048 and §§ 64.2-1055 and 64.2-1060. E. A fiduciary may not exercise the power under subsection A to make an adjustment or under § 64.2-1055 to make a determination that an allocation is insubstantial if: 1. The a djustment or determination would reduce the amount payable to a current income beneficiary from a trust that qualifies for a special tax benefit, except to the extent the adjustment is made to provide for a reasonable apportionment of the total return of the trust between the current income beneficiary and successor beneficiaries; 2. The adjustment or determination would change the amount payable to a beneficiary, as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets, under the terms of the trust; 3. The adjustment or determination would reduce an amount that is permanently set aside for a charitable purpose under the terms of the trust, unless both income and principal are set asi de for the charitable purpose; 4. Possessing or exercising the power would cause a person to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for federal income tax purposes; 5. Possessing or exercising the power would cause all or part of the value of the trust assets to be included in the gross estate of an individual for federal estate tax purposes; 6. Possessing or exercising the power would cause an individual to be treated as making a gift for federal gift tax purposes; 7. The fiduciary is not an independent person; 8. The trust is irrevocable and provides for income to be paid to the settlor and possessing or exercising the power would cause the adjusted principal or income to be considered an avail able resource or available income under a public-benefit program; or 9. The trust is a unitrust under Article 3 (§ 64.2-1039 et seq.). F. If subdivis ion E 4, 5, 6, or 7 applies to a fiduciary: 1. A co- fiduciary to which subdivisions E 4 through 7 does not apply may exercise the power to adjust, unless the exercise of the power by the remaining co-fiduciary or co-fiduciaries is not permitted by the terms of the trust or law other than this chapter; or 2. If there is no co-fiduciary to which subdivisions E 4 through 7 does not apply, the fiduciary may appoint a co-fiduciary to which subdivisions E 4 through 7 does not apply, which may b e a special fiduciary with limited powers, and the appointed co-fiduciary may exercise the power to adjust under subsection A, unless the appointment of a co-fiduciary or the exercise of the power by a co-fiduciary is not permitted by the terms of the tr ust or law other than this chapter. G. A fiduciary may release or delegate to a co-fiduciary the power to adjust under subsection A if the fiduciary determines that the fiduciarys possession or exercise of the power will or may: 1.

A fiduciary s release or delegation to a co-fiduciary under subsection G of the power to adjust under subsection A: 1. Must be in a record; 2. Applies to the entire power, unless the release or delegation provides a limitation, which may be a limitation to the power to adjust: a. From income to principal; b. From principal to income; c. For specified property; or d. In specified circumstances; 3. For a delegation, may be modified by a redelegation under this subsection by the co-fiduciary to which the delegation is made; and 4. Subject to subdivision 3, is permanent, unless the release or delegation provides a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual or the lives of more than one individual. I. Terms of a trust that deny or limit the power to adjust between income and principal do not affect the application of this section, unless the terms of the trust expressly deny or limit the power to adjust under subsection A. J. The exercis e of the power to adjust under subsection A in any accounting period may apply to the current period, the immediately preceding period, and one or more subsequent periods. K. A descripti on of the exercise of the power to adjust under subsection A must be: 1. Inclu ded in a report, if any, sent to beneficiaries under § 64.2-775; or 2.

A fiduciary may make an adjustment between income and principal to offset the shifting of economic interests or tax benefits between current income beneficiaries and successor beneficiaries that arises from: 1. An el ection or decision the fiduciary makes regarding a tax matter, other than a decision to claim an income tax deduction to which subsection B applies; 2. An income tax or other tax imposed on the fiduciary or a beneficiary as a result of a transaction involving the fiduciary or a distribution by the fiduciary; or 3. Ownership by the fiduciary of an interest in an entity a part of whose taxable income, whether or not distributed, is includable in the taxable income of the fiduciary or a beneficiary . B. If the amou nt of an estate tax marital or charitable deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes and, as a result, estate taxes paid from principal are increa sed and income taxes paid by the fiduciary or a beneficiary are decreased, the fiduciary shall charge each beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax to reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid. The total reimb ursement must equal the increase in the estate tax, to the extent the principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital or charitable deduction but for the payment. The share of the reimbursement for each fiduciary or beneficiary whos e income taxes are reduced must be the same as its share of the total decrease in income tax. C. A fiduciary that charges a beneficiary under subsection B may offset the charge by obtaining payment from the beneficiary, withholding an amount from future distributions to the beneficiary, or adopting another method or combination of methods.

This sectio n applies when: 1. The d eath of an individual results in the creation of an estate or trust; or 2. An income interest in a trust terminates, whether the trust continues or is distributed. B. A fiduciary of an estate or trust with an income interest that terminates shall determine, under subsection G and Articles 4 (§ 64.2-1048 et seq.), 5 (§ 64.2-1051 et seq.), 6 (§ 64.2-1055 et seq.), 7 (§ 64.2-1064 et seq.), and 9 (§ 64.2-1073 et seq.) , the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary. The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary that is to receive the specific property. C. A fiduciary shall determine the income and net income of an estate or income interest in a trust that terminates, other than the amount of net income determined under subsection B, under Articles 4 (§ 64.2-1048 et seq.), 5 (§ 64.2-1051 et seq.), 6 (§ 64.2- 1055 et seq.), 7 (§ 64.2-1064 et seq.), and 9 (§ 64.2-1073 et seq.), and by: 1.

Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciarys discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants, and fiduciaries, court costs and other expenses of administration, and interest on es tate and inheritance taxes and other taxes imposed because of the decedents death, but the fiduciary may pay the expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims a federal estate tax marital or charitable deduction o nly to the extent: a. The payment of the expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; or b. The fiduciary makes an adjustment under subsection B of § 64.2-1070; and 3. Paying from principal other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of the estate or the winding up of an income interest that terminates, including: a. To the extent authorized by the decedents will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law, debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances, estate and inheritance taxes, and other taxes imposed because of the decedents death; a nd b. Related penalties that are apportioned, by the decedents will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law, to the estate or income interest that terminates. D. If a decede nts will, the terms of a trust, or applicable law provides for the payment of interest or the equivalent of interest to a beneficiary that receives a pecuniary amount outright, the fiduciary shall make the payment from net income determined under sub section C or from principal, to the extent net income is insufficient. E. If a benefi ciary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends because of an income beneficiarys death, and no payment of interest or the equivalent of interest is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall pay the interest or the equivalent of interest to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will. F. A fiduciary shall distribute net income remaining after payments required by subsections D and E in the manner described in § 64.2-1072 to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary that receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds a n unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust. G. A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in subsection B because of a payment described in § 64.2-1064 or 64.2-1065, to the extent the decedents will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property must be determined by including the amount the fidu ciary receives or pays regarding the property, whether the amount accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of the decedents death or an income interests terminating event, and making a reasonable provision for an amount the estate or i ncome interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. Subject-matter jurisdiction.  County commissioner of accounts had subject matter jurisdiction to hear a petition for aid and direction filed initially with him because the circuit court had su bject matter jurisdiction over the case, and the supreme court reviewed decisions of the circuit court, not decisions of the commissioner; a commissioners authority to assist the circuit court with the settlement of estates was an extension of the ci rcuit courts subject matter jurisdiction to administer estates. Gray v. Binder, 294 Va. 268, 805 S.E.2d 768, 2017 Va. LEXIS 157 (2017). Purpose of chapter.  By the enactment of this chapter it was the intention of the legislature to confer upon probate courts, in the administration of a decedents estate, concurren t jurisdiction with a court of equity, and to establish a less expensive method and at the same time an equally efficient method of administering estates. Nicholas v. Nicholas, 169 Va. 399, 193 S.E. 689, 1937 Va. LEXIS 186 (1937). Chapter prov ides same protection as suit in chancery.  This chapter is full, ample and complete, and guards and protects every interest as amply as could be done by a formal suit in chancery. Carter v. Skillman, 108 V a. 204, 60 S.E. 775, 1908 Va. LEXIS 26 (1908). And render s danger of injustice to beneficiary remote.  The provisions of this chapter, if substantially followed, render the danger of any injustice to a beneficiary exceedingly remote, as they will usually show the c haracter, amount and value of the property transmitted and therefore necessarily determine the amount of inheritance due thereon. Commonwealth v. Carter, 126 Va. 469, 102 S.E. 58, 1920 Va. LEXIS 4 (1920). No gener al supervision over trustee who did not qualify.  Where the trustee did not qualify before the court, the commissioner of accounts did not have a general supervision over the trustee as set forth in this section. Cope v. Shedd-Carter, 175 Va. 273, 7 S.E.2d 891, 1940 Va. LEXIS 171 (1940). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Subject-matter jurisdiction. Decedents son was not an heir and had no pecuniary interest in the matter, and therefore the decedents son and daughter-in-law could not request that the Commissioner of Accounts hold a hearing under Va. Code Ann. § 64.2-1209, and the decedents widow was the only interested person who could have asked the Commissioner for a hearing; however, it would be absurd to require the Commissioner to approve the executors accounting and not look into a claim brought by an uninterested person that the executors accounting was deficient, Va. Code Ann. § 64.2-1200. In re Estate of Wilder, 109 Va. Cir. 420, 2022 Va. Cir. LEXIS 31 (Fairfax County Apr. 11, 2022). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Editors note.  The annotations below were decided under prior law. A commissioner of accounts is not permitted access to criminal history records of delinquent fiduciaries through the Virginia Criminal Information Network, unless such records are released pursuant to a circuit court order or rule. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Thomas D. Horne, Judge, Twentieth Ju dicial Circuit, 00-011 (4/8/02). Clerk of circuit court may not hold interest in Virginia stock corporation.  The clerk of a circuit court may not accept the transfer by a commissioner of accounts of an equity interest in a Virginia stock corporation, which is subject to the direction of the court, when the transfer is not part of a case or controversy properly before the court. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Michael P.

I.Disbursements. A.Expenses. Editors note. The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. Reasonable expenses allowed.  Executors and administrators ought to be allowed, in their accounts, all reasonable charges and disbursements for the benefit of the estate they represent, and a reasonable recompense for their personal trouble, in preference to the claim of any creditor of the decedent. Garrett v. Carr, 40 Va. (1 Rob.) 196, 1842 Va. LEXIS 23 (1842). Executors and administrators are entitled to allowance for reasonable expenses and where the record does not show such allowance, it cannot be presumed to have be en made. Dromgoole v. Smith, 78 Va. 665, 1884 Va. LEXIS 38 (1884). Such as disbursements for re pairs.  Fiduciaries are justified in making ordinary repairs and improvements and are allowed to hold the property until reimbursed therefor. Shirkey v. Kirby, 110 Va. 45 5, 66 S.E. 40, 1909 Va. LEXIS 165 (1909); White v. Hall, 113 Va. 427, 74 S.E. 212, 1912 Va. LEXIS 53 (1912). A trustee whose conduct was found to be absolutely beyond reproach should recover his expenses where he is subjected to an unwarranted and groundless attack. Clare v. Grasty, 213 Va. 165, 191 S.E.2d 184, 1972 Va. LEXIS 329 (1972). Clerk hire and rent of office.  Under certain circumstances, a fiduciary may be allowed expenses of administration (including clerk hire, rent of a counting room, and postage), in addition to hi s commission. Hipkins v. Bernard, 18 Va. (4 Munf) 83, 1813 Va. LEXIS 30 (1813); Farneyhough's Ex'rs v. Dickerson, 41 Va. (2 Rob.) 582, 1843 Va. LEXIS 53 (1843); Southern Ry. v. Glenn's Adm'r, 98 Va. 309, 36 S.E. 395, 1900 Va. LEXIS 44 (1900). Counsel fees.  Trustees who in good faith engage counsel to aid them in the execution of the trust are entitled to pay them out of the trust fund. Cochran v. Richmond &amp; A.R.R., 91 Va. 339, 21 S.E. 664, 1895 Va. LEXIS 30 (1895); Ward v. City of Winchester, 11 Va. L. Reg. 501 (1902); Berkley v. Green, 102 Va. 378, 46 S.E. 387, 1904 Va. LEXIS 80 (1904); Stull v. Harvey, 112 Va. 816, 72 S.E. 701, 1911 Va. LEXIS 155 (1911). An executor, may, in good faith, seek the aid of counsel in the execution of his duties. However, in addition to good faith there must be some reasonable ground t hat renders the employment of counsel reasonably necessary to aid the executor in the performance of his duties. If counsel is employed under these circumstances, then reasonable expenses incurred by such employment are assessable against the estate. Cla re v. Grasty, 213 Va. 165, 191 S.E.2d 184, 1972 Va. LEXIS 329 (1972). Allowance of attorneys fees for services rendered the estate apart from the duties as executor was within the sound discretion of the trial court. Perrow v. P ayne, 203 Va. 17, 121 S.E.2d 900, 1961 Va. LEXIS 215 (1961). The executor was not entitled to allowance of a fee to the attorney who represented him in the hearings on the exceptions to his accounting. Perrow v. Payne, 203 Va. 17, 121 S.E.2d 900, 1961 Va. LEXIS 215 (1961). Counsel fee exce eding that by law allowed.  An executor or administrator ought to be credited in his administration account for fees paid to counsel, notwithstanding those fees were more than the law allowe d. Lindsay v. Howerton, 12 Va. (2 Hen. &amp; M.) 9, 1807 Va. LEXIS 57 (1807). Expenses of counsel for services rendered not in aid of the executor in the performance of his duties are not chargeable against the estate. Clare v. Grasty, 213 Va. 165, 191 S.E.2d 184, 1972 Va. LEXIS 329 (1972). It was error to charge the estate for those services rendered by counsel which were for the executors personal benefit. Clare v. Grasty, 213 Va. 165, 191 S.E. 2d 184, 1972 Va. LEXIS 329 (1972). B.Debts of Estate. Allowance made f or payment of taxes.  An administrator is entitled to an allowance for money paid by him for taxes on the property of the decedent. Nimmo's Ex'r v. Commonwealth, 14 Va. (4 Hen. &amp; M.) 5 7, 1809 Va. LEXIS 28 (1809). But not for paym ent of unlawful debt.  An executor ought not to be allowed a credit for paying a debt of his testator, appearing, on the face of the written instrument intended to secure it, to have be en for money won at unlawful gaming. Carter's Ex'rs v. Cutting, 19 Va. (5 Munf) 223, 1816 Va. LEXIS 39 (1816). C.Proof of Disbursement. Oath substit uted for vouchers.  An item should be allowed in an administration account, upon the oath of the defendant, where it is of such a nature that the expense probably must have been incu rred, or that perhaps a voucher for it could not have been procured; for example, mourning for the widow, services performed by a carpenter and the like. M'Call v. Peachy's Adm'r, 17 Va. (3 Munf) 288, 1812 Va. LEXIS 51 (1812); Newton v. Poole, 39 Va. (12 Leigh) 112, 1841 Va. LEXIS 34 (1841). II.Compensation. A.Rate of Compensation. Right to receive compensation is statutory.  The right of a fiduciary to receive compensation for administering an estate is of purely statutory origin. Swank v. Reherd, 181 Va. 943, 27 S.E.2d 191, 1943 Va. LEXIS 241 (1943). Compensation dependent upon facts of particular case.  The amount of compensation to which a trustee is entitled is clearly dependent upon the facts of a particular case. It is impossible to lay down a hard and fast r ule when so many factors may be involved. The court must rely on the general principles above and look to the value of the services performed under the circumstances, the results obtained, and the responsibilities assumed by the trustee. In re Manning, 4 3 Bankr. 712, 1984 Bankr. LEXIS 4692 (Bankr. W.D. Va. 1984). No hard and fast rule as to compensation.  Inasmuch as this section fails to lay down a hard and fast rule, the court should not do so. A fair construction of the statute seems to be that if the fiduciary sells property, of whatever kind, he is generally entitled to a commission of five percent on the receipts. If he has the right to sell, but those entitled to the proceeds of sale prefer to take the property in kind, then he is generally entitled to rece ive five percent commission upon the appraised value of the property. If he is not entitled to sell the property, but must deliver in kind (except in the case of a specific legacy), he is only entitled to a reasonable compensation to be fixed by the comm issioner, or court, upon the proper proof of the expense incurred, the risk taken, and the services rendered in connection with the property so delivered to those entitled thereto. Jones v. Virginia Trust Co., 142 Va. 229, 128 S.E. 533, 1925 Va. LEXIS 33 3 (1925); Mapp v. Hickman, 164 Va. 386, 180 S.E. 296, 1935 Va. LEXIS 213 (1935); Swank v. Reherd, 181 Va. 943, 27 S.E.2d 191, 1943 Va. LEXIS 241 (1943); Virginia Trust Co. v. Evans, 193 Va. 425, 69 S.E.2d 409, 1952 Va. LEXIS 151 (1952); Perrow v. Payne, 203 Va. 17, 121 S.E.2d 900, 1961 Va. LEXIS 215 (1961). The amount of compensation to which a personal representative may be entitled is dependent upon the facts of the particular case. Since it is still practically im possible to lay down a hard and fast rule because of the many factors involved, the court must rely on general principles, remembering that the personal representative is entitled to a reasonable reward, commensurate with the value of his services under the attendant circumstances, the results obtained, and the responsibility assumed. In some instances five percent upon the appraised value of property coming into his hands would not be sufficient; in others it would be too much. Virginia Trust Co. v. Ev ans, 193 Va. 425, 69 S.E.2d 409, 1952 Va. LEXIS 151 (1952); Bickers v. Shenandoah Valley Nat'l Bank, 201 Va. 257, 110 S.E.2d 514, 1959 Va. LEXIS 220 (1959). But it is in d iscretion of court.  There is no law which prescribes what commissions shall be allowed as executor, trustee or other fiduciary. The allowance or refusal of commissions rests in the s ound discretion of the court under the circumstances of the case. Boyd's Surs. v. Oglesby, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 674, 1873 Va.

Annotations CASE NOTES This section and § 26-15 do not oust a court of equity of its jurisdiction to enjoin improper settlement by a trustee under a deed of trust. Bradley v. Canter, 201 Va. 747, 113 S.E.2d 878, 1960 Va. LEXIS 156 (1960) (decided under prior law). Subject-matter jurisdiction.  County commissioner of accounts had subject matter jurisdiction to hear a petition for aid and direction filed initially with him because the circuit court had su bject matter jurisdiction over the case, and the supreme court reviewed decisions of the circuit court, not decisions of the commissioner; a commissioners authority to assist the circuit court with the settlement of estates was an extension of the ci rcuit courts subject matter jurisdiction to administer estates. Gray v. Binder, 294 Va. 268, 805 S.E.2d 768, 2017 Va. LEXIS 157 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Subject-matter jurisdiction.  Decedents son was not an heir and had no pecuniary interest in the matter, and therefore the decedents son and daughter-in-law could not request that the Commissioner of Accounts hold a hearing under Va. Code Ann. § 64.2-1209, and the decedents widow was the only interested person who could have asked the Commissioner for a hearing; however, it would be absurd to require the Commissioner to approve the executors accounting and not look into a claim brought by an uninterested person that the executors accounting was deficient, Va.

The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. Subject-matter jurisdiction.  County commissioner of accounts had subject matter jurisdiction to hear a petition for aid and direction filed initially with him because the circuit court had su bject matter jurisdiction over the case, and the supreme court reviewed decisions of the circuit court, not decisions of the commissioner; a commissioners authority to assist the circuit court with the settlement of estates was an extension of the ci rcuit courts subject matter jurisdiction to administer estates. Gray v. Binder, 294 Va. 268, 805 S.E.2d 768, 2017 Va. LEXIS 157 (2017). Ex ception not required where fundamental error committed.  Where it is apparent from the face of the report of a commissioner and from the pleadings and exhibits, independent of other evidence, that the commissioners report was based upon a fundamental error of law, no exception to the report is necessary. Carle v. Cochran, 127 Va. 223, 103 S.E. 699, 1920 Va. LEXIS 45 (1920). Reference to commissioner where period for filing exceptions expired.  Conceding that an ex parte account of an executor, in the absence of exceptions, stood confirmed at the expiration of 30 days (now 15 days) from the filing thereo f, the lower court was entirely right in referring the cause to a commissioner, where, before the decree of reference was entered, proof had been taken showing that the executor had misappropriated the funds, and that the settlement itself was based in t he main upon fictitious and fraudulent entries. American Sur. Co. v. Quincey, 125 Va. 1, 99 S.E. 641, 1919 Va. LEXIS 1 (1919). Exceptions must state grounds.  No particular form or formality is required when stating and filing exceptions to the commissioners report, but the exceptant must specify with reasonable cer tainty the particular grounds of the objections relied upon so that the adverse party may know what he has to meet and the court what it has before it for review. Perrow v. Payne, 203 Va. 17, 121 S.E.2d 900, 1961 Va. LEXIS 215 (1961). An exception directed to the reasonableness of the amount claimed for services as execut or and attorney did not raise the issue of forfeiture of commissions under § 26-19. Perrow v. Payne, 203 Va. 17, 121 S.E.2d 900, 1961 Va. LEXIS 215 (1961). Account confirmed without exception.  Where an executors first accounting was approved by the commissioner of accounts and confirmed by the court without exception, the accounting thereby became f inal and conclusive. Perrow v. Payne, 203 Va. 17, 121 S.E.2d 900, 1961 Va. LEXIS 215 (1961). Additional evidence may be heard in circuit court to exceptions to commissioners report.  Although this section does not explicitly provide for a further evidentiary hearing in circuit court when exceptions to a commissioners report are heard, it i s implicit in the statutory provision for jury trial that additional evidence may be adduced, and it is equally implicit that evidence which may be heard by a jury may also be heard ore tenus, in the courts discretion. Morris v. United Va. Bank, 237 Va. 331, 377 S.E.2d 611, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1873, 1989 Va. LEXIS 38 (1989). Final approval.  Circuit court erroneously delegated final approval of the accountings to the Commissioner of Accounts without a certification that it had made a personal examinat ion of the exceptions, as required by subsection B of § 64.2-1212, where its order conditioned final approval of the accountings on the Commissioners approval, subject to specific written objections, nothing in the record showed any ruling on the beneficiarys objections and exceptions, and none of the orders contained the language required by subsection B that the court certify in the order that it has made a personal examination of the exceptions. Henderson v. Cook, 297 Va. 699, 831 S.E.2d 717, 2019 Va. LEXIS 96 (2019). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Exceptions to correct errors.  Chancery commissioner erred in finding that the claimant did not hold the property he claimed by adverse possession under the necessary claim of right; the claima nt provided clear and convincing evidence satisfying the hostility requirement by introducing proof that he believed that a particular line on the ground represented the extent of his land and that he treated all the land within the line as his own, and, thus, the trial court had a duty to correct the chancery commissioners erroneous conclusion in the chancery commissioners report that found the claimant had not proved he had title to the disputed property by adverse possession.

The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. Section declaratory of preexisti ng rule.  This section seems to have been engrafted on the statute law, in its present form, for the first time at the revisal of 1849 (Code of 1849, ch. 132, § 23, p. 5 52), and is simply declaratory of the preexisting rule as to the credit to which such settlements were entitled.

And is applicable to fiducia ry settlements.  The reports of accounts referred to in this section, which are to be taken as correct until properly surcharged or falsified, are fiduciary settlements in the legitimate acceptation of that term  executorial and administrative accounts and the like, such as the commissioner of accounts has the authority to deal with, affecting assets, the due administration of which devolve upon the fiduciary by virtu e of his office, and which are covered by his oath and bonds.

The only method contemplated by the Virginia Code for the impeachment of an ex parte settlement is by bill in equity to surcharge and falsify, except in the case of a person who was a party to exceptions filed to the report, in which case the statute prohibits such person from bringing a suit to surcharge and falsify, but does permit an appeal as in other suits in equity. Lister v. Virginia Nat'l Bank, 209 Va. 739, 167 S.E.2d 346, 1969 Va. LEXIS 170 (1969). Ex parte settlements of accounts by fiduciaries are prima facie evidence of their correctness, but subject to be surcharged and falsified. Radford v. Fowlkes, 85 Va. 820, 8 S.E. 817, 1889 Va. LEXIS 94 (1889); Hurt v. West's Adm'r, 87 Va. 78, 12 S.E. 141, 1890 Va. LEXIS 94 (1890); Robinett Adm'r v. Robinett Heirs, 92 Va. 124, 22 S.E. 856, 1895 Va. LEXIS 95 (1895); Leavell v. Smith's Ex'rs, 99 Va. 374, 38 S.E. 202, 1901 Va. LEXIS 55 (1901); Scott v. Porter, 99 Va. 553, 39 S.E. 220, 1901 Va. LEXIS 77 (1901) (see Leakes Exr v. Leake, 75 Va. 792 (1881); Carter v. Edmunds, 80 Va. 58 (1885); Owens v. Owens Exr, 109 Va. 432, 63 S.E. 990 (1909); Miller v. Smith, 109 Va. 651, 64 S.E. 956 (1909)). But ex parte accounts of executors or administrators are not evidence of overpayments by them, or that the claims stated in such accounts were debts justly due by the deceased, and chargeable upon his real estate. If an executor or administrator, after exhausting the assets which properly come into his hands, pays debts of the decede nt out of his own estate, he can only claim to be substituted to the rights of the creditor, and must prove his demand by the same kind of evidence that would be demanded of the original creditor. Leavell v. Smith's Ex'rs, 99 Va. 374, 38 S.E. 202, 1901 V a. LEXIS 55 (1901). Burden on plaintiff to show errors.  The ex parte settlements by a master commissioner of the accounts of a fiduciary, are presumed to be correct, except so far as the same may in a suit in proper ti me be surcharged and falsified; and the onus is on the plaintiff to show that it is not correct. And when such settlement is made in a suit inter partes, and is duly returned and confirmed, it cannot be disturbed except for errors apparent on its face or for after-discovered facts. Radford v. Fowlkes, 85 Va. 820, 8 S.E. 817, 1889 Va. LEXIS 94 (1889). The ex parte settlements of the commissioner of accounts are presumed to be correct until surcharged and falsified, and not only the duty of specifying errors, bu t also the onus probandi, devolves on the party complaining. Corbin v. Mills' Ex'rs, 60 Va. (19 Gratt.) 438, 1869 Va. LEXIS 11 (1869); Young v. Bowen, 131 Va. 401, 108 S.E. 866, 1921 Va. LEXIS 32 (1921) (citing Peale v. Hickle, 1852 Va. LEXIS 14, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 437 (1852)); Counts v. Counts, 165 Va. 61, 181 S.E. 437, 1935 Va. LEXIS 272 (1935). Misconduct of administrator no t presumed.  The ex parte settlement of an administration account (confirmed by the court) showing that all funds coming into the hands of the administrator have been properly accounted for, and that the disbursements are supported by proper and satisfactory vouchers, will not be overturned by showing that before the account was settled the administrator paid his individual debts by checks drawn by him as administrator of his decedents estate. It will not be inferred that the administrator has misappropriated the funds belonging to his decedents estate. McIntyre v. Wright, 113 Va. 299, 74 S.E. 172, 1912 Va. LEXIS 36 (1912). Election.  This section does not prohibit a beneficiary, who did not file exceptions to the commissioners report within the statutory period (now 15 days), from seeking equitable relief by instituting a suit in proper time to surcharge and falsify an ex parte settlement of the fiduciarys account. A beneficiary may elect whether to file exceptions to the report or to institute a suit to surcharge and falsify. If he f iles exceptions to the report, then he is barred from prosecuting such a suit. The statute specifically states that a confirmed report shall be taken to be correct, except so far as it may, in a suit, in proper time, be surcharged or falsified. L ister v. Virginia Nat'l Bank, 209 Va. 739, 167 S.E.2d 346, 1969 Va. LEXIS 170 (1969). Subject-matter jurisdiction.  County commissioner of accounts had subject matter jurisdiction to hear a petition for aid and direction filed initially with him because the circuit court had su bject matter jurisdiction over the case, and the supreme court reviewed decisions of the circuit court, not decisions of the commissioner; a commissioners authority to assist the circuit court with the settlement of estates was an extension of the ci rcuit courts subject matter jurisdiction to administer estates. Gray v. Binder, 294 Va. 268, 805 S.E.2d 768, 2017 Va. LEXIS 157 (2017). Setting aside settlement by bi ll in equity.  The settlement by a commissioner of the accounts of the committee of an insane person which has been duly confirmed will not be set aside on a bill which stated n o grounds of fraud, accident or mistake, but merely seeks to correct an error alleged to have been made by the commissioner in his settlement. Johnston v. Commonwealth ex rel. Perry, 117 Va. 506, 85 S.E. 566, 1915 Va. LEXIS 63 (1915). Confirmation of report of assistant commissioner of accounts approving the executors account did not constitute a bar to the prosecution of complainants suit to surcharge and falsify the ex parte settlement of the executors account. Lister v. Virginia Nat'l Bank, 209 Va. 739, 167 S.E.2d 346, 1969 Va. LEXIS 170 (1969). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Burden on plaintiff to show errors.  While the plaintiff in a surcharge and falsification suit generally had the burden of proof, whether or not a commissioner-of-accounts approved an executors a ccountings, in a suit in which the executors pursuit of an aid and direction suit materially advanced his own interests, the executor had the burden of proving that his actions were taken within the scope of his authority, were taken in good faith, a nd comported with ordinary prudence.

The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. This section does not apply to accounts which are settled in a suit brought for the admi nistration of the estate. Fauber v. Gentry, 89 Va. 312, 15 S.E. 899, 1892 Va. LEXIS 101 (1892); Cannon v. Searles, 150 Va. 738, 143 S.E. 495, 1928 Va. LEXIS 349 (1928). Discretion to allow compensation.  This section does not create an absolute forfeiture of commissions. Whether they are allowed or refused is a matter of discretion, a discretion to be reasonably e xercised under the circumstances of each case. Dearing v. Walter, 179 Va. 620, 20 S.E.2d 483, 1942 Va. LEXIS 255 (1942) (see Harris v. Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., 172 Va. 111, 200 S.E. 652 (1880); Buckle v. Marshall, 176 Va. 139, 10 S.E.2d 506 (1940)). There is a discretion in the allowance of compensation under this section even though the fiduciary has failed to settle his accounts. Crigler's Comm. v. Alexande r's Ex'r, 74 Va. (33 Gratt.) 674, 1880 Va. LEXIS 67 (1880); Brent's Adm'r v. Clevinger, 78 Va. 12, 1883 Va. LEXIS 3 (1883); Trevelyan v. Lofft, 83 Va. 141, 1 S.E. 901, 1887 Va. LEXIS 47 (1887); Robertson v. Gillenwaters, 85 Va. 116, 7 S.E. 371, 1888 Va. LEXIS 17 (1888). And the circumstances of each ca se govern.  Whether a court shall allow or refuse compensation in a case where a fiduciary has failed to settle his accounts depends on the circumstances of each particular c ase. Wood's Ex'r v. Garnett, 33 Va. (6 Leigh) 271, 1835 Va. LEXIS 31 (1835); Lovett v. Thomas, 81 Va. 245, 1885 Va. LEXIS 28 (1885); Trevelyan v. Lofft, 83 Va. 141, 1 S.E. 901, 1887 Va. LEXIS 47 (1887). This section does not create an absolute forfeiture of commissions for failure to file an accounting within four months after the end of each year, pursuant to former § 26-17. The allowance or refusal of commissions is a matter of discretion to be reasonably exercised under the circumstances of each case, and when exercised it is subject to review on appeal. Perrow v. Payne, 203 Va. 17, 121 S.E.2d 900, 1961 Va. LEXIS 215 (1961). Excuse is necessary for failur e to account.  It is incumbent upon a delinquent fiduciary, praying the court to exercise its discretion in his favor, and grant him compensation where he has failed to settle h is accounts, to give a reasonable excuse for his delay, otherwise compensation ought not to be allowed him. Brent's Adm'r v. Clevinger, 78 Va. 12, 1883 Va. LEXIS 3 (1883); Trevelyan v. Lofft, 83 Va. 141, 1 S.E. 901, 1887 Va. LEXIS 47 (1887). And the excuse must be reasonable.  Under this section commissions to a fiduciary will be allowed on receipts as to which he is in default under this section and former § 26-17, only to the exten t that he gives a reasonable excuse for such default. Bliss v. Spencer, 125 Va. 36, 99 S.E. 593, 1919 Va. LEXIS 4 (1919). Commissions not allowed.  A trustee who failed to make annual settlements, or any statement to the beneficiaries, as directed by former § 26-17 and this section, whose only excuse was t hat he did not deem it necessary, as he had annually paid the interest, was not entitled to commissions, and his right to future commissions will depend upon his future conduct. Ward v. Funsten, 86 Va. 359, 10 S.E. 415, 1889 Va. LEXIS 50 (1889) (see also Beverleys v. Miller, 20 Va. (6 Munf.) 99 (1818); McCready v. Lyon, 167 Va. 103, 187 S.E. 442 (1936)). Pursuant to this section and former § 26-17, an administrator who has made no settlement of his accounts as required by law, and who offers no reasonable or su fficient excuse for his failure to perform this plain and mandatory duty, is not entitled to receive commissions on that part of the funds of the estate received by him which goes to persons who have not waived such settlements. Crismond v. Jones, 117 Va . 34, 83 S.E. 1045, 1915 Va. LEXIS 6 (1915). Commission allowed o n money actually collected.  No accounts were filed by the committees, and when the various estates were brought into equity, it was contended that in allowing commissions to the committees, there was an abuse of discretion under this section. It was held that it could not be said that there was an abuse of discretion in allowing commissions on the money actually collected and disbursed by the committees. Mapp v. Byrd, 169 Va. 519, 194 S.E. 724, 1938 Va. LEXIS 229 (1938). A personal representative will be entitled to his commissions upon moneys received by him during the Civil War, though he did not settle his accounts until after the war. Moses v. Hart's Adm'r, 66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 795, 1875 Va. LEXIS 84 (1875); Brent's Adm'r v. Clevinger, 78 Va. 12, 1883 Va. LEXIS 3 (1883). Settlement before wrong court.  Under the discretion given the court by this section, it was not error to allow compensation to an executor, who, by mistake, settled his account before the commi ssioner of the county instead of the circuit court, where he qualified. Moorman v. Crockett, 90 Va. 185, 17 S.E. 875, 1893 Va. LEXIS 33 (1893). Failure of commissioner to rep ort account.  Where, under this section, a personal representative yearly laid his accounts before the commissioner of accounts, the failure of the officer to audit, state, and report them, cannot lose the former his commissions. Lovett v. Thomas, 81 Va. 245, 1885 Va. LEXIS 28 (1885). Issue of forfeiture not properly r aised.  Where the commissioner approved an accounting including certain amounts claimed as executors commission, exceptions filed in the circuit court directed at the reasonableness of such amounts did not properly bring before the court for determination the issue of forfeiture of commissions pursuant to this section. Perrow v. Payne, 203 Va. 17, 121 S.E.2d 900, 1961 Va. LEXIS 215 (1961). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Commissions not allowed.  Executor was not allowed fees where she filed her first accounting nearly nine months after it was due, failed to seek help in accounting and did not hire legal c ounsel until eight months after the deputy commissioner had summoned her for her failure to file.

No abuse of discretion found.  In case in which $20 million and certain property was awarded to the Commonwealth for the public benefit after a constructive trust had been imposed on the assets of a charitable corporation whose charter was revoked, the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in failing to award attorneys fees and costs to the Commonwealth, although the trustees had engaged in a longstanding course of self-dealing at the ex pense of the charity, which would have supported an award of attorneys fees under the evidence presented.

B. If (i) the will of a decedent probated on or after July 1, 1993, contains a waiver of the obligations of the testamentary trustee nominated therein to account or (ii) the sole beneficiary of the trust also is a trustee, the trustee will not be required to file acco unts with the commissioner of accounts.Where the waiver is contained in the decedents will, the trustee shall within 90 days after qualification notify in writing all beneficiaries of the trust, other than the trustee, who are adults, whose addresses are known to the trustee, and to whom income or principal of the trust could be currently distributed; provide each such beneficiary with a copy of the applicable provisions of the will; advise each such beneficiary of his right to require an annual acc ounting; and provide each such beneficiary with a copy of this section and annually thereafter provide each such beneficiary an accounting upon request.

Notwithstan ding a waiver in the will of the decedent or any prior consent of a beneficiary, any such adult beneficiary may, at any time during the administration of the trust, demand in a writing delivered to the trustee and to the commissioner of accounts that the trustee settle annually with the commissioner of accounts. Upon notice of such demand to the trustee and the commissioner of accounts, such trustee shall file an account with the commissioner of accounts for a period acceptable to the commissioner of ac counts as though there were no waiver by the testator. The beneficiary making such demand may later revoke his demand by a writing delivered to the trustee and the commissioner of accounts. The demand for settlement of the trustees account before the commissioner of accounts may also be made by the personal representative of a deceased beneficiary whose estate is a beneficiary, an attorney-in-fact for a beneficiary, a guardian of an incapacitated beneficiary, a committee of a convict or insane benef iciary, the duly qualified guardian of a minor, or if none exists, a custodial parent of a minor or by any minor who has attained 14 years of age. E. Notwithstan ding the provisions of this section, any trustee under a will of a decedent containing the requisite waiver, whenever probated, shall be relieved of the duty to file an inventory or annual accounts with the commissioner of accounts if the trustee (i) obt ains the written consent of all adult beneficiaries, other than the trustee, to whom income or principal of the trust could be currently distributed, after providing those beneficiaries with the documents and information specified in subsection B, and (i i) files those consents with the commissioner of accounts on or before the date on which the inventory or next required accounting would otherwise be due. For receiving and filing such written consent, the commissioner of accounts shall be allowed a fee not to exceed $25. F. Notwithstan ding the provisions of this section, any trustee under a will of a decedent probated on or after July 1, 2010, shall be relieved of the duty to file an inventory or annual accounts with the commissioner of accounts if the will of the decedent does not di rect the filing of such inventory or accounts and the trustee (i) obtains the written consent of all adult beneficiaries, other than the trustee, to whom income or principal of the trust could be currently distributed, after providing those beneficiaries with the documents and information specified in subsection B; (ii) obtains the written consent of the representatives of all incapacitated beneficiaries, other than the trustee, to whom income or principal of the trust could be currently distributed, af ter providing those representatives with the documents and information specified in subsection B; and (iii) files those consents with the commissioner of accounts on or before the date on which the inventory or next required accounting would otherwise be due.

Any trustee appointed by a deed or other writing where the deed or other writing does not require that the trustee qualify may voluntarily qualify. However, regardless of whether the deed or other writing does not require qualification, upon the request of any inte rested party, the administration of the trust shall be in the same manner as if qualification had been required by the terms of the deed or other writing creating it.

Section does not apply t o discretionary trust.  A court of equity has no jurisdiction to interfere with a trustee in the exercise of a discretionary trust, or one of personal confidence, so long as he acts in g ood faith. It can neither execute it itself, nor appoint someone else to do it. This section has no application to a trust of this character. Dillard v. Dillard, 97 Va. 434, 34 S.E. 60, 1899 Va. LEXIS 57 (1899). When a trust is discretionary or one of personal confidence, this section does not apply; otherwise it does apply, although the trustee be invested with the legal title. Roller v. Catlett, 118 Va. 185, 86 S.E. 909, 1915 Va. LEXIS 138 (1915), writ of error dismissed, 245 U.S. 632, 38 S. Ct. 133, 62 L. Ed. 521, 1917 U.S. LEXIS 1748 (1917). Proceeding under section determines nothing as to character of deed.  A proceeding by motion under this section to substitute a new trustee in a deed of trust to secure a debt, determines nothing as to the rights of the parties unde r the deed, nor as to the character of the deed. Pettus v. Atlantic Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 94 Va. 477, 26 S.E. 834, 1897 Va. LEXIS 97 (1897). Jurisdiction of court.  Where a deed was properly recorded in the County of Prince George, the City of Hopewell not then being in existence, but after the incorporation of the City of Ho pewell, the land conveyed by the deed of trust being situated in the city as incorporated, the deed of trust was recorded in the clerks office of the corporation court of the City of Hopewell, the corporation court of the City of Hopewell had jurisdi ction of the subject matter of the proceeding to appoint a new trustee insofar as such jurisdiction depended upon the place of recordation of the deed of trust. Abrahams v. Ball, 122 Va. 197, 94 S.E. 799, 1918 Va. LEXIS 87 (1918). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Section does not apply t o discretionary trust.  Where the three original testamentary trustees had discretionary powers, the trust could be implemented in accordance with its terms by the surviving trustees pur suant to former § 26-54; the court, therefore, declined to appoint a successor trustee to replace a deceased trustee under this section. In re Trust of Sams, 59 Va. Cir. 322, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 376 (Richmond Aug. 7, 2002). Jurisdiction of court.  Where the trustees were willing to step aside and either of two courts could entertain a § 26-3 petition to remove them, pursuant to §§ 26-46.2 and 26-48 and in the interest of justice, the beneficiarys action to remove the trustees would be transferred to the court with supervisory authority over the trusts administration. Estate of Mabon, 61 Va. Cir. 420, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 126 (Richmond Apr. 1, 2003). Appointment of trustee.  Entirety of decedents estate was within the residuary estate as certain devises and bequests in the decedents will failed when the designated beneficiary predeceased the decedent and, thus, did not share in the residuary estate as contemplated by the will. Because the charitable trust created by the will was a valid trust with the beneficiary as the designated trustee, a principal beneficiary was not requ ired, the charities maintained an equitable interest in the trust corpus, and a new trustee was to be appointed to oversee the trust.

Reasonable notice of a motion made pursuant to § 64.2-1405 for the appointment of a substitute trustee shall be provided to all persons interested in the execution of the trust other than the moving party. If any interested person is under 18 years of age, the c ircuit court or clerk shall appoint a discreet and competent attorney-at-law as guardian ad litem for such person on whom notice may be served. If any interested person is incapacitated or incarcerated, the notice shall be served on his committee, guardi an, or conservator, if any, or if none exists, the court or clerk shall appoint a discreet and competent attorney-at-law as a guardian ad litem for such person on whom notice may be served. Notice does not need to be given to a trustee or, if one has pre viously been appointed, a substitute trustee who no longer resides the Commonwealth, declined to accept the trust, or resigned, or to the personal representative of a deceased trustee, or to a corporate trustee that has been adjudicated bankrupt or that has lost its charter. B. In the case of the substitution of the trustee in a deed of trust securing the payment of indebtedness, notice of the motion made pursuant to § 64.2-1405 need only be given to the trustee or, if one has previously been appointed, to the substitute trustee unless notice to him is not required pursuant to subsection A; any beneficiaries appearing of record or known to the moving party; any debtors mentioned in the deed of trust; any persons who may be shown by the deed records to have assumed payment of the indeb tedness in whole or in part; and the person in whom the equitable title to the property conveyed by the deed of trust is vested at the time of the motion as shown by the deed records. In such case when the written notice of motion has been filed in the c lerks office of the court having jurisdiction as defined in § 64.2-1405, service of the notice as to all parties mentioned in § 8.01-316 may be made in conformity with the provisions of §§ 8.01-316, 8.01-317, 8.01-318, 8.01-320, 8.01-322, and 8.01-323. C. Any decree or order of substitution heretofore made by a court of competent jurisdiction is hereby validated. D. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a court from substituting a trustee in a suit instituted for that purpose. History History.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under prior law. Substantial compliance necessary.  The proceeding under this section to substitute a new trustee for the original trustee named in the instrument creating the trust is a statutory one and the expre ss requirements of the statute must be at least substantially complied with in order that the court may have the jurisdiction of the subject matter conferred by the statute. Abrahams v. Ball, 122 Va. 197, 94 S.E. 799, 1918 Va. LEXIS 87 (1918). Original trustee is an interested party.  In proceedings under this section to substitute a trustee the original trustee in a deed of trust is interested in the execution of the trust, and is a ne cessary party to the proceeding and the statute requires notice to him of the proceeding. Abrahams v. Ball, 122 Va. 197, 94 S.E. 799, 1918 Va. LEXIS 87 (1918). Record must show parti es in interest had notice.  Where the record does not show that all parties in interest were before the court, or that all such parties had notices, an order substituting another trustee is null, and a sale made by him is void.

The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. New bond relates back.  Where a guardian of an infant, having when he was appointed given a bond with sureties, afterwards, without order requiring it, comes into court and gives another bond with other sureties, the last bond is valid and relates back to his appointment as guardian, and the sureties in the first bond are discharged. Sayers v. Cassell, 64 Va. (23 Gratt.) 525, 1873 Va. LEXIS 52 (1873). Section provides for summary removal of fiduciary.  This section is intended to provide a summary and informal means for the removal of an unsuitable or unfaithful fiduciary. United States Veterans' Bureau v. Thoma s, 156 Va. 902, 159 S.E. 159, 1931 Va. LEXIS 243 (1931); Shands v. Shands, 175 Va. 156, 7 S.E.2d 112, 1940 Va. LEXIS 157 (1940). Provision made is ample.  Ample provision is made by this section and the procedure specifically provided, whereby any person interested in the estate of a lunatic may, for cause shown, ha ve the committee removed, his accounts corrected, his expenditures restrained, and such relief granted as will assure the proper fulfillment by the committee of the duties of his office, without permitting self-constituted next friends to bring, at their discretion, suits with respect to the person or estate of the lunatic. Lake v. Hope, 116 Va. 687, 82 S.E. 738, 1914 Va. LEXIS 78 (1914). And court should act under this sect ion.  When a responsible party brings to the attention of the court matters warranting the removal of a committee of an insane person, the court ordinarily should act b y rule or otherwise under this section. United States Veterans' Bureau v. Thomas, 156 Va. 902, 159 S.E. 159, 1931 Va. LEXIS 243 (1931). Court has power and duty to revoke authority.  Under this section, the court under the order of which a fiduciary derives his authority is vested with the right and duty to revoke and annul his power whenever from any cause it is proper. Nickels v. Horsley, 126 Va. 54, 100 S.E. 831, 1919 Va. LEXIS 74 (1919) (see Reynolds v. Zink, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 29 (1876)). Under this section, the court has the power to remove a fiduciary on evidence adduced before it by any party interested, or, whenever from any cause it appears pr oper, to revoke and annul his powers. Shands v. Shands, 175 Va. 156, 7 S.E.2d 112, 1940 Va. LEXIS 157 (1940). This section has wisely deposited with the court, under the order of which any fiduciary derives his authority, the right and duty to revoke and annul his powers whenever from any cause it appears proper. Clark v. Grasty, 210 Va. 33, 168 S.E.2d 268, 1969 Va. LEXIS 191 (1969). Discretion of court.  A court is vested by this section with a very large discretion in regard to the removal of a fiduciary appointed by it, and while it is a legal discretion, to be exercised in a proper case, an appellate court ought not to interfere, except in a case where manifest injustice has been done, or where it is plain that a proper case has not been made for the exercise of the powers which the legislature has specially c onferred upon that court, from which the fiduciary derives his authority. Nickels v. Horsley, 126 Va. 54, 100 S.E. 831, 1919 Va. LEXIS 74 (1919); Clark v. Grasty, 210 Va. 33, 168 S.E.2d 268, 1969 Va. LEXIS 191 (1969). The removal of a trustee is within the reasonable discretion of the court. More is required to remove a trustee appointed by the creator of the trust than is requ ired to remove one appointed by the court. In all cases the real guide is whether or not it is best for the trust estate that the trustee be removed. Friction between the trustee and the beneficiary is not in itself sufficient ground for removal. Some be neficial end must be achieved by the removal or it will not be justified. Clark v. Grasty, 210 Va. 33, 168 S.E.2d 268, 1969 Va. LEXIS 191 (1969). Veterans Adm inistration may be interested party.  The United States Veterans Bureau (now Veterans Administration), not having a direct beneficial interest in the estate of an incompetent ex-serviceman, ma y not be a party interested in the limited and technical sense, yet where the entire fund in question is the compensation paid to the incompetent by the Veterans Bureau (now Veterans Administration), the Bureau is materially interested in performing its duty and paying the fund over to a proper committee. The fact that it made the award of compensation shows that it is in reality a party interested, and has the right to ask for the removal of the committee. United States Veterans ' Bureau v. Thomas, 156 Va. 902, 159 S.E. 159, 1931 Va. LEXIS 243 (1931) (see also United States Veterans Bureau v. Smith, 156 Va. 897, 159 S.E. 161 (1931)). It is the duty of a guardian whose power as such is revoked to account to his wards, or to his successor as guardian, if there be one, for the estate, including evidences of claim which may have come to his hands; and if after revocation he collects any money on account of any such claim, he and his surety are accountable therefor to the pa rties entitled thereto; at least where such payment is made in good faith by a person who is not informed of the revocation, and who believes when he makes it that the party claiming to be guardian is so in fact, and has authority as such to receive the money. Sage v. Hammonds, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 651, 1876 Va. LEXIS 57 (1876). Grounds of removal held sufficient.  Where the brother of an executor sued the executor on claims assigned by their father sufficient in amount to consume the whole estate, and the executor refused t o make any defense, an order revoking the executors authority is authorized. Reynolds v. Zink, 68 Va. (27 Gratt.) 29, 1876 Va. LEXIS 4 (1876). Where a surviving partner was appointed as administrator of his deceased partner, and failed to return any inventory or appraisement within four months of the dat e of his qualification as required by statute, and it was clear that there were conflicting interests between the administrator, claiming in his own right as surviving partner, and the heirs at law and distributees claiming under the decedent, an order r emoving the administrator was plainly right. Nickels v. Horsley, 126 Va. 54, 100 S.E. 831, 1919 Va. LEXIS 74 (1919). Circuit court did not abuse its discretion or err in removing brothers from their roles as co-executors because the brothers were not getting along, and as a resu lt, the administration of the estate was suffering; the conflict between the brothers led to numerous subsequent resignations, at the expense of the estate, and the brothers could not agree on how to distribute the assets of the estate. Galiotos v. Galio tos, 300 Va. 1, 858 S.E.2d 653, 2021 Va. LEXIS 58 (2021). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Action to remove trustees.  Where the trustees were willing to step aside and either of two courts could entertain a § 26-3 petition to remove them, pursuant to §§ 26-46.2 and 26-48 and in the interest of justice, the beneficiarys action to remove the trustees would be transferred to the court with supervisory authority over the trusts administration. Estate of Mabon, 61 Va. Cir. 420, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 126 (Richmond Apr. 1, 2003). Grounds of removal held sufficient.  Brother was removed as executor because his failure to account for, and pursue, his own debts to the estate, and his failure to carry out the provision of the wil l that required him to distribute the entire estate to the trust upon Fathers death, were sufficient cause for his removal as executor.

If a fiduci ary qualifies pursuant to subsection A, the court or clerk shall issue one or more certificates of qualification pursuant to this section for administration of an estate, guardianship, conservatorship, or committeeship that does not exceed a cumulative t otal of $25,000. Each such certificate shall specify that the maximum amount of estate, guardianship, conservatorship, or committeeship assets that may be collected pursuant to that certificate shall not exceed $25,000. Each such certificate shall: 1. Be ti tled Qualification Certificate for Small Asset Estate; 2. State in a prominent position on the front of such certificate that any person may pay or deliver to the fiduciary named in the certificate any asset belonging, owed, or distributable to the specified deceased person, incapacitated ward, or minor having a value, on the date of payment or delivery, of no more than $25,000. Assets held in a safe deposit box shall not be counted toward such $25,000 limit, and the lessor of a safe deposit box shall not be deemed to know of, and shall have no obligation to determine, the presence or value of any asset in a safe deposit box; 3. State that the certificate (i) may only be used once, (ii) is not effective if it does not have an impression seal of the court clerk and therefore photocopies of the certificate are n ot effective, and (iii) must be retained by the payor; and 4. Bear the impression seal of the court clerk. D. Upon being presented with a certificate of qualification issued pursuant to subsection C, any person may pay or deliver to the fiduciary named in such certificate any asset belonging, owed, or distributable to the specified deceased person, incapacitated ward, or m inor having a value, on the date of payment, of no more than $25,000. The payor shall retain possession of such certificate. Assets held in a safe deposit box shall not be counted toward such $25,000 limit, and the lessor of a safe deposit box shall not be deemed to know of, and shall have no obligation to determine, the presence or value of any asset in a safe deposit box. Any person that makes such payment or delivery upon presentation of a certificate of qualification issued pursuant to subsection C is discharged and released from any or all claims or liabilities for such payment or delivery. Such payor is not required to see the application of such payment or delivery or to inquire into the assets paid or delivered by other parties to a fiduciary t hat qualifies pursuant to subsection A. A person presented with a certificate of qualification issued pursuant to subsection C shall not be liable for, or subject to, any claims, damages, fines or penalties for paying or distributing assets the person be lieved in good faith to have a value of $25,000 or less or for the failure to pay or deliver assets the person believed in good faith to have a value of more than $25,000. E. A court cle rk shall not be liable for any misrepresentations of a personal representative, guardian, conservator, or committee with regard to whether the estate qualifies for the small asset estate exemption under this section or for the performance of any of the c lerks duties under this section, except in the case of the clerks gross negligence or intentional misconduct.

If the circ uit court having jurisdiction of any estate in the process of administration by any guardian, conservator, curator, executor, administrator, trustee, receiver, or other fiduciary, determines that the size of the bond required of the fiduciary would be bu rdensome or for other cause, the court may order a portion or all of the personal assets of the estate, as the court deems proper, to be placed with a designated bank, trust company, or savings institution, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corpor ation or other federal insurance agency and doing business in the Commonwealth, with consideration being given to any bank, trust company, or savings institution proposed by the fiduciary. When the original assets are placed with a designated financial i nstitution, the financial institution shall issue in the name of the estate and file with the court a receipt for such assets and shall give the fiduciary a copy of the receipt. The receipt shall acknowledge that: 1. The o riginal assets received by the financial institution, or the duly collected proceeds from such assets, and all interest, dividends, principal, and other indebtedness subsequently collected by the financial institution on account thereof, are to be held b y the financial institution in safekeeping, subject to such instructions of the fiduciary to the financial institution that have been authorized by orders of the court; and 2. Accountings therefor shall be made to the fiduciary at reasonably frequent intervals agreeable to the fiduciary. After the receipt of the financial institution for the original assets placed with the financial institution has been filed with the court, the court shall enter an order waiving the bond to be given or previously given by the fiduciary or reduce it so that the bond applies only to the estate remaining in the possession of the fiduciary, whichever the court deems best for the estate. B. Whenever th e court has ordered any assets of an estate be placed with a financial institution pursuant to subsection A, any person or corporation having possession or control of any of the assets, or owing interest, dividends, principal, or other indebtedness on ac count thereof, shall, on the due dates thereof, upon the demand of the financial institution whether the fiduciary has duly qualified or not, pay and deliver the assets, interest, dividends, principal, and other indebtedness to the financial institution. The receipt and acceptance thereof by the financial institution shall relieve the person or corporation from all further responsibility. C. Any bank, t rust company, or savings institution designated by the court pursuant to subsection A may accept or reject the designation in any particular instance. The financial institution shall evidence its acceptance or rejection by filing the same with the court or the clerk of the court making the designation within 15 days after actual knowledge of the designation shall have come to the attention of the financial institution. In the event of acceptance, the financial institution shall be allowed as a proper ch arge against the assets placed with it such reasonable amount for its services and expenses as the court making the designation may order.

Executors and Administrators, §§ 69, 317; 12A M.J. Limitation of Actions, § 55. CASE NOTES Editors note. The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. Object of section is to require payment of interest by fiduciary.  The true object of this section is to settle any question which otherwise might arise as to the propriety of charging fiduciaries, and other persons mentioned the rein, with the interest as well as the principal of debts lost by their negligence or improper conduct. Southall's Adm'r v. Taylor, 55 Va. (14 Gratt.) 269, 1858 Va. LEXIS 50 (1858). Failure to proceed promptly with collection of assets due an estate is negligence, for w hich the personal representative may be liable under this section. Isbell v. Flippen, 185 Va. 977, 41 S.E.2d 31, 1947 Va. LEXIS 235 (1947). But action is unnecessary if claim is clearly uncollectible.  Under this section, the administrator is only chargeable with money he fails to collect through his negligence or other improper conduct, and he is not required t o sue for a debt due the estate when it is apparent that the debtor is unable to pay it. Virginia Sur. Co. v. Hilton, 181 Va. 952, 27 S.E.2d 62, 1943 Va. LEXIS 242 (1943). An administrator is bound to plead the statute of limitations to actions on claims not a sserted within the statutory period. It is his duty to interpose this plea not only to protect the decedents estate, but also for the benefit of other creditors, or of legatees or distributees of the decedent. Gwinn v. Farrier, 159 Va. 183, 165 S.E. 647, 1932 Va. LEXIS 182 (1932); Soble v. Herman, 175 Va. 489, 9 S.E.2d 459, 1940 Va. LEXIS 194 (1940). But fiduciary need not plead statute when it is inapplicable.  The provision of this section that an administrator shall have no credit for a claim which he pays, knowing facts whereby recovery could be prevented, does not re quire him to plead the statute of limitations to a claim apparently barred, where he knows facts making the statute inapplicable. Radford v. Fowlkes, 85 Va. 820, 8 S.E. 817, 1889 Va. LEXIS 94 (1889). He must make any def ense decedent could have made.  No estate is lawfully administered where the personal representative has neglected or failed to make any defense of which the decedent, if living, could have avai led himself. Smith v. Pattie, 81 Va. 654, 1886 Va. LEXIS 132 (1886). And trustee paying barred claim has no right of contribution.  The trustee of one of two joint obligors, who, in violation of this section, pays the entire debt after it has become barred by the statute of limitations, has no right of contribution against the estate of the other obligor. Turner v. Thom, 89 Va. 745, 17 S.E. 323, 1893 Va. LEXIS 98 (1893). Standard of care applicable to a ttorneys.  The law implies a promise that an attorney will exercise a reasonable degree of care, skill, and dispatch in carrying out the business for which he is employed, a nd the same standard of reasonable care applies to all attorneys in the performance of their professional duties, but the contractual obligations will, of course, vary widely from client to client and case to case. Ortiz v. Barrett, 222 Va. 118, 278 S.E. 2d 833, 1981 Va. LEXIS 282 (1981). Liability of local attorney hired by foreign attorney.  Where a foreign attorney hires a local attorney to perform services on an hourly basis, and where the foreign attorney remains lead counsel in the action and the local attorney has no direct contact with the client, the local attorney does not escape liability to the client for his negligence in the discharge of his assigned duties since he has an implied obligation to act with reasonable care.

As used in this section, fiduciary has the same meaning as provided in § 8.01-2, except that it shall not include trustees subject to the requirements and provisions of the Uniform Trust Code (§ 64.2-700 et seq.). B. Any power v ested in three or more fiduciaries may be exercised by a majority of the fiduciaries, but a fiduciary who has not joined in exercising a power is not liable to the beneficiaries or to others for the consequences of the exercise. A dissenting fiduciary is not liable for the consequences of an act in which he joins at the direction of the majority of the fiduciaries if he expressed his dissent in writing to any of his cofiduciaries, if the act is not of itself a patent breach of trust. C. A fiduciary shall be answerable and accountable only for his own acts, receipts, neglects, or defaults, and not for those of any cofiduciary, or for those of any banker, broker, or other person with whom the trust money or securities may be lawfully deposited, or f or any loss that does not result from his own default or negligence. D. Whenever th e instrument under which a fiduciary or fiduciaries are acting reserves the authority to direct the making or retention of any investment for the settlor, testator, or creator or vests such authority in an advisory or investment committee or any other pe rson, including a cofiduciary, to the exclusion of the fiduciary or the exclusion of one or more of several fiduciaries,, the excluded fiduciary or cofiduciary shall be liable, if at all, only as a ministerial agent and shall not be liable as fiduciary o r cofiduciary for any loss resulting from the making or retention of any investment pursuant to such authorized direction. E. This sectio n does not excuse a cofiduciary from liability for failing to (i) participate in the administration of trust, (ii) attempt to prevent a breach of trust, or (iii) seek advice and guidance from the circuit court in an apparently recurring situation unless otherwise expressly provided by the instrument under which the cofiduciary is acting.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Editors note.  The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. Scope of liability.  Statute recognized the basic principle that the court could not hold a trustee, or anyone else, liable for decisions that it did not and could not have made. Roll ins v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. of Va., 56 Va. Cir. 147, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 146 (Roanoke Apr. 30, 2001). Statute clearly prohibited the imposition of liability on the trustee for failing to do what he had no ability to do. Rollins v. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. of Va. , 56 Va. Cir. 147, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 146 (Roanoke Apr. 30, 2001). Under subsection D, the prohibition on recovery did not excuse a trustee from liability for failing to participate in the administration of the trust or for faili ng to attempt to prevent a breach of trust; thus a trustee could be held liable for a loss caused by his conduct for actions which he was entrusted to take.

The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 26 or prior law. Purpose of section.  This section merely authorizes the court, in a suit against an administrator on a debt due from his decedent, to enter a judgment without an account of the transa ctions of the representative. Such a judgment would ordinarily carry costs with it. To prevent an estate from being depleted by having to bear the costs of litigation against it made necessary by the stubborn and imprudent attitude of the personal repres entative, the court, even where it enters a judgment to be paid out of the estate, may make the representative personally liable for the costs. This is the only effect and purpose of the section. In re Butler, 20 F. Supp. 995, 1937 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1520 (D. Va. 1937). Judgment s hould recite that it is to be paid from estate.  This section does not alter the general rule that, where a judgment against a personal representative should be paid and is intended to be paid from the assets of his decedents estate, the judgment should so recite.

In addition to the provisions of subsection A, if the lender secured by the deed of trust bids the amount secured, including interest through the date of sale and costs of foreclosure, the trustees participation in fixing the bid price by the lender shall not b e deemed improper and the sale shall not be rendered voidable solely by reason of the trustees participation. C. All sales m ade before July 1, 1990, by any trustee by virtue of a deed of trust and any deed made by the trustee in pursuance of such sales are hereby declared to be valid and effective in all respects, if otherwise valid according to laws then in force, the same a s if the trustee had not been a stockholder, member, employee, officer, or director of, or counsel to, the corporation thereby secured.

CASE NOTES Voidable transactions.  Virginia law deems that a conflict of interest such as a breach of faith or fiduciary duty by officers of the trustee makes a transaction voidable by the plaintif f-debtor, not void, thus rendering that defense useless against a holder in due course. Resolution Trust Corp. v. Maplewood Invs., 31 F.3d 1276, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 19485 (4th Cir. 1994) (decided under prior law). Relationship to federal law.  Because state law granted state banks, but not national banks with no principal office in Virginia, the power to act as a deed of trust trustee and foreclose, a p ower incidental to a national banks real estate lending power, the National Bank Act preempted state law, and, even if trustees referred to a different type of trustee, deed of trust trustees fit within the catch-all provision, which applied the National Bank Act to national banks serving in any other fiduciary capacity, and, Virginia law governing fiduciaries included provisions applying explicitly to deed of trust trustees.

A natural p erson who is not a resident of the Commonwealth may be appointed or allowed to qualify or act as the personal representative, or trustee under a will, of any decedent, or appointed as the guardian of an infants estate or the guardian or conservator o f the property of an incapacitated person under Chapter 20 (§ 64.2-2000 et seq.) or Chapter 21 (§ 64.2-2100 et seq.).Qualification of such person as a personal representative, or trustee under a will, of any decedent shall be subject to the provisi ons of Article 1 (§ 64.2-500 et seq.) of Chapter 5.At the time of qualification or appointment, each such nonresident shall file with the clerk of the circuit court of the jurisdiction wherein the qualification is had or appointment is made his consen t in writing that service of process in any action or proceeding against him as personal representative, trustee under a will, conservator, or guardian, or any other notice with respect to the administration of the estate, trust, or person in his charge in the Commonwealth may be by service upon the clerk of the court in which he is qualified or appointed, or upon such resident of the Commonwealth and at such address as the nonresident may appoint in the written instrument. In the event of the death, re moval, resignation, or absence from the Commonwealth of a resident agent or any successor named by a similar instrument filed with the clerk, or if a resident agent or any such successor cannot with due diligence be found for service at the address desig nated in such instrument, then any process or notice may be served on the clerk of the circuit court. Notwithstanding §§ 64.2-505 and 64.2-2011, where any nonresident qualifies, other than as a guardian of an incapacitated person, pursuant to this subsection, bond with surety shall be required in every case, unless a resident personal representative, trustee, or fiduciary qualifies at the same time or the court or clerk making the appointment waives surety under the provisions of § 64.2-1411. B. A corporati on shall not be appointed or allowed to qualify or act as personal representative, as trustee under a will, or as one of the personal representatives or trustees under a will of any decedent, or appointed or allowed to qualify or act as guardian of an in fant, as one of the guardians of an infant, as guardian of the person or property of an incapacitated person under Chapter 20 (§ 64.2-2000 et seq.) or Chapter 21 (§ 64.2-2100 et seq.), or as one of the guardians or conservators, unless the corporat ion is authorized to do business in the Commonwealth. Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the validity of any appointment or qualification made prior to January 1, 1962, nor to affect in any way the other provisions of this chapter or of § 64.2-609. The provisions of this section shall not authorize or allow any appointment or qualification prohibited by § 6.2-803. C. The fact th at an individual nominated or appointed as the guardian of the person of an infant is not a resident of the Commonwealth shall not prevent the qualification of the individual to serve as the sole guardian of the person of the infant.

The 1950 amendment to this section deals with fiduciaries acting in Virginia generally a nd not with the Virginia Wrongful Death Act. Kaufmann v. Service Trucking Co., 139 F. Supp. 1, 1956 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3565 (D. Md. 1956). Validity of deed of trust to resident and nonresident trustees.  There is no authority for the statement that a deed of trust made in this state to two trustees, one being a resident of Virginia and the other being a nonresiden t, would be invalid. It seems that such a claim is impliedly contradicted by the provisions of this section. Woodhouse v. Burling, 76 F.2d 446, 1935 U.S. App. LEXIS 2574 (D.C. 1935). Foreign personal representative.  Since the 1950 amendment of this section a personal representative, who is not a resident of Virginia and who has not qualified or been appointed as such in the s tate, cannot maintain an action in a United States district court sitting in Virginia, under the Virginia Statute of Death by Wrongful Act. Holt v. Middlebrook, 214 F.2d 187, 1954 U.S. App. LEXIS 4231 (4th Cir. 1954). A nonresident personal representative who was not qualified in Virginia under this section could not maintain an action in a federal district court sitting in Vir ginia, under either the wrongful death act of Virginia or that of North Carolina, under which the personal representative is the only party having the right to sue. Mozingo v. Consolidated Constr. Co., 171 F. Supp. 396, 1959 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4021 (D. Va. 1959). A nonresident personal representative as sole plaintiff cannot maintain an action for death by wrongful act in a federal court in Virginia against a resident of V irginia. The effect of this rule is to divest the federal courts in this state of jurisdiction in any action for death by wrongful act against a resident of Virginia, since there will be a citizen of Virginia on each side of the controversy and the requi rements of diversity jurisdiction will not be satisfied. Rodgers v. Irvine, 161 F. Supp. 784, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2341 (D. Va. 1957), aff'd, 254 F.2d 224, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3991 (4th Cir. 1958) (see note to § 8.01-50). Section 8.01-50 and this section prohibit an Ohio administrator from instituting an action for wrongful death in Virginia. Goranson v. Capital Airlines, 221 F. Su pp. 820, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6731 (E.D. Va. 1963), cert. denied, Goranson v. Capital Airlines, Inc., 382 U.S. 984, 86 S. Ct. 560, 15 L. Ed. 2d 473, 1966 U.S. LEXIS 2623 (1966). Where a surviving wife was not qualified as a personal representative in any state when the wife filed a wrongful death suit in Virginia under § 26-59 and subs ection B of § 8.01-50, the wife lacked standing to maintain the action; therefore, the statute of limitations was not tolled by subsection B of § 8.01-244 and the action was properly dismissed. Fowler v. Winchester Med. Ctr., Inc., 266 Va. 131, 580 S.E.2d 816, 2003 Va. LEXIS 68 (2003). Guardian appointed in another state.  This section does not require that a guardian appointed and qualified in another state must, in order to bring suit in Virginia, associate a resident coguardian a s plaintiff. Vroon v. Templin, 278 F.2d 345, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 4786 (4th Cir. 1960). The amendment of 1950 did not alter in any way the inhibition placed against guardians. The words or act in the first sentence relate to personal represen tatives, but not to guardians. As to guardians the section remains unchanged, and the only prohibition against nonresidents is to their appointment in Virginia. Vroon v. Templin, 278 F.2d 345, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 4786 (4th Cir. 1960). Waiver where defendants did not properly challenge nonresidents right to maintain action.  Where defendants did not properly and seasonably challenge the nonresident administrators right to maintain the action in the trial court, they waived the iss ue, and it could not be raised for the first time on appeal. Wackwitz v. Roy, 244 Va. 60, 418 S.E.2d 861, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3230, 1992 Va. LEXIS 58 (1992). This section bars nonresident administrators from maintaining wrongful death actions. Wa ckwitz v. Roy, 244 Va. 60, 418 S.E.2d 861, 8 Va. Law Rep. 3230, 1992 Va. LEXIS 58 (1992). Statute of limitations begins to run on date foreign representative is qualified in Virginia.  Overruling prior precedent as to the running of the statute of limitations, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed a trial courts judgment dismissing a person al representatives motion for judgment on a personal injury action against a physician as untimely under subdivision B 1 of § 8.01-229 where her qualification as a personal representative in another state and her prior motion for judgment filed wh ile she was a foreign representative had no legal effect due to her lack of standing; the statute of limitations commenced upon the date she qualified as personal representative in Virginia. Harmon v. Sadjadi, 273 Va. 184, 639 S.E.2d 294, 2007 Va. LEXIS 1 (2007). McDaniel v. North Carolina Pulp Co., 198 Va. 612, 95 S.E.2d 201 (1956), which concerned the running of the statute of limitations, was overruled as there was no b asis to carve out an exception to the otherwise clear precedent that lack of standing caused a partys legal proceeding to be of no legal effect. Harmon v. Sadjadi, 273 Va. 184, 639 S.E.2d 294, 2007 Va. LEXIS 1 (2007). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statute of limitations not tolled where plaintiff not qualified as personal representative.  Plaintiff parents did not qualify as the personal representatives of their deceased childs estate under subsection B of § 8.01-50 and, therefore, in their wrongful death action brought against a property management corporation, the corporations plea in bar was granted with prejudice since the two-year statute of limitations had expired the day after the parents brought suit, thereby preventing joinder of a personal representative...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-1427"><akn:num>§ 64.2-1427</akn:num><akn:heading>How property of nonresident infant or incapacitated person transferred to foreign guardian, conservator, or committee</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When any nonresident infant or incapacitated person is entitled to property or money in the Commonwealth, a petition to remove the property or money to the domicile of the infant or incapacitated person may be filed by his guardian, conservator, committee, or other fiduciary lawfully appointed and qualified in the state or country of his residence, in the circuit court of the county or city in which the property or mon ey, or some part thereof, is located. If entitlement to the property or money was acquired other than by a will or was acquired by a will that restricts the transfer out of the Commonwealth, the infant or incapacitated person, and the guardian of the inf ant or the conservator or other fiduciary of the incapacitated person appointed in the Commonwealth, if there is one, shall be made a party defendant to this petition. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the infant or incapacitated person who , as well as the conservator or other fiduciary, if there is one, shall answer the petition on oath. Upon a hearing of the case on its merits, or upon the petition without hearing if entitlement to the property or money was acquired by a will that does n ot restrict the transfer out of the Commonwealth, the court may order the fiduciary to pay and deliver to the foreign guardian, conservator, committee, or fiduciary, or his agent or attorney, all personal property and money in his possession belonging to the infant or incapacitated person, and authorize the foreign guardian, conservator, committee, or fiduciary to sue for, recover, and receive all money and personal property, including the accruing rents of his real estate, that belongs to the infant or incapacitated person in the same manner as if he were appointed a guardian, conservator, committee, or fiduciary of the infant or incapacitated person in the Commonwealth, and to remove the money and personal property to the state or country in which th e foreign fiduciary was appointed and qualified.

Annotations CASE NOTES Application of foreign guardian for removal of wards effects.  The application of a foreign guardian, under this section and § 26-61, for the removal of the effects of his ward out of the state, is a separate and distinct proceeding from a suit by a creditor to administer the assets of the estate of the wards deceased ancestor. Clendenning v. Conrad, 91 Va. 410, 21 S.E. 818, 1895 Va. LEXIS 38 (1895) (decided under prior law).

Clendenning v. Conrad, 91 Va. 410, 21 S.E. 818, 1895 Va. LEXIS 38 (1895). Protection of righ ts when removal order improper.  Although the application by a foreign guardian for the removal of the assets from the Commonwealth is a summary proceeding, four weeks notice must be given by publication. And if the court finds that the order for removal was improper, it may take all necessary steps to protect the rights of all involved. Clendenning v. Conrad, 91 Va. 410, 21 S.E. 818, 1895 Va.

If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the occurrence of a future event or contingency, the principal, in the power of attorney, may authorize one or more persons to determine in a writing or other record that the event or contingency has occurred. C. If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the principals incapacity and the principal has not authorized a person to determine whether the principal is incapacitated, or the person authorized is unable or unwilling to make the determination, the power of at torney becomes effective upon a determination in a writing or other record by (i) the principals attending physician and a second physician or licensed clinical psychologist after personal examination of the principal that the principal is incapacita ted within the meaning of subdivision 1 of the definition of incapacity in § 64.2-1600 or (ii) an attorney-at-law, a judge, or an appropriate governmental official that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning of subdivision 1 of the definiti on of incapacity in § 64.2-1600.

The petition may be filed in the circuit court of the county or city in which the agent resides or has his principal place of employment, or, if a nonresident, in any court in which a determination of incompetency or incapacity of the principal is proper under Chapter 20 (§ 64.2-2000 et seq.), or, if a conservator or guardian has been appointed for the principal, in the court that made the appointment. The court, after reasonable n otice to the agent and to the principal, if no guardian or conservator has been appointed, or to the conservator or guardian, if one has been appointed, may conduct a hearing on the petition. The court, upon the hearing on the petition and upon considera tion of the interest of the principal and his estate, may dismiss the petition or may enter such order or orders respecting discovery as it may deem appropriate, including an order that the agent respond to all discovery methods that the petitioner might employ in a civil action or suit subject to the Rules of Supreme Court of Virginia. Upon the failure of the agent to make discovery, the court may make and enforce further orders respecting discovery that would be proper in a civil action subject to suc h Rules and may award expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, as therein provided. Furthermore, upon completion of discovery, the court, if satisfied that prior to filing the petition the petitioner had requested the information or records that are the subject of ordered discovery pursuant to § 64.2-1612, may, upon finding that the failure to comply with the request for information was unreasonable, order the agent to pay the petitioners expenses in obtaining discovery, including reasonable attorney fees. 3. A determination to grant or deny in whole or in part discovery sought hereunder shall not be considered a finding regarding the competence, capacity, or impairment of the principal, no r shall the granting or denial of discovery hereunder preclude the availability of other remedies involving protection of the person or estate of the principal or the rights and duties of the agent.

D. Upon motion by the principal, the court shall dismiss a petition filed under this section, unless the court finds that the principal lacks capacity to revoke the agents authority or the power of attorney. E. In a judici al proceeding under this chapter, if the court finds that the agent breached his fiduciary duty in violation of the provisions of this chapter, the court, as justice and equity may require, may award costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees , to any person who petitions the court for relief under subdivisions A 1 through 8, to be paid by the agent found in violation.

Cause of action st ated under Power of Attorney Act.  Banks demurrer was overruled because a decedents son stated a claim under the Power of Attorney Act since if the allegations were proven, the circuit cour t could mandate the bank to accept the power of attorney and honor the transaction the decedent intended to make through the son as his agent; the payment by the bank to another party would be its own loss, having taken the risk of refusing the power of attorney before receiving an opinion of counsel.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Statute of limitations.  When a decedents son presented a power of attorney to a bank he was acting not only as agent but as the decedents intended beneficiary, and the Uniform Po wer of Attorney Act recognized a property interest in such a beneficiary and conferred standing on the son to assert that property interest; thus, the son incurred damages as a result of the alleged violation of the Power of Attorney Act well within the five-year limitation period for property damage. Lance v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 99 Va. Cir. 115, 2018 Va. Cir. LEXIS 132 (Chesapeake June 29, 2018). Punitive damages.  While statute does not abrogate any other means employed to redress an injury, it does not affect the availability vel non of damages and thus does not permit com pensation other than what is otherwise expressly provided for in the Uniform Power of Attorney Act, which is only the restoration of the lost value of the principals property and fees and costs.

Subject to the provisions of subsection H, an agent under a power of attorney may do the following on behalf of the principal or with the principals property only if the power of attorney expressly grants the agent the authority and exercise of the authority is not otherwise prohibited or limited by another statute, agreement, or instrument to which the authority or property is subject: 1.

C. Subject to subsections A, B, D, and E, if a power of attorney grants to an agent authority to do all acts that a principal could do, the agent has the general authority described in § 64.2-124 and §§ 64.2-1625 through 64.2-1637. D. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides and subject to subsection H, a grant of authority to make a gift is subject to § 64.2-1638. E.

H. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection A, if a power of attorney grants to an agent authority to do all acts that a principal could do, the agent shall have the authority to make gifts in any amount of any of the principals property to any individuals or to organizations described in §§ 170(c) and 2522(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or corresponding future provisions of federal tax law, or both, in accordance with the principals personal history of making or joining in the making of lifetime g ifts. This subsection shall not in any way impair the right or power of any principal, by express words in the power of attorney, to authorize, or limit the authority of, an agent to make gifts of the principals property.

CASE NOTES Change of beneficiary authorized.  Language in power of attorney authorized the daughter to change the beneficiary of an IRA where the decedent provided the attorney-in-fact with the power to manag e qualified retirement plans and individual retirement accounts, including but not limited to the exercise of all rights, privileges, elections, and options that he had with regard to any individual retirement account, and the decedent obviously had the right to designate beneficiaries. Reineck v. Lemen, 292 Va. 710, 792 S.E.2d 269, 2016 Va. LEXIS 178 (2016). Transfers of property.  Because sell and convey in a power of attorney, strictly construed, was not an express grant of authority to the decedents mother to make gifts or oth er transfers for inadequate consideration, the circuit court erred in holding the power of attorney expressly authorized her to give away the decedents real and personal property; sell and convey contemplated a transfer be for adequate consid eration and did not expressly authorize the gifts of the decedents property granted by the mother. Davis v. Davis, 298 Va. 157, 835 S.E.2d 888, 2019 Va. LEXIS 150 (2019). Gifts.  Insufficient evidence supported the conclusion that a mothers transfers were in accordance with the decedents personal history of making lifetime gifts, a nd thus, the circuit court erred in holding that the mother was authorized to gift the decedents real and personal property to herself and her surviving children; the transfers shared no similarities with the decedents prior purported gifts, and the nature, amount, purpose, and timing of the gifts made them akin to testamentary gifts. Davis v. Davis, 298 Va. 157, 835 S.E.2d 888, 2019 Va. LEXIS 150 (2019). Circuit court erred in concluding that the gifts made by a decedents mother were in accordance with the prior purported gifts given by the decedent; because t here was valid consideration, a 90-year lease and the use of leased property as collateral were not gifts made by a decedent.

The annotations below were decided under former similar statutory provisions in Title 31 or prior law. Guardianship, legal custod y distinguished.  The distinction between legal custody and guardianship is a reflection of the extent of the power over and the responsibility to the child involve d in each. Thus, in the Commonwealth, legal custody is the right to have physical charge of the child and generally direct the day-to-day activities of the childs life. Guardianship of the person and estate of a child, by contrast, is a broader power to have the custody of the ward and the right to take possession of the wards estate, real and personal, and out of the proceeds of such estate provide for the wards maintenance and education. Additionally, the legal custodian, while being requi red to provide the child, is not fiduciary or guarantor of the child. Rather, it is the guardian of the person and estate who carries the burden of managing the wards estate and making good the lawful debts of his ward. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). Role of guardian.  Although the Code of Virginia does not define the term guardian, implicit in the statutes is a recognition that a guardian is a person who has either the custody and control of the estate of a minor or the custody of the person of a minor, or both. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). The authority conferred by this section is limited to those named in the statute, and do es not extend to grandparents. Hayes v. Strauss, 151 Va. 136, 144 S.E. 432, 1928 Va. LEXIS 218 (1928). Second marriage does not deprive a mother of the right to custody of her child, where th ere is no legal guardian of the child. Armstrong v. Stone, 50 Va. (9 Gratt.) 102, 1852 Va. LEXIS 52 (1852). Upon the death of the parent who has held custody under a divorce decree, the right to c ustody automatically inures to the surviving parent. Judd v. Van Horn, 195 Va. 988, 81 S.E.2d 432, 1954 Va. LEXIS 176 (1954). Custody was properly awarded to the mother (rather than the stepmother or grandmother) after the death of the childs father, who had previously been awarded c ustody after divorce and remarriage. Jones v. Henson, 202 Va. 738, 120 S.E.2d 286, 1961 Va. LEXIS 172 (1961). Duty to support children.  As a parents duty to support children is based largely upon the right to their custody and control, it follows that a mother, after death of the father, has a duty to support her children. Commonwealth v. Shepard, 212 Va. 843, 188 S.E.2d 99, 1972 Va. LEXIS 280 (1972). Burden of showing existence of circumstances which would deprive the parents of their right to custody is on the person opposing the right, and the evidence justifying the separation of a child from its parents must be cogent and convincing. Phillips v. Kiraly, 200 Va. 345, 105 S.E.2d 855, 1958 Va. LEXIS 194 (1958); Jones v. Henso n, 202 Va. 738, 120 S.E.2d 286, 1961 Va. LEXIS 172 (1961). Hostility of divorced parents toward each other as grounds for denying either custody.  In a custody dispute arising out of a divorce action, the conscientious concern that if the children were placed in the custody of either parent, the open hostili ty that the parties have exhibited toward each other would be harmful to the children, being one common to most divorce cases involving custody disputes, did not, standing alone, constitute an extraordinary reason for taking a child from its parent, or p arents. James v. James, 230 Va. 51, 334 S.E.2d 551, 1985 Va. LEXIS 249 (1985). Necessity of notic e prior to transfer proceeding.  Reasonable notice to all interested parties is required in a proceeding involving a private petition for the transfer of guardianship of a minor child to protect the rights of such parties and to ensure the best interests of the child. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). Incorrect us e of balancing test in transfer analysis.  Where it is established that the petition seeking legal guardianship of the person of a minor child is unopposed by the childs natural guardian(s) and occurs subsequent to or contemporaneously with a voluntary temporary transfer of custody to the prospective legal guardian of the person of the child, the chancellor, in determining whether to grant the petition, applied an incorrect standard by balancing a pot ential financial benefit to the prospective legal guardian of the person against the best interests of the child. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). Showing of abuse.  Absent some showing that plaintiff had been divested of or had abused her statutory capacity as natural guardian, under this section, she remained the proper pers on to receive payments and to be the contingent payee for those funds. Parrish v. Jessee, 250 Va. 514, 464 S.E.2d 141, 1995 Va. LEXIS 130 (1995). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Duty to support children.  Where the decedent died just after being born, the administrator was not entitled to collect under the parents homeowners policy that excluded residents o f the household; the decedent was a resident of household, in part, because under § 31-1, the parents had a duty to support and protect the decedent. Harrell v. Shelby Cas. Ins. Co., 58 Va. Cir. 484, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Norfolk May 6, 2002). Residence of minor.  Parent has a duty imposed by statute and natural law to support and protect his legitimate children; infant child who died from injuries from a traffic accident a nd who had spent her entire life in hospitals was a permanent resident of her parents household. Harrell v. Shelby Cas. Ins. Co., 58 Va. Cir. 484, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 165 (Norfolk May 6, 2002).

Most of the cases below were decided under prior law. Role of guardian.  Although the Code of Virginia does not define the term guardian, implicit in the statutes is a recognition that a guardian is a person who has either the custody and control of the estate of a minor or the custody of the person of a minor, or both. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). Grounds for denial of guardiansh ip award.  Where it appears that the parties are attempting to accomplish some fraud or abuse of the power of guardianship, the transfer is not in the best interests of the child. Additionally, the chancellor, in determining the best interests of the child, may decline to award guardianship to any person deemed by him to be incompetent to discharge the duties of that office. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). Necessity of notic e prior to transfer proceeding.  Reasonable notice to all interested parties is required in a proceeding involving a private petition for the transfer of guardianship of a minor child to protect the rights of such parties and to ensure the best interests of the child. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). Use of best in terests analysis in transfer decision.  Where the grandparents had legal custody of the child, the chancellors consideration of a petition for transfer of guardianship is limited to a determination of whether the transfer is in the best interests of the child, and the chancellor should therefore deny such a petition only where it appears from the record that the transfer of guardianship of the person would be detrimental to the best interests of th e child. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). Incorrect us e of balancing test in transfer analysis.  Where it is established that the petition seeking legal guardianship of the person of a minor child is unopposed by the childs natural guardian(s) and occurs subsequent to or contemporaneously with a voluntary temporary transfer of custody to the prospective legal guardian of the person of the child, the chancellor, in determining whether to grant the petition, applied an incorrect standard by balancing a pot ential financial benefit to the prospective legal guardian of the person against the best interests of the child. In re O'Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). In surer may condition coverage on obtaining guardianship.  Because the statutory definition of legal custody in this Commonwealth includes the power to direct medical care, legal guardianship of the person was not a neces sary legal status for grandparents who had such custody to obtain to direct such care for their granddaughter. However, the status of legal custodian does not require a non-governmental entity such as their insurance carrier to recognize their financial responsibility for her medical care. Therefore, their insurance carrier could decline to recognize the child as an insured person until the grandparents obtained the status of legal guardians of the person in order to comply with their contract. In re O' Neil, 18 Va. App. 674, 446 S.E.2d 475, 11 Va. Law Rep. 51, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 485 (1994). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Jurisdiction.  Circuit court did not have the authority to appoint maternal grandparents as guardians over their minor grandchild while the childs father was living and reta ined legal custody of the child. Moreover, an available and appropriate legal avenue existed for the grandparents in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court in the form of a petition for joint custody with the father.

B.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases annotated below were decided under prior law. Former § 37.1-132 was designed to safeguard the property of incompetent persons from dissipation by their own improvidence and to preserve it for their own support and maintenance and, incidentally, for the benefit of the heirs or legatees and devisees. Gilmer v. Brown, 186 Va. 630, 44 S.E.2d 16, 1947 Va. LEXIS 186 (1947) (construing for mer § 37-140). Appointment as evidence of mental incapacity.  The appointment of a guardian or committee under this section (referring to former § 37-140) should not be regarded as prima facie evidence of mental incapacit y, but the order of such appointment should be admitted as pertinent evidence to be given such weight as the jury may determine. Gilmer v. Brown, 186 Va. 630, 44 S.E.2d 16, 1947 Va. LEXIS 186 (1947); Tate v. Chumbley, 190 Va. 480, 57 S.E.2d 151, 1950 Va. LEXIS 146 (1950). Incurring of debts in sale of wards real estate.  Upon the exhaustion of a wards liquid assets and personal estate, the wards committee would be justified in selling the wards real estate. As this wou ld require a court order, the committee may, of necessity, be required to incur debts and obligations on behalf of its ward. Carter v. Cavalier Cent. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 223 Va. 571, 292 S.E.2d 305, 1982 Va. LEXIS 240 (1982). Bankruptcy petition.  Physically incapacitated debtor could not file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition through his wife by virtue of her power of attorney, but he could file by means of a court-appointed guardian having specific authorization to file bankruptcy on his behalf. In re Smith, 115 Bankr. 84, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 1214 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1990). Jurisdiction.  Former § 37.1-132 conferred jurisdiction on the circuit court where the allegedly impaired person is located or in which such person is a resident. Mazur v. Wo odson, 932 F. Supp. 144, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8936 (E.D. Va. 1996). Mere presence in a state is sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the states courts for matters relating to the oversight of the mentally ill or incapacitated. Mazur v. Woodson, 932 F. Supp. 144, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8936 (E.D. Va. 1996). When trial courts findings affirmed on appeal.  It is a question of fact as to whether an incompetent is capable of managing his property, and a finding by the trial court that a person is or is not so capable, if supported by the evidence, will be affirmed by the Supreme Court. Schmidt v. Goddin, 224 Va. 474, 297 S.E.2d 701, 1982 Va. LEXIS 317 (1982). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Fees.  Respondents argued that the court had discretion to apportion guardian ad litem fees and should do so as petitioner nonsuited her claims, but the nonsuit statute no longer provided a penalty for vexing an opponent; a guardian ad litem is not an expert witness, but rather an attorney appointed to represent the interests of the respondents, and the nonsuit statute did not provide any support for the relief responde nts requested.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Divorce of incapacitated person.  Husband could not proceed with a divorce case by using the husbands sibling as an agent under a general power of attorney grantedbecause a general power of at torney did not permit an agent to maintain a divorce action for an incapacitated person. The circuit court further found that the husband had to first obtain a guardian to maintain the divorce. Heu v. Kim, 107 Va. Cir. 100, 2021 Va. Cir. LEXIS 7 (Fairfax County Jan. 8, 2021). Pro se filing by the appointed guard ian.  Complaint for divorce, which was filed pro se by the appointed guardian for the husband, who was an incapacitated adult, was a legal nullity because, while the gu ardian was statutorily vested with the right of action, the guardians surrogate status precluded the guardian from filing the complaint pro se as the guardian was only acting in a representative capacity for the true party in interest, the incapacita ted person. Furthermore, as a non-lawyer, the guardian engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. Somuah v. Ofusu-Appiah, 2023 Va. Cir.

At all time s the conservator shall exercise reasonable care, diligence, and prudence and shall act in the best interest of the incapacitated person. To the extent known to him, a conservator shall consider the expressed desires and personal values of the incapacita ted person. B. Subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in the conservatorship order, the conservator shall take care of and preserve the estate of the incapacitated person and manage it to the best advantage. The conservator shall apply the income from the estate, or s o much as may be necessary, to the payment of the debts of the incapacitated person, including payment of reasonable compensation to himself and to any guardian appointed, and to the maintenance of the person and of his legal dependents, if any, and, to the extent that the income is not sufficient, he shall so apply the corpus of the estate. C. A conservat or shall, to the extent feasible, encourage the incapacitated person to participate in decisions, to act on his own behalf, and to develop or regain the capacity to manage the estate and his financial affairs. A conservator also shall consider the size o f the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship, the incapacitated persons accustomed manner of living, other resources known to the conservator to be available, and the recommendations of the guardian. D. A conservat or stands in a fiduciary relationship to the incapacitated person for whom he was appointed conservator and may be held personally liable for a breach of any fiduciary duty.

Committee has management o f wards property.  A committee is appointed for the purpose of securing a competent person to manage the property of an incompetent adult. The ownership of the property remains in t he incompetent. Its management alone is transferred to the committee for preservation and such wise expenditure as may be most beneficial to the incompetent owner. Somers v. Godwin, 182 Va. 144, 27 S.E.2d 909, 1943 Va. LEXIS 143 (1943). While it is the duty of the committee to render his accounts annually before a commissioner of the court in which he qualified (§ 26-17), he has absolute contr ol and management of his wards estate, and § 26-38, which authorizes the court to order money in the hands of any fiduciary to be invested, etc., and the statute relative to the payment of taxes on funds under the control of the court, have no app lication to funds in the hands of a committee or other fiduciary who is the representative of, or holds the estate of, a person under disability, such fiduciary being at all times liable for interest upon the annual balances in his hands. Said statutes o nly apply to such fiduciaries as represent the court and are the means by which the court holds and controls the fund in its charge. Hurt v. City of Bristol, 104 Va. 213, 51 S.E. 223, 1905 Va. LEXIS 88 (1905) (see Merchants Admr v. Shry, 116 Va. 437, 82 S.E. 106 (1914)). Power of guardian or committee to incur obligations for necessities.  While the general rule is that a guardian is without power to bind a ward or his estate by contract, a guardian or committee of an incompetent may incur obligatio ns for necessaries, such as care and support of his ward, without the prior approval of the court. Carter v. Cavalier Cent. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 223 Va. 571, 292 S.E.2d 305, 1982 Va. LEXIS 240 (1982). Conversion of realty to personalty or personalty to realty through purc hase of security at foreclosure sale.  On appeal from a decree directing a trustee to execute and deliver to the committee of an insane person a deed to real estate sold under foreclosure proceedings a t public auction, the trustee contended that the purchase of the property by the committee would have converted his wards estate from personalty to realty, which he had no legal right to do without the sanction of a court of competent jurisdiction. T he wards personal funds had been invested by a prior committee in a bond secured by the real estate involved. The trial court, prior to the completion of the sale and transfer of the property, approved and confirmed its purchase by the committee as f or the best interest of the ward. It was held that the committee was clothed with an implied power under former version of this section to bid on the property to prevent the trust estate from being deprived of its security at less than its fair value; an d under all of the circumstances, the spirit of the rule requiring the consent of the court had been observed. Somers v. Godwin, 182 Va. 144, 27 S.E.2d 909, 1943 Va. LEXIS 143 (1943). The proceeds of land sold during incompetency of testatrix should not share with the per sonal estate in payment of her expenses during incompetency. Bryson v. Turnbull, 194 Va. 528, 74 S.E.2d 180, 1953 Va. LEXIS 115 (1953). The paramount duty of the committee is to attend to his wards wants and comforts and to furnish him so far as the funds in his hands will allow, with not only all the necessaries of life, but all the proper recreation and amusements consistent with his former habit of living. The care, health and comfort of the ward alone are to be cons idered, and this without reference to the interest of the next of kin, heirs at law and expectants. Lake v. Hope, 116 Va. 687, 82 S.E. 738, 1914 Va. LEXIS 78 (1914). The committee may expend the corpus of his wards personal estate in his discretion, subject only to the future confirmation of his reports by the court, which should follow if the expenditures were bona fide and reasonably necessary and proper under all the circumstances of the case. Lake v. Hope, 116 Va. 687, 82 S.E. 738, 1914 Va. LEXI S 78 (1914) (see Hauser v. King, 76 Va. 731 (1882); Davidson v. Pope, 82 Va. 747, 1 S.E. 117 (1887)). Without first obtain ing the courts permission.  While the court has supervision of the expenditures made by the committee of an insane person, it cannot be considered malfeasance in office for the committee to trench upon the corpus of his wards personal estate to the extent that it may be necessary to the maintenance of the ward and of his family, if any, without first obtaining permission from the court. Lake v. Hope, 116 Va. 687, 82 S.E. 738, 1914 Va. L EXIS 78 (1914). Discontinu ance of allowance to wards adult children.  Where the continuance by the committee of a weekly allowance formerly made by the ward to each of his adult children trenched upon the corpus of his personal esta te, the Supreme Court cannot say that the action of the trial court in directing its discontinuance was not justified. Lake v. Hope, 116 Va. 687, 82 S.E. 738, 1914 Va. LEXIS 78 (1914). Will executed prior to incompetency.  Since the ownership of the property remains in the incompetent, where it has been disposed of by a valid will prior to incompetency neither the committee nor the court can rewrite the will or change the beneficiaries named therein. The form of the property may be changed for certain purposes but the will cannot be revoked or modified. Bryson v. Turnbull, 194 Va. 528, 74 S.E.2d 180, 1953 Va. LEXIS 115 (1953). Liability of committee.  The committee is liable for whatever estate of his ward he received by virtue and under color of his appointment. If one assumes to act as a trustee in relation t o trust property, without just authority, he shall be held liable equally as if he had been lawfully appointed. Neither the committee nor his sureties could, in another proceeding, object that the order appointing the committee was void. Pannill's Adm'r v. Calloway's Comm., 78 Va. 387, 1884 Va. LEXIS 14 (1884). Same; interest.  As a general rule the committee of a lunatic is only to be charged simple interest upon the balances found against him on a settlement of his account.

Same; liability of sureties.  The estate of the committee should be first exhausted before that of his sureties is touched for money for which he is officially liable. Pannill's Adm'r v. Callo way's Comm., 78 Va. 387, 1884 Va. LEXIS 14 (1884). The answer of a committee as to the amount of his wards lien, in a creditors sui t does not relieve the court of the necessity of taking an account of such lien; and if the answer mistakes the amount of the lien, both the committee and court are under obligation to correct the mistake. Calloway's Comm. v. Dinsmore, 83 Va. 309, 2 S.E. 517, 1887 Va. LEXIS 69 (1887).

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Revocation of beneficiary.  Revocation of a wife as the designated beneficiary of a life insurance policy was upheld because the evidence a daughter submitted about her fathers capacity and wish to change his beneficiary was not controverted; that the father preferred to confer a benefit on his daughter, who took him in and cared for him, rather than on a wife of just a few years, who was removed as guardian for malfeasance and who had no contact with him for years, was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

Conservators recovery.  Specific harm to the estate caused by the prior conservators defalcation amounted to costs incurred in taking over the estate and performing the past due duti es, and thus the bond secured by the prior conservator was liable for such costs, and the successor conservator was entitled to seek recovery directly from the insurer as the process of first billing the estate was inefficient.

In the orde r appointing a conservator entered pursuant to § 64.2-2009 or in a separate proceeding brought on petition, the court may for good cause shown authorize a conservator to (i) make gifts from income and principal of the incapacitated persons estate not necessary for the incapacitated persons maintenance to those persons to whom the incapacitated person would, in the judgment of the court, have made gifts if he had been of sound mind, (ii) disclaim property as provided in Chapter 26 (§ 64.2-2 600 et seq.), or (iii) create a revocable or irrevocable trust on behalf of an incapacitated person with terms approved by the court or transfer assets of an incapacitated person or an incapacitated persons estate to a trust. B. In a procee ding under this section, a guardian ad litem shall be appointed to represent the interest of the incapacitated person. Notice of a proceeding under this section shall be given pursuant to Chapter 8 (§ 8.01-285 et seq.) of Title 8.01 and the Rules of S upreme Court of Virginia to: (i) the incapacitated person and the incapacitated persons spouse and children, (ii) all beneficiaries named in any known will of the incapacitated person, (iii) the incapacitated persons intestate heirs determined as if the incapacitated person had died intestate on the date of the filing of the petition, and (iv) all other interested persons. The court may authorize the hearing to proceed without notice to any person who would not be substantially affected by the p roceedings. For the purposes of this section, the beneficiaries and intestate heirs shall be deemed possessed of inchoate property rights. Unless otherwise represented, a minor, incapacitated, or unborn individual, or a person whose identity or location is unknown and not reasonably ascertainable, may with the approval of the court be represented and bound by another having a substantially identical interest with respect to the will proceeding under this section, but only to the extent that there is no conflict of interest between the representative and the person represented. C. The court s hall determine the amounts, recipients, and proportions of any gifts of the estate, the advisability of any disclaimer, whether good cause exists to create a trust or transfer assets, and whether to approve the trust terms after considering (i) the size and composition of the estate; (ii) the nature and probable duration of the incapacity; (iii) the effect of the gifts, disclaimers, trusts, or transfers on the estates financial ability to meet the incapacitated persons foreseeable health, medica l care, and maintenance needs; (iv) the incapacitated persons estate plan and the effect of the gifts, disclaimers, trusts, or transfers on the estate plan; (v) prior patterns of assistance or gifts to the proposed donees; (vi) the tax effect of the proposed gifts, disclaimers, trusts, or transfers; (vii) the effect of any transfer of assets or disclaimer on the establishment or retention of eligibility for medical assistance services; (viii) whether to require, during the lifetime of the incapacita ted person, that the trustee of any trust created or funded pursuant to this section post bond, with or without surety, or provide an accounting as set forth in § 64.2-1305; and (ix) other factors that the court may deem relevant. D. A commissio ner of accounts for the jurisdiction where a conservator qualifies may authorize the same gifts under the same circumstances as the circuit court may authorize under subsection C, except that (i) the total gifts authorized in a calendar year shall not ex ceed $25,000 and (ii) the commissioner shall report to the court his determination based upon consideration of clauses (i) through (ix) set forth in subsection C. The provisions of subsection B shall not apply to proceedings before the commissioner, but the commissioner shall give reasonable written notice of the scheduled hearing date to any person who would be substantially affected by the proceedings. The commissioner may provide notice to a minor by mail to the duly qualified guardian of the minor o r, if none exists, a custodial parent of the minor who is also not the conservator. E. If the gift s by the conservator under clause (i) of subsection A do not exceed $150 to each donee in a calendar year and do not exceed a total of $750 in a calendar year, the conservator may make such gifts without a hearing under this section, the appointment of a guardian ad litem, or giving notice to any person. Prior to the making of such a gift, the conservator shall consider clauses (i) through (ix) set forth in subsection C and shall also find that the incapacitated person has shown a history of giving the same or a similar gift to a specific donee for the previous three years prior to the appointment of the conservator. F. The conserv ator may transfer assets of an incapacitated person or an incapacitated persons estate into an irrevocable trust where the transfer has been designated solely for burial of the incapacitated person or spouse of the incapacitated person in accordance with conditions set forth in subdivision A 2 of § 32.1-325. The conservator also may contractually bind an incapacitated person or an incapacitated persons estate by executing a preneed funeral contract, described in Chapter 28 (§ 54.1-2800 et seq.) of Title 54.1, for the benefit of the incapacitated person. G. A conservat or may exercise the incapacitated persons power to revoke or amend a trust or to withdraw or demand distribution of trust assets only with the approval of the court for good cause shown, unless the trust instrument expressly provides otherwise.

Power of guardian or committee to incur obligations for necessities.  While the general rule is that a guardian is without power to bind a ward or his estate by contract, a guardian or committee of an incompetent may incur obligatio ns for necessaries, such as care and support of his ward, without the prior approval of the court. Carter v. Cavalier Cent. Bank &amp; Trust Co., 223 Va. 571, 292 S.E.2d 305, 1982 Va. LEXIS 240 (1982). Suits respecting the person or estate of an insane person must be brought by or against his committee, if there be one. Bird's Comm. v. Bird, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 712, 1872 Va.

Taylor's Comm., 116 Va. 762, 82 S.E. 698, 1914 Va. LEXIS 86 (1914). The whole property of the insane person passes to the committee, and he can sue and be sued with respect to any lawful demand. Merchant's Adm'r v. Shry, 116 Va. 4 37, 82 S.E. 106, 1914 Va. LEXIS 49 (1914). Where the right of maintenance, either entire or partial, in a trust fund is vested in an insane person, his committee is the proper person to sue for its preserv ation and protection. General Bd. of State Hosps. for Insane v. Robertson, 115 Va. 527, 79 S.E. 1064, 1913 Va. LEXIS 66 (1913). But where there is no committee, or he has adverse interests, suit may be by next friend.  Where no committee has been appointed or he has been removed, or has interests adverse to the ward, a suit may be brought in the name of the ward by his next frie nd approved by the court. Birds Comm. v. Bird, 62 Va. (21 Gratt.) 712 (1872), cited in General Bd. of State Hosps. for Insane v. Robertson, 115 Va. 527, 79 S.E. 1064 (1913). A bill by a lunatic, suing by his next friend, is bad on demurrer, if it fails to aver that the next friend appears as such by the appointment or leave of the cou rt. The fact that the bill avers that the next friend is a child of the lunatic does not change the rule, as the court considers only the situation of the lunatic, and the next of kin are not considered as having any interest in his property. Lake v. Hop e, 116 Va. 687, 82 S.E. 738, 1914 Va. LEXIS 78 (1914). In determining the right to sue out an attachment on the ground of nonresidence of the d efendant, the residence of the committee and not that of the lunatic governs. Sheltman v.

Therefore, plaintiff lacked standing to file a medical malpractice suit in her own name. Lopez-Rosario v. Habib, 291 Va. 293, 785 S.E.2d 214, 2016 Va. LEXIS 45 (2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Erroeous caption in suit was subject to amendment and the complaint would not be dismissed.  Guardian for an incapacitated ward, who was suing a doctor, hospital, and psychiatric clinic on allegations that their negligence allowed the ward to be raped by a fellow patient, was allowed to amend the caption of the complaint because it was not technically in compliance with the requirements of former § 37.1-141 [now this section]. The defendants had argued the caption should have read that the guardian wa s bringing the complaint on behalf of the ward, not that the ward was bringing the action by and through the guardian; while the court agreed the caption may have been in technical error, it was not a fatal one and amendment instead of dismissal was the proper remedy considering the guardian had an obligation to bring the action.

Disappears in a foreign country, his body has not been found, and he is not known to be alive, and a report of presumptive death by the Department of State of the United States ha s been issued. 2. Any person who is not a resident of the Commonwealth, but who owns real or personal property located within the Commonwealth, shall be presumed to be dead if such person disappears for seven successive years from the place of his residence outside of the Commonwealth and is not heard from. 3. The presumption created by this subsection shall be applicable in any action where the persons death is in question, unless proof is offered that the person was alive within the ti me specified or, in the case of a presumed death in a foreign country, at any time following the persons disappearance, whether before or after the report of presumptive death was issued. B. The fact th at any person was exposed to a specific peril of death may be a sufficient basis for determining at any time after the exposure that the person is presumed to have died less than seven years after the person was last heard from. C.

CASE NOTES Editors note. The cases below were decided under former Title 64.1 and prior law. History of section.  See Simpson v. Simpson, 162 Va. 621, 175 S.E. 320, 1934 Va. LEXIS 275 (1934), cert. denied, 295 U.S. 735, 55 S. Ct. 648, 79 L. Ed. 1683, 1935 U.S. LEXIS 410 (1935 ). This section is simply declaratory of the rules of the common law previously extant in t his State. Evans v. Stewart, 81 Va. 724, 1886 Va. LEXIS 136 (1886). It has been construed a number of times by the highest court of the State and a federal court is bound by that construction. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Goodwin, 92 F.2d 274, 1937 U.S. App. LEXIS 4546 (4th Cir. 1937). That part of this section after the first sentence does not apply to divorce cases but m anifestly applies only where an order or decree is sought in favor of the alleged heirs, devisees or legatees of the supposed decedent or persons claiming by, through or under them. Simpson v. Simpson, 162 Va. 621, 175 S.E. 320, 1934 Va. LEXIS 27 5 (1934), cert. denied, 295 U.S. 735, 55 S. Ct. 648, 79 L. Ed. 1683, 1935 U.S. LEXIS 410 (1935). Thus, where a wife procured a divorce a vinculo from her first husband, and her second husband sued for a divorce on the ground that the wife remarried within six months after she obtained the divorce a vinculo from her first husband, it was held that the evidence was sufficient to raise a presumption based on seven years absence that the first husband was dead at the time the divorce decree was entered rende ring the second marriage valid. Simpson v. Simpson, 162 Va. 621, 175 S.E. 320, 1934 Va. LEXIS 275 (1934), cert. denied, 295 U.S. 735, 55 S. Ct. 648, 79 L. Ed. 1683, 1935 U.S. LEXIS 410 (1935). Presumption of the continued existence of a person remains in full force and effect until the passage of the seven-year period prescribed in this section and in the absence of credible evidence to the contrary, is conclusive. Ashby v. Red Jacket Coal Corp., 185 Va. 202, 38 S.E.2d 436, 1946 Va. LEXIS 191 (1946). There is no presumption of death at any time within the seven years, or that a party is alive at any particular time within that period, and the burden is on the party asserting such a claim to prove it by evidence satisfactory to the jury.

Death is presumed to be the result of material dissolution rather than of accidental injury. General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp. v. Murray, 120 Va. 115, 90 S.E. 620, 1916 Va. LEXIS 160 (1916). A party is as much entitled to the benefit of a presumption of law as he would be to have any other appropriate legal rule applied to the facts of his case; and, where the facts which are required to give rise to the presumption are proven, the presumption must be applied (the presumed fact must be assumed to have been proven) until evid ence sufficient to overcome the presumption and prove the contrary shall have been introduced. Simpson v. Simpson, 162 Va. 621, 175 S.E. 320, 1934 Va. LEXIS 275 (1934), cert. denied, 295 U.S. 735, 55 S. Ct. 648, 79 L. Ed. 1683, 1935 U.S. LEXIS 410 (1935) . Sufficient evidence to jus tify presumption.  Where person left home after being arrested on a liquor charge and remained more than seven years, the evidence was such as to justify the jury in finding that th e presumption of the insureds death was conclusive. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Goodwin, 92 F.2d 274, 1937 U.S. App. LEXIS 4546 (4th Cir. 1937). Presumption rebuttable.  The statutory presumption of death after an absence of seven years created by this section is rebuttable. Barraud v. Barraud, 19 Va. L. Reg. 616 (1913). To strengthen or rebut the presumption of death created by the statute, the facts and circumstances connected with the disappearance of the absent party are admis sible in evidence, since the strength of the presumption lies, not so much in the facts of his absence for the statutory period as in the cogency of the circumstances of his disappearance; such as that he was a fugitive from justice, or under a cloud as to his character, or any other facts or circumstances tending to explain his going, his motive in remaining away, or his failure to communicate with his home. Barraud v. Barraud, 19 Va. L. Reg. 616 (1913). The presumption of death after seven years absence is a true rebuttable presumption of law as distinguished from a presumption of fact (which is in reality me rely an inference of a fact from facts proven) and from an administrative assumption of fact. Simpson v. Simpson, 162 Va. 621, 175 S.E. 320, 1934 Va. LEXIS 275 (1934), cert. denied, 295 U.S. 735, 55 S. Ct. 648, 79 L. Ed. 1683, 1935 U.S. LEXIS 410 (1935). A rebuttable presumption of law is a provisional procedural assumption of a fact which is prescribed by a rule of the substantive law. It is a rule of the substan tive law declaring that for procedural purposes a certain prima facie probative force will and shall, until evidence sufficient to prove the contrary is introduced, be provisionally attached to a given state of facts. That is, a certain inference shall b e drawn from it, unless and until evidence sufficient to prove the contrary has been introduced. Simpson v. Simpson, 162 Va. 621, 175 S.E. 320, 1934 Va. LEXIS 275 (1934), cert. denied, 295 U.S. 735, 55 S. Ct. 648, 79 L. Ed. 1683, 1935 U.S. LEXIS 410 (193 5). Whether evidence is sufficient to rebut presumption is question for jury.  When the presumption of death is sought to be rebutted by evidence as to the circumstances under which the missing man disappeared and under which no news has bee n heard of him, the question whether such evidence is sufficient to rebut the presumption of death prescribed by this section is a question of fact for the jury. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Goodwin, 92 F.2d 274, 1937 U.S. App. LEXIS 4546 (4th Cir. 1937 ). Grant of letters of administration on estate of a living person as if he were dead is absolutely void, and if it be conceded that the legislature intended by this section to authorize the courts to grant administration upon the estate of a person who was once a resident of the State and has been absent therefrom and unheard from for more than seven years, irrespective of his dea...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_64.2-2301"><akn:num>§ 64.2-2301</akn:num><akn:heading>Distribution of fund when presumption of death not applicable</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

Operability of slayer statute.  When the decedents adult child shot and killed the decedent, under the laws of intestate succession at the time of the decedents death, as modified by the version of the Virginia Slayer Statute, § 55-401 et seq., in effect at the time of the death of the decedent, the decedents estate passed to the decedents surviving parent, instead of the adult childs minor children, because the parent wa s the next living person who was neither the slayer, nor making a claim through the slayer.

The disclaimed interest passes according to any provision in the instrument creating the interest providing for the disposition of the interest, should it be disclaimed, or of disclaim ed interests in general. 3. If the instrument does not contain a provision described in subdivision 2, the following rules apply: a. If the disclaimant is an individual, the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant had died immediately before the time of distribution. However, if by law or under the instrument, the descendants of the disclaimant would share in the disclaimed i nterest by any method of representation had the disclaimant died before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes only to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive at the time of distribution. b. If the disclaimant is not an individual, the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant did not exist. 4. Upon the disclaimer of a preceding interest, a future interest held by a person other than the disclaimant takes effect as if the disclaimant had died or ceased to exist immediately be fore the time of distribution, but a future interest held by the disclaimant is not accelerated in possession or enjoyment.
