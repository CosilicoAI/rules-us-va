History History. 1979, c. 711. Annotations Editors note. At its regular session of 1974, the General Assembly directed the Code Commission to study Title 32, Health, of the Code and to report its findings in the form of a recodification of that title. In December of 1978, the Commission sent to the Governor and General Assembly its report containing a proposed revision of Title 32 and also drafts of several companion bills which would accomplish additional changes soug ht by the State Department of Health. This report contains revisors notes and other explanatory matter which, while valuable, are too lengthy for inclusion here. The proposed revision of Title 32 was adopted by the 1979 General Assembly as chapter 71 1 of the Acts of 1979. Effective October 1, 1979, it repealed Title 32 and enacted in lieu thereof a new Title 32.1. It also repealed certain provisions of Titles 54 and 62.1 and incorporated substantially similar provisions in the new Title 32.1. The co mpanion acts to Acts 1979, c. 711, repealed designated provisions of Title 32 and enacted substantially similar provisions in titles other than new Title 32.1. In addition to its revision by Chapter 711, former Title 32 was also amended by other acts pas sed at the 1979 session. As required by § 30-152, the Code Commission has incorporated these amendments into new Title 32.1, or into corresponding sections of other titles enacted by companion acts to Chapter 711. In addition, an amendment to § 54- 524.109:18, which section was repealed by Chapter 711, has been incorporated in the corresponding new section, § 32.1-88. Some of the cases cited in the notes under the various sections of this title were decided under corresponding provisions of former Title 32. Acts 1979, c. 711, cl. 2 provides: That the regulations of the State Board of Health and those of the Virginia Voluntary Formulary Board in effect on the effe ctive date of this act [Oct. 1, 1979], shall continue in effect to the extent that they are not in conflict with this act and shall be deemed to be regulations promulgated under this act. Law Review.

CASE NOTES Hospital.  Section 501(c)(3) health care provider was not immune from tort liability under § 8.01-38, even though it was not a hospital as defined in § 32.1-123, becau se the provider did not operate as a charitable institution. It was created to correct billing and collection issues, the ratio of its revenue to its charity work cost was disproportionate, it used a profit-based bonus system, and it did not accept chari table gifts.

LEXIS 39 (2008). Nursing home.  Circuit court properly dismissed the estates declaratory judgment complaints seeking to assert a private right of action against two nursing homes for the pro duction of documents because the estates claims could not be enforced where the governing statutes did not authorize a private right of action and the estates could not use the Declaratory Judgment Act as a platform for asserting non-existent private rights of action to enforce an administrative regulation promulgated by the Board of Health. Cherrie v. Va. Health Servs., 292 Va. 309, 787 S.E.2d 855, 2016 Va. LEXIS 106 (2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Hospital.  Foundation was not a hospital for purposes of § 8.01-38 charitable immunity, as the foundation was not a facility pursuant to § 32.1-123; rather, it was the entity that employed the physicians who cared for patients at a university hospital. The fact that the foundation owned and operated several clinics in outlying areas did not change this analysis. MacArthur v. Univ. of Va. Health Servs. Found., 72 Va. Cir. 322, 2006 Va. Cir.

In a nursing facility residents action for damages following a fire, the facility, which was not licensed pursuant to § 32.1-123 et seq., was immune from t ort liability under the doctrine of charitable immunity and did not fall under the scope of § 8.01-38s denial of charitable immunity to hospitals. The facilitys charter established the rebuttable presumption that it was a charitable institutio n, and the resident failed to rebut that presumption. Rogers v. Va. Home, 83 Va. Cir. 423, 2011 Va. Cir. LEXIS 138 (Richmond Oct. 5, 2011). Nursing home.  Section 32.1-138 did not provide a nursing home patient with a private right of action. The nursing home was subject to § 32.1-138, however, regardless of the patient referring to it as an assisted living facility, because the definitions of assisted living facility in § 63.2-100 and nursing home in § 32.1-123 were not mutually exclusive.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 9B M.J. Hospitals and Sanitariums, § 7. CASE NOTES Motion to suppress denied.  Defendant argued that the evidence underlying his conviction was obtained through the execution of constitutionally invalid search warrants, however, the showing of probable cause in the agents affidavit was predicated on defendants billing practices, not on whether he was legally permitted to perform surgery in his podiatry office; accordingly, even if the affidavit had included a Virginia statutory prov ision, § 32.1-124, under which defendant might lawfully have performed the surgeries for which he billed, it would nonetheless have supplied probable cause to believe that his billing itself was fraudulent. The district court thus did not err in denyi ng defendants motion to suppress and his request for a Franks hearing. United States v.

CASE NOTES Owner.  Definition of owner does not specify the source of the water being supplied, but rather, it expressly contemplates a private owner as the definition encom passes both private and public ownership; thus, private wells are not exempt from the possible water sources for a waterworks, and instead, the definition of owner simply refers to supplying water to any person in Virginia via a waterworks.

CASE NOTES Waterworks.  Despite an assisted living facilitys lack of an application for a permit for a waterworks, the Virginia Department of Health was within its authority under Vi rginia Administrative Process Act to begin the administrative process and eventually issue a case decision determining that such a permit was necessary because the facility, as the owner of a waterworks, was not able to operate without a permit. North Vi ew Home for Adults, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Health, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 82 (Va. Ct. App. May 18, 2021). Assisted living facilitys water system was a waterwork because its wells served piped water, its water system served at least 15 service connections or 25 or more individuals, and the facility operated year-round; the testimony of the facilitys owner that the staff helped residents with bathing and teeth brushing and that they prepared and cleaned up after meals established that the water piped into the f acility from the wells was used for human consumption. North View Home for Adults, LLC v. Va. Dep't of Health, 2021 Va. App. LEXIS 82 (Va. Ct.

When a bir th occurs on a moving conveyance within the United States of America and the child is first removed from the conveyance in this Commonwealth, the birth shall be registered in this Commonwealth and the place where the child is first removed from the conve yance shall be considered the place of birth. When a birth occurs on a moving conveyance while in international waters or air space or in a foreign country or its air space and the child is first removed from the conveyance in this Commonwealth, the birt h shall be registered in this Commonwealth although the certificate shall indicate the actual place of birth insofar as can be determined.

In any case in which a final determination of the paternity of a child has been made by a cour t of competent jurisdiction pursuant to § 20-49.8, from which no appeal has been taken and for which the time allowed to perfect an appeal has expired, the name of the father and the surname of the child shall be entered on the certificate of birth in accordance with the finding and order of the court.Children born of marriages prohibited by law, deemed null or void, or dissolved by a court shall nevertheless be legitimate and the birth certificate for such children shall contain full information con cerning the other parent.For the purpose of birth registration in the case of a child resulting from assisted conception, pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 20-156 et seq.) of Title 20, the birth certificate of such child shall contain full information concerni ng the mothers spouse as the other parent of the child and the gestational mother as the mother of the child.

Right to litigate paternity issue.  Trial court erred in dismissing a petition to determine parentage filed by the childs biological father, as subdivision A 3 of § 20-158 and subsection D of § 32.1-257 did bar an unmarried, biological father from establishing legal parentage of his child conceived through assisted conception, pursuant to a voluntary written agreement as authorized by subdivision B 2 of § 20-49.1.L.F. v. Breit, 285 Va. 163, 736 S.E.2d 711, 2013 Va. LEXIS 4 (2013).

Parent-child relationship is not established to same extent as adoption.  Adoption of children by husband whose wife conceived the children through artificial insemination, not only establishes and creates rights in the adoptive father and the child, but also divests the natural father of all legal rights or obligations with respect to the child; this section and former § 64.1-7.1 do not establish the parent-child relationship with the legal certainty and to the same extent as adopt ion proceedings.

Research References. Friends Virginia Pleading and Practice (Matthew Bender). Chapter 28 Domestic Actions. § 28.02 Marriage. Friend. CASE NOTES Void marriage not revived by corrective measures.  Denial of a wifes petition to annul a bigamous marriage was error because, contrary to the trial courts finding, a void bigamous marriage could not have b een revived by corrective measures, and the wifes action in obtaining a falsified marriage certificate was not an option because, under § 20-13, marriages in Virginia had to be solemnized; a marriage license presupposed a marriage ceremony solemnizing the union, and whatever formalities the ceremony required, at the very least it required the attendance of both the bride and groom. Section 20-31 had no application in cases where the putative marriage was void ab initio. Davidson v. Davids on, 2009 Va. App. LEXIS 313 (Va. Ct. App. July 14, 2009). License and solemnization.  Statutes make plain the General Assemblys intent that a license must precede the solemnization ceremony. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456 , 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Trial court properly ruled that a husband and wife never married because their marriage ceremony was not under a license since the husband and wife did not have a license when they held their marriage ceremony, and when they did obtain a license they did not perform any kind of solemnization; mailing a license via express mail for a signature when the parties were not even present did not constitute solemniza tion. MacDougall v. Levick, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), vacated, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 182, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Nothing in the governing statutes or case law renders a marriage void ab initio or voidable merely because the officiant and celebrants agree in advance to solemn ize the marriage. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). Dissimilar use of the terms solemnization and ceremony implies that the General Assembly has declined to adopt a specific definition for solemniza tion, leaving the details to the discretion of the officiant and the celebrants. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). Although a rabbi could have violated subsection C by not filing the marriage certificate within five days of the marriage ceremony that he officiated, neither the statute nor any other statute mandated that the officiants violation voided the celebrants marriage; they have no control of whether he files the certificate five, six, or sixty days later, and the legal validity of their marriage cannot be so e asily extinguished. Levick v. MacDougall, 294 Va. 283, 805 S.E.2d 775, 2017 Va. LEXIS 158 (2017). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Marriage was void ab initio.  Parties marriage was null and void ab initio because it did not meet the statutory requirements, under § 20-13, of licensure followed by solemnization, as the marriage license was obtained after the marriage ceremony and was subsequently signed by the officiant without either party being present. Moreover, the curative statute, § 20-31, and estoppel, as well as other equitable remedies, were not applica ble because the alleged marriage was void ab initio. MacDougall v. Levick, 87 Va. Cir. 160, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 87 (Fairfax County Oct. 10, 2013), aff'd, 65 Va. App. 223, 776 S.E.2d 456, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 255 (2015), aff'd, 66 Va. App. 50, 782 S.E.2d 1 82, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (2016). Requirement to return paperwork to court.  It is clear from subsection C of § 32.1-267 that the person who officiates the marriage ceremony must be the same person who fills out the paperwork and return s it to the court.

A certified copy of a vital record or any part thereof issued in accordance with subsection A shall be considered for all purposes the same as the original and shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated, provided that the evidentiary value of a vital record filed more than one year after the event or a vital record which has been amended shall be determined by the judicial or administrative body or official before whom the certificate is offered as evidence. C. The federal agency responsible for national vital statistics may be furnished such copies or other data from the system of vital records as it may require for national statistics if such federal agency shares in the cost of collecting, processing and transmitting s uch data. Such data may be used for research and medical investigations of public health importance. No other use of such data shall be made by the federal agency unless authorized by the State Registrar. D. Other feder al, state and local, public or private agencies or persons in the conduct of their official duties may, upon request and payment of a reasonable fee, be furnished copies or other data from the system of vital records for statistical or administrative pur poses upon such terms or conditions as may be prescribed by the Board.

Some of the cases below were decided under prior law. Date of registration of certificate need not include day of the month.  Subsection A does not specify that the date of registration shall include a day of the month, and nothing in the statute or regulations indicates that a month and year do not constitute a date of registration. Thus, a stamp of September 1995 meets the statutory requirements under this section. Guthrie v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 365 (Va. Ct. App. May 16, 2000). Death certificate offered for the purpose of showing cause of death was held inadmissibl e. Edwards v. Jackson, 210 Va. 450, 171 S.E.2d 854, 1970 Va. LEXIS 143 (1970). Certified copy of the record of a death is prima facie evidence only of the facts stated therein. It is to be noted that this section does not provide that a mere opinion shall be prima facie proof of the fact to be determined. Life Ins. Co. v. Brockman, 173 Va. 86, 3 S.E.2d 480, 1939 Va. LEXIS 178 (1939); Bailey v. C.V. Hunter, Inc., 2 07 Va. 123, 148 S.E.2d 826, 1966 Va. LEXIS 196 (1966); Robertson v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 62, 175 S.E.2d 260, 1970 Va. LEXIS 212 (1970). This section, making the certificate admissible as prima facie evidence, limits the admissibility of the certificate to the facts contained therein. The mere opin ion, surmise or conjecture of the medical examiner, which was based on hearsay as to the means and cause of death, is not a statement of fact as contemplated by the provisions of the statute. Bailey v. C.V. Hunter, Inc., 207 Va. 123, 148 S.E.2d 826, 1966 Va. LEXIS 196 (1966).

Upon request of the surviving spouse of a veteran, the funeral director or funeral service licensee providing funeral services for the veteran ma y obtain one certified copy of the death certificate for service-connected benefits. No charge shall be imposed upon a veteran or his survivor for a copy related to obtaining service-connected benefits. B. Fees collec ted under this section by the State Registrar shall be transmitted to the Comptroller for deposit. Two dollars of each fee collected by the State Registrar shall be deposited by the Comptroller into the Vital Statistics Automation Fund established pursua nt to § 32.1-273.1 for so long as shall be authorized.

At the direction of the Virginia Code Commission, the reference to 64.1-5.1 and 64.1-5.2 was changed to 64.2-102 and 64.2-103 to conform to the re codification of Title 64.1 by Acts 2012, c. 614, effective October 1, 2012.

For related discussion, see 5C M.J. Dead Bodies, § 5; 7B M.J. Evidence, §§ 84, 221; 9B M.J. Homicide, §§ 59, 76. CASE NOTES This section does not authorize an exhumation order for the purpose of establishing paternity; decedents death was not alleged to have resulted from any unnatural cause listed in § 32.1-283, and no medical examiner authorized further investigation of his death. Thus the trial court was without subject matter jurisdiction to en ter an exhumation order. Garrett v. Majied, 252 Va. 46, 471 S.E.2d 479, 1996 Va. LEXIS 73 (1996) (but see amendments by Acts 1997, c. 59, which added subsection C of § 32.1-286). Good cause not required for exhumation for purpose of determining paternity.  Good cause did not have to be shown for the exhumation of a decedent to determine the paternity of the decedents alleged illegitimate daughter because subsection C of § 32.1-286 expressly provided that the need of a qualified illegitimate child to prove parentage for the purpose of inheritance was sufficient cause for exhumation. Martin v. Howard, 273 Va. 722, 643 S.E.2d 229, 2007 Va. LEXIS 51 (200 7). Exhumation not discretionary under subsection C if stated requirements met.  Use of the word may in subsection C of § 32.1-286 is not discretionary because there is nothing in the statute to suggest that the trial court has the discretion to deny an exhumation to a person who has met the statutes stated requirements; the only discretion is limited to determining whether a petitioner is a party attempting to prove parentage for inheritance purposes under §§ 64. 1-5.1 and 64.1-5.2.Martin v.

Identification of decedent, next of kin; disposition of claimed dead body. Text A. As used in this chapter, unless the context requires a different meaning:Disposition means the burial, inter ment, entombment, cremation, or other authorized disposition of a dead body permitted by law.Next of kin has the same meaning assigned to it in § 54.1-2800. B. In the abse nce of a next of kin, a person designated to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains pursuant to § 54.1-2825, an agent named in an advance directive pursuant to § 54.1-2984, or any guardian appointed pursuant to Chapter 20 ( § 64.2-2000 et seq.) of Title 64.2 who may exercise the powers conferred in the order of appointment or by § 64.2-2019, or upon the failure or refusal of such next of kin, designated person, agent, or guardian to accept responsibility for the dispo sition of the decedent, then any other person 18 years of age or older who is able to provide positive identification of the deceased and is willing to pay for the costs associated with the disposition of the decedents remains shall be authorized to make arrangements for such disposition of the decedents remains. If a funeral service establishment or funeral service licensee makes arrangements with a person other than a next of kin, designated person, agent, or guardian in accordance with this s ection, then the funeral service licensee or funeral service establishment shall be immune from civil liability unless such act, decision, or omission resulted from bad faith or malicious intent. C. Upon the de ath of any person, irrespective of the cause and manner of death, and irrespective of whether a medical examiners investigation is required pursuant to § 32.1-283 or 32.1-285.1, the person or institution having initial custody of the dead body sha ll make good faith efforts to determine the identity of the decedent, if unknown, and to identify and notify the next of kin of the decedent regarding the decedents death. If, upon notification of the death of the decedent, the next of kin of the dec edent or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains is willing and able to claim the body, the body may be claimed by the next of kin or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposi tion of the decedents remains for disposition, and the claimant shall bear the expenses of such disposition. If the next of kin of the decedent or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains fails or refuses to claim the body within 10 days of receiving notice of the death of the decedent, the body shall be disposed of in accordance with § 32.1-309.2. D. If the pers on or institution having initial custody of the dead body is unable to determine the identity of the decedent or to identify and notify the next of kin of the decedent regarding the decedents death, the person or institution shall contact the primary law-enforcement agency for the locality in which the person or institution is located, which shall make good faith efforts to determine the identity of the decedent and to identify and notify the next of kin of the decedent. However, in cases in which t he identity of the decedent and the county or city in which the decedent resided at the time of death are known, the person or institution having initial custody of the dead body shall notify the primary law-enforcement agency for the county or city in w hich the decedent resided regarding the decedents death, and the law-enforcement agency for the county or city in which the decedent resided shall make good faith efforts to identify and notify the next of kin of the decedent.If the identity of the d ecedent is known to the primary law-enforcement agency or the primary law-enforcement agency is able to identify the decedent, the primary law-enforcement agency is able to identify and notify the next of kin of the decedent or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains, and the next of kin of the decedent or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains is willing and able to claim the body, the bod y may be claimed by the next of kin or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains for disposition, and the claimant shall bear the expenses of such disposition.If the identity of the decedent is known or the primary law-enforcement agency is able to determine the identity of the decedent but the primary law-enforcement agency is unable, despite good faith efforts, to identify and notify the decedents next of kin or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains within 10 days of the date of contact by the person or institution having initial custody of the dead body, or the primary law-enforcement agency is able to identify and notify the deceden ts next of kin or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains but the next of kin or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains fails or refuse s to claim the body within 10 days, the primary law-enforcement agency shall notify the person or institution having initial custody of the dead body, and the body shall be disposed of in accordance with § 32.1-309.2. E. In cases in which a dead body is claimed by the decedents next of kin or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains but the next of kin or other person authorized by law to make arrangements for disposition of the decedents remains is unable to pay the reasonable costs of disposition of the body and the costs are paid by the county or city in which the decedent resided or in which the death occurred in accordance with this section, and the decedent has an estate out of which disposition expenses may be paid, in whole or in part, such assets shall be seized for such purpose. F. No dead bod y that is the subject of an investigation pursuant to § 32.1-283 or autopsy pursuant to § 32.1-285 shall be transferred for purposes of disposition until such investigation or autopsy has been completed. G. Any sheriff or primary law-enforcement officer, county, city, health care provider, funeral service establishment, funeral service licensee, or other person or institution that acts in accordance with the requirements of this chapter shall be immune from civil liab ility for any act, decision, or omission resulting from acceptance and disposition of the dead body in accordance with this section, unless such act, decision, or omission resulted from bad faith or malicious intent. H. Nothing in this section shall prevent a law-enforcement agency other than the primary law-enforcement agency from performing the duties established by this section if so requested by the primary law-enforcement agency and agreed to by the other law-enforcement agen cy.
