CASE NOTES General district court is court of record for purposes of 26 U.S.C. § 6323(a).  The general district court of Virginia is a court of record for the purpose of affording a judgment lien creditor the special protections contained in § 6323(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. § 6323(a)). Air Power, Inc. v. United States, 741 F.2d 53, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 19691 (4th Cir. 1984). A juvenile and domestic relations court is a court of record for purposes of the provisi on in the Bankruptcy Code exempting from discharge obligations of the debtor arising out of an order of child support issued by a court of record. Croteau v. Croteau, 246 Bankr. 254, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 302 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 2000). Subject matter jurisdiction.  Because a juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) district court had no jurisdiction to hear a petition related to consent for adoption that was not a parental plac ement adoption, a circuit court had no subject matter jurisdiction at all to hear the appeal as the circuit court had no more subject matter jurisdiction than the JDR district court had in that courts original proceeding. Knight v. Ottrix, 69 Va. App . 519, 820 S.E.2d 411, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 312 (2018). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Inapplic able to juvenile and domestic relations cases.  That §§ 16.1-106 and 16.1-113 do not apply to appeals from juvenile and domestic relations district courts is made clear by § 16.1-77, which gives genera l district courts exclusive original jurisdiction of civil cases involving claims of $3,000 or less and concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts of civil cases involving claims above $3,000, and by § 16.1-69.5 (b), which defines general dis trict courts as all courts not of record, except juvenile and domestic relations district courts. Commonwealth v. Neal, 58 Va. Cir. 205, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 142 (Richmond Feb. 13, 2002). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Demurrer.  A demurrer can be filed in both general district courts and circuit courts to challenge the legal sufficiency of a cause of action.

While a matter is pending in a general district court, upon motion of the plaintiff seeking to increase the amount of the claim, the court shall order transfer of the matter to the circuit court that has jurisdic tion over the amended amount of the claim without requiring that the case first be dismissed or that the plaintiff suffer a nonsuit, and the tolling of the applicable statutes of limitations governing the pending matter shall be unaffected by the transfe r.

Certification of expert witness opinion at time of service of process. Text Every warrant in debt, counter claim, or third party claim in a medical malpractice action, at the time the plaintiff requests service of process upon a defendant, or r equests a defendant to accept service of process, shall be deemed a certification that the plaintiff has obtained from an expert whom the plaintiff reasonably believes would qualify as an expert witness pursuant to subsection A of § 8.01-581.20 a writ ten opinion signed by the expert witness that, based upon a reasonable understanding of the facts, the defendant for whom service of process has been requested deviated from the applicable standard of care and the deviation was a proximate cause of the i njuries claimed. This certification is not necessary if the plaintiff, in good faith, alleges a medical malpractice action that asserts a theory of liability where expert testimony is unnecessary because the alleged act of negligence clearly lies within the range of the jurys common knowledge and experience. The certifying expert shall not be required to be an expert witness expected to testify at trial nor shall any defendant be entitled to discover the identity or qualifi cations of the certifying expert or the nature of the certifying expert opinions. Should the certifying expert be identified as an expert expected to testify at trial, the opinions and bases therefor shall be discoverable pursuant to Rule 4:1 of the Rule s of Supreme Court of Virginia with the exception of the experts status as a certifying expert. Upon written request of any defendant, the plaintiff shall, within 10 business days after receipt of such request, provide the defendant with a certification form which affirms that the plaintiff had obtained the necessary certifying expert opinion at the time service was requested or affirms that the plaintiff did not need to obtain a certifying expert opinion. The court, upon good cause shown, may conduct an in camer a review of the certifying expert opinion obtained by the plaintiff as the court may deem appropriate. If the plaintiff did not obtain a necessary certifying expert opinion at the time the plaintiff requested service of process on a defendant, the court shall impose sanctions according to the provisions of § 8.01-271.1 and may dismiss the case with prejudice.

CASE NOTES Design of section.  This section is designed to allow a court not of record to enter an informal order on the face of the pleadings in disposing of cases. Barkman v. Chevalier, 214 V a. 6, 196 S.E.2d 911, 1973 Va. LEXIS 242 (1973). This section requires the judge of a court not of record to enter a notation of judgment somewhere in the record. Barkman v. Chevalier, 214 Va. 6, 196 S.E.2d 911, 1973 Va. LEXIS 242 (1973). But this section is procedural only. Barkman v. Chevalier, 214 Va. 6, 196 S.E.2d 911, 197 3 Va. LEXIS 242 (1973). A judgment may be entered in a court not of record on the warrant itself.  To effectuate a valid judgment, this section requires that the warrant be signed by the judge, or that the judges signature be affixed by facsimile stamp, in which case the judge must initial the warrant. The requirement of the statute is procedural only. It is designed to allow a court not of record to enter an informal order on the face of the pleadings in disposing of cases. Meredith v. Commonwealth, No. 1 117-93-3 (Ct. of Appeals Jan. 10, 1995). Lack of specific notation as to counterclaim not conclusive.  Where an informal order was entered on a civil warrant before the county court (now general district court), showing judgment in favor of a plaintiff, which may h ave been intended by the court to be an adverse ruling on the defendants counterclaim, the lack of a specific notation concerning defendants pleading is not conclusive of the question whether the counterclaim was recognized and ruled on by the co unty court. Barkman v. Chevalier, 214 Va. 6, 196 S.E.2d 911, 1973 Va. LEXIS 242 (1973). District court final order would satisfy requirements for written decision.  In an eviction proceeding, as a discretionary matter, a general district court in Virginia could provide the tenant discovery by ordering a bill of particulars, a nd issue subpoenas duces tecum, and has the power to issue a final order that would satisfy the requirements for a written decision. Kennedy v. Block, 784 F.2d 1220, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 22834 (4th Cir. 1986). § 16.1-94.01. When and how satisfaction entered on judgment. Text A. When satisf action of any judgment rendered in a court not of record is made, the judgment creditor shall by himself, or his agent or attorney, give written notice of such satisfaction, within 30 days of receipt, to the clerk of the court in which the judgment was r endered. Such notice shall include the docket number, the names of the parties, and the date of the judgment. The clerk of the court shall then mark the judgment satisfied. For any money judgment marked as satisfied pursuant to this section, nothing here in shall satisfy an unexecuted order of possession entered pursuant to § 8.01-126. B. If the judg ment creditor fails to comply with subsection A, the judgment debtor, his heirs or personal representatives, may, on motion, after 10 days notice thereof to the judgment creditor, or his assignee, his personal representative, or his agent or attorney , apply to the court in which the judgment was rendered to have the judgment marked satisfied. Upon proof that the judgment has been satisfied, the clerk shall mark the judgment satisfied. If the judgment creditor or his legal representatives cannot be r easonably located, the notice may be published and posted as an order of publication is required to be published and posted under §§ 8.01-316 and 8.01-317. C. The cost of such proceedings, including reasonable attorney fees and the cost of publication, may be ordered to be paid by the judgment creditor.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Order of remittance does not serve as a satisfaction of judgment pursuant to the statute.  An order of remittance, after the forfeiture of a bond in a general district court criminal matter has led to a docketed judgment, does not serve as a satisfactio n of the judgment pursuant to the statute, but does operate as a satisfaction of the judgment docketed in the circuit court.

Even if creditors attorney did not request continuance for status, she should have dismissed debtors interrogatories as soon as she learned of the bankruptcy filing, thus obviating need for a continuance by the state court.

Some of the cases below were decided under former statute corresponding to this section. Purpose of section.  The legislative purpose of this section is to afford a summary and speedy settlement of trifling controversies before justices of the peace (now district court ju dges). Norfolk &amp; W.R.R. v. Clark, 92 Va. 118, 22 S.E. 867, 1895 Va. LEXIS 94 (1895). Section § 16.1-112 and this section are remedial and should be construed to effectuat e the purposes of their enactment. Southern Ry. v. Hill, 106 Va. 501, 56 S.E. 278, 1907 Va. LEXIS 112 (1907). The right of appeal is statutory and the exercise of appellate jurisdiction is confined to the provisions of the written law. Covington Virginian, Inc. v. Woods, 182 Va. 538, 29 S.E.2d 406, 1944 Va. LEXIS 202 (1944). Appeal of right generally.  Section § 16.1-106 does not require the appealing party to appeal every adverse ruling of the general district court but, rather, provides an appeal of right f or any order entered or judgment rendered. Robert &amp; Bertha Robinson Family, LLC v. Allen, 295 Va. 130, 810 S.E.2d 48, 2018 Va. LEXIS 15 (2018). Supreme Court of Virginia holds that the appeal of right belongs to the party applying for the same. When the general district court enters a final, appealable ju dgment on claims pleaded in a warrant, summons, or complaint, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:4(a); a counterclaim or cross-claim, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:3(a); or a third-party civil warrant or complaint, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:10(a), any party seeking on appeal to change or modify an unfavorable disposition of a claim asserted by or against him must file a notice of appeal. The failure to do so will leave the general district courts judgment on the claim intact and subject to res judicata principles. Robert &amp; Bertha Ro binson Family, LLC v. Allen, 295 Va. 130, 810 S.E.2d 48, 2018 Va. LEXIS 15 (2018). Ruling on motion requesting a new trial not appealable under this section.  Circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear tenants appeal in unlawful detainer action from denial of her motion requesting a new trial because the decision den ying the motion was not a final order or judgment, as it did not dispose of the merits of the unlawful detainer summons, and therefore was not any order entered or judgment rendered as required by this section. Ragan v. Woodcroft Village Apts., 2 55 Va. 322, 497 S.E.2d 740, 1998 Va. LEXIS 34 (1998). Ruling on motion to set aside verdict not a final judgment.  Trial court properly granted the prevailing parties motion to dismiss the losing parties appeal from the general district court, as the losing parties motion to s et aside was not a final judgment from which an appeal could be taken. Architectural Stone, LLC v. Wolcott Ctr., LLC, 274 Va. 519, 649 S.E.2d 670, 2007 Va. LEXIS 107 (2007). Jurisdictional amount.  Under this section costs are not to be computed as a part of the matter in controversy in determining the right of appeal. Shafer v. C &amp; O R.R., 23 S.E. 221 (Sept . 1, 1895). Under this section no appeal lies from a judgment for $10.00 (now $50.00) and costs, costs being no part of the controversy. Norfolk &amp; W.R.R. v. Clark, 92 Va. 118 , 22 S.E. 867, 1895 Va. LEXIS 94 (1895). Judgment involvi ng constitutionality of statute.  The language of this section is broad enough to cover the right of appeal to the circuit court from a judgment involving the constitutionality of a statute. South ern Ry. v. Hill, 106 Va. 501, 56 S.E. 278, 1907 Va. LEXIS 112 (1907). Appeal on statutes constitutionality does not lie if previously decided by Supreme Court.  Where the sole ground for an appeal is the constitutionality of a statute, the validity of which has been settled by former decisions of the Supreme Court, an app eal will not be entertained. This is the rule even if the constitutional objections are not precisely the same ones previously adjudicated. Myers v. Moore, 204 Va. 409, 131 S.E.2d 414, 1963 Va. LEXIS 165 (1963), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 992, 84 S. Ct. 632, 11 L. Ed. 2d 479, 1964 U.S. LEXIS 1974 (1964). Abandoned counterclaim not revived in trial de novo of plaintiffs claim.  Defendants inaction and failure to seek a definitive ruling when the district court failed, apparently through inadvertence, to rule upon defendants count erclaim was an abandonment of the claim, and the circuit court properly refused to allow it to be revived in a trial de novo on plaintiff...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-107"><akn:num>§ 16.1-107</akn:num><akn:heading>Requirements for appeal</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. No appeal s hall be allowed unless and until the party applying for the same or someone for him shall give bond, in an amount and with sufficient surety approved by the judge or by his clerk if there is one, or in an amount sufficient to satisfy the judgment of the court in which it was rendered. Either such amount shall include the award of attorney fees, if any. Such bond shall be posted within 30 days from the date of judgment, except for an appeal from the judgment of a general district court on an unlawful det ainer pursuant to § 8.01-129. However, no appeal bond shall be required of a plaintiff in a civil case where the defendant has not asserted a counterclaim, the Commonwealth or when an appeal is proper to protect the estate of a decedent, an infant, a convict, or an insane person, or the interest of a county, city, town or transportation district created pursuant to the Transportation District Act of 1964 (§ 33.2-1900 et seq.) of Title 33.2. In a case where a defendant with indemnity coverage throu gh a policy of liability insurance appeals, the bond required by this section shall not exceed the amount of the judgment that is covered by a policy of indemnity coverage. B. In all civi l cases, except trespass, ejectment, unlawful detainer against a former owner based upon a foreclosure against that owner, or any action involving the recovering rents, no indigent person shall be required to post an appeal bond. In cases of unlawful det ainer against a former owner based upon a foreclosure against that owner, a person who has been determined to be indigent pursuant to the guidelines set forth in § 19.2-159 shall post an appeal bond within 30 days from the date of judgment. C. In cases of unlawful detainer for a residential dwelling unit, notwithstanding the provisions of § 8.01-129, an appeal bond shall be posted by the defendant with payment into the general district court in the amount of outstanding rent, late charges, attorney fe es, and any other charges or damages due, as contracted for in the rental agreement, and as amended on the unlawful detainer by the court. If such amount is not so paid, any such appeal shall not be perfected as a matter of law. Upon perfection of an app eal, the defendant shall pay the rental amount as contracted for in the rental agreement to the plaintiff on or before the fifth day of each month. If any such rental payment is not so paid, upon written motion of the plaintiff with a copy of such writte n motion mailed by regular mail to the tenant, the judge of the circuit court shall, without hearing, enter judgment for the amount of outstanding rent, late charges, attorney fees, and any other charges or damages due as of that date, subtracting any pa yments made by such tenant as reflected in the court accounts and on a written affidavit submitted by the plaintiff, plaintiffs managing agent, or plaintiffs attorney with a copy of such affidavit mailed by regular mail to the tenant, and an orde r of possession without further hearings or proceedings in such court. Any funds held in a court account shall be released to the plaintiff without further hearing or proceeding of the court unless the defendant has filed a motion to retain some or all o f such funds and the court, after a hearing, enters an order finding that the defendant is likely to succeed on the merits of a counterclaim alleging money damages against the plaintiff, in which case funds shall be held by order of such court. D. If such bon d is furnished by or on behalf of any party against whom judgment has been rendered for money or property or both, the bond shall be conditioned for the performance and satisfaction of such judgment or order as may be entered against such party on appeal , and for the payment of all costs and damages which may be awarded against him in the appellate court. If the appeal is by a party against whom there is no recovery except for costs, the bond shall be conditioned for the payment of such costs and damage s as may be awarded against him on the appeal. E. In addition to the foregoing, any party applying for appeal shall, within 30 days from the date of the judgment, pay to the clerk of the court from which the appeal is taken the amount of the writ tax of the court to which the appeal is taken and costs as required by subdivision A 13 of § 17.1-275, including all fees for service of process of the notice of appeal in the circuit court pursuant to § 16.1-112.

Generally.  Supreme Court of Virginia holds that the appeal of right belongs to the party applying for the same. When the general district court enters a final, appealable ju dgment on claims pleaded in a warrant, summons, or complaint, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:4(a); a counterclaim or cross-claim, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:3(a); or a third-party civil warrant or complaint, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 7B:10(a), any party seeking on appeal to change or modify an unfavorable disposition of a claim asserted by or against him must file a notice of appeal. The failure to do so will leave the general district courts judgment on the claim intact and subject to res judicata principles. Robert &amp; Bertha Ro binson Family, LLC v.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 1B M.J. Appeal and Error, § 360. CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Appeal bond of $0.00.  Lenders motion to dismiss was denied because the lienor satisfied the statutory requirements and purpose of an appeal bond where, while the trial court found for the lender on a lienors counterclaim, no money judgment was entered against the lienor in favor of the lender, there were no financial interests of the lender to protect during the appeal, and the lienor paid the appeal costs.

B. When a bond or other security is required by law to be posted or given in connection with an appeal or removal from a district court, and there is either (i) a defect in such bond or other security as a result of an error of the district court, or (ii) the district court erroneously failed to require the bond or other security, and the defect or failure is discovered prior to sending the case to the circuit court, the district court shall order that the appellant or applicant for removal cure such defect or failur e within a period not longer than the initial period of time for posting the bond or giving the security. If the error or failure is discovered after the case has been sent to the circuit court, the circuit court shall return the case to the district cou rt for the district court to order the appellant or applicant for removal to cure the defect or post the required bond or give the required security within a period of time not longer than the initial period of time for posting the bond or giving the sec urity for removal.

For related discussion, see 1B M.J. Appeal and Error, § 360. CASE NOTES Juvenile and domestic relations court abused its discretion when setting bond at $500 fo r an appeal of a judgment of arrearage of $18,975. Similarly, the circuit court abused its discretion by denying mothers motion to require father to provide new or additional security in an amount sufficient to satisfy the judgment on appeal. Smiley v. Erickson, 29 Va. App. 426, 512 S.E.2d 842, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 203 (1999). A deficient appeal bond does not require dismissal of the appeal since under § 16.1-1 14.1 the court is empowered to correct defects, irregularities or omissions in the proceedings of a court not of record and this section empowers an appellate court to require the appellant to give new or additional security. Burks v. Three Hills Corp., 214 Va. 322, 200 S.E.2d 521, 1973 Va. LEXIS 303 (1973). Error not to corre ct discrepancies in appeal bond.  It is error for a trial court to fail to exercise its statutory power to correct the discrepancies in an appeal bond of a proceeding in a court not of record wher e such a correction would have brought the dispute to a trial on the merits and thereby facilitated final adjudication of the rights of the parties. Burks v. Three Hills Corp., 214 Va. 322, 200 S.E.2d 521, 1973 Va. LEXIS 303 (1973). Cure not allowed where a party totally failed to comply with the bond requirement.  Trial court properly dismissed a fathers appeal of a juvenile court order which modified his child support obligation and assessed an arrearage; a court clerk s act of setting an appeal bond at 0 did not excuse the father of the requirement to post an appeal bond under subsection H of § 16.1-296, and this section did not allow for a cure where there was a total failure to comply with the bond re quirement, and thus the failure to post the bond divested the trial court of jurisdiction. Sharma v. Sharma, 46 Va. App. 584, 620 S.E.2d 553, 2005 Va. App. LEXIS 389 (2005). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Error not to corre ct discrepancies in appeal bond.  Circuit court exercised its authority to allow plaintiff additional time to post the bond on the counter-claim as there was no reason why plaintiff should have to post two separate bonds, one for the appeal of his claim and one for the appeal of the counter-claim, when the claims arose out of the same cause of action and doing so would frustrate the principles of § 16.1-114.1.Van Garris v.

CASE NOTES This section and § 16.1-106 are remedial and should be construed to effectuate the pu rposes of their enactment. Southern Ry. v. Hill, 106 Va. 501, 56 S.E. 278, 1907 Va. LEXIS 112 (1907) (decided under former statute corresponding to these sections). Status of judgments after appeal.  No other statute deals with the status of the judgments of a civil and police justice (now district court judge) after appeal, although they necessarily remain un changed until the appeal is perfected. Thomas Gemmell, Inc. v. Svea Fire &amp; Life Ins. Co., 166 Va. 95, 184 S.E. 457, 1936 Va. LEXIS 168 (1936) (decided under former statute corresponding to these sections). The papers required to be delivered by the justice to the clerk constitute the case and are the essential groundwork for intelligent proceeding in the appellate court. Wygal v. Wilder, 117 Va. 896, 86 S.E. 97, 1915 Va. LEXIS 110 (1915) (decided under former statute corresponding to these sections). Papers held below until tax and costs paid.  This section requires prompt transmittal of the appellate papers, including the bond, to the circuit court, but permits those papers to be held below for thirty d ays until the writ tax and costs are paid to the clerk of the court not of record. Godlewski v. Gray, 221 Va. 1092, 277 S.E.2d 213, 1981 Va. LEXIS 253 (1981). A notice that an appeal has been docketed is simply notification of continuing action in the same case, of whose pendency the defendant is already aware. The notice is required by this section to be served only upon the appellee or his attorney. The appellee often is the plaintiff, who could hardly be expected to respond to his own civil warrant or other similar pleading. No particular form is prescribed for the notice; the clerk is required merely to give notice that such an appeal has been docketed in his office. Overnite Transp. Co. v. Barnett's, Inc., 217 Va. 222, 227 S.E.2d 695, 1976 Va. LEXIS 263 (1976). Not like notice of motion for judgment .  A notice that an appeal has been docketed is not, by name, nature, or form, equivalent or even similar to a notice of motion for judgment. A notice of motion for judgment is notice to the defendant of a new action brought against him. In prescribed form, the notice specifically calls upon him timely to respond or suffer the enunciated danger of default. Overnite Transp. Co. v. Barnett's, Inc., 217 Va. 222, 227 S. E.2d 695, 1976 Va. LEXIS 263 (1976). Transmission of record to circuit court.  Circuit court properly considered the pleadings filed in the general district court because, although appeals from courts not of record were heard by the circuit court de novo, the lower court was statutorily required to transmit its record to the circuit court. Parrish v. Fannie Mae, 292 Va. 44, 787 S.E.2d 116, 2016 Va. LEXIS 76 (2016). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Transmission of record to circuit court.  By failing to transmit the case papers to the circuit court, the general district court (GDC) acted in derogation of strong policy reasons favoring certainty of r esults in judicial proceedings because its action called into question the finality of the judgment in the absence of a ruling from the circuit court; the GDC in effect delayed timely adjudication of the appeal de novo by declining to perform a ministeri al act, namely the forwarding of its case papers to the circuit court. FCRHA Cedar Ridge, L.P. v. Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020). It is not the transmission of the case papers that creates the jurisdiction of the circuit court, but rather the filing of the notice of appeal. FCRHA Cedar Ridge , L.P. v. Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020). Jurisdiction.  When a lower court procedurally impedes an appeal by failing to transmit its case papers to the upper court under the mistaken belief the circuit court does not h ave jurisdiction and the appellant has taken all steps in the lower court properly to invoke the jurisdiction of the circuit court, then, in effect, the upper court has already acquired jurisdiction over the appeal. FCRHA Cedar Ridge, L.P. v. Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020). Mandamus proceeding was unnecessary because the circuit court possessed jurisdiction over the cause, and merely did not have the general district courts (GDC) case papers; while the GDC did not transmit the relevant case papers to the circuit court, the circuit court acquired jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of the appeal by the filing of the notice of appeal in the GDC. FCRHA Cedar Ridge, L.P. v . Boler, 104 Va. Cir. 132, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 8 (Fairfax County Jan. 17, 2020). When a disputed issue of first impression arises regarding the circuit courts jurisdiction, particularly interpretation of a new statutory provision, due proc ess and prudence suggest the general district court clerk should transmit the case papers to the upper court to permit it to determine the issue of its jurisdiction; this concept of erring on the side of affording litigants meaningful opportunity to be h eard should be of particular focus when the consequences of ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-113"><akn:num>§ 16.1-113</akn:num><akn:heading>How appeals tried</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Every such appeal shall be tried by the court in a summary way, or, if the amount in controversy exceeds fifty dollars, by a jury if either party requires it. All legal evidence produced by either party shall be heard, whether or not it was produced before the court from which the appeal is taken. If judgment is recovered by the appellee, execution shall issue against the principal and his surety, jointly or separately , for the amount of the judgment, including interests and costs, with damages on the aggregate at the rate of ten percent annually, from the date of that judgment until payment, and for the costs of the appeal; and the execution shall be endorsed No security is to be taken. If the decision is reversed, the party substantially prevailing shall recover his costs and the order or judgment shall be made or given as ought to have been made or given by the judge of the court from which the appeal was taken. When the appeal is from an order or judgment under §§ 16.1-119 through 16.1-121, the court shall enter such judgment respecting the property, the expense of keeping it, and any injury done to it, as may be equitable among the parties.

Tuttle, 208 Va. 28, 155 S.E.2d 358, 1967 Va. LEXIS 180 (1967). The purpose of the ten percent penalty damage was for the purpose of discouraging appeal s with little or no basis in law or fact from courts not of record. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tuttle, 208 Va. 28, 155 S.E.2d 358, 1967 Va. LEXIS 180 (1967). Effect of appeal from judgment of trial justice.  An appeal from the trial justice, properly perfected, transfers the entire record to the circuit court for a retrial as though originally brought therein. The jud gment of the trial justice is completely annulled by the appeal and is not thereafter effective for any purpose. Addison v. Salyer, 185 Va. 644, 40 S.E.2d 260, 1946 Va. LEXIS 237 (1946) (decided under former statute corresponding to these sections). In a de novo appeal of a general district court or special justices determination that a person meets the requirements for involuntary commitment, the circuit court is required by § 37.2-821 to evaluate the evidence for commitment as of the date of the circuit court hearing of the de novo appeal, using the criteria of subsection C of § 37.2-817. This conclusion is supported by § 16.1-113. Paugh v. He nrico Area Mental Health &amp; Developmental Servs., 286 Va. 85, 743 S.E.2d 277, 2013 Va. LEXIS 77 (2013) (pursuant to the legislative summary the 2020 amendments to § 37.2-821 by Acts 2020, c. 1175 were in response to this decision). Abandoned counterclaim not revived in trial de novo of plaintiffs claim.  Defendants inaction and failure to seek a definitive ruling when the district court failed, apparently through inadvertence, to rule upon defendants count erclaim was an abandonment of the claim, and the circuit court properly refused to allow it to be revived in a trial de novo on plaintiffs claim. K-B Corp. v. Gallagher, 218 Va. 381, 237 S.E.2d 183, 1977 Va. LEXIS 200 (1977). Right to jury trial not improperly denied where plaintiff did not follow procedure.  Dismissal of suit, which complained only of the denial of a trial by jury and asserted a collusion by defendants to deny him one, was proper, where plaintiffs own actions in bringing suit in the general district court rather than the circuit court deprived him of a trial by jury. Had he originally brought his personal injury claim in circuit court, as he was entitled to by § 17-123 (now § 17.1-513), he would have received a jury upon request under § 8.01-336. He also could have received a de novo jury trial by properly perfecting his appeal from general district court under this section. His failure to receive a jury trial, therefore, was the result of his own failure to follow valid state procedures rather than the result of any collusion by defendants in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Beaudett v. City of Hampton, 775 F.2d 1274, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 24559 (4th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1088, 106 S. Ct. 1475, 89 L. Ed. 2d 729, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 963 (1986). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability of statute.  Sections 16.1-106 and 16.1-113 govern civil cases over which general district courts, not juvenile and domestic relations district courts, have jurisdiction; spec ifically, § 16.1-106 grants an appeal of right in certain civil cases, and § 16.1-113 specifies how such appeals shall be tried in circuit court. Commonwealth v. Neal, 58 Va. Cir. 205, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 142 (Richmond Feb. 13, 2002). Inapplic able to juvenile and domestic relations cases.  That §§ 16.1-106 and 16.1-113 do not apply to appeals from juvenile and domestic relations district courts is made clear by § 16.1-77, which gives genera l district courts exclusive original jurisdiction of civil cases involving claims of $3,000 or less and concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts of civil cases involving claims above $3,000, and by § 16.1-69.5 (b), which defines general dis trict courts as all courts not of record, except juvenile and domestic relations district courts. Commonwealth v. Neal, 58 Va. Cir. 205, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 142 (Richmond Feb. 13, 2002). Parties on appeal.  Effect of an appeal from a judgment entered against one of two defendants was to completely nullify the effect of the district court judgment; thus, regardless of the finding of the lower court, the reviewing court had appellate jurisdiction over all the parties to the case, including the defendant against whom judgment was not entered. Khan v. Washington, 74 Va. Cir. 95, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 255 (Alexandria July 27, 2007). Nonsuit of appeal permitted.  On appeal of a judgment of the Virginia General District Court (GDC) to the Virginia Circuit Court, under § 16.1-106, the rulings of the GDC were completely nu ll and void, and an original plaintiff was provided a new trial, and was not barred from taking a nonsuit of the appeal to the Circuit Court; § 16.1-106 granted an appeal of right if timely filed, and § 16.1-113 granted authority for the judge or , if required by either party, a jury to make a determination based upon evidence, whether or not that evidence was offered in the GDC, and the only limitations placed on a party in appealing to the Circuit Court were that the appeal be from an order or judgment of a court not of record, and that the appeal be timely made. Joseph v. Giant Food, Inc., 61 Va. Cir. 143, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 52 (Fairfax County Feb. 7, 2003). Release of appeal bond.  Section 16.1-107 clearly requires that a judgment or order be entered against the appellant in the appeal itself as a necessary condition for release of t he appeal bond to a plaintiff; § 16.1-113 by its text also requires a judgment in circuit court before its provisions for execution of a judgment apply. Cajiao v. Warren, 90 Va. Cir. 64, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Norfolk July 2, 2015). Motion for release of ci vil appeal bond denied.  Plaintiffs motion for release of the civil appeal bond was denied because there was no judgment or order against defendants in the appeal; the Virginia Code d oes not authorize releasing the surety bond following the dismissal of the appeal. Cajiao v. Warren, 90 Va. Cir. 64, 2015 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Norfolk July 2, 2015).</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-114"><akn:num>§ 16.1-114</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1983, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>499. § 16.1-114.1. Principles applicable in trial of appeals; defective or irregular warrants or motions. Text Actions or proceedings appealed from district courts shall be tried according to the principles of law and equity, and when the same conflict the principles of equity s hall prevail. No warrant, motion or other pleading shall be dismissed by reason of a mere defect, irregularity or omission in the proceedings in the district court, or in the form of any such pleading, when the same may be corrected by a proper order of the court of record. In any such case the court of record shall retain the same, with full power to direct all necessary amendments, to enter orders and direct proceedings to correct such defects, irregularities and omissions, to promote substantial just ice to all parties, and to bring about a trial of the merits of the controversy. In any case where an appeal is taken by a defendant the circuit court may direct amendments to increase the amount of the claim above the jurisdictional amount set forth in § 16.1-77. This section shall be liberally construed, to the end that justice is not delayed or denied by reason of errors in the pleadings or in the form of the proceedings.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases below were decided under former § 16.1-114 and corresponding former statutes. This section affords the circuit court full power to control the course of appeals. Overn ite Transp. Co. v. Barnett's, Inc., 217 Va. 222, 227 S.E.2d 695, 1976 Va. LEXIS 263 (1976). The circuit court may require a defendant in an appealed case to file responsive pleadings and declare him in default for failure to respond as required. Overnite Transp. Co. v. Barnett's, Inc., 217 Va. 222, 227 S.E.2d 695, 1976 Va. LEXIS 263 (1976). Formal defects disregarded.  This section and § 8.01-545 seem to accentuate the wholesome purpose of disregarding formal defects that the attainment of the ends of substantial justice may be had. Jenkins v. Faulkner, 174 Va. 43, 4 S.E.2d 788, 1939 Va. LEXIS 139 (1939). Section does not excuse total failure to comply with requirement.  The statute refers to mere defects, irregularities, and the form of such pleading; it does not envision or authorize the exercise of discr etion to excuse the total failure to comply with a mandatory statutory requirement for an appeal bond. Scheer v. Isaacs, 10 Va. App. 338, 392 S.E.2d 201, 6 Va. Law Rep. 2389, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (1990). This section does not empower a circuit court to correct an irregularity in the day-to-day operations of a district court clerks office that inadvertently causes an appellant to miss the statutory deadline for timely filing an appeal bond. Hutchins v. Carrillo, 27 Va. App. 595, 500 S.E.2d 277, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 336 (1998). Jurisdiction of appell ate court is derivative.  The general rule, subject to the exception stated in § 8.01-129, relating to an appeal from a decision of the trial justice in an action of forceful entry or u nlawful detainer, is that jurisdiction of the circuit court to try cases appealed from a decision of a trial justice is derivative and if the trial justice had no jurisdiction to issue the warrant the appellate court acquired no jurisdiction by an appeal  that is, the jurisdiction of the appellate court in such matters is the same as that of the court in which the action was originally instituted. Addison v. Salyer, 185 Va. 644, 40 S.E.2d 260, 1946 Va. LEXIS 237 (1946). And motion to dismiss is proper where justice had no jurisdiction.  In Addison v. Salyer, 185 Va. 644, 40 S.E.2d 260 (1946), it was held that the trial justice did not have jurisdiction of the case appealed, and when that lack of jurisdiction appeared in the circuit court that court should have sustained the motion to dismiss. Sta cy v. Mullins, 185 Va. 837, 40 S.E.2d 265, 1946 Va. LEXIS 257 (1946). Amendmen t of pleadings beyond justices jurisdiction.  A plaintiff, while his case is pending in the circuit court on appeal from a decision of a trial justice, may not amend his pleadings to present a case which, as clearly shown on the face of the pleadings, the trial justice had no jurisdiction to determine. Addison v. Salyer, 185 Va. 644, 40 S.E.2d 260, 1946 Va. LEXIS 237 (1946). Amendment to claim amount in excess of justices jurisdiction.  On appeal of a civil action from a trial justice appointed under Chapter 2 of former Title 16, a plaintiff may not, in the circuit court, amend his complaint to c laim an amount in excess of the jurisdiction of the trial justice. Even if this section were applicable, it would not authorize the amendment, for the reason that the appeal was a continuation of the original case, and on the appeal the warrant could not be amended to make a case of which the trial justice would not have had jurisdiction. Stacy v. Mullins, 185 Va. 837, 40 S.E.2d 265, 1946 Va. LEXIS 257 (1946). Statutory scheme permitted a plaintiff to increase the amount of the ad damnum above the jurisdictional limit but only if she did so prior to trial in the distric t court, and such a request necessitated a transfer of the claim to the circuit court for trial where the existing statutory framework made clear that after trial in the district court, on de novo appeal to the circuit court, an increase in the amount of the claim beyond the $25,000 jurisdictional limit was permitted only if the defendant appealed; the amended complaint requested relief outside the circuit courts jurisdiction because it permitted plaintiff to receive an award of $40,000 in damages. Ruderman v. Pritchard, 76 Va. App. 295, 881 S.E.2d 665, 2022 Va. App. LEXIS 647 (2022). Substitution of plaintiff as an individual in action brought by her as executrix where plaintiff would be sole distributee of any recovery. See Grinels v. Legg, 208 Va. 63, 155 S.E.2d 56, 1967 Va. LEXIS 184 (1967). When a trial court judge fails to require an appeal bond, under this section, which shou ld be liberally construed, it is the duty of the circuit court to correct the omission, and require the execution of the bond, and upon due execution thereof to proceed with the trial of the case according to the principles of law and equity. Jenkins v. Bertram, 163 Va. 672, 177 S.E. 204, 1934 Va. LEXIS 207 (1934). Effect of failure to post appeal bond.  Failure of appealing party to post appeal bond in appeal of judgment of juvenile and domestic relations district court was a fatal jurisdictional defect that coul d not be cured under this section. Commonwealth, Va. Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. May v. Walker, 253 Va. 319, 485 S.E.2d 134, 1997 Va. LEXIS 50 (1997). A deficient appeal bond does not require dismissal of the appeal since under this sectio n the court is empowered to correct defects, irregularities or omissions in the proceedings of a court not of record and § 16.1-109 empowers an appellate court to require the appellant to give new or additional security. Burks v. Three Hills Corp., 21 4 Va. 322, 200 S.E.2d 521, 1973 Va. LEXIS 303 (1973). Error not to corre ct discrepancies in appeal bond.  It is error for a trial court to fail to exercise its statutory power to correct the discrepancies in an appeal bond of a proceeding in a court not of record wher e such a correction would have brought the dispute to a trial on the merits and thereby facilitated final adjudication of the rights of the parties. Burks v. Three Hills Corp., 214 Va. 322, 200 S.E.2d 521, 1973 Va. LEXIS 303 (1973). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Principle of equity in mortgage case.  Having conceded that she could not maintain ownership and possession of the real estate without regularly paying the deed of trust note, having established a mech anism for paying the note into the registry of the court, and then having failed to honor her payment obligations, the mortgagor would not be heard to say that she should be allowed to maintain her defense of the case; as this action was removed from the General District Court, and under § 16.1-114.1, equity principles applied and a fundamental principle of equity was that one who sought equity had to do equity, so the mortgagee was granted a writ of possession. Principal Residential Mortg. Corp. v. Curtis, 61 Va. Cir. 151, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 5 (Roanoke Feb. 10, 2003). Effect of failure to post appeal bond.  Circuit court held that plaintiff should be given additional time to post a $15,000 bond on the appeal of defendants counter-claim as there was no reasoning a s to why plaintiff should have to post two separate bonds, one for the appeal of his claim and one for the appeal of the counter-claim when the claims arose out of the same cause of action as doing so would frustrate the principles of § 16.1-114.1.Van Garris v. Harold, 71 Va. Cir. 411, 2005 Va. Cir. LEXIS 260 (Norfolk Apr. 29, 2005). Parties on appeal.  Effect of an appeal from a judgment entered against one of two defendants was to completely nullify the effect of the district court judgment; thus, regardless of the finding of the lower court, the reviewing court had appellate jurisdiction over all the parties to the case, including the defendant against whom judgment was not entered. Khan v. Washington, 74 Va. Cir. 95, 2007 Va. Cir. LEXIS 255 (Alexandria July 27, 2007). Amendment permitted.  Although plaintiff selected only the contract box on warrant in debt, plaintiff was permitted to amend its pleadings...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-115"><akn:num>§ 16.1-115</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1986, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>45.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-116"><akn:num>§ 16.1-116</akn:num><akn:heading>Issuance of executions and abstracts and proceedings by interrogatories after papers returned to circuit court</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text When a judgment has been rendered in a civil action in a general district court and the papers in the action have been returned to the clerk of the circuit court for fi ling and preserving, executions upon and abstracts of the judgment may be issued by the clerk of such circuit court within the periods permitted under § 8.01-251, provided that such judgment has been duly entered in the judgment lien docket book of su ch court.

All o ffenses against the ordinances of a service district shall be prosecuted in the name of such service district; b. All other misdemeanors and traffic infractions arising in such county, including the towns in such county, or city. 2. Each genera l district court which is established within a city shall also have: a. Concu rrent jurisdiction with the circuit court of such city for all violations of state revenue and election laws; and b. Exclusive original jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided by general law or the city charter, within the area extending for one mile beyond the corporate limits thereof, for the tr ial of all offenses against the ordinances, laws and bylaws of the city. 3. If a city l ying within a county has no general district court provided by city charter or under general law, then the general district court of the county within which such city lies shall have the same jurisdiction in such city as a general district court establis hed for a city would have. 4.

Upon certif ication by the general district court of any felony charge and ancillary misdemeanor charge or when an appeal of a conviction of an offense in general district court is noted, jurisdiction as to such charges shall vest in the circuit court, unless such c ase is reopened pursuant to § 16.1-133.1; a final judgment, order, or decree is modified, vacated, or suspended pursuant to Supreme Court of Virginia Rule 1:1; or the appeal has been withdrawn in the general district court within 10 days pursuant to § 16.1-133. 7.

CASE NOTES Petty offenses not requiring jury trial.  Notwithstanding the broad language of the Virginia Constitution, there are many petty offenses against statutes or municipal ordinances which are triable without a jury, because they were so triable when the Constitution was adopted, and the right of trial by jury which is secured is the right as it existed at the time the Constitution was adopted.

CASE NOTES No opportunity for vindictive deterrence of appeal.  The Virginia two-tier system of administering criminal justice does not present the opportunity for the vindictive deterrence of appeal condemned in North Carolin a v. Pearce, 1969 U.S. LEXIS 1165, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969); McClung v. Weatherholtz, 351 F. Supp. 5, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10995 (W.D. Va. 1972). Failure to appear on charging summons.  Traffic summons was a public record as it became the charging document on which a general district court tried an accused, under § 16.1-129, and if an accused willfully violated his written promise to appear in court, given when he signed the summons, he could be convicted for failure to appear under § 19.2-128, regardless of the disposition of, and in addition to, the charge upon which he was originally ar rested, under subdivision A 3 of § 19.2-74, and, given this statutory scheme, each signed summons clearly could constitute a separate offense under § 18.2-168, regarding forgery of a public document. Hines v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 752, 576 S.E. 2d 781, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 92 (2003). On a ppeal, court properly granted motion to amend summons.  Where both an arrest warrant and a summons charged defendant with violating a city ordinance and § 18.2-266, each of which is a misdemeanor, and the defendant was convicted on the summons and appealed, and on appeal, the circuit court granted the Commonwealths motion to amend the summons to delete the reference to the city ordinance, this action was proper, as the amendment did not change the nature or cha racter of the offense charged. Hill v. Commonwealth, No. 1240-91-4 (Ct. of Appeals Feb. 2, 1993). § 16.1-129.1. Repealed by Acts 1990, c. 75. § 16.1-129.2. Procedure when warrant defective. Text Upon the trial of a warrant, the court may, upon its own motion or upon the request either of the attorney for the prosecution or for the accused, amend the form of the warrant in any respect in which it appears to be defective. But when the warrant is so defective in form that it does not substantially appear from the same what is the offense with which the accused is charged, or even when it is not so seriously defec tive, the judge of the court having examined on oath the original complainant, if there be one, or if he sees good reason to believe that an offense has been committed, then without examination of witnesses, may issue under his own hand his warrant recit ing the offense and requiring the defendant in the original warrant to be arrested and brought before him. Upon the arrest of the defendant on the new warrant and his production or appearance in court the trial shall proceed upon the new warrant. When th ere is an amendment of the original warrant the trial shall proceed on the amended warrant. But whether the warrant is amended or a new warrant is issued, the court before proceeding to trial on the same may grant a continuance to the prosecution or to t he defendant upon such terms as to costs as may be proper under the circumstances of the case; provided, however, that if the warrant be amended or if a new warrant be issued after any evidence has been heard, the accused shall be entitled to a continuan ce as a matter of right. When a warrant is amended or a new warrant is issued the costs already accrued shall be taxed against the defendant, if he is ultimately convicted, as a part of the cos ts arising under the new or amended warrant. History History. 1968, c. 495. Annotations Cross references. For provision on amendment of written pleadings, see Rule 8:8, Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court Rules. CASE NOTES Judges authority to amend warrant.  Assuming a trial judge never actually accepted a defendants plea of guilty to a charge of driving under the influence, the judge retained the authority to ame nd the charging warrant and then find the defendant guilty of reckless driving. Kelley v. Stamos, 285 Va. 68, 737 S.E.2d 218, 2013 Va. LEXIS 10 (2013). Amendment did not render war rant defective.  Arrest warrant issued was not defective as a result of having been amended sometime prior to a trial de novo in the lower appellate court, where the dates of the offense were amended, as the same particularity was not required in warrants of arrest as was required in formal indictments; pursuant to §§ 16.1-129.2 and 16.1-137, as long as the warrant was not so defective as to fail to notify the defendant of the nature and character of the offense charged, both district courts and circuit courts had the power to amend a warrant in any respect in which the warrant appeared to be defective, on the courts own motion and without the consent of the parties. R aja v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 710, 581 S.E.2d 237, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 318 (2003). Amendment did not rend er indictment defective.  Even though the trial court allowed the indictment to be amended, the indictment was not rendered defective by the amendment. The trial court merely allowed the i ndictment to be changed from reading that defendant robbed the store to defendant robbed the store clerk, but at all times, defendant was aware of the nature of the conduct forming the robbery charge against defendant. Thomas v. Commonwealth, 2006 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 605 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 20, 2006). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Amendment could not change nature and character of offense charged.  Amendment to a warrant could not change the nature and character of the offense originally charged; a trial court erred when, after hearing the evidence and witho ut the agreement of the parties or the request of either, sua sponte, amended a DUI warrant to reckless driving and convicted defendant, since reckless driving was not a lesser included offense of DUI. Commonwealth v. Sumner, 66 Va. Cir. 266, 2004 Va. Ci r. LEXIS 322 (Salem Dec. 3, 2004). Dismissal of an appeal was required because, although defendant was tried on a charge of improper lane change, he was convicted of the charge of failure to give f ull time and attention to the operation of the vehicle, pursuant to Fairfax, Va., County Code § 82-4-24, and the district court had not amended the warrant, because an amendment could not change the nature and character of the offense originally charg ed. Commonwealth v. Dipietro, 79 Va. Cir. 55, 2009 Va. Cir. LEXIS 67 (Fairfax County Apr. 22, 2009). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Prosecutorial discretion.  While a prosecutor is permitted to move to amend a misdemeanor charge alleging a violation of a municipal ordinance to the equivalent misdemeanor charge alleging a violation of state law when such an arrest or summons was made by an officer of a local police department or a deputy for a local sheriffs department, any such an amendment is subject to judicial review and may be made only by an appropriate judici al officer.

CASE NOTES No violation of Equal Protection C lause.  With respect to appellate procedure, the distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors either do not exist or, where they do, are based upon well-reasoned object ives which serve a legitimate state interest and protect the constitutional right of defendants convicted of crime and thus do not violate equal protection. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is not violated by the procedure in which a person convicted of a misdem eanor in a court not of record is given an automatic appeal to a higher court while a person originally convicted in a court of record has no such automatic right of appeal to a higher court. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LE XIS 206 (1974). Construction with other laws.  Where the provisions of §§ 16.1-69.24 and 18.2-459 address the specific subject of appeals from summary contempt adjudications in the district courts, and t he provisions of §§ 16.1-132 and 16.1-136 address the general subject of appeals from the district courts, to the extent that the more specific provisions of §§ 16.1-69.24 and § 18.2-459 are in conflict with the general provisions of § § 16.1-132 and 16.1-136, the more specific statutes prevail. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474, 2008 Va. LEXIS 23 (2008). Because the provisions of § 16.1-69.24 and § 18.2-459 had to prevail over the more general provisions of §§ 16.1-132 and 16.1-136, a contemnor appeali ng an adjudication of summary contempt does not receive a trial de novo in the circuit court with attendant Sixth Amendment protections and, thus, does not have a Sixth Amendment right of confrontation in that summary contempt adjudication in the circuit court. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474, 2008 Va. LEXIS 23 (2008). This section contains no unreasonable restrictions. Gaskill v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 486, 144 S.E.2d 293, 1965 Va. LEXIS 224 (1965). Section does not limit appeals from other juvenile court orders or judgments.  Although this section mentions a right to an appeal only with respect to orders or judgments pertaining to convictions, filing for recognizance, or revoking suspe nsion of sentences, this provision does not operate to limit the right of appeal from other juvenile court orders or judgments. Hairfield v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 649, 376 S.E.2d 796, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1674, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 12 (1989). Orders transferring juveniles are final, a contrary interpretation would contravene legi slative intent, and such orders are immediately appealable to the circuit court and need not be preceded by a conviction under this section. Hairfield v. Commonwealth, 7 Va. App. 649, 376 S.E.2d 796, 5 Va. Law Rep. 1674, 1989 Va. App. LEXIS 12 (1989). This section insures an unrestricted right of appeal to the circuit court, where the acc used can demand a jury. Lacey v. Palmer, 93 Va. 159, 24 S.E. 930, 1896 Va. LEXIS 62 (1896) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). Regardless of whether error wa s committed.  The intent of the former statutes relating to appeals from justices of the peace, and trial justices appointed under Chapter 2 of former Title 16, was to grant an appeal, in the nature of a new trial, as of right without inquiry as to whether the justice or trial justice has committed error or not. And considering the nature and procedure of these courts it seemed to be an undesirable practice to make appeals the refrom depend, in any case, upon the establishment by parol testimony that the justice had been guilty of judicial misconduct or had committed error. Dickerson v. Commonwealth, 162 Va. 787, 173 S.E. 543, 1934 Va. LEXIS 286 (1934) (decided under former st atute corresponding to this section). The trial de novo procedure involves a fresh determination of guilt or innocence by the court of general jurisdiction, which is not the court that acted before and has no motive to deal more strictly with a de novo defendant than it would with any other. Griffith v. Kerkhoff, 345 F. Supp. 1160, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13095 (W.D. Va. 1972). An appeal of a district court order revoking a suspended sentence must be heard de novo in the circuit court. Barnes v. City of Newport News, 9 Va. App. 466, 389 S.E.2d 481, 6 Va. Law Rep. 1370, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 34 (1990). The effect of an appeal, etc.  The effect of an appeal from the inferior courts decision is not only to deprive him of further jurisdiction but to annul his judgment of conviction. Malouf v. City of Roanoke, 177 Va. 846, 13 S.E.2d 319, 1941 Va. LEXIS 263 (1941) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). An appeal under this section and § 16.1-136 is, in effect, a statutory grant of a new trial which annuls the judgment of the inferior court, and accordingly su ch judgment may not be introduced in evidence before the jury in the circuit court. Harbaugh v. Commonwealth, 209 Va. 695, 167 S.E.2d 329, 1969 Va. LEXIS 163 (1969). An appeal under this section is in effect a statutory grant of a new trial, which annuls the judgment of the inferior court as completely as if there had been no previous trial, and it is reversible error to mention such judgment of conviction in a trial of the case on appeal. Buck v. City of Danville, 213 Va. 387, 192 S.E.2d 758, 1972 Va. LEXIS 372 (1972). Whenever a defendant exercises his rights under § 16.1-132 and a conviction in general district court is appealed, the fact of that conviction is not admissibl e in the appeal or in a subsequent civil proceeding. Baker v. Elmendorf, 271 Va. 474, 628 S.E.2d 358, 2006 Va. LEXIS 39 (2006). In a malicious prosecution suit, it was error to admit into evidence, under Ricketts v. J.G. McCrory Co., 138 Va. 548 (1924), the fact of a previous conviction as conclusive evidence of probable cause; where the conviction was reversed on appeal, the de novo appeal a nnulled the judgment of the inferior tribunal completely as if there had been no previous trial and wiped out guilty pleas. Baker v. Elmendorf, 271 Va. 474, 628 S.E.2d 358, 2006 Va. LEXIS 39 (2006). Defendants double jeopardy rights were not violated when he was convicted of assault under Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-57 in circuit court because assault was no t a lesser included offense of brandishing a machete under Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-282.1, and even if it was, he had appealed his assault under this statute, so the only offense he could not be charged for in his assault trial de novo was brandishing a machete, but he had not been charged with that in the circuit court assault case. Jones v. Commonwealth, 2023 Va. App. LEXIS 26 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 17, 2023). The right of appeal is not dependent upon the posting of a bond.  The right of an accused to appeal from the district court to the circuit court and obtain retrial of a misdemeanor charge pursuant to this section is not dependen t upon his posting an appeal bond. Hill v. Middlesex County, 12 Va. App. 58, 402 S.E.2d 243, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1894, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (1991). No condition imposed except appeal be made within 10 days from conviction.  No condition is imposed upon the exercise of the statutory right to appeal in this section other than the requirement that the appeal be made within 10 days from conviction in the district court. Hill v. Middlesex County, 12 Va. App. 58, 402 S.E.2d 243, 7 Va. Law Rep. 1894, 1991 Va. App. LEXIS 35 (1991). The right to appeal is n ot waived by form of plea.  The words and whether or not such conviction was upon a plea of guilty, make statutory the holding in Dickerson v. Commonwealth, 162 Va. 787, 173 S.E. 543 (1934), that a plea of guilty or not guilty does not operate to waive or bar the right of appeal given by that section. The case cited disapproves the contrary rule laid down in Cooper v.

A person withdrawing an appeal shall give written notice of withdrawal to the court and counsel for the prosecution prior to the hearing date of the appeal. If the appe al is withdrawn more than ten days after conviction, the circuit court shall forthwith enter an order affirming the judgment of the lower court and the clerk shall tax the costs as provided by statute.

Appeal and Error, §§ 232, 376, 381. CASE NOTES Construction with § 16.1-133.1.  The General Assembly intended to make fully available to a person convicted of a misdemeanor both the right to seek review by a de novo appeal and the right, with in the specified period, to petition to reopen the case in the district court; this section and § 16.1-133.1 must be construed in a manner that affords a convicted person the full opportunity to employ both post-trial procedures to the extent the exer cise of one does not conflict with the exercise of the other. Commonwealth v. Zamani, 256 Va. 391, 507 S.E.2d 608, 1998 Va. LEXIS 129 (1998). Termination of district courts jurisdiction following appeal to circuit court.  Where a case is brought in the circuit court on appeal from the district court, a de novo hearing on the merits must commence before the district courts juris diction to reopen the case is terminated; accordingly, where a defendant had noted his appeal to the circuit court and, at the only hearing in that court, the defendant had waived his right to a jury trial and the case was continued, such incidents did n ot rise to the dignity of a de novo hearing on the merits, the district court retained jurisdiction to reopen its judgment and the defendant could withdraw his appeal to the circuit court. Commonwealth v. Zamani, 256 Va. 391, 507 S.E.2d 608, 1998 Va. LEX IS 129 (1998). Validity of district courts jurisdiction following appeal to circuit court.  Where defendant withdrew an appeal of a district court judgment, pursuant to § 16.1-133, more than 10 days after the date of the judgment, and a de novo hearin g was not held, the judgment was stayed, but remained valid; a circuit courts appellate order did not annul or abrogate the district court judgment. Commonwealth v. Diaz, 266 Va. 260, 585 S.E.2d 552, 2003 Va. LEXIS 90 (2003). Reopening of case by district court.  Where an appeal had been perfected to the circuit court, and where appellant withdrew his appeal, until a de novo hearing on the merits had commenced, the distric t court could for good cause shown reopen and reconsider its judgment within sixty days from the final judgment. Zamani v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 59, 492 S.E.2d 854, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 698 (1997), aff'd, 256 Va. 391, 507 S.E.2d 608, 1998 Va. LEXIS 129 (1998). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Responsibility for costs.  Defendants appeal of a district court conviction for unreasonably failing to permit his blood or breath to be tested when charged with driving while intoxicat ed was a criminal matter to which the same procedures applied as appeals from misdemeanor convictions, and defendant was therefore responsible for the jury expense incurred in the circuit court when defendant withdrew his appeal on the day of trial when a jury had been assembled and resolved his case via plea bargain; to avoid the charge, defendant would have had to have withdrawn his jury demand at least 10 days prior to trial. Commonwealth v. Franklin, 54 Va. Cir. 214, 2000 Va. Cir. LEXIS 579 (Northam pton County 2000). § 16.1-133.1. Reopening case after conviction. Text Within sixty days from the date of conviction of any person in a general district court or juvenile and domestic relations district court for an offense not felonious, the case may be reopened upon the application of such person and for good cause shown. Such application shall be heard by the judge who presided at the trial in which the conviction was had, but if he be not in office, or be absent from the county or cit y or is otherwise unavailable to hear the application, it may be heard by his successor or by any other judge or substitute judge of such court. If the case is reopened after the case documents have been filed with the circuit court, the clerk of the cir cuit court shall return the case documents to the district court in which the case was originally tried.

Commonwealth v. Zamani, 256 Va. 391, 507 S.E.2d 608, 1998 Va. LEX IS 129 (1998). Juvenile court lost jurisdiction since no timely appeal filed.  Because a mother did not comply with subsection A of § 16.1-296 and § 16.1-133.1 by appealing a dispositional order within 10 days of its entry or applying to reopen the case within 60 days, pursuant to Va. Sup. Ct. R. 1:1, the juvenile court lost jurisdiction of a charge and the courts dismissal of that charge had no force; therefore, since the juvenile court had authority under subdivision A 13 c of § 16.1-278.8 to maintain custody of the child with the social services department, the circuit court properly denied the mothers motion to dismiss proceedings and return custody of her son. Lee v. Frederick County Dep't of Soc. Servs., 2008 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 370 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2008). Reopening of case where appeal w ithdrawn.  Where an appeal had been perfected to the circuit court, and where appellant withdrew his appeal, until a de novo hearing on the merits had commenced, the distric t court could for good cause shown reopen and reconsider its judgment within sixty days from the final judgment.

Finding of contempt base d on valid conviction.  Trial courts finding that defendant was in contempt of court was based on a valid conviction; as the district court did not dismiss defendants conviction within 21 days of the conviction order, the district court no longer had jurisdiction and could not dismiss defendants conviction. Wilson v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 465 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 13, 2002). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Applicability.  Statutory authority of § 16.1-133.1 applies only to convictions not matters rendered nolle prosequi; while the district court may retain its revisory power ove r criminal sentences within the time frame allotted by Va.

CASE NOTES Authority of jus tice after judgment of conviction.  The only prerogative that can be lawfully exercised, after judgment of conviction has been pronounced, by a justice of the peace (now district court judge) is to admit the accused to bail, if applied for immediately, or grant bail if subsequently applied for within ten days, or carry into execution the judgment. Seay v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1087, 156 S.E. 574, 1931 Va. LEXIS 285 (1931) (decided under former stat ute corresponding to this section). He cannot grant a new trial or hold judgment in abeyance.  There is no statutory provision for a new trial to be had before a justice of the peace (now district court judge) in a criminal case, nor is there any warrant of law authorizing him to hold in abeyance the judgment of conviction. Seay v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1087, 156 S.E. 574, 1931 Va. LEXIS 285 (1931) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). It is his mandatory duty to forthwith return and file all papers with the clerk of the c ourt having appellate jurisdiction of the case. Seay v.

When such filing has been done by the justice his jurisdiction is at an end and any furt her act committed in connection with the judgment is ultra vires and void. Seay v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1087, 156 S.E. 574, 1931 Va. LEXIS 285 (1931) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section).

Malouf v. City of Roanoke, 177 Va. 846, 13 S.E.2d 319, 1941 Va. LEXIS 263 (1941) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). The right of appeal is not dependent upon the posting of a bond.  The right of an accused to appeal from the district court to the circuit court and obtain retrial of a misdemeanor charge pursuant to § 16.1-132 is not depende nt upon his posting an appeal bond.

Constitutionality of distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors with respect to appeals.  With respect to appellate procedure, the distinctions between felonies and misdemeanors either do not exist or, where they do, are based upon well-reasoned object ives which serve a legitimate state interest and protect the constitutional rights of defendants convicted of crime and thus do not violate equal protection. Saunders v. Reynolds, 214 Va. 697, 204 S.E.2d 421, 1974 Va. LEXIS 206 (1974). Construction with other laws.  Where the provisions of §§ 16.1-69.24 and 18.2-459 address the specific subject of appeals from summary contempt adjudications in the district courts, and t he provisions of §§ 16.1-132 and 16.1-136 address the general subject of appeals from the district courts, to the extent that the more specific provisions of §§ 16.1-69.24 and § 18.2-459 are in conflict with the general provisions of § § 16.1-132 and 16.1-136, the more specific statutes prevail. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474, 2008 Va. LEXIS 23 (2008). Because the provisions of § 16.1-69.24 and § 18.2-459 had to prevail over the more general provisions of §§ 16.1-132 and 16.1-136, a contemnor appeali ng an adjudication of summary contempt does not receive a trial de novo in the circuit court with attendant Sixth Amendment protections and, thus, does not have a Sixth Amendment right of confrontation in that summary contempt adjudication in the circuit court. Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474, 2008 Va. LEXIS 23 (2008). Double jeopardy does not attac h.  Assertion that the trial on the new warrant under this section was barred by the double jeopardy clause was without merit. An appeal de novo from a general distri ct court to a circuit court annuls the former judgment as completely as if no trial had ever occurred. To allow a defendant to appeal a conviction in the general district court de novo and then plead double jeopardy in the circuit court would grant every criminal defendant who appealed an automatic pass to freedom. Ledbetter v. Commonwealth, 18 Va. App. 805, 447 S.E.2d 250, 11 Va. Law Rep. 134, 1994 Va. App. LEXIS 554 (1994). Trial by jury.  This section and § 16.1-132 were enacted pursuant to Va. Const., Art. I, § 8, and provide the means of securing a trial by jury. Commonwealth v. Bass, 113 V a. 760, 74 S.E. 397, 1912 Va. LEXIS 99 (1912) (decided under former statutes corresponding to this section and § 16.1-132). Improper denial of de novo a ppeal.  Circuit court committed clear error in denying a mother her right to a de novo appeal of an order awarding a father custody of the parties child because the c ircuit court considered the transcript of the juvenile and domestic relations district court hearing on the matter and pronounced that its ruling would be the same unless the mother presented different evidence; the circuit court improperly shifted the b urden of production and persuasion from the father to the mother by requiring the mother to present new or different evidence and imposed an award of attorneys fees as a punitive measure to punish the mother for pursuing her right to a trial de novo. Alexander v. Flowers, 51 Va. App. 404, 658 S.E.2d 355, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 139 (2008). No opportunity for vindictive deterrence of appeal.  The Virginia two-tier system of administering criminal justice does not present the opportunity for the vindictive deterrence of appeal condemned in North Carolin a v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). McClung v. Weatherholtz, 351 F. Supp. 5, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10995 (W.D. Va. 1972). II.Trial de novo. The court is given a free hand in conducting the trial on appeal, under this section and § 16.1-137, in such a way as to guarantee every substantial right, on the one hand, and, on the other, to cut off frivolous and formal objections. Collins v. City of Radford, 134 Va. 518, 113 S.E. 735, 1922 Va. LEXIS 174 (1922) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). The de novo trial is a two-edged sword. Just as a defendant is protected against having anything that happened in the lower court used against him in the de novo trial, he may not seek to incur any of the benefits. The fact that the prosecution may have agreed to a lesser penalty below is irrelevant in the de novo trial. McClung v. Weatherh oltz, 351 F. Supp. 5, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10995 (W.D. Va. 1972). Which is to be heard de novo.  Under the provisions of this section appeals from convictions by mayors, police justices, justices of the peace and trial justices appointed under Chapter 2 of fo rmer Title 16 (now district court judges), are to be tried de novo. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. City of Charlottesville, 126 Va. 800, 101 S.E. 357 (1919); Ossa v. Town of Appalachia, 137 Va. 795, 119 S.E. 51 (1923); Seay v. Commonwealth, 155 Va. 1087, 156 S.E. 574 (1931); Peak v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 535, 199 S.E. 473 (1938); Gravely v. Deeds, 185 Va. 662, 40 S.E.2d 175 (1946). The above cases were decided under former statute corresponding to this section Laing v. Commonwealth, 203 Va. 682, 127 S.E. 2d 142 (1962), cert. denied, Gamble v. Gamble, 14 Va. App. 558, 421 S.E.2d 635 (1992). In Virginia, on appeal from convictions of misdemeanors in courts not of record to courts of record, the defendant is entitled to a trial de novo under this secti on. Griffin v. Wilkerson, 335 F. Supp. 1272, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15667 (W.D. Va. 1972). Circuit court erred because it acted as a court of appeals and did not conduct a de novo trial by asking a father to show where in the record he preserved his arg uments; the circuit court did not conduct a new hearing on the underlying issues but rather reviewed the determination of the juvenile and domestic relations district court and rendered a decision based upon that review. Minor v. Barrett, 2016 Va. App. L EXIS 263 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 11, 2016). And without formal pleadings.  This section dispenses with formal pleadings in writing on the trial where an appeal has been taken from the judgment of a justice convicting one of an offense. H arding v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. 858, 52 S.E. 832 (1906); Harley v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 664, 108 S.E. 648 (1921); Collins v. City of Radford, 134 Va. 518, 113 S.E. 735 (1922); Ossa v. Town of Appalachia, 137 Va. 795, 119 S.E. 51 (1923); McWilliams v. Co mmonwealth, 165 Va. 725, 181 S.E. 391 (1935); Peak v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 535, 199 S.E. 473 (1938). The above cases were decided under former statute corresponding to this section . This section does not deprive an accused of the right or relieve him of the duty to file informal or special pleas, if he intends to rely on them. Royals v. City of Hampton, 201 Va. 552, 111 S.E.2d 795, 1960 Va. LEXIS 128 (1960). A trial de novo in the circuit court grants to a litigant every advantage which would ha ve been his had the case been tried originally in such court. Walker v. Department of Pub. Welfare, 223 Va. 557, 290 S.E.2d 887, 1982 Va. LEXIS 238 (1982). Consideration of evidence.  A trial court is required to consider any relevant evidence developed prior to the hearing date that may impact on the childs best interests. Parish v. Spauld ing, 20 Va. App. 130, 455 S.E.2d 728, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 330 (1995). The appeal is in effect a statutory grant of a new trial to the accused to be had before the appellate court. Dickerson v. Commonwealth, 162 Va. 787, 173 S.E. 543 (1934); Gravely v. Deeds, 185 Va. 662, 40 S.E.2d 175 (1946); Baylor v. Commonwealth, 190 Va. 116, 56 S.E.2d 77 (1949). These cases were decided under former statute corresponding to this section . The intent of this section and § 16.1-137 is to afford the accused, by giving him a new trial before the court on appeal, the opportunity to have every advanta ge which would have been his had he been tried originally in such court. Dickerson v. Commonwealth, 162 Va. 787, 173 S.E. 543, 1934 Va. LEXIS 286 (1934) (decided under former corresponding statutes). The appeal is in effect a statutory grant of a new trial to the accused, to be had before a court of record having original criminal jurisdiction. Gaskill v. Comm onwealth, 206 Va. 486, 14...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-137"><akn:num>§ 16.1-137</akn:num><akn:heading>Procedure on appeal when warrant defective</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Upon the trial of the warrant on appeal the court may, upon its own motion or upon the request either of the attorney for the prosecution or for the accused, amend the form of the warrant in any respect in which it appears to be defective. But when the warrant is so defective in form that it does not substantially appear from the same what is the offense with which the accused is charged, or even when it is not so seri ously defective, the judge of the court having examined on oath the original complainant, if there be one, or if he sees good reason to believe that an offense has been committed, then without examination of witnesses, may issue under his own hand his wa rrant reciting the offense and requiring the defendant in the original warrant to be arrested and brought before him. Upon the arrest of the defendant on the new warrant and his production or appearance in court the trial shall proceed upon the new warra nt. When there is an amendment of the original warrant the trial shall proceed on the amended warrant. But whether the warrant is amended or a new warrant is issued, the court before proceeding to trial on the same may grant a continuance to the prosecut ion or to the defendant upon such terms as to costs as may be proper under the circumstances of the case; provided, however, that if the warrant be amended or if a new warrant be issued after any evidence has been heard, the accused shall be entitled to a continuance as a matter of right. When a warrant is amended or a new warrant is issued the costs already accrued shall be taxed against the defendant, if he is ultimately convicted, as a part of the cos ts arising under the new or amended warrant.

CASE NOTES Legislative intent.  This section was intended to provide broad powers and abundant opportunity to amend a defective warrant where justice so requires. Watkins v. Commonwealth, 1997 V a. App. LEXIS 294 (Va. Ct. App. May 6, 1997). Formal pleadings are dispensed with.  Formal pleadings are dispensed with on the trial of an appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace (now district court judge) convicting one of an offense. Harding v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. 858, 52 S.E. 832, 1906 Va. LEXIS 93 (1906) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). See § 16.1-136 . And a warrant do es not require technical precision.  A warrant need not have the particularity or technical precision of pleading required in an indictment. Harding v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. 858, 52 S.E. 832, 1906 Va . LEXIS 93 (1906) (see Harley v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 664, 108 S.E. 648 (1921). These cases were decided under former statute corresponding to this section). But it must recite the offense charged .  While a warrant is not required to describe the offense with that particularity demanded of indictments, it must recite the offense charged. Commonwealth v. Doss, 159 Va. 968, 167 S.E. 371 (1933); Smith v. Commonwealth, 160 Va. 943, 169 S.E. 550 (1933). Both cases were decided under former statute corresponding to this section . It was error for the trial court to convict the defendant of a violation of a state statute upon a warrant which, at the time of conviction, charged a violation o f a county ordinance. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 766, 146 S.E.2d 197, 1966 Va. LEXIS 146 (1966). With sufficient clarity.  Where an appeal has been taken from the judgment of a justice of the peace (now district court judge) convicting one of an offense, the charge of the offense must be sufficiently clear and specific to inform the accused of the precise offense with which he is charged. Harding v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. 858, 52 S.E. 832, 1906 Va. LEXIS 93 (1906) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). A warrant charging the accused with the violation of § 36 of Michies Virginia Code of 1930, by hunting during the closed season, was held fatally defective as legal notice to the accused of the offense with which he was charged. Smith v. Commonwealth, 160 Va. 943, 169 S.E. 550, 1933 Va. LEXIS 272 (1933) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). The court is given a free hand in conducting the trial on appeal, under this section and § 16.1-136, in such way as to guarantee every substantial right, on the one hand, and, on the other, to cut off frivolous and formal objections. Collins v. City of Radford, 134 Va. 518, 113 S.E. 735, 1922 Va. LEXIS 174 (1922) (decided under former st atutes corresponding to this section and § 16.1-136). It may amend warrants or issue new one s.  Under this section, on appeals from convictions before a mayor, justice of the peace or police justice (now district court judges), the appellate court has full p ower to amend the warrants in any particular, or to issue new warrants in lieu thereof. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. City of Charlottesville, 126 Va. 800, 101 S.E. 357 (1919); Ossa v. Town of Appalachia, 137 Va. 795, 119 S.E. 51 (1923); Commonwealth v. Doss, 159 Va. 968, 167 S.E. 371 (1933); Smith v. Commonwealth, 160 Va. 943, 169 S.E. 550 (1933). These cases were decided under former statute corresponding to this section . Under this section abundant opportunity is afforded to correct a warrant. Harley v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 664, 108 S.E. 648, 1921 Va. LEXIS 55 (1921) (decided und er former statute corresponding to this section). Under this section there is ample power to correct formal objection to a warrant. Flint v. Commonwealth, 114 Va. 820, 76 S.E. 308, 1912 Va. LEXIS 147 (1912) (deci ded under former statute corresponding to this section). Where the original warrant was sufficient to inform the accused of the charge against him, the court did not err in permitting amendments thereto instead of issui ng a new warrant. McWilliams v. Commonwealth, 165 Va. 725, 181 S.E. 391, 1935 Va. LEXIS 323 (1935) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). Because a warrant provided defendant with notice of the nature and character of the offense with which defendant was charged, and because §§ 16.1-137 and 19 .2-226 authorized the trial court to amend the warrant to delete reference to a city code, which was mere surplusage, the trial court properly denied defendants motion to dismiss, and found defendant guilty of a second offense of driving under the in fluence under § 18.2-266. Dennis v. Commonwealth, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 530 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 9, 2008). The court may change a warrant to cover another offense.  Under the broad powers conferred by this section, the court of its own motion may direct the attorney for the Commonwealth to change a warrant from an attempt to commit larceny of oats to an attempt to obtain money by false pretenses. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 111 Va. 844, 69 S.E. 518 (1910), distinguished in, Eddy v. Commonwealth, 119 Va. 873, 89 S.E. 899 (1916). These cases were decided under former statute cor responding to this section . Where the real subject of prosecution was the violation of a local law against catching fish with nets, and the warrant charged defendant with a violation of the fish laws of the State, the defect could have been corrected by amendment under this section. Burks v. Commonwealth, 126 Va. 763, 101 S.E. 230, 1919 Va. LEXIS 111 (1919) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). And it may be duty bound to do so.  When it was brought to the attention of the trial court by accused that the appeal warrant charged him with an offense against the State, whereas he had been trie d before the police justice for an offense against a city ordinance, it became the duty of the trial court, under this section, to amend the warrant so as to conform it to the facts so brought to its attention. Malouf v. City of Roanoke, 177 Va. 846, 13 S.E.2d 319, 1941 Va. LEXIS 263 (1941) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). Instead of remanding case to t rial justice.  See Read v. Commonwealth, 65 Va. (24 Gratt.) 618 (1873); Malouf v. City of Roanoke, 177 Va. 846, 13 S.E.2d 319 (1941). Both cases were decided under former statut e corresponding to this section . The court was bound to take the warrant as it read when the evidence was concluded and t he defendants motion to strike was made. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 206 Va. 766, 146 S.E.2d 197, 1966 Va. LEXIS 146 (1966). Substitution o f warrant pending appeal may be error.  Where a prisoner convicted by a police justice of the violation of a city ordinance against houses of ill fame appeals to the corporation court, neither the attor ney for the Commonwealth nor the police justice can, pending the appeal, change the warrant so as to charge an offense under former § 18.1-196 (now § 18.2-347). There having been no conviction of any offense under the statute, the provisions of thi s section as to amendments and changes of the warrant have no application, and until such conviction, the corporation court has no jurisdiction, with or without the consent of the accused, to hear and determine a charge of misdemeanor under former § 1 8.1-196 (now § 18.2-347). Eddy v. Commonwealth, 119 Va. 873, 89 S.E. 899 (1916). Both cases were decided under former statute corresponding to this section . The court may try a case on a new warr ant.  Under the broad terms of this section if there is any substantial reason to suppose that the accused does not know from the warrant what he is charged with, the c ourt may discard the original warrant and proceed to trial on a new warrant for the offense. Collins v. City of Radford, 134 Va. 518, 113 S.E. 735, 1922 Va. LEXIS 174 (1922) (decided under former statute corresponding to this section). Or on a warrant issued before commission of offense.  In a prosecution for the unlawful sale of ardent spirits, it was held that the defendant was not prejudiced by the fact that th...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-138"><akn:num>§ 16.1-138</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1983, c</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>499.

Welfare, 223 Va. 557, 290 S.E.2d 887, 1982 Va. LEXIS 238 (1982). Strict c ompliance with substantive statutes required.  Taken as a whole, the Virginia cases compel strict compliance with the requirements of the juvenile statutes that are not merely procedural.

But failure to comply with any statute may not be jurisdictional defect.  Virginia cases do not indicate that the failure to comply with any juvenile statute is a jurisdictional defect and establish no per se rule to that effect. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 10309 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1024 (1979).

It is the intention of this law that in all proceedings the welfare of the child and the family, the safety of the community and the protection of the rights of victims are the paramount concerns of the Commonwealth and to the end that these p urposes may be attained, the judge shall possess all necessary and incidental powers and authority, whether legal or equitable in their nature. This law shall be interpreted and construed so as to effectuate the following purposes: 1. To di vert from or within the juvenile justice system, to the extent possible, consistent with the protection of the public safety, those children who can be cared for or treated through alternative programs; 2. To provide judicial procedures through which the provisions of this law are executed and enforced and in which the parties are assured a fair hearing and their constitutional and other rights are recognized and enforced; 3. To separate a child from such childs parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis only when the childs welfare is endangered or it is in the int erest of public safety and then only after consideration of alternatives to out-of-home placement which afford effective protection to the child, his family, and the community; and 4. To protect the community against those acts of its citizens, both juveniles and adults, which are harmful to others and to reduce the incidence of delinquent behavior and to hold offen ders accountable for their behavior.

Commonwealth, 198 Va. 833, 97 S.E.2d 14, 1957 Va. LEXIS 146 (1957). Strict c ompliance with substantive statutes required.  Taken as a whole, the Virginia cases compel strict compliance with the requirements of the juvenile statutes that are not merely procedural. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 10309 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1024 (1979). But failure to comply with any statute may not be jurisdictional defect.  Virginia cases do not indicate that the failure to comply with any juvenile statute is a jurisdictional defect and establish no per se rule to that effect. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 10309 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1024 (1979). Impeachment with pri or juvenile adjudications.  A prosecutor may not impeach the defendant with evidence of prior juvenile adjudications, and the attempt to so cross-examine defendant was not harmless error. La vinder v. Commonwealth, 395 S.E.2d 211, 7 Va. Law Rep. 118, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 136 (Va. Ct. App. 1990). Authority to issue interlocutory o rder.  Trial court properly affirmed juvenile and domestic relations courts order which held the juvenile in contempt for failing to attend school, as § 16.1-227 provided the court with authority to issue the interlocutory order. B.P. v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 735, 568 S.E.2d 412, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 498 (2002). Best interests of child.  Mother and fathers apparent stipulation to the correctness of the juvenile and domestic relations courts adjudicatory order making a nonspecific finding t hat their child was abused was not binding on the trial court to the extent that agreement conflicted with the trial courts duty to determine what disposition would serve the best interest of the child. Thus, the trial court needed to hear evidence a nd make findings about who was inflicting the abuse, and what type of abuse was being inflicted, since § 16.1-227 expressed the intent of the legislature that the welfare of the child and the family were the paramount concerns of the Commonwealth. Ano nymous B v. Anonymous C, 51 Va. App. 657, 660 S.E.2d 307, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 201 (2008). Trial court did not err in denying a mothers request for a nonsuit under § 8.01-380 because the evidence supported a finding that it was in the best intere sts of her child for the trial court to transfer the right to advocate for the protective order to the father and the guardian ad litem, and since the mother was a respondent to the preliminary protective order, her right to nonsuit the case against her was subordinate to the welfare of the child; in cases where allegations of child sexual abuse have been presented to the trial court and a preliminary protective order has been issued pursuant to those allegations, an alleged abusers right to nonsuit must be subordinate to the welfare of the child, and the right to advocate a protective order on behalf of the child can be transferred to a party of interest. Anonymous C v. Anonymous B, 2011 Va. App. LEXIS 14 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2011). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Equitable powers of juvenile court.  Juvenile court erred in concluding that it did not have jurisdiction over the petition the city social services agency filed that alleged the minor child was a ch ild in need of services and that continued placement in the home would be contrary to the minor childs welfare; evidence showing that the mother had previously abused the minor childs brother was sufficient to invoke the juvenile courts equit able jurisdiction even though the evidence did not show that the minor child had been abused, as the juvenile court was authorized to prevent the minor childs placement with a known abuser and did not have to wait for the minor child herself to be ab used. Norfolk Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Petermore, 63 Va. Cir. 315, 2003 Va. Cir. LEXIS 351 (Norfolk Oct. 24, 2003). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Contempt proceedings.  A juvenile and domestic relations (JDR) court may enforce, through indirect contempt proceedings, a provision of an emergency protective order (EPO) granting the petitioner the possession of a companion animal when a magistrate has issued the EPO. The contempt proceedings may be initiated by a JDR court through the issuance of a show cause summons. A JDR court has discretion in imposing punishment for a violation of a companion animal provision in an EPO, but the punishment may not exceed a jail sentence in excess of six months or a fine in excess of $500 without affording the defendant the right to trial by jury. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Ani ta D. Filson, Chief Judge, Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court for the 25th Judicial District, No. 14-033, 2014 Va. AG LEXIS 62 (11/21/14). Transportation of juveniles.  Statute authorizes the chief judge of a juvenile and domestic relations district court to order that local law-enforcement personnel shall be responsible for tran sporting violent and disruptive juveniles to court-ordered out-of-state destinations; when a local law-enforcement officer is transporting a prisoner in another state, he has only such law-enforcement authority over the prisoner as may be provided by the laws of that state.

Whose parents or other person responsible for his care creates or inflicts, threatens to create or inflict, or allows to be created or inflicted upon such child a physical or mental injury by other than accidental means, or creates a substantial risk of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions, including, but not limited to, a child who is with his parent or other person responsible for his care either (i) during the manufacture or attempted manufacture of a Schedule I or II cont rolled substance, or (ii) during the unlawful sale of such substance by that childs parents or other person responsible for his care, where such manufacture, or attempted manufacture or unlawful sale would constitute a felony violation of § 18.2-2 48; 2. Whose parents or other person responsible for his care neglects or refuses to provide care necessary for his health; however, no child who in good faith is under treatment solely by spiritual means through prayer in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination shall for that reason alone be considered to be an abused or neglected child. Further, a decision by parents who have legal aut hority for the child or, in the absence of parents with legal authority for the child, any person with legal authority for the child who refuses a particular medical treatment for a child with a life-threatening condition shall not be deemed a refusal to provide necessary care if (i) such decision is made jointly by the parents or other person with legal authority and the child; (ii) the child has reached 14 years of age and is sufficiently mature to have an informed opinion on the subject of his medica l treatment; (iii) the parents or other person with legal authority and the child have considered alternative treatment options; and (iv) the parents or other person with legal authority and the child believe in good faith that such decision is in the ch ilds best interest. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the provisions of § 16.1-278.4; 3. Whose parents or other person responsible for his care abandons such child; 4. Whose parents or other person responsible for his care, or an intimate partner of such parent or person, commits or allows to be committed any act of sexual exploitation or any se xual act upon a child in violation of the law; 5. Who is without parental care or guardianship caused by the unreasonable absence or the mental or physical incapacity of the childs parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis; 6. Whose parents or other person responsible for his care creates a substantial risk of physical or mental injury by knowingly leaving the child alone in the same dwelling, including an apartment as defined in § 55.1-2000, with a person to whom the child is not related by blood or marriage and who the parent or other person responsible for his care knows has been convicted of an offense against a minor for which registration is r equired as a Tier III offender pursuant to § 9.1-902; or 7. Who has been identified as a victim of sex trafficking or severe forms of trafficking as defined in the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, 22 U.S.C. § 7102 et seq., and in the federal Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, 42 U.S.C. § 5101 et seq. If a civil proceeding under this chapter is based solely on the parent having left the child at a hospital or emergency medical services agency, it shall be an affirmat ive defense that such parent safely delivered the child within 30 days of the childs birth to (i) a hospital that provides 24-hour emergency services, (ii) an attended emergency medical services agency that employs emergency medical services personne l, or (iii) a newborn safety device located at and operated by such hospital or emergency medical services agency. For purposes of terminating parental rights pursuant to § 16.1-283 and placement for adoption, the court may find such a child is a negl ected child upon the ground of abandonment. Adoptive home means the place of residence of any natural person in which a child resi des as a member of the household and in which he has been placed for the purposes of adoption or in which he has been legally adopted by another member of the household. Adult means a person 18 years of age or older. Ancillary crime or ancillary charge means any delinquent act committed by a juvenile as a part of the same act or transaction as, or that constitutes a part of a common scheme or plan with, a delinquent act that would be a felony if committed by an adult. Child,juvenile, or minor means a person who is (i) younger than 18 years of age or (ii) for purposes of the Fostering Futures program set forth in Article 2 (§ 63.2-917 et seq.) of Chapter 9 of Title 63.2, younger than 21 years of age and meets the eligibility criteria set forth in § 63.2-919. Child in need of services means (i) a child whose behavior, conduct or condition prese nts or results in a serious threat to the well-being and physical safety of the child or (ii) a child under the age of 14 whose behavior, conduct or condition presents or results in a serious threat to the well-being and physical safety of another person ; however, no child who in good faith is under treatment solely by spiritual means through prayer in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination shall for that reason alone be considered to be a child in need of services, nor shall any child who habitually remains away from or habitually deserts or abandons his family as a result of what the court or the local child protective services unit determines to be incidents of physical, emotional or sexual abuse in the home be considered a child in need of services for that reason alone.

Michies Jurisprudence. For related discussion, see 4A M.J. Commonwealths and States Attorney, § 4. CASE NOTES Purpose.  This section, in effect, gives the Commonwealths attorney some discretion in prosecuting certain criminal cases in the juvenile and domestic relations courts and requires him to prosecute all cases appealed to the circuit court. But the statute does not confer authority to represent parties in civil cases in which the Commonwealth is not a party in interest. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2 d 169, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1806, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (1987). Duty to prosecute foreign suppor t orders.  The Commonwealths attorney has a duty to prosecute foreign support orders that are properly before a Virginia court pursuant to the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (§§ 20-88.12 to 20-88.31) [see now the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (§ 20-88.32 et. seq.)].Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1806, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (1987). The word case, as used in the second paragraph of this section, refers to the ca ses described in the paragraph immediately preceding it. The first paragraph provides that the Commonwealth shall prosecute felony charges before the juvenile court and may prosecute misdemeanor charges before that court, but shall be required to do so o nly when the court so directs. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1806, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (1987). The second paragraph of this section, which states that the Commonwealth shall represent the state in all cases appealed from the juvenile and domestic relations district court to the circuit court, refers only to cases in which the Commonwealth is a party or, at least, has an interest. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 674, 353 S.E.2d 169, 3 Va. Law Rep. 1806, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 157 (1987). Real party in interest h as right to own counsel.  In civil matters appealed to the circuit court, the Commonwealth may have a theoretical interest in seeing that the best interests of children are provided for in both custody disputes and support proceedings. However, the real party in interest has a right to his or her own counsel. Certainly the legislature never intended that under these circumstances the Commonwealths attorney be allowed to control litiga tion in a purely civil case. Walthall v. Commonwealth, 3 Va.

Annotations CASE NOTES Reassignment.  Circuit court erred in reversing a hearing officers decision that granted an employees request for relief and reinstatement to his former position, becaus e the employees grievance went through every procedural step available and policy to which he was entitled, the hearing officer had jurisdiction to take the necessary action, the position was a statutory creation, the hearing officers findings of fact generally reflected positively on the employee, and the Department of Juvenile Justice reassigned the employee arbitrarily or as a form of unwarranted punishment.

Orders of the juvenile court in such cases shall continue to be reviewed and enforced by the juvenile court until the circuit court, Court of Appeals or Supreme Court rules otherwise. History History. 1998, c. 550. Annotations CASE NOTES Permanency planning.  Pursuant to the second sentence of the statute, the permanency planning orders continued to be reviewed and enforced by the juvenile and domestic relations distri ct court until the trial court or appellate court ruled on the appeal of the orders because nothing in the statute indicates that the filing of a notice of appeal to the trial court for a permanency planning order renders that order void.

Cases involving children, other than support or where protective order issued: Proceedings with respect to children under this law, except support proceedings as provided in subdivision 2 or family abuse proceedings as provided in subdivision 3, shall: a. Delinquency: If delinquency is alleged, be commenced in the city or county where the acts constituting the alleged delinquency occurred or they may, with the written consent of the child and the attorney for the Commonwealth for both jurisdictions, be co mmenced in the city or county where the child resides; b. Custody or visitation: In cases involving custody or visitation, be commenced in the court of the city or county which, in order of priority, (i) is the home of the child at the t ime of the filing of the petition, or had been the home of the child within six months before the filing of the petition and the child is absent from the city or county because of his removal or retention by a person claiming his custody or for other rea sons, and a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in the city or county; (ii) has significant connection with the child and in which there is substantial evidence concerning the childs present or future care, protection, training and personal relationships; (iii) is where the child is physically present and the child has been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because he has been subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or is otherwise negl ected or dependent; or (iv) it is in the best interest of the child for the court to assume jurisdiction as no other city or county is an appropriate venue under the preceding provisions of this subdivision; c. Adoption: In parental placement adoption consent hearings pursuant to §§ 16.1-241, 63.2-1233, and 63.2-1237, be commenced in any city or county, provided, however, that dili gent efforts shall first be made to commence such hearings (i) in the city or county where the child to be adopted was born, (ii) in the city or county where the birth parent(s) reside, or (iii) in the city or county where the prospective adoptive parent (s) reside. In cases in which a hearing is commenced in a city or county other than one described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii), the petitioner shall certify in writing to the court that diligent efforts to commence a hearing in such city or county have been made but have proven ineffective; d. Abuse and neglect: In cases involving an allegedly abused or neglected child, be commenced (i) in the city or county where the child resides, (ii) in the city or county where the child is present when the proceedings are commenced, or (iii) in the city or county where the alleged abuse or neglect occurred; and e. All other cases: In all other proceedings, be commenced in the city or county where the child resides or in the city or county where the child is present when the proceedings are commenced. 2. Support: Proceedings that involve child or spousal support or child and spousal support, exclusive of proceedings arising under Chapter 5 (§ 20-61 et seq.) of Title 20, shall be com menced in the city or county where either party resides or in the city or county where the respondent is present when the proceeding commences. 3. Family abuse: Proceedings in which an order of protection is sought as a result of family abuse shall be commenced where (i) either party has his or her principal residence (ii) the ab use occurred or (iii) a protective order was issued if at the time the proceeding is commenced the order is in effect to protect the petitioner or a family or household member of the petitioner. B. Transfer of venue: 1. Gener ally: Except in custody, visitation and support cases, if the child resides in a city or county of the Commonwealth and the proceeding is commenced in a court of another city or county, that court may at any time, on its own motion or a motion of a party for good cause shown, transfer the proceeding to the city or county of the childs residence for such further action or proceedings as the court receiving the transfer may deem proper. However, such transfer may occur in delinquency proceedings only after adjudication, which shall include, for the purposes of this section, a finding of facts sufficient to justify a finding of delinquency. 2. Custody and visitation: In custody and visitation cases, if venue lies in one of several cities or counties, the court in which the motion for transfer is made shall determine which su ch city or county is the most appropriate venue unless the parties mutually agree to the selection of venue. In the consideration of the motion, the best interests of the child shall determine the most appropriate forum. 3. Support: In support proceedings, exclusive of proceedings arising under Chapter 5 (§ 20-61 et seq.) of Title 20, if the respondent resides in a city or county in the Commonwealth an d the proceeding is commenced in a court of another city or county, that court may, at any time on its own motion or a motion of a party for good cause shown or by agreement of the parties, transfer the proceeding to the city or county of the respondent s residence for such further action or proceedings as the court receiving the transfer may deem proper. For the purposes of determining venue of cases involving support, the respondents residence shall include any city or county in which the resp ondent has resided within the last six months prior to the commencement of the proceeding or in which the respondent is residing at the time that the motion for transfer of venue is made. If venue is transferable to one of several cities or counties, the court in which the motion for transfer is made shall determine which such city or county is the most appropriate venue unless the parties mutually agree to the selection of such venue.When the support proceeding is a companion case to a child custody or visitation proceeding, the provisions governing venue in the proceeding involving the childs custody or visitation shall govern. 4. Subsequent transfers: Any court receiving a transferred proceeding as provided in this section may in its discretion transfer such proceeding to a court in an appropriate venue for goo d cause shown based either upon changes in circumstances or mistakes of fact or upon agreement of the parties. In any transfer of venue in cases involving children, the best interests of the child shall be considered in deciding if and to which court a t ransfer of venue would be appropriate. 5. Enforcement of orders for support, maintenance and custody: Any juvenile and domestic relations district court to which a suit is transferred for enforcement of orders pertaining to su pport, maintenance, care or custody pursuant to § 20-79 (c) may transfer the case as provided in this section. C. Records: Or iginals of all legal and social records pertaining to the case shall accompany the transfer of venue.

CASE NOTES Propriety of action where child was removed pursuant to emergency r emoval ordered by court lacking jurisdiction.  Trial court did not err when it denied a mothers motion to dismiss the Virginia Beach Department of Social Services action to terminate the mothers pa rental rights pursuant to § 16.1-283 based upon a petition filed in Norfolk because, even if a Virginia Beach juvenile and domestic relatio...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-244"><akn:num>§ 16.1-244</akn:num><akn:heading>Concurrent jurisdiction; exceptions</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. Nothing con tained in this law shall deprive any other court of the concurrent jurisdiction to determine the custody of children upon a writ of habeas corpus under the law, or to determine the custody, guardianship, visitation or support of children when such custod y, guardianship, visitation or support is incidental to the determination of causes pending in such courts, nor deprive a circuit court of jurisdiction to determine spousal support in a suit for separate maintenance. However, when a suit for divorce has been filed in a circuit court, in which the custody, guardianship, visitation or support of children of the parties or spousal support is raised by the pleadings and a hearing, including a pendente lite hearing, is set by the circuit court on any such is sue for a date certain or on a motions docket to be heard within 21 days of the filing, the juvenile and domestic relations district courts shall be divested of the right to enter any further decrees or orders to determine custody, guardianship, visitati on or support when raised for such hearing and such matters shall be determined by the circuit court unless both parties agreed to a referral to the juvenile court. In any case in which the jurisdiction of the juvenile and domestic relations district cou rt has been divested pursuant to this section and no final support order has been entered, any award for child support or spousal support in the circuit court shall be retroactive to the date on which the proceeding was commenced by the filing of the act ion in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, provided that the petitioner exercised due diligence in the service of the respondent. Nothing in this section shall deprive a circuit court of the authority to refer any such case to a commissio ner for a hearing or shall deprive the juvenile and domestic relations district courts of the jurisdiction to enforce its valid orders prior to the entry of a conflicting order of any circuit court for any period during which the order was in effect or t o temporarily place a child in the custody of any person when that child has been adjudicated abused, neglected, in need of services or delinquent subsequent to the order of any circuit court. B. Jurisdictio n of cases involving violations of federal law by a child shall be concurrent and shall be assumed only if waived by the federal court or the United States attorney. History History.

CASE NOTES Generally, under statutory scheme, juvenile courts have exclusive original jurisdiction in custody cases unless and until circuit courts assume jurisdiction. The circuit courts may assume jurisdiction either by an appeal from the juvenile courts or by the direct filing of an appropriate proceeding in the circuit courts. The procedural sta ndard to be applied in the circuit courts is dictated by the manner in which those courts assume jurisdiction. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1699, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (1988). Waiver of jurisdiction.  Nothing in either § 16.1-241 or this section permits the juvenile court to waive its jurisdiction and allow a party to bring an original action in the circuit court without meeting the statutory requirements. Willis v. Gamez, 20 Va. App. 75, 455 S.E.2d 274, 1995 Va. App. LEXIS 288 (1995). Mere filing of divorce suit by husband prior to participating in subsequent juvenile court proceeding did not sufficiently challenge juvenile court order to relieve him of meeting the extra burden of proof imposed by the change in circumstances test. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1699, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (1988). Courts of equity not divested of all power to determine custody of children.  It is evident, as indicated by the language of this section, that it was not the purpose of the legislature to divest courts of equity of all power to determine t he custody of children. Under this section a court of record has concurrent jurisdiction to determine the custody of children: (1) upon a writ of habeas corpus; and (2) in a suit in equity when custody is incidental to the determination of the cause. Poo le v. Poole, 210 Va. 442, 171 S.E.2d 685, 1970 Va. LEXIS 141 (1970). Jurisdiction of circuit court over custody petition.  Although a circuit court had acquired jurisdiction solely by virtue of an appealed visitation petition, custody was incidental to visitation under the circumstanc es and the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to transfer custody. Cintron v. Long, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 487 (Va. Ct. App. July 5, 2000). Authority of circuit court to reinstate case on docket.  Circuit court had authority to reinstate the case on its docket and to entertain the parties motions to enforce visitation rights and to modify child support after having transferred all matters . . . pertaining to child support, visitation rights [and] custody of the minor children to the juvenile and domestic relations district court pursuant to § 20-79(c). Although a final divorce decree had bee n entered, when the case was reinstated on the docket of the circuit court, the case was pending for consideration of those matters over which the circuit court had continuing jurisdiction. Crabtree v. Crabtree, 17 Va. App. 81, 435 S.E.2d 883, 10 Va. Law Rep. 331, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 449 (1993). A transfer of any other matters pertaining to support and maintenance . . . and custody to the juvenile and domestic relations district court pur suant to § 20-79(c) conveys concurrent jurisdiction on the juvenile and domestic relations district court to hear those matters, but the transfer does not divest the circuit court of its continuing jurisdiction to consider those issues, should it exer cise its discretion to do so. Accordingly, the circuit court had the authority to reinstate the case on its docket and to consider the motions to modify child support and visitation. Crabtree v. Crabtree, 17 Va. App. 81, 435 S.E.2d 883, 10 Va. Law Rep. 3 31, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 449 (1993). Distinction between appeal and divestiture of jurisdiction.  Under the statutory scheme this distinction between an appeal under § 16.1-136 and a divestiture of further jurisdiction in the juvenile court by operation of subsection A is intentional and consistent with and conducive to the best interests of children who are the subjects of custody disputes between their natural parents, the protection of parental rights, and, less significantly, with the notion of judicia l economy. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1699, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (1988). In an appeal to the circuit court, the advantage granted to the noncustodial parent is simply the avoidance of the additional burden of proof imposed by t he change in circumstance test; in the de novo appeal, the issue is simply what is in the best interests of the child. Accordingly, the procedural distinction between an appeal under § 16.1-136 and a divestiture of further jurisdiction in the juvenile court by operation of this section is significant and perhaps controlling in most cases. Peple v. Peple, 5 Va. App. 414, 364 S.E.2d 232, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1699, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 7 (1988). The procedural distinction between an appeal under § 16.1-136 and a divestiture of further jurisdiction in the juvenile court by operation of this section rela ting to divorce proceedings is significant. An order adjudicating an appeal from the juvenile court to the circuit court is not entitled to the procedural convenience of transfer provided by § 20-79. Rather, such order, together with related issues em braced by the appeal, rests within the exclusive jurisdiction of the circuit court pending disposition by that court. Calfee v. Calfee, 29 Va. App. 88, 509 S.E.2d 552, 1999...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-245"><akn:num>§ 16.1-245</akn:num><akn:heading>Transfer from other courts</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text If, during the pendency of a proceeding in any other court, it is ascertained for the first time that exclusive jurisdiction lies within the juvenile and domestic relat ions district court, such court shall forthwith transfer the case, together with all papers, documents and evidence connected therewith, to the juvenile and domestic relations district court of the city or county having jurisdiction. The court making the transfer shall determine who is to have custody of the child pending action by the juvenile and domestic relations district court pursuant to § 16.1-247. If, during the pendency of a proceeding in the juvenile and domestic relations district court, it is ascertained for the first time that exclusive jurisdiction lies in the general district or circuit court, the juvenile and domestic relations district court shall likewise transfer the case to the appropriate court.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Transferee court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.  Circuit Court for the City of Norfolk did not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider the parties motions to amend a husbands child and spousal suppo rt obligations upon a transfer from the Norfolk Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court since: (1) the circuit court did not have concurrent jurisdiction to amend the support orders; (2) § 16.1-245 allowed the district court to transfer a case to the circuit court if the circuit court had exclusive jurisdiction, but the circuit court did not have exclusive jurisdiction; (3) the circuit court only had appellate jurisdiction over a Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court order under subse ctions A and J of § 16.1-296; (4) there was no authority to transfer a case from a lower court to a circuit court pendente lite; and (5) the Virginia Constitution and the statutes enacted pursuant to it were the sources of the circuit courts subje ct matter jurisdiction. Cunningham v. Cunningham, 86 Va. Cir. 202, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 10 (Norfolk Jan. 24, 2013). § 16.1-245.1. Medical evidence admissible in juvenile and domestic relations district court. Text In any civil case heard in a juvenile and domestic relations district court involving allegations of child abuse or neglect or family abuse, any party may present evide nce, by a report from the treating or examining health care provider as defined in § 8.01-581.1 or the records of a hospital, medical facility or laboratory at which the treatment, examination or laboratory analysis was performed, or both, as to the e xtent, nature, and treatment of any physical condition or injury suffered by a person and the examination of the person or the result of the laboratory analysis. A medical report shall be admitted if the party intending to present such evidence at trial or hearing gives the opposing party or parties a copy of the evidence and wr itten notice of intention to present it at least 10 days, or in the case of a preliminary removal hearing under § 16.1-252 or in preliminary protective order hearings under § 16.1-253 or 16.1-253.1 at least 24 hours, prior to the trial or hearing a nd if attached to such evidence is a sworn statement of the treating or examining health care provider or laboratory analyst who made the report that (i) the information contained therein is true, accurate, and fully describes the nature and extent of th e physical condition or injury and (ii) the patient named therein was the person treated or examined by such health care provider; or, in the case of a laboratory analysis, that the information contained therein is true and accurate. A hospital or other medical facility record shall be admitted if attached to it is a sworn statement of the custodian thereof that the same is a true and accurate copy of the record of such hospital or other medical facility. If thereafter a party summons the health care provider or custodian making such statement to testify in proper person or by deposition taken de bene esse, the court shall determine which party sha ll pay the fees and costs for such appearance or depositions, or may apportion the same among the parties in such proportion as the ends of justice may require. If such health care provider or custodian is not subject to subpoena for cross-examination in court or by a deposition de bene esse, then the court shall allow a reasonable opportunity for the party seeking the subpoena for such health care provider or custodian to obtain his testimony as the ends of justice may require.

CASE NOTES Intr oduction into evidence of psychological evaluation.  In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the court properly allowed the introduction into evidence of the mothers psychological evaluation as the report was previously made a part of the file in the juvenile court and the juvenile court documents were admitted in evidence. Padilla v. Norfolk Division of Social Services, 1999 Va. App. LEXIS 48 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 26, 1999). Admission of medical recor ds harmless error.  Assuming the circuit court erred in admitting a childs medical records, the error was harmless because the county department of family services presented suff icient evidence to terminate the mothers parental rights without the admission of the medical records; the trial court found that the mother had limitations that affected her ability to adequately care for the child and his siblings and she was unwil ling to accept assistance.

Annotations Cross references. For present provisions as to criteria for detention or shelter care, see § 16.1-248.1. § 16.1-248.1. Criteria for detention or shelter care. Text A. A juvenile taken into custody whose case is considered by a judge, intake officer or magistrate pursuant to § 16.1-247 shall immediately be released, upon the ascertainment of the necessary facts, to the care, custody and control of such juveniles parent, gu ardian, custodian or other suitable person able and willing to provide supervision and care for such juvenile, either on bail or recognizance pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 19.2-119 et seq.) of Title 19.2 or under such conditions as may be imposed or otherw ise. However, at any time prior to an order of final disposition, a juvenile may be detained in a secure facility, pursuant to a detention order or warrant, only upon a finding by the judge, intake officer, or magistrate, that there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed the act alleged, and that at least one of the following conditions is met: 1. The j uvenile is alleged to have (a) violated the terms of his probation or parole when the charge for which he was placed on probation or parole would have been a felony or Class 1 misdemeanor if committed by an adult; (b) committed an act that would be a fel ony or Class 1 misdemeanor if committed by an adult; or (c) violated any of the provisions of § 18.2-308.7, and there is clear and convincing evidence that: a. Considering the seriousness of the current offense or offenses and other pending charges, the seriousness of prior adjudicated offenses, the legal status of the juvenile and any aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the liberty of the juvenile, const itutes a clear and substantial threat to the person or property of others; b. The liberty of the juvenile would present a clear and substantial threat of serious harm to such juveniles life or health; or c. The juvenile has threatened to abscond from the courts jurisdiction during the pendency of the instant proceedings or has a record of willful failure to appear at a court hear ing within the immediately preceding 12 months. 2. The juvenile has absconded from a detention home or facility where he has been directed to remain by the lawful order of a judge or intake officer. 3. The juvenile is a fugitive from a jurisdiction outside the Commonwealth and subject to a verified petition or warrant, in which case such juvenile may be detained for a period not to e xceed that provided for in § 16.1-323 while arrangements are made to return the juvenile to the lawful custody of a parent, guardian or other authority in another state. 4. The juvenile has failed to appear in court after having been duly served with a summons in any case in which it is alleged that the juvenile has committed a delinquent act or that the child is in need of services or is in need of supervision; however, a child alleged to be in need of services or in need of supervision may be detained for good cause pursuant to this subsection only until the next day upon which the court sits within th e county or city in which the charge against the child is pending, and under no circumstances longer than 72 hours from the time he was taken into custody. If the 72-hour period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or day on which the court is la wfully closed, the 72 hours shall be extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday or day on which the court is lawfully closed. 5. The juvenile failed to adhere to the conditions imposed upon him by the court, intake officer or magistrate following his release upon a Class 1 misdemeanor charge or a felony charge.H owever, no juvenile younger than 11 years of age shall be placed in secure detention unless such juvenile is alleged to have committed one or more of the delinquent acts enumerated in subsection B or C of § 16.1-269.1.When a juvenile is placed in secu re detention, the detention order shall state the offense for which the juvenile is being detained, and, to the extent practicable, other pending and previous charges. B. Any juvenil e not meeting the criteria for placement in a secure facility shall be released to a parent, guardian or other person willing and able to provide supervision and care under such conditions as the judge, intake officer or magistrate may impose. However, a juvenile may be placed in shelter care if: 1. The j uvenile is eligible for placement in a secure facility; 2. The juvenile has failed to adhere to the directions of the court, intake officer or magistrate while on conditional release; 3. The juveniles parent, guardian or other person able to provide supervision cannot be reached within a reasonable time; 4. The juvenile does not consent to return home; 5. Neither the juveniles parent or guardian nor any other person able to provide proper supervision can arrive to assume custody within a reasonable time; or 6. The juveniles parent or guardian refuses to permit the juvenile to return home and no relative or other person willing and able to provide proper supervision and care can be locate d within a reasonable time. C. When a juve nile is detained in a secure facility, the juveniles probation officer may review such placement for the purpose of seeking a less restrictive alternative to confinement in that secure facility. D. The criteri a for continuing the juvenile in detention or shelter care as set forth in this section shall govern the decisions of all persons involved in determining whether the continued detention or shelter care is warranted pending court disposition. Such criteri a shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence in support of the decision not to release the juvenile. E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive the court of its power to punish a juvenile summarily for contempt for acts set forth in § 18.2-456, other than acts of disobedience of the courts dispositional order which are committed outside the prese nce of the court. F. A detention order may be issued pursuant to subdivision A 2 by the committing court or by the court in the jurisdiction from which the juvenile fled or where he was taken into custody. G. The court i s authorized to detain a juvenile based upon the criteria set forth in subsection A at any time after a delinquency petition has been filed, both prior to adjudication and after adjudication pending final disposition subject to the time limitations set f orth in § 16.1-277.1. H. If the inta ke officer or magistrate releases the juvenile, either on bail or recognizance or under such conditions as may be imposed, no motion to revoke bail, or change such conditions may be made unless (i) the juvenile has violated a term or condition of his rel ease, or is convicted of or taken into custody for an additional offense, or (ii) the attorney for the Commonwealth presents evidence that incorrect or incomplete information regarding the factors in subsection A was relied upon by the intake officer or magistrate establishing the initial terms of release. If the juvenile court releases the juvenile, either on bail or recognizance or under such conditions as may be imposed, over the objection of the attorney for the Commonwealth, the attorney for the Co mmonwealth may appeal such decision to the circuit court. The order of the juvenile court releasing the juvenile shall remain in effect until the circuit court, Court of Appeals or Supreme Court rules otherwise.

E. If, in the judgment of the custodian, a juvenile has demonstrated that he is a threat to the security or safety of the other juveniles detained or the staff of the home or facility, the judge shall determine whether such juvenile should be transferred to another ju venile facility or, if the child is 14 years of age or older, a jail or other facility for the detention of adults, provided that (i) the detention is in a room or ward entirely separate and removed from adults, (ii) adequate supervision is provided, and (iii) the facility is approved by the State Board of Local and Regional Jails for detention of juveniles. F. If, in the judgment of the custodian, it has been demonstrated that the presence of a juvenile in a facility creates a threat to the security or safety of the other juveniles detained or the staff of the home or facility, the custodian may transfer the juvenile to another juvenile facility, or, if the child is 14 years of age or older, a jail or other facility for the detention of adults pursuant to the limitations of clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of subsection E for a period not to exceed six hours prior to a court hearing and an additional six hours after the court hearing unless a longer period is ordered pursuant to subsection E.

A child may be taken into immediate custody and placed in shelter care pursuant to an emergency removal order in cases in which the child is alleged to have been abused or neglected. Such order may be issued ex parte by the court upon a petition supported by an aff idavit or by sworn testimony in person before the judge or intake officer which establishes that: 1. The c hild would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would be likely to result if the child were returned to or left in the custody of his parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person stan ding in loco parentis pending a final hearing on the petition. 2. Reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of the child from his home and there are no alternatives less drastic than removal of the child from his home which could reasonabl y protect the childs life or health pending a final hearing on the petition. The alternatives less drastic than removal may include but not be limited to the provision of medical, educational, psychiatric, psychological, homemaking or other similar s ervices to the child or family or the issuance of a preliminary protective order pursuant to § 16.1-253.If the petitioner fails to obtain an emergency removal order within four hours of taking custody of the child, the affidavit or sworn testimony bef ore the judge or intake officer shall state the reasons therefor.When a child is removed from his home and there is no reasonable opportunity to provide preventive services, reasonable efforts to prevent removal shall be deemed to have been made.The peti tioner shall not be required by the court to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the child from his home if the court finds that (i) the residual parental rights of the parent regarding a sibling of the child have previously been involuntarily terminated; (ii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a substantially similar law of any other state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes murder or voluntary manslaughter, or a felo ny attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any such offense, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent, a child with whom the parent resided at the time such offense occurred, or the other parent of the child; (iii) the parent has bee n convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a substantially similar law of any other state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding re sulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent or a child with whom the parent resided at the time of such offense; or (iv) on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, the parent has s ubjected any child to aggravated circumstances or abandoned a child under circumstances that would justify the termination of residual parental rights pursuant to subsection D of § 16.1-283.As used in this section: Aggravated circumstances means torture, chronic or severe abuse, or chronic or severe sexual abuse, if the victim of such cond uct was a child of the parent or child with whom the parent resided at the time such conduct occurred, including the failure to protect such a child from such conduct, which conduct or failure to protect (i) evinces a wanton or depraved indifference to h uman life or (ii) has resulted in the death of such a child or in serious bodily injury to such a child.Chronic abuse or chronic sexual abuse means recurring acts of physical abuse that place th e childs health, safety and well-being at risk.Serious bodily injury means bodily injury that involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty. Severe abuse or severe sexual abuse may include an act or omission that occurred only once but otherwise meets the definition of aggravated circumstances. B. Whenever a child is taken into immediate custody pursuant to an emergency removal order, a hearing shall be held in accordance with § 16.1-252 as soon as practicable, but in no event later than five business days after the removal of the child. C. In the emer gency removal order the court shall give consideration to temporary placement of the child with a person with a legitimate interest under the supervision of the local department of social services, until such time as the hearing in accordance with § 1 6.1-252 is held. D. The local d epartment of social services having legal custody of a child as defined in § 16.1-228 (i) shall not be required to comply with the requirements of this section in order to redetermine where and with whom the child shall live, notwithstanding t hat the child had been placed with a natural parent.

CASE NOTES Code contemplates intervention where severe injury likely if child returned to parent.  The Code contemplates intervention in circumstances, which are without realistic probability of improvement of conditions, by allowing for the emergency removal o f children before placement into an environment where the child would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irreversible injury would be likely to result if the child were returned to or left in the custody of his parent.

Relation to custody statutes.  Court of appeals erred when the court upheld a circuit courts decision awarding custody of a child who had been adjudicated as abused and neglected and remove d the child from the childs parents, pursuant to §§ 16.1-251 and 16.1-252, giving custody to the childs grandparents, based on the courts conclusion that language in subsection A of § 16.1-241 and subsection B of § 16.1-278.15 sub ordinated Virginia statutes on foster care to Virginias general custody statutes. The only interpretation of Titles 16.1 and 20 that gave effect to both statutory schemes and the intent of the Virginia General Assembly was that a trial court had to m ake the specific factual findings required by the foster care statutes in a custody case involving a child who was subject to a foster care plan.

Parents given specific written notice of subsequent hearing.  Under this section, §§ 16.1-252 and 16.1-253 the parents shall be given specific notice in writing of a subsequent hearing on the merits by a petition stati ng the factual circumstances which allegedly necessitated removal of the children. Rader v. Montgomery County Dep't of Social Servs., 5 Va. App. 523, 365 S.E.2d 234, 4 Va. Law Rep. 1839, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 32 (1988). Statute is procedural and directory.  Because subsection B of § 16.1-251 does not expressly prohibit the juvenile and domestic relations district court from conducting a preliminary removal hearing beyond the five-business-day period, is not prohibitive or limiting, and does not contain any manifestation of a contrary intent, subsection B of § 16.1-251 is procedural and directory, rather than mandatory and jurisdictional; although subsection B does provide that the hearing shall be held in no event later than five business days after the removal of the child, this phrase does not suggest an intent that the statute be deemed mandatory and jurisdictional because subsection B of § 16.1 -251 contains no explicit penalty for failure to comply with the five-day requirement nor explicitly renders a hearing held beyond the five-day period invalid.

A prelimina ry removal order in cases in which a child is alleged to have been abused or neglected may be issued by the court after a hearing wherein the court finds that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of the child from his home. The hearing sh all be in the nature of a preliminary hearing rather than a final determination of custody. B. Prior to th e removal hearing, notice of the hearing shall be given at least 24 hours in advance of the hearing to the guardian ad litem for the child, to the parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis of the child and to the child if he or she is 12 years of age or older. If notice to the parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis cannot be given despite diligent efforts to do so, the hearing shall be held nonetheless, and the parents, guardian, l egal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis shall be afforded a later hearing on their motion regarding a continuation of the summary removal order. The notice provided herein shall include (i) the time, date and place for the hearing; (ii) a specific statement of the factual circumstances which allegedly necessitate removal of the child; and (iii) notice that child support will be considered if a determination is made that the child must be removed from the home. C. All parties to the hearing shall be informed of their right to counsel pursuant to § 16.1-266. D. At the remo val hearing the child and his parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis shall have the right to confront and cross-examine all adverse witnesses and evidence and to present evidence on their own behalf. If the child was 14 years of age or under on the date of the alleged offense and is 16 or under at the time of the hearing, the childs attorney or guardian ad litem, or if the child has been committed to the custody of the Department of Social Services, the local dep artment of social services, may apply for an order from the court that the childs testimony be taken in a room outside the courtroom and be televised by two-way closed-circuit television. The provisions of § 63.2-1521 shall apply, mutatis mutandis , to the use of two-way closed-circuit television except that the person seeking the order shall apply for the order at least 48 hours before the hearing, unless the court for good cause shown allows the application to be made at a later time. E. In order fo r a preliminary order to issue or for an existing order to be continued, the petitioning party or agency must prove: 1. The c hild would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would be likely to result if the child were returned to or left in the custody of his parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person stan ding in loco parentis pending a final hearing on the petition; and 2. Reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of the child from his home and there are no alternatives less drastic than removal of the child from his home which could reasonabl y and adequately protect the childs life or health pending a final hearing on the petition. The alternatives less drastic than removal may include but not be limited to the provision of medical, educational, psychiatric, psychological, homemaking or other similar services to the child or family or the issuance of a preliminary protective order pursuant to § 16.1-253.When a child is removed from his home and there is no reasonable opportunity to provide preventive services, reasonable efforts to p revent removal shall be deemed to have been made.The petitioner shall not be required by the court to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the child from his home if the court finds that (i) the residual parental rights of the parent regarding a sibling of the child have previously been involuntarily terminated; (ii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a substantially similar law of any other state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction tha t constitutes murder or voluntary manslaughter, or a felony attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any such offense, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent, a child with whom the parent resided at the time such offense occurred, o r the other parent of the child; (iii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a substantially similar law of any other state, the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes felony assault result ing in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent or a child with whom the parent resided at the time of such offense; or (iv) on the basis of clear and convincing evidence, the parent has subjected any child to aggravated circumstances, or abandoned a child under circumstances that would justify the termination of residual parental rights pursuant to subsection D of § 16.1-283.As used in this section:Aggravated circumstances means torture, chronic or severe abuse, or chronic or severe sexual abuse, if the victim of such conduct was a child of the parent or child with whom the parent resided at the time such conduct occurred, including the failure to protect such a child from such conduct, which conduct or failure to protect (i) evinces a wanton or depraved indifference to human life or (ii) has resulted in the death of such a child or in serious bodily injury to such a child.Chronic abuse or chronic sexual abuse means recurring acts of physical abuse that place the childs health, safety and well-being at risk.Serious bodily injury means bodily injury that involves substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty. Severe abuse or severe sex ual abuse may include an act or omission that occurred only once but otherwise meets the definition of aggravated circumstances. F. If the cour t determines that pursuant to subsection E hereof the removal of the child is proper, the court shall: 1. Order that the child be placed in the temporary care and custody of a suitable person, subject to the provisions of subsection F1 and under the supervision of the local department of social services, with consideration being given to placement in the temporar y care and custody of a person with a legitimate interest until such time as the court enters an order of disposition pursuant to § 16.1-278.2, or, if such placement is not available, in the care and custody of a suitable agency; 2. Order that reasonable visitation be allowed between the child and his parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis, and between the child and his siblin gs, if such visitation would not endanger the childs life or health; and 3. Order that the parent or other legally obligated person pay child support pursuant to § 16.1-290.In addition, the court may enter a preliminary protective order pursuant to § 16. 1-253 imposing requirements and conditions as specified in that section which the court deems appropriate for protection of the welfare of the child. F1. Prior to t he entry of an order pursuant to subsection F transferring temporary custody of the child to a person with a legitimate interest, the court shall consider whether such person is one who (i) is willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; and (iii) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect. The courts order transferring temporary custody to a person with a legitimate interest shoul d provide for compliance with any preliminary protective order entered on behalf of the child in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-253; initiation and completion of the investigation as directed by the court and court review of the childs p lacement required in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-278.2; and, as appropriate, ongoing provision of social services to the child and the temporary custodian. G. At the conc lusion of the preliminary removal order hearing, the court shall determine whether the allegations of abuse or neglect have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Any finding of abuse or neglect shall be stated in the court order. However, if, b efore such a finding is made, a person responsible for the care and custody of the child, the childs guardian ad litem or the local department of social services objects to a finding being made at the hearing, the court shall schedule an adjudicatory hearing to be held within 30 days of the date of the initial preliminary removal hearing. The adjudicatory hearing shall be held to determine whether the allegations of abuse and neglect have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Parties who a re present at the preliminary removal order hearing shall be given notice of the date set for the adjudicatory hearing and parties who are not present shall be summoned as provided in § 16.1-263. The hearing shall be held and an order may be entered, although a party to the preliminary removal order hearing fails to appear and is not represented by counsel, provided personal or substituted service was made on the person, or the court determines that such person cannot be found, after reasonable effor t, or in the case of a person who is without the Commonwealth, the person cannot be found or his post office address cannot be ascertained after reasonable effort.The preliminary removal order and any preliminary protective order issued shall remain in f ull force and effect pending the adjudicatory hearing.

Upon the mo tion of any person or upon the courts own motion, the court may issue a preliminary protective order, after a hearing, if necessary to protect a childs life, health, safety or normal development pending the final determination of any matter befor e the court. The order may require a childs parents, guardian, legal custodian, other person standing in loco parentis or other family or household member of the child to observe reasonable conditions of behavior for a specified length of time. These conditions shall include any one or more of the following: 1. To ab stain from offensive conduct against the child, a family or household member of the child or any person to whom custody of the child is awarded; 2. To cooperate in the provision of reasonable services or programs designed to protect the childs life, health or normal development; 3. To allow persons named by the court to come into the childs home at reasonable times designated by the court to visit the child or inspect the fitness of the home and to determine the physical or emotional health of the child; 4. To allow visitation with the child by persons entitled thereto, as determined by the court; 5. To refrain from acts of commission or omission which tend to endanger the childs life, health or normal development; 6. To refrain from such contact with the child or family or household members of the child, as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such person from the residence of the c hild. However, prior to the issuance by the court of an order removing such person from the residence of the child, the petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that such persons probable future conduct would constitute a danger to th e life or health of such child, and that there are no less drastic alternatives which could reasonably and adequately protect the childs life or health pending a final determination on the petition; or 7. To grant the person on whose behalf the order is issued the possession of any companion animal as defined in § 3.2-6500 if such person meets the definition of owner in § 3.2-6500 . B. A prelimina ry protective order may be issued ex parte upon motion of any person or the courts own motion in any matter before the court, or upon petition. The motion or petition shall be supported by an affidavit or by sworn testimony in person before the judge or intake officer which establishes that the child would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that delay for the provision of an adversary hearing would be likely to result in serious or irremediable injury to the child s life or health. If an ex parte order is issued without an affidavit being presented, the court, in its order, shall state the basis upon which the order was entered, including a summary of the allegations made and the courts findings. Following the issuance of an ex parte order the court shall provide an adversary hearing to the affected parties within the shortest practicable time not to exceed five business days after the issuance of the order. C. Prior to th e hearing required by this section, notice of the hearing shall be given at least 24 hours in advance of the hearing to the guardian ad litem for the child, to the parents, guardian, legal custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis of the child , to any other family or household member of the child to whom the protective order may be directed and to the child if he or she is 12 years of age or older. The notice provided herein shall include (i) the time, date and place for the hearing and (ii) a specific statement of the factual circumstances which allegedly necessitate the issuance of a preliminary protective order. D. All parties to the hearing shall be informed of their right to counsel pursuant to § 16.1-266. E. At the hear ing the child, his or her parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis and any other family or household member of the child to whom notice was given shall have the right to confront and cross-examine all adverse witnesses and evidence and to present evidence on their own behalf. F. If a petiti on alleging abuse or neglect of a child has been filed, at the hearing pursuant to this section the court shall determine whether the allegations of abuse or neglect have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Any finding of abuse or neglect sha ll be stated in the court order. However, if, before such a finding is made, a person responsible for the care and custody of the child, the childs guardian ad litem or the local department of social services objects to a finding being made at the he aring, the court shall schedule an adjudicatory hearing to be held within 30 days of the date of the initial preliminary protective order hearing. The adjudicatory hearing shall be held to determine whether the allegations of abuse and neglect have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence. Parties who are present at the hearing shall be given notice of the date set for the adjudicatory hearing and parties who are not present shall be summoned as provided in § 16.1-263. The adjudicatory hearing shall be held and an order may be entered, although a party to the hearing fails to appear and is not represented by counsel, provided personal or substituted service was made on the person, or the court determines that such person cannot be found, after reasonable effort, or in the case of a person who is without the Commonwealth, the person cannot be found or his post office address cannot be ascertained after reasonable effort.Any preliminary protective order issued shall remain in full force and eff ect pending the adjudicatory hearing. G. If at the p reliminary protective order hearing held pursuant to this section the court makes a finding of abuse or neglect and a preliminary protective order is issued, a dispositional hearing shall be held pursuant to § 16.1-278.2. The court shall forthwith, bu t in all cases no later than the end of the business day on which the order was issued, enter and transfer electronically to the Virginia Criminal Information Network the respondents identifying information and the name, date of birth, sex, and race of each protected person provided to the court. A copy of the preliminary protective order containing any such identifying information shall be forwarded forthwith to the primary law-enforcement agency responsible for service and entry of protective orde rs. Upon receipt of the order by the primary law-enforcement agency, the agency shall forthwith verify and enter any modification as necessary to the identifying information and other appropriate information required by the Department of State Police int o the Virginia Criminal Information Network established and maintained by the Department of State Police pursuant to Chapter 2 (§ 52-12 et seq.) of Title 52 and the order shall be served forthwith on the allegedly abusing person in person as provided in § 16.1-264 and due return made to the court. However, if the order is issued by the circuit court, the clerk of the circuit court shall forthwith forward an attested copy of the order containing the respondents identifying information and the n ame, date of birth, sex, and race of each protected person provided to the court to the primary law-enforcement agency providing service and entry of protective orders and upon receipt of the order, the primary law-enforcement agency shall enter the name of the person subject to the order and other appropriate information required by the Department of State Police into the Virginia Criminal Information Network established and maintained by the Department pursuant to Chapter 2 (§ 52-12 et seq.) of Tit le 52 and the order shall be served forthwith upon the allegedly abusing person in person as provided in § 16.1-264. Upon service, the agency making service shall enter the date and time of service and other appropriate information required by the Dep artment of State Police into the Virginia Criminal Information Network and make due return to the court. The preliminary order shall specify a date for the dispositional hearing. The dispositional hearing shall be scheduled at the time of the hearing pur suant to this section, and shall be held within 60 days of this hearing. If an adjudicatory hearing is requested pursuant to subsection F, the dispositional hearing shall nonetheless be scheduled at the hearing pursuant to this section. All parties prese nt at the hearing shall be given notice of the date and time scheduled for the dispositional hearing; parties who are not present shall be summoned to appear as provided in § 16.1-263. H. Nothing in this section enables the court to remove a child from the custody of his or her parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis, except as provided in § 16.1-278.2, and no order hereunder shall be entered against a person over whom the court does not have jurisdiction. I. Neither a l aw-enforcement agency, the attorney for the Commonwealth, a court nor the clerks office, nor any employee of them, may disclose, except among themselves, the residential address, telephone number, or place of employment of the person protected by the order or that of the family of such person, except to the extent that disclosure is (i) required by law or the Rules of the Supreme Court, (ii) necessary for law-enforcement purposes, or (iii) permitted by the court for good cause. J. Violation o f any order issued pursuant to this section shall be punishable as contempt of court. However, if the violation involves an act or acts of commission or omission that endanger the childs life or health or result in bodily injury to the child, it shal l be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor.

No individual shall b e required to obtain support services from the Department of Social Services prior to filing a petition seeking support for a child. Complaints, requests, and the processing of petitions to initiate a case shall be the responsibility of the intake office r. However, (i) the attorney for the Commonwealth of the city or county may file a petition on his own motion with the clerk; (ii) designated nonattorney employees of the Department of Social Services may complete, sign, and file petitions and motions re lating to the establishment, modification, or enforcement of support on forms approved by the Supreme Court of Virginia with the clerk; (iii) designated nonattorney employees of a local department of social services may complete, sign, and file with the clerk, on forms approved by the Supreme Court of Virginia, petitions for foster care review, petitions for permanency planning hearings, petitions to establish paternity, motions to establish or modify support, motions to amend or review an order, and mo tions for a rule to show cause; and (iv) any attorney may file petitions on behalf of his client with the clerk except petitions alleging that the subject of the petition is a child alleged to be in need of services, in need of supervision, or delinquent . Complaints alleging abuse or neglect of a child shall be referred initially to the local department of social services in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 15 (§ 63.2-1500 et seq.) of Title 63.2. Motions and other subsequent pleadings in a c ase shall be filed directly with the clerk. The intake officer or clerk with whom the petition or motion is filed shall inquire whether the petitioner is receiving child support services or public assistance. No individual who is receiving support servic es or public assistance shall be denied the right to file a petition or motion to establish, modify, or enforce an order for support of a child. If the petitioner is seeking or receiving child support services or public assistance, the clerk, upon issuan ce of process, shall forward a copy of the petition or motion, together with notice of the court date, to the Division of Child Support Enforcement. If a petitioner is seeking to establish child support, the intake officer shall provide the petitioner in formation on the possible availability of medical assistance through the Family Access to Medical Insurance Security (FAMIS) plan or other government-sponsored coverage through the Department of Medical Assistance Services. B. The appeara nce of a child before an intake officer may be by (i) personal appearance before the intake officer or (ii) use of two-way electronic video and audio communication. If two-way electronic video and audio communication is used, an intake officer may exerci se all powers conferred by law. All communications and proceedings shall be conducted in the same manner as if the appearance were in person, and any documents filed may be transmitted by facsimile process. The facsimile may be served or executed by the officer or person to whom sent, and returned in the same manner, and with the same force, effect, authority, and liability as an original document. All signatures thereon shall be treated as original signatures. Any two-way electronic video and audio com munication system used for an appearance shall meet the standards as set forth in subsection B of § 19.2-3.1.When the court service unit of any court receives a complaint alleging facts which may be sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the court p ursuant to § 16.1-241, the unit, through an intake officer, may proceed informally to make such adjustment as is practicable without the filing of a petition or may authorize a petition to be filed by any complainant having sufficient knowledge of the matter to establish probable cause for the issuance of the petition.An intake officer may proceed informally on a complaint alleging a child is in need of services, in need of supervision, or delinquent only if the juvenile (a) is not alleged to have co mmitted a violent juvenile felony or (b) has not previously been proceeded against informally or adjudicated delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult. A petition alleging that a juvenile committed a violent juvenile felon y shall be filed with the court. A petition alleging that a juvenile is delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult shall be filed with the court if the juvenile had previously been proceeded against informally by intake or had been adjudicated delinquent for an offense that would be a felony if committed by an adult.If a juvenile is alleged to be a truant pursuant to a complaint filed in accordance with § 22.1-258 and the attendance officer has provided documentation to the intake officer that the relevant school division has complied with the provisions of § 22.1-258, then the intake officer shall file a petition with the court. The intake officer may defer filing the petition and proceed informally by developing a truancy plan, provided that (1) the juvenile has not previously been proceeded against informally or adjudicated in need of supervision on more than two occasions for failure to comply with compulsory school attendance as provided in § 22.1-254 and ( 2) the immediately previous informal action or adjudication occurred at least three calendar years prior to the current complaint. The juvenile and his parent or parents, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis must agree, in writing, for the development of a truancy plan. The truancy plan may include requirements that the juvenile and his parent or parents, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis participate in such programs, cooperate in such treatment, or be subject to such co nditions and limitations as necessary to ensure the juveniles compliance with compulsory school attendance as provided in § 22.1-254. The intake officer may refer the juvenile to the appropriate public agency for the purpose of developing a truanc y plan using an interagency interdisciplinary team approach. The team may include qualified personnel who are reasonably available from the appropriate department of social services, community services board, local school division, court service unit, an d other appropriate and available public and private agencies and may be the family assessment and planning team established pursuant to § 2.2-5207. If at the end of the deferral period the juvenile has not successfully completed the truancy plan or t he truancy program, then the intake officer shall file the petition.Whenever informal action is taken as provided in this subsection on a complaint alleging that a child is in need of services, in need of supervision, or delinquent, the intake officer sh all (A) develop a plan for the juvenile, which may include restitution, the performance of community service, or on a complaint alleging that a child has committed a delinquent act other than an act that would be a felony or a Class 1 misdemeanor if comm itted by an adult and with the consent of the juveniles parent or legal guardian, referral to a youth justice diversion program established pursuant to § 16.1-309.11, based upon community resources and the circumstances which resulted in the compl aint, (B) create an official record of the action taken by the intake officer and file such record in the juveniles case file, and (C) advise the juvenile and the juveniles parent, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis and the compl ainant that any subsequent complaint alleging that the child is in need of supervision or delinquent based upon facts which may be sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to § 16.1-241, or in the case of a referral to a youth justi ce diversion program established pursuant to § 16.1-309.11, that any subsequent report from the youth justice diversion program alleging that the juvenile failed to comply with the youth justice diversion programs sentence within 180 days of the s entencing date, may result in the filing of a petition with the court. C. The intake officer shall accept and file a petition in which it is alleged that (i) the custody, visitation, or support of a child is the subject of controversy or requires determination, (ii) a person has deserted, abandoned, or failed to provide support for any p erson in violation of law, (iii) a child or such childs parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis is entitled to treatment, rehabilitation, or other services which are required by law, (iv) family abuse has occurred and a protective order is being sought pursuant to § 16.1-253.1, 16.1-253.4, or 16.1-279.1, or (v) an act of violence, force, or threat has occurred, a protective order is being sought pursuant to § 19.2-152.8, 19.2-152.9, or 19.2-152.10, and eith er the alleged victim or the respondent is a juvenile. If any such complainant does not file a petition, the intake officer may file it. In cases in which a child is alleged to be abused, neglected, in need of services, in need of supervision, or delinqu ent, if the intake officer believes that probable cause does not exist, or that the authorization of a petition will not be in the best interest of the family or juvenile or that the matter may be effectively dealt with by some agency other than the cour t, he may refuse to authorize the filing of a petition. The intake officer shall provide to a person seeking a protective order pursuant to § 16.1-253.1, 16.1-253.4, or 16.1-279.1 a written explanation of the conditions, procedures and time limits app licable to the issuance of protective ord...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-261"><akn:num>§ 16.1-261</akn:num><akn:heading>Statements made at intake or mental health screening and assessment</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Statements made by a child to the intake officer or probation officer during the intake process or during a mental health screening or assessment conducted pursuant to § 16.1-248.2 and prior to a hearing on the merits of the petition filed against the child, shall not be admissible at any stage of the proceedings.

CASE NOTES Failure to comply with statutory requirements.  Fathers motion to change the foster care plans goal to adoption and terminate his parental rights did not comply with the statutory scheme to terminate hi s parental rights and approve a goal of adoption because the father only recited facts and argument as to why the court had to terminate his parental rights and change the foster care plan goal to adoption. Cisneros v. Arlington County Dep't of Human Ser vs., 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 261 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 11, 2016). Proceeding seeking the issuance of a protective order.  Plea in bar was not proper in proceedings seeking the issuance of a protective order because (1) a protective order was solely a creature of statute, (2) a plea i n bar responded to a complaint, but a petition for a protective order was not a complaint, and (3) a protective order was not a cause of action. Baldwin v. Baldwin, 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 290 (Va. Ct. App. Dec. 10, 2019). Settlement agreements.  In proceedings seeking the issuance of a protective order, it was error to sustain a plea in bar arguing a settlement agreement barred evidence of alleged abuse o ccurring before the agreement because the agreement did not affect the rights of the parties children to a protective order, as the children were not parties to the agreement.

After a pet ition has been filed, the court shall direct the issuance of summonses, one directed to the juvenile, if the juvenile is twelve or more years of age, and another to at least one parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis , and such other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceedings.After a petition has been filed against an adult pursuant to subsection C or D of § 16.1-259, the court shall direct the issuance of a summons against the adult.The summons shall require them to appear personally before the court at the time fixed to answer or testify as to the allegations of the petition. Where the custodian is summoned and such person is not a parent of the juvenile in question, a p arent shall also be served with a summons. The court may direct that other proper or necessary parties to the proceedings be notified of the pendency of the case, the charge and the time and place for the hearing.Any such summons shall be deemed a mandat e of the court, and willful failure to obey its requirements shall subject any person guilty thereof to liability for punishment for contempt. Upon the failure of any person to appear as ordered in the summons, the court shall immediately issue an order for such person to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.The parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis shall not be summoned to appear or be punished for failure to appear in cases of adults who are brought b efore the court pursuant to subsection C or D of § 16.1-259 unless such person is summoned as a witness. B. The summons shall advise the parties of their right to counsel as provided in § 16.1-266. A copy of the petition shall accompany each summons for the initial proceedings. The summons shall include notice that in the event that the juvenile is committed to the De partment or to a secure local facility, at least one parent or other person legally obligated to care for and support the juvenile may be required to pay a reasonable sum for treatment of the juvenile pursuant to § 16.1-290. Notice of subsequent proce edings shall be provided to all parties in interest. In all cases where a party is represented by counsel and counsel has been provided with a copy of the petition and due notice as to time, date, and place of the hearing, such action shall be deemed due notice to such party, unless such counsel has notified the court that he no longer represents such party. C. The judge m ay endorse upon the summons an order directing a parent or parents, guardian, or other custodian having the custody or control of the juvenile to bring the juvenile to the hearing. D. A party, ot her than the juvenile, may waive service of summons by written stipulation or by voluntary appearance at the hearing. E. No such sum mons or notification shall be required if the judge shall certify on the record that (i) the identity of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable or (ii) in cases in which it is alleged that a juvenile has committed a delinquent act, crime, s tatus offense, or traffic infraction or is in need of services or supervision, the location, or in the case of a parent or guardian located outside of the Commonwealth the location or mailing address, of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainab le.

CASE NOTES Claim that § 16.1-263 was unconstitutionally vague was without sufficient substance to warrant the convening of a three-judge court. McGhee v. Moyer, 60 F.R.D. 578, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11947 (D. Va. 1973). Proceedings jurisdictional.  The proceedings in the juvenile court are jurisdictional rather than procedural. Evans v. Cox, 327 F. Supp. 1057, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13370 (E.D. Va. 1971). This section establishes procedures only for the juvenile court and has no application o nce the case has been certified to the court of record. Ferguson v. Slayton, 340 F. Supp. 276, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14928 (W.D. Va. 1972). And such procedures are mandatory.  The statutes relating to the procedure applicable to proceedings for cases tried in a juvenile court are mandatory and must be followed. Evans v. Cox, 327 F. Supp . 1057, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13370 (E.D. Va. 1971). Failure of the juvenile court to comply with the statutory provisions of procedure will render the certification to a court of record void. Evans v. Cox, 327 F. Supp. 1057, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13370 (E.D. Va. 1971); Ferguson v. Slayton, 340 F. Supp. 276, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14928 (W.D. Va. 1972). Identity of parent and guardian was required to be addressed on record.  Where the mothers testimony failed to suggest even a clue as to the fathers identity, his whereabouts, or that a reasonable inquiry or search would succes sfully identify and locate him, the identity of the father was not reasonably ascertainable. Unknown Father of Baby Girl Janet v. Division of Social Servs., 15 Va. App. 110, 422 S.E.2d 407, 9 Va. Law Rep. 331, 1992 Va. App. LEXIS 240 (1992). Juvenile courts failure to properly issue summons made transfer of jurisdiction ineffectual.  Where juvenile court had address of defendants mother but issued a summons to a different jurisdiction and later issued another summons at a time which made m others timely arrival at transfer hearing impossible, transfer of jurisdiction over defendant from juvenile to circuit court was ineffectual and subsequent convictions were void. Williams v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. App. 776, 497 S.E.2d 156, 1998 Va. App . LEXIS 162 (1998). Father held not entitled to notice where divested of parental rights.  Defendants biological father was not his parent within the meaning of subsection A of this section as it read at the time of transfer proceedings and was not entitled to notice under this section, because an earlier final adoption order divested the defendants biological parents of all legal rights with respect to him. Thomas v. Garraghty, 258 Va. 530, 522 S.E.2d 865, 1999 Va. LEXIS 126 (1999). Failur e to serve father required reversal of conviction.  Without either a certification on the record that the identity of a juveniles father was not reasonably ascertainable or proof of service of a summons on the father by publication, the provisions of this section requiring service of process on the parents of a juvenile have not been met and noncompliance with these requirements necessitated reversal of the juveniles conviction. Baker v. Commonwealth, 28 V a. App. 306, 504 S.E.2d 394, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 484 (1998), aff'd, 258 Va. 1, 516 S.E.2d 219, 1999 Va. LEXIS 83 (1999) (see note below). Service of summons to both parents not required.  Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over juvenile even though father was not notified of criminal proceedings, pursuant to subsection E of § 16.1-263, which allowed the trial court to rely upon an affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father was not reasonably ascertainable, and did not require that both parents be served with a summons.

If a party designated in subsection A of § 16.1-263 to be served with a summons can be found within the Commonwealth, the summons shall be served upon him in person or by substituted service as prescribed in subdivision 2 of § 8.01-296.If a party designated t o be served in § 16.1-263 is without the Commonwealth but can be found or his address is known, or can with reasonable diligence be ascertained, service of summons may be made either by delivering a copy thereof to him personally or by mailing a copy thereof to him by certified mail return receipt requested.If after reasonable effort a party other than the person who is the subject of the petition cannot be found or his post-office address cannot be ascertained, whether he is within or without the Co mmonwealth, the court may order service of the summons upon him by publication in accordance with the provisions of §§ 8.01-316 and 8.01-317. A1. Any person who is subject to an emergency protective order issued pursuant to § 16.1-253.4 or 19.2-152.8 shall have been personally served with the protective order if a law-enforcement officer, as defined in § 9.1-101, personally provides to such person a n otification of the issuance of the order, which shall be on a form approved by the Executive Secretary of the Supreme Court of Virginia, provided that all of the information and individual requirements of the order are included on the form. The officer m aking service shall enter or cause to be entered the date and time of service and other appropriate information required by the Department of State Police into the Virginia Criminal Information Network and make due return to the court. B. Service of summons may be made under the direction of the court by sheriffs, their deputies and police officers in counties and cities or by any other suitable person designated by the court. However, in any case in which custody or visitation of a minor child or c hildren is at issue and a summons is issued for the attendance and testimony of a teacher or other school personnel who is not a party to the proceeding, if such summons is served on school property, it shall be served only by a sheriff or his deputy. C. Proof of se rvice may be made by the affidavit of the person other than an officer designated in subsection B hereof who delivers a copy of the summons to the person summoned, but if served by a state, county or municipal officer his return shall be sufficient witho ut oath. D. The summons shall be considered a mandate of the court and willful failure to obey its requirements shall subject any person guilty thereof to liability for punishment as for contempt.

CASE NOTES Section 8.01-288 is not applicable to the service of a summons under this section, which provides for service in juvenile cases, since it excepts process commencing actions wherein service of process is specifically prescribed by statute. Garritty v. Virginia Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Sinift, 11 Va. App. 39, 396 S.E.2d 150, 1990 Va. Ap p. LEXIS 159 (1990). Since there is no provision in this section for substituted service by posting a summons on the front door of the persons abode, the summons in a child support case was not properly served on the defendant because a copy was not sent to him by certified mail as required by this section. Service would be invalid even if it w as shown that a copy of the summons was posted on the front door of his residence and a copy of the pleading was mailed to him less than 10 days prior to entry of the default judgment.

Waiver of ob jection based on failure to notify parent.  The legislature has provided in subsection E of § 16.1-269.1 that, as to offenses committed on or after July 1, 1996, once an indictment has been returned in t he circuit court, any failure to comply with the parental notification provisions of § 16.1-263 and this section does not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. Carter v. Commonwealth, 31 Va. App. 393, 523 S.E.2d 544, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 26 (2000). Evidence sufficient to suppo rt conviction.  Defendants conviction for violating the terms of a preliminary protective order was proper because the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant had ade quate notice of the terms of the preliminary protective order prohibiting contact, pursuant to §§ 16.1-253.1 and 16.1-264, and that defendant acted intentionally in violation of those terms. Cardenas-Najarro v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 64 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 4, 2014). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Waiver of parental notice.  A juveniles motion to vacate his convictions was denied. Because both the juveniles parents appeared at an initial appearance and a certification hearing, an alleged failure by the State to properly notify both parents as required by §§ 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 was waived pursuant to subsection D of § 16.1-263. Commonwealth v. Haskins, 56 Va. Cir. 373, 2001 Va. Cir. LEXIS 474 (Norfolk Aug. 24, 2001 ). Posted witness subpoena not a substitute for service of process.  Because a posted witness subpoena was not a substitute for service of process in a juvenile court procedure pursuant to subsection A of § 16.1-264, and a summo ns was returned not found, a father did not have adequate actual notice of a child support hearing.

Subpoenas duces tecum for medical records shall be subject to the provisions of §§ 8.01-413 and 32.1-127.1:03 except that no separate fee shall be imposed. A subp oena may also be issued in a civil proceeding by an attorney-at-law who is an active member of the Virginia State Bar at the time of issuance, as an officer of the court. Any such subpoena shall be on a form approved by the Committee on District Courts, signed by the attorney as if a pleading and shall include the attorneys address. A copy, together with the attorneys certificate of service pursuant to Rule 1:12, shall be mailed or delivered to the clerks office of the court in which the cas e is pending on the day of issuance by the attorney. The law governing subpoenas issued by a clerk shall apply mutatis mutandis, except that attorneys may not issue subpoenas in those cases in which they may not issue a summons as provided in § 8.01-4 07.

Prior to th e hearing by the court of any case involving a child who is alleged to be abused or neglected or who is the subject of an entrustment agreement or a petition seeking termination of residual parental rights or who is otherwise before the court pursuant to subdivision A 4 of § 16.1-241 or § 63.2-1230, the court shall appoint a discreet and competent attorney-at-law as guardian ad litem to represent the child pursuant to § 16.1-266.1. B. Prior to th e detention hearing held pursuant to § 16.1-250, the court shall appoint a qualified and competent attorney-at-law to represent the child unless an attorney has been retained and appears on behalf of the child. For the purposes of appointment of couns el for the detention hearing held pursuant to § 16.1-250 only, a childs indigence shall be presumed. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a judge from releasing a child from detention prior to appointment of counsel. C. Subsequent to the detention hearing, if any, and prior to the adjudicatory or transfer hearing by the court of any case involving a child who is alleged to be in need of services, in need of supervision or delinquent, such child and his parent, guardian, legal cust odian or other person standing in loco parentis shall be informed by a judge, clerk or probation officer of the childs right to counsel and of the liability of the parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis for the co sts of such legal services pursuant to § 16.1-267 and be given an opportunity to: 1. Obtai n and employ counsel of the childs own choice; or 2. Request that the court appoint counsel, provided that before counsel is appointed or the court continues any appointment previously made pursuant to subsection B, the court shall deter mine that the child is indigent within the contemplation of the law pursuant to guidelines set forth in § 19.2-159 by requiring the childs parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis to complete a statement of indig ence substantially in the form provided by § 19.2-159 and a financial statement, and upon determination of indigence the court shall appoint an attorney from the list maintained by the Indigent Defense Commission pursuant to § 19.2-163.01 to repres ent the child; or 3. Waive the right to representation by an attorney, if the court finds the child and the parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis of the child consent, in writing, and such waiver is consistent with the interests of the child. Such written waiver shall be in accordance with law and shall be filed with the court records of the case. A child who is alleged to have committed an offense that would be a fel ony if committed by an adult, may waive such right only after he consults with an attorney and the court determines that his waiver is free and voluntary. The waiver shall be in writing, signed by both the child and the childs attorney and shall be f iled with the court records of the case. D. A judge, cl erk or probation officer shall inform the parent or guardian of his right to counsel prior to the adjudicatory hearing of a petition in which a child is alleged to be abused or neglected or at risk of abuse or neglect as provided in subdivision A 2a of § 16.1-241 and prior to a hearing at which a parent could be subjected to the loss of residual parental rights. In addition, prior to the hearing by the court of any case involving any other adult charged with abuse or neglect of a child, this adult s hall be informed of his right to counsel. This adult and the parent or guardian shall be given an opportunity to: 1. Obtai n and employ counsel of the parents, guardians or other adults own choice; or 2. If the court determines that the parent, guardian or other adult is indigent within the contemplation of the law pursuant to the guidelines set forth in § 19.2-159, a statement subs tantially in the form provided by § 19.2-159 and a financial statement shall be executed by such parent, guardian or other adult and the court shall appoint an attorney-at-law to represent him; or 3. Waive the right to representation by an attorney in accordance with the provisions of § 19.2-160.If the identity or location of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable or a parent or guardian fails to appear, the court shall consider appointing an attorney-at-law to represent the interests of the absent parent or guardian, and the hearing may be held.Prior to a hearing at which a child is the subject of an initial fost er care plan filed pursuant to § 16.1-281, a foster care review hearing pursuant to § 16.1-282 and a permanency planning hearing pursuant to § 16.1-282.1, the court shall consider appointing counsel to represent the childs parent or guardian . E. In those ca ses described in subsections A, B, C and D, which in the discretion of the court require counsel or a guardian ad litem to represent the child or children or the parent or guardian or other adult party in addition to the representation provided in those subsections, a discreet and competent attorney-at-law may be appointed by the court as counsel or a guardian ad litem. F. In all othe r cases which in the discretion of the court require counsel or a guardian ad litem, or both, to represent the child or children or the parent or guardian, discreet and competent attorneys-at-law may be appointed by the court. However, in cases where the custody of a child or children is the subject of controversy or requires determination and each of the parents or other persons claiming a right to custody is represented by counsel, the court shall not appoint counsel or a guardian ad litem to represen t the interests of the child or children unless the court finds, at any stage in the proceedings in a specific case, that the interests of the child or children are not otherwise adequately represented. G. Any state o r local agency, department, authority or institution and any school, hospital, physician or other health or mental health care provider shall permit a guardian ad litem or counsel for the child appointed pursuant to this section to inspect and copy, with out the consent of the child or his parents, any records relating to the child whom the guardian or counsel represents upon presentation by him of a copy of the court order appointing him or a court order specifically allowing him such access. Upon reque st therefor by the guardian ad litem or counsel for the child made at least 72 hours in advance, a mental health care provider shall make himself available to conduct a review and interpretation of the childs treatment records which are specifically related to the investigation. Such a request may be made in lieu of or in addition to inspection and copying of the records. History History.

CASE NOTES Court erred in assessing transcript costs against Commonwealth.  The trial court erred in assessing to the Commonwealth the costs related to preparation of the trial transcript since subsection B expressly assures compensation only for appointed counsels services not expenses. Kerns v. Winchester Dept of Social Servs., No. 2211-91-4 (Ct. of Appeals Sept. 15, 1992). Inquiry as to financial ability to pay fees applies only to appointments pursuant to § 16.1-266 A and B [now § 16.1-266 A and C].  That statutory mandate, to inquire as to financial ability to pay guardian ad litem fees as required by subsection A of this section, applies only to a guardian a d litem appointed pursuant to § 16.1-266 A or B [now § 16.1-266 A and C].

App. LEXIS 420 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 1993). In a case in which the trial court properly denied the mothers motion to amend custody and visitation, §§ 16.1-267 and 19.2-163 were inapplicable to gua rdian ad litem compensation because § 16.1-267 granted authority to the juvenile and domestic relations district court to award guardian ad litem fees in cases originating in that court, but the present action took place entirely in circuit court, beg inning with the 2010 divorce proceedings; and § 19.2-163 pertained to the cap for compensation of court-appointed counsel in criminal cases. The amount of the award to the guardian ad litem was clearly within the discretion of the trial court. Sims-Be rnard v. Bernard, 2018 Va. App. LEXIS 13 (Va. Ct. App. Jan. 23, 2018). Guardian ad litem fees can be divided between parties.  Trial court did not err in dividing a guardian ad litems fees equally between a mother and a father because nothing in Virginia jurisprudence indicated that a llocating guardian ad litem costs equally amongst the parties was error.

The juvenile court finds that probable cause exists to believe that the juvenile committed the delinquent act as alleged or a lesser included delinquent act which would be a felony if committed by an adult; 3. The juvenile is competent to stand trial. The juvenile is presumed to be competent and the burden is on the party alleging the juvenile is not competent to rebut the presumption by a p reponderance of the evidence; and 4. The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the juvenile is not a proper person to remain within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. In determining whether a juvenile i s a proper person to remain within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court, the court shall consider, but not be limited to, the following factors: a. The juveniles age; b. The seriousness and number of alleged offenses, including (i) whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful manner; (ii) whether th e alleged offense was against persons or property, with greater weight being given to offenses against persons, especially if death or bodily injury resulted; (iii) whether the maximum punishment for such an offense is greater than 20 years confinement i f committed by an adult; (iv) whether the alleged offense involved the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon by brandishing, threatening, displaying or otherwise employing such weapon; and (v) the nature of the juveniles participation in the all eged offense; c. Whether the juvenile can be retained in the juvenile justice system long enough for effective treatment and rehabilitation; d. The appropriateness and availability of the services and dispositional alternatives in both the criminal justice and juvenile justice systems for dealing with the juveniles pr oblems; e. The record and previous history of the juvenile in this or other jurisdictions, including (i) the number and nature of previous contacts with juvenile or circuit courts, (ii) the number and nature of prior periods of probation, (iii) the number and nature of prior commitments to juvenile correctional centers, (iv) the number and nature of previous residential and community-based treatments, (v) whether previous adjudications and commitments were for delinquent acts that involved the infliction of serious bodily injury, and (vi) whether the alleged offense is part of a repetitive pattern of similar adjudicated offenses; f. Whether the juvenile has previously absconded from the legal custody of a juvenile correctional entity in this or any other jurisdiction; g. The extent, if any, of the juveniles degree of intellectual disability or mental illness; h. The juveniles school record and education; i. The juveniles mental and emotional maturity; and j. The juveniles physical condition and physical maturity.No transfer decision shall be precluded or re versed on the grounds that the court failed to consider any of the factors specified in subdivision 4. B. The juvenil e court shall conduct a preliminary hearing whenever a juvenile 16 years of age or older is charged with murder in violation of § 18.2-31, 18.2-32 or 18.2-40, or aggravated malicious wounding in violation of § 18.2-51.2. If the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, but less than 16 years of age, then the court may proceed, on motion of the attorney for the Commonwealth, as provided in subsection A. C. The juvenil e court shall conduct a preliminary hearing whenever a juvenile 16 years of age or older is charged with murder in violation of § 18.2-33; felonious injury by mob in violation of § 18.2-41; abduction in violation of § 18.2-48; malicious wounding in violation of § 18.2-51; malicious wounding of a law-enforcement officer in violation of § 18.2-51.1; felonious poisoning in violation of § 18.2-54.1; adulteration of products in violation of § 18.2-54.2; robbery in violation of subdivisio n B 1 or 2 of § 18.2-58 or carjacking in violation of § 18.2-58.1; rape in violation of § 18.2-61; forcible sodomy in violation of § 18.2-67.1; object sexual penetration in violation of § 18.2-67.2; manufacturing, selling, giving, distribu ting, or possessing with intent to manufacture, sell, give, or distribute a controlled substance or an imitation controlled substance in violation of § 18.2-248 if the juvenile has been previously adjudicated delinquent on two or more occasions of vio lating § 18.2-248 provided the adjudications occurred after the juvenile was at least 16 years of age; manufacturing, selling, giving, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, sell, give, or distribute methamphetamine in violation of § 18.2-248.03 if the juvenile has been previously adjudicated delinquent on two or more occasions of violating § 18.2-248.03 provided the adjudications occurred after the juvenile was at least 16 years of age; or felonious manufacturing, selling, g iving, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, sell, give, or distribute anabolic steroids in violation of § 18.2-248.5 if the juvenile has been previously adjudicated delinquent on two or more occasions of violating § 18.2-248.5 pr ovided the adjudications occurred after the juvenile was at least 16 years of age, provided the attorney for the Commonwealth gives written notice of his intent to proceed pursuant to this subsection. Prior to giving written notice of his intent to proce ed pursuant to this subsection, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall submit a written request to the director of the court services unit to complete a report as described in subsection B of § 16.1-269.2 unless waived by the juvenile and his attorne y or other legal representative. The report shall be filed with the court and mailed or delivered to (i) the attorney for the Commonwealth and (ii) counsel for the juvenile, or, if the juvenile is not represented by counsel, to the juvenile and a parent, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis with respect to the juvenile, within 21 days of the date of the written request. After reviewing the report, if the attorney for the Commonwealth still intends to proceed pursuant to this subsection, h e shall then provide the written notice of such intent, which shall include affirmation that he reviewed the report. The notice shall be filed with the court and mailed or delivered to counsel for the juvenile or, if the juvenile is not then represented by counsel, to the juvenile and a parent, guardian or other person standing in loco parentis with respect to the juvenile at least seven days prior to the preliminary hearing. If the attorney for the Commonwealth elects not to give such notice, if he ele cts to withdraw the notice prior to certification of the charge to the grand jury, or if the juvenile is 14 years of age or older, but less than 16 years of age, he may proceed as provided in subsection A. D. Upon a find ing of probable cause pursuant to a preliminary hearing under subsection B or C, the juvenile court shall certify the charge, and all ancillary charges, to the grand jury. Such certification shall divest the juvenile court of jurisdiction as to the charg e and any ancillary charges. Nothing in this subsection shall divest the juvenile court of jurisdiction over any matters unrelated to such charge and ancillary charges which may otherwise be properly within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.If the c ourt does not find probable cause to believe that the juvenile has committed the violent juvenile felony as charged in the petition or warrant or if the petition or warrant is terminated by dismissal in the juvenile court, the attorney for the Commonweal th may seek a direct indictment in the circuit court. If the petition or warrant is terminated by nolle prosequi in the juvenile court, the attorney for the Commonwealth may seek an indictment only after a preliminary hearing in juvenile court.If the cou rt finds that the juvenile was not (i) for the purposes of subsection A, 14 years of age or older or (ii) for purposes of subsection B or C, 16 years of age or older, at the time of the alleged commission of the offense or that the conditions specified i n subdivision A 1, 2, or 3 have not been met, the case shall proceed as otherwise provided for by law. E. An indictme nt in the circuit court cures any error or defect in any proceeding held in the juvenile court except with respect to the juveniles age. If an indictment is terminated by nolle prosequi, the Commonwealth may reinstate the proceeding by seeking a subs equent indictment.

CASE NOTES Waiver ineffective where juvenile and domestic court without jurisdiction.  Although this section provides that a juvenile, with the written consent of his counsel, may elect in writing to waive the jurisdiction of the juvenile and domest ic court and have his case transferred to the appropriate circuit court, such waiver provision relates to transfer and does not dispense with the statutory parental notice necessary to confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the juvenile and domestic cou rt at the inception of the proceedings; manifestly, a waiver permitted by this section is predicated upon the existence of authority in the juvenile and domestic court to act, and cannot cure an antecedent and fatal defect in the underlying jurisdiction.

Statutes, § 47. CASE NOTES Effect of 1994 amendment.  Prior to 1994, the treatment of a juvenile as an adult specifically did not prohibit the juvenile court from exercising jurisdiction on subsequent charges. Howeve r, the 1994 amendment intentionally altered that procedure and now precludes the juvenile court from exercising jurisdiction over a juvenile once the juvenile has been tried or treated as an adult on an earlier charge. Broadnax v. Commonwealth, 24 Va. Ap p. 808, 485 S.E.2d 666, 1997 Va. App. LEXIS 347 (1997). Conviction in circuit court divests juvenile court of jurisdiction.  A juvenile who has been convicted as an adult in circuit court under the provisions of this article is not entitled to a transfer hearing in juvenile court for an y pending unrelated allegations of delinquency which have not been disposed of by the juvenile court at the time of the criminal conviction. A prior conviction in the circuit court for unrelated offenses precludes the juvenile court from thereafter exerc ising jurisdiction regardless of the defendants age at the time of the institution of the proceedings. Asby v. Commonwealth, 34 Va. App. 217, 539 S.E.2d 742, 2001 Va. App. LEXIS 4 (2001), op. withdrawn, vacated, transferred, 38 Va. App. 148, 562 S.E. 2d 346, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 265 (2002). Although defendant was only 17 years old, jury sentencing was proper in his adult trial because pursuant to this section, § 16.1-272 did not apply where defend ant had previously been tried and convicted as an adult on an unrelated charge. Saunders v. Commonwealth, 56 Va. App. 139, 692 S.E.2d 252, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 169 (2010), aff'd, 281 Va. 448, 706 S.E.2d 350, 2011 Va. LEXIS 45 (2011). Probable cause finding divested juvenile court of jurisdiction for future offenses.  Defendant juvenile, tried as an adult on a charge of malicious wounding and convicted of the lesser included offense of unlawful wounding, could not have the case transferred back to the juvenile court, as once the juvenile court made a probable cause finding, the juvenile court had no further jurisdiction; the juvenile court was also precluded from taking jurisdiction subsequent offenses committed by that juveni le, pursuant to § 16.1-271. Hughes v. Commonwealth, 39 Va. App. 448, 573 S.E.2d 324, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 765 (2002). Applicability of statute.  Section 16.1-271 was not applicable because the events giving rise to defendants prior convictions occurred chronologically after the shooting of the victim, so that the shooting of the victim was not an alleged future criminal act. Furthermore, the charges against defendant for the victims shooting were not pending at the time of defendants prior convictions. Robinson v. Commonwealth, 63 Va. App. 302 , 756 S.E.2d 924, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 150 (2014). Prior conviction as adult renders transfer procedures inapplicable.  A defendants argument that original indictments were void because the circuit court failed to review the transfer record from the juvenile court as required b y statute before the indictments were obtained was without merit because the defendant previously had been tried and convicted as an adult in another circuit court for rape and such prior conviction as an adult eliminated the requirement that the circuit court review the transfer proceedings. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 259 Va. 654, 529 S.E.2d 769, 2000 Va. LEXIS 60, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 981, 121 S. Ct. 432, 148 L. Ed. 2d 439, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 7371 (2000). Juve nile procedures inapplicable to subsequent offense.  Where the defendant had previously been tried as an adult and convicted of a rape which occurred several days before the rape and capital murder with which he was presently charged, the later rape and capital murder constituted alleged future criminal acts for purposes of this section and rendered inapplicable the procedures for transferring a case so that a juvenile may be charged as an adult and for giv ing notice to the juveniles parents. Johnson v. Commonwealth, 259 Va. 654, 529 S.E.2d 769, 2000 Va. LEXIS 60, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 981, 121 S. Ct. 432, 148 L. Ed. 2d 439, 2000 U.S. LEXIS 7371 (2000). Failur e to challenge certification in other proceeding.  Because the defendant failed to raise the jurisdictional issue of lack of notice to his father when he was certified for trial as an adult in another county befor e the indictments were returned in the circuit court in the instant case, failure to comply with the parental notification provisions of the statutes did not deprive the circuit court of jurisdiction in the instant case. Monteon v. Commonwealth, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 316 (Va. Ct. App. May 2, 2000). Sentencing by a jury.  The fact that a defendant was convicted as an adult of crimes committed when he was a juvenile after he had previously been convicted of another crime as an adult did not mean he was entitled to be sentenced by a jury. The offenses for which he was to be sentenced occurred before the offense of which he had previously been convicted as an adult and were not, therefore, future criminal acts, nor were they the subject of delinquency allegations pending in the juvenile court at the time of his first conviction as an adult. Ingram v. Commonwealth, 2002 Va. App. LEXIS 593 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2002). Jury sentencing was proper in a minor defendants adult trial because § 16.1-271 permitted all adult sentencing procedures and dispositions, including jury sentencing. Saunders v. Commonwealth, 56 Va. App. 139, 692 S.E.2d 252, 2010 Va. App. LEXIS 169 (2010), aff'd, 281 Va. 448, 706 S.E.2d 350, 2011 Va. LEXIS 45 (2011). When defendant appeared before a circuit court for sentencing on criminal charges under § 16.1-269.1, the jury was correctly allowed to sentence defendant beca use he was not a juvenile in that he had been previously convicted as an adult on an unrelated charge and given an adult sentence. Section 16.1-272 did not apply to youthful offenders who fell within the scope of § 16.1-271, while § 16.1-271 applie d to any juvenile who was tried and convicted in a circuit court as an adult. Saunders v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 448, 706 S.E.2d 350, 2011 Va. LEXIS 45 (2011). Trial as an adult proper where previous charges ended by nolle prosequi.  Defendant was properly tried as an adult under § 16.1-271 on attempted murder, use of a firearm in the commission of attempted murder, robbery, and use of a fi rearm in the commission of robbery charges, where he had been certified as adult under subsection C of § 16.1-269.1 on previous charges of robbery and aggravated malicious wounding; although the previous charges terminated by nolle prosequi, defendant was treated as an adult during the pendency of the prior proceedings, which status continued pursuant to § 16.1-271. Cook v. Commonwealth, No. 1968-02-2, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 375 (Ct. of Appeals July 1, 2003), affd, 268 Va. 111, 597 S.E.2d 84 (200 4) But see the 2007 amendment to this section which substituted Conviction of a juvenile for The trial or treatment of a juvenile. . CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Juvenile court retained jurisdiction to enforce previous order.  Despite the fact that defendant had already been tried and convicted on unrelated charges as an adult in the circuit court, the juven...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-272"><akn:num>§ 16.1-272</akn:num><akn:heading>Power of circuit court over juvenile offender</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. In any case in which a juvenile is indicted, the offense for which he is indicted and all ancillary charges shall be tried in the same manner as provided for in the trial of adults, except as otherwise provided with regard to sentencing. Upon a finding of guilty of any charge, the court shall fix the sentence without the intervention of a jury. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a court to review the results of an investigation completed pursuant to § 16.1-273. 1. If a juvenile is convicted of a violent juvenile felony, for that offense and for all ancillary crimes the court may order that (i) the juvenile serve a portion of the sentence as a serious juvenile offender under § 16.1-285.1 and the remainder of such sen tence in the same manner as provided for adults; (ii) the juvenile serve the entire sentence in the same manner as provided for adults; or (iii) the portion of the sentence to be served in the same manner as provided for adults be suspended conditioned u pon successful completion of such terms and conditions as may be imposed in a juvenile court upon disposition of a delinquency case including, but not limited to, commitment under subdivision A 14 of § 16.1-278.8 or § 16.1-285.1. 2. If the juvenile is convicted of any other felony, the court may sentence or commit the juvenile offender in accordance with the criminal laws of this Commonwealth or may in its discret ion deal with the juvenile in the manner prescribed in this chapter for the hearing and disposition of cases in the juvenile court, including, but not limited to, commitment under § 16.1-285.1 or may in its discretion impose an adult sentence and susp end the sentence conditioned upon successful completion of such terms and conditions as may be imposed in a juvenile court upon disposition of a delinquency case. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the juvenile is convicted of any felony, the court may in its discretion depart from any mandatory minimum sentence required by law or su spend any portion of an otherwise applicable sentence. 4. If the juvenile is not convicted of a felony but is convicted of a misdemeanor, the court shall deal with the juvenile in the manner prescribed by law for the disposition of a delinque ncy case in the juvenile court. B. If the circ uit court decides to deal with the juvenile in the same manner as a case in the juvenile court and places the juvenile on probation, the juvenile may be supervised by a juvenile probation officer. C. Whether the court sentences and commits the juvenile as a juvenile under this chapter or under the criminal law, in cases where the juvenile is convicted of a felony in violation of § 18.2-61, 18.2-63, 18.2-64.1, 18.2-67.1, 18.2-67.2, 18.2-67.3, 18.2-67.5, 18.2- 370 or 18.2-370.1 or, where the victim is a minor or is physically helpless or mentally incapacitated as defined in § 18.2-67.10, subsection B of § 18.2-361 or subsection B of § 18.2-366, the clerk shall make the report required by § 19.2-390 to the Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry established pursuant to Chapter 9 (§ 9.1-900 et seq.) of Title 9.1. D. In any case in which a juvenile is not sentenced as a juvenile under this chapter, the court shall, in addition to considering any other factor and prior to imposing a sentence, consider (i) the juveniles exposure to adverse childhood experiences, early childho od trauma, or any child welfare agency and (ii) the differences between juvenile and adult offenders. E. A juvenile sentenced pursuant to clause (i) of subdivision A 1 shall be eligible to earn sentence credits in the manner prescribed by § 53.1-202.2 for the portion of the sentence served as a serious juvenile offender under § 16.1-285.1. F. If the cour t sentences the juvenile as a juvenile under this chapter, the clerk shall provide a copy of the courts final order or judgment to the court service unit in the same locality as the juvenile court to which the case had been transferred.

CASE NOTES Construction with § 18.2-53.1.  The terms of § 18.2-53.1, providing for a mandatory, unsuspended sentence for persons convicted of use of a firearm in the commission of certain felonies n otwithstanding any other provision of law, require a trial court to impose the mandatory, unsuspended sentence on a juvenile convicted of one of the enumerated felonies despite the provisions of this section. Green v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 567, 5 07 S.E.2d 627, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 632 (1998). Notwithstanding the 2004 amendment to § 18.2-53.1, Green v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 567, 507 S.E.2d 627 (1998), remains valid and precludes the courts from applying clause (iii) of subdivision A 1 of § 16.1-272 to suspend any part of a mandatory minimum se ntence imposed under § 18.2-53.1.Bullock v. Commonwealth, 48 Va. App. 359, 631 S.E.2d 334, 2006 Va. App. LEXIS 296 (2006), overruled in part, Brown v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 538, 733 S.E.2d 638, 2012 Va. LEXIS 190 (2012). Juvenile defendant who was charged as an adult and pled guilty to five counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, in violation of § 18.2-53.1, s hould have been sentenced to the mandatory minimum rather than sentenced to juvenile dispositions under § 16.1-272 because the statutes were in conflict, and § 18.2-53.1 was the more specific statute. Brown v. Commonwealth, 279 Va. 210, 688 S.E.2d 185, 2010 Va. LEXIS 9, cert. denied, 562 U.S. 886, 131 S. Ct. 217, 178 L. Ed. 2d 131, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 7041 (2010). Use of firearm in commission of felony .  Even after the 2004 statutory amendments, the mandatory sentencing provisions of § 18.2-53.1 control over the juvenile sentencing options contained in subdivis ion A 1 of § 16.1-272 that allow suspension of an adult sentence. Commonwealth v. Brown, 2008 Va. App. LEXIS 517 (Va. Ct. App. Nov. 25, 2008), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 279 Va. 210, 688 S.E.2d 185, 2010 Va. LEXIS 9 (2010). Convictions for using a firearm in the commission of robbery were clearly ancillary crimes requiring sentencing under subdivision A 1 of § 16.1-272 rat her than subdivision A 2 of § 16.1-272, and the mandatory sentencing provisions of § 18.2-53.1 control...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-273"><akn:num>§ 16.1-273</akn:num><akn:heading>Court may require investigation of social history and preparation of victim impact statement</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

However, in the case of a juvenile adjudicated delinquent on the basis of an act committed on or after January 1, 2000, which would be (a) a felony if committed by an adult, or (b) a violation under Article 1 (§ 18.2-247 et seq .) or Article 1.1 (§ 18.2-265.1 et seq.) of Chapter 7 of Title 18.2 and such offense would be punishable as a Class 1 or Class 2 misdemeanor if committed by an adult, the court shall order the juvenile to undergo a drug screening. If the drug screenin g indicates that the juvenile has a substance abuse or dependence problem, an assessment shall be completed by a certified substance abuse counselor as defined in § 54.1-3500 employed by the Department of Juvenile Justice or by a locally operated cour t services unit or by an individual employed by or currently under contract to such agencies and who is specifically trained to conduct such assessments under the supervision of such counselor. B. The court a lso shall, on motion of the attorney for the Commonwealth with the consent of the victim, or may in its discretion, require the preparation of a victim impact statement in accordance with the provisions of § 19.2-299.1 if the court determines that the victim may have suffered significant physical, psychological, or economic injury as a result of the violation of law.

Whenever a juvenile concerning whom a petition has been filed appears to be in need of nursing, medical or surgical care, the juvenile court or the circuit court may or der the parent or other person responsible for the care and support of the juvenile to provide such care in a hospital or otherwise and to pay the expenses thereof. If the parent or other person is unable or fails to provide such care, the juvenile court or the circuit court may refer the matter to the authority designated in accordance with law for the determination of eligibility for such services in the county or city in which such juvenile or his parents have residence or legal domicile. In any such case, if a parent who is able to do so fails or refuses to comply with the order, the juvenile court or the circuit court may proceed against him as for con tempt or may proceed against him for nonsupport.

Approval of entrustment agreement. Text A. In any case in which a child has been entrusted pursuant to § 63.2-903 or 63.2-1817 to the local board of social services or to a child welfare agency, a petition for approval of the entrustment agreement by the board or agency: 1. Shall be filed within a reasonable period of time, no later than 89 days after the execution of an entrustment agreement for less than 90 days, if the child is not returned to the caretaker from whom he was entrusted within that period; 2. Shall be filed within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days after the execution of an entrustment agreement for 90 days or longer or for an unspecified period of time, if such entrustment agreement does not provide for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child; and 3. May be filed in the case of a permanent entrustment agreement which provides for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child.The board or agen cy shall file a foster care plan pursuant to § 16.1-281 to be heard with any petition for approval of an entrustment agreement. B. Upon the fi ling of a petition for approval of an entrustment agreement pursuant to subsection A of § 16.1-241, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the child in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-266, and shall schedule the matter fo r a hearing to be held as follows: within 45 days of the filing of a petition pursuant to subdivision A 1, A 2 or A 3, except where an order of publication has been ordered by the court, in which case the hearing shall be held within 75 days of the filin g of the petition. The court shall provide notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition to the following, each of whom shall be a party entitled to participate in the proceeding: 1. The l ocal board of social services or child welfare agency; 2. The child, if he is 12 years of age or older; 3. The guardian ad litem for the child; and 4. The childs parents, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis to the child. No such notification shall be required, however, if the judge certifies on the record that the identity of the parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable. A birth father shall be given notice of the proceedings if he is an acknowledged father pursuant to § 20-49.1, adjudicated pursuant to § 20-49.8, or presumed pursu ant to § 63.2-1202, or has registered with the Virginia Birth Father Registry pursuant to Article 7 (§ 63.2-1249 et seq.). An affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of th is fact, provided there is no other evidence before the court which would refute such an affidavit. Failure to register with the Virginia Birth Father Registry pursuant to Article 7 (§ 63.2-1249 et seq.) of Chapter 12 of Title 63.2 shall be evidence t hat the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable. The hearing shall be held and an order may be entered, although a parent, guardian, legal custodian or person standing in loco parentis fails to appear and is not represented by counsel, pro vided personal or substituted service was made on the person, or the court determines that such person cannot be found, after reasonable effort, or in the case of a person who is without the Commonwealth, the person cannot be found or his post office add ress cannot be ascertained after reasonable effort. However, when a petition seeks approval of a permanent entrustment agreement which provides for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child, a summons shall be served upon the parent or parents and the other parties specified in § 16.1-263. The summons or notice of hearing shall clearly state the consequences of a termination of residual parental rights. Service shall be made pursuant to § 16.1-264. The r emaining parents parental rights may be terminated even though that parent has not entered into an entrustment agreement if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child and that (i) the ident ity of the parent is not reasonably ascertainable; (ii) the identity and whereabouts of the parent are known or reasonably ascertainable, and the parent is personally served with notice of the termination proceeding pursuant to § 8.01-296 or 8.01-320; (iii) the whereabouts of the parent are not reasonably ascertainable and the parent is given notice of the termination proceedings by certified or registered mail to the last known address and such parent fails to object to the proceedings within 15 day s of the mailing of such notice; or (iv) the whereabouts of the parent are not reasonably ascertainable and the parent is given notice of the termination proceedings through an order of publication pursuant to §§ 8.01-316 and 8.01-317, and such par ent fails to object to the proceedings. C. At the hear ing held pursuant to this section, the court shall hear evidence on the petition filed and shall review the foster care plan for the child filed by the local board or child welfare agency in accordance with § 16.1-281. D. At the conc lusion of the hearing, the court shall make a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, whether approval of the entrustment agreement is in the best interest of the child. However, if the petition seeks approval of a permanent entrustment agre ement which provides for the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities with respect to the child, the court shall make a finding, based upon clear and convincing evidence, whether termination of parental rights is in the best interest of th e child. If the court makes either of these findings, the court may make any of the orders of disposition permitted in a case involving an abused or neglected child pursuant to § 16.1-278.2. Any such order transferring legal custody of the child shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subdivision A 5 of § 16.1-278.2 and shall be subject to the provisions of subsection D1. This order shall include, but need not be limited to, the following findings: (i) that there is no less drastic alte rnative to granting the requested relief; and (ii) that reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal and that continued placement in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the child, if the order transfers legal custody of the child to a lo cal board of social services. At any time subsequent to the transfer of legal custody of the child pursuant to this section, a birth parent or parents of the child and the pre-adoptive parent or parents may enter into a written post-adoption contact and communication agreement in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-283.1 and Article 1.1 (§ 63.2-1220.2 et seq.) of Chapter 12 of Title 63.2. The court shall not require a written post-adoption contact and communication agreement as a precondition to entry of an order in any case involving the child.The effect of the courts order approving a permanent entrustment agreement is to terminate an entrusting parents residual parental rights. Any order terminating parental rights shall be accomp anied by an order (i) continuing or granting custody to a local board of social services or to a licensed child-placing agency or (ii) granting custody or guardianship to a person with a legitimate interest. Such an order continuing or granting custody t o a local board of social services or to a licensed child-placing agency shall indicate whether that board or agency shall have the authority to place the child for adoption and consent thereto. A final order terminating parental rights pursuant to this section renders the approved entrustment agreement irrevocable. Such order may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-296. D1. Any order transferring custody of the child to a person with a legitimate interest pursuant to subsection D shall be entered only upon a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that such person is one who (i) after an investigation as directed by the court, is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect; and the order shall so state. The courts order transferring custody to a person with a legitimate interest should further provide for, as appropriate, any terms and conditions w hich would promote the childs interest and welfare; ongoing provision of social services to the child and the childs custodian; and court review of the childs placement. E. The local b oard or licensed child-placing agency to which authority is given to place the child for adoption and consent thereto after an order terminating parental rights is entered pursuant to this section shall file a written Adoption Progress Report with the ju venile court on the progress being made to place the child in an adoptive home. The report shall be filed with the court every six months from the date of the final order terminating parental rights until a final order of adoption is entered on behalf of the child in the circuit court. At the conclusion of the hearing at which termination of parental rights is ordered and authority is given to the local board or licensed child-placing agency to place the child for adoption, the juvenile court shall sche dule a date by which the board or agency shall file the first Adoption Progress Report required by this section. A copy of the Adoption Progress Report shall be sent by the court to the guardian ad litem for the child. The court may schedule a hearing on the report with or without the request of a party.

Within 60 d ays of a preliminary removal order hearing held pursuant to § 16.1-252 or a hearing on a preliminary protective order held pursuant to § 16.1-253, a dispositional hearing shall be held if the court found abuse or neglect and (i) removed the child f rom his home or (ii) entered a preliminary protective order. Notice of the dispositional hearing shall be provided to the childs parent, guardian, legal custodian, or other person standing in loco parentis in accordance with § 16.1-263. The hearin g shall be held and a dispositional order may be entered, although a parent, guardian, legal custodian, or person standing in loco parentis fails to appear and is not represented by counsel, provided personal or substituted service was made on the person , or the court determines that such person cannot be found, after reasonable effort, or in the case of a person who is without the Commonwealth, the person cannot be found or his post office address cannot be ascertained after reasonable effort. Notice s hall also be provided to the local department of social services, the guardian ad litem and, if appointed, the court-appointed special advocate. If a child is found to be (a) abused or neglected; (b) at risk of being abused or neglected by a parent or custodian who has been adjudicated as having abused or neglec ted another child in his care; or (c) abandoned by his parent or other custodian, or without parental care and guardianship because of his parents absence or physical or mental incapacity, the juvenile court or the circuit court may make any of the f ollowing orders of disposition to protect the welfare of the child: 1. Enter an order pursuant to the provisions of § 16.1-278; 2. Permit the child to remain with his parent, subject to such conditions and limitations as the court may order with respect to such child and his parent or other adult occupant of the s ame dwelling; 3.

The prohibition may exclude any such individual from the home under such conditions as the court may prescribe for a period to be determined by the court but in no event for longer than 180 days from the date of such de termination. A hearing shall be held within 150 days to determine further disposition of the matter that may include limiting or prohibiting contact for another 180 days; 4.

The local board or public agency and the parents or guardians shall enter into an agre ement which shall specify the responsibilities of each for the care and control of the child. The board or public agency that places the child shall have the final authority to determine the appropriate placement for the child. Nothing herein shall limit the authority of the court to review the childs status in foster care in accordance with subsection G of § 16.1-281 or to review the foster care plan through a petition filed pursuant to subsection A of § 16.1-282.

In any case in which (i) a local board of social services places a child through an agreement with the parents or guardians where legal custody remains with the parents or guardian, or (ii) legal custody of a child is given to a local board of social services or a child welfare agency, the local department of social services or child welfare agency shall prepare a foster care plan for such child, as described hereinafter. The individual family service plan developed by the family assessment and planning team pursu ant to § 2.2-5208 may be accepted by the court as the foster care plan if it meets the requirements of this section. The representatives of such department or agency shall involve in the development of the plan the childs parent(s), except when parental rights have been terminated or the local department of social services or child welfare agency has made diligent efforts to locate the parent(s) and such parent(s) cannot be located, relatives and fictive kin who are interested in the childs welfare, and any other person or pe rsons standing in loco parentis at the time the board or child welfare agency obtained custody or the board placed the child. The representatives of such department or agency shall involve a child who is 12 years of age or older in the development of the plan and, at the option of such child, up to two members of the case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent of, or caseworker for, the child. A child under 12 years of age may be involved in the development of the plan if such involvement is consistent with the best interests of the child. In cases where either the parent(s) or child is not involved in the development of the plan, the department or agency shall include in the plan a full description of the reasons the refor. The department or child welfare agency shall file the plan with the juvenile and domestic relations district court within 45 days following the transfer of custody or t he boards placement of the child unless the court, for good cause shown, allows an extension of time, which shall not exceed an additional 60 days. However, a foster care plan shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-277.01 with a petition for approval of an entrustment agreement. A foster care plan need not be prepared if the child is returned to his prior family or placed in an adoptive home within 45 days following transfer of custody to the board or agency or the boards placement of the child. B. The foster care plan shall describe in writing (i) the programs, care, services and other support which will be offered to the child and his parents and other prior custodians; (ii) the participation and conduct which will be sought from the childs parents and other prior custodians; (iii) the visitation and other contacts which will be permitted between the child and his parents and other prior custodians, and between the child and his siblings; (iv) the nature of the placement or placements which will be pro vided for the child, including an assessment of the stability of each placement, the services provided or plans for services to be provided to address placement instability or to prevent disruption of the placement, and a description of other placements that were considered for the child, if any, and reasons why such other placements were not provided; (v) for school-age children, the school placement of the child; (vi) for children 14 years of age and older, the childs needs and goals in the areas of counseling, education, housing, employment, and money management skills development, along with specific independent living services that will be provided to the child to help him reach these goals; and (vii) for children 14 years and older, an explan ation of the childs rights with respect to education, health, visitation, court participation, and the right to stay safe and avoid exploitation. The foster care plan shall include all documentation specified in 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(l) and § 63.2 -905.3. If the child in foster care is placed in a qualified residential treatment program as defined in § 16.1-228, the foster care plan shall also include the report and documentation set forth in subsection A of § 63.2-906.1. If the child in fos ter care is pregnant or is the parent of a child, the foster care plan shall also include (a) a list of the services and programs to be provided to or on behalf of the child to ensure parental readiness or capability and (b) a description of the foster c are prevention strategy for any child born to the child in foster care. In cases in which a foster care plan approved prior to July 1, 2011, identifies independent living as the goal for the child, and in cases involving children admitted to the United S tates as refugees or asylees who are 16 years of age or older and for whom the goal is independent living, the plan shall also describe the programs and services which will help the child prepare for the transition from foster care to independent living. If consistent with the childs health and safety, the plan shall be designed to support reasonable efforts which lead to the return of the child to his parents or other prior custodians within the shortest practicable time which shall be specified in the plan. The childs health and safety shall be the paramount concern of the court and the agency throughout the placement, case planning, service provision and review process. For a child 14 years of age and older, the plan shall include a signed a cknowledgment by the child that the child has received a copy of the plan and that the rights contained therein have been explained to the child in an age-appropriate manner. If the department or child welfare agency concludes that it is not reasonably likely that the child can be returned to his prior family within a practicable time, consi stent with the best interests of the child, the department, child welfare agency or team shall (1) include a full description of the reasons for this conclusion; (2) provide information on the opportunities for placing the child with a relative or in an adoptive home; (3) design the plan to lead to the childs successful placement with a relative or fictive kin for the purpose of establishing eligibility for the Federal-Funded Kinship Guardianship Assistance program established pursuant to § 63.2- 1305 or the State-Funded Kinship Guardianship Assistance program established pursuant to § 63.2-1306 or in an adoptive home within the shortest practicable time; and (4) if neither of such placements is feasible, explain why permanent foster care is t he plan for the child or independent living is the plan for the child in cases involving children admitted to the United States as refugees or asylees who are 16 years of age or older and for whom the goal is independent living. The local board or other child welfare agency having custody of the child shall not be required by the court to make reasonable efforts to reunite the child with a pare nt if the court finds that (A) the residual parental rights of the parent regarding a sibling of the child have previously been involuntarily terminated; (B) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a substantiall y similar law of any other state, the United States or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes murder or voluntary manslaughter, or a felony attempt, conspiracy or solicitation to commit any such offense, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent, a child with whom the parent resided at the time such offense occurred or the other parent of the child; (C) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a substantially similar law of any other state, the Un ited States or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent or a child with whom the parent resided at the time of such offense; or (D) based on clear and convincing evidence, the parent has subjected any child to aggravated circumstances, or abandoned a child under circumstances which would justify the termination of residual parental rights pursuant to subsection D of § 16.1-283. As used in this section: Aggravated circumstances means torture, chronic or severe abuse, or chronic or severe sexual abuse, if the victim of such conduct was a child of the parent or child with whom the parent resided at the time such conduct occurred, including the failure to protect such a child from such conduct, which conduct or failure to protect: (i) evinc es a wanton or depraved indifference to human life, or (ii) has resulted in the death of such a child or in serious bodily injury to such a child. Chronic abuse or chronic sexual abuse means recurring acts of physical abuse that place the childs health, safety and well-being at risk. Independent living has the meaning set forth in § 63.2-100. Serious bodily injury means bodily injury that involves substantial risk of death, ext reme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty. Severe abuse or severe sexual abuse may include an act or omission that occurred only once, but otherwise meets the definition of aggravated circumstances. Within 30 days of making a determination that reasonable efforts to reunite the child with the parents are not required, the court shall hold a permanency planning hear ing pursuant to § 16.1-282.1. C. A copy of t he entire foster care plan shall be sent by the court to the child, if he is 12 years of age or older; the guardian ad litem for the child, the attorney for the childs parents or for any other person standing in loco parentis at the time the board or child welf...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-282"><akn:num>§ 16.1-282</akn:num><akn:heading>Foster care review</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. In the case of a child who was the subject of a foster care plan filed with the court pursuant to § 16.1-281, a foster care review hearing shall be held within four months of the dispositional hearing at which the foster care plan pursuant to § 16.1-281 was r eviewed if the child (i) was placed through an agreement between the parents or guardians and the local board of social services where legal custody remains with the parents or guardians and such agreement has not been dissolved by court order or (ii) is under the legal custody of a local board of social services or a child welfare agency and has not had a petition to terminate parental rights granted, filed or ordered to be filed on the childs behalf; has not been placed in permanent foster care; o r is age 16 or over and the plan for the child is not independent living.Any interested party, including the parent, guardian or person who stood in loco parentis prior to the boards placement of the child or the boards or child welfare agency s assumption of legal custody, may file with the court the petition for a foster care review hearing hereinafter described at any time after the initial foster care placement of the child. However, the board or child welfare agency shall file the pet ition within three months of the dispositional hearing at which the foster care plan was reviewed pursuant to § 16.1-281. B. The petitio n shall: 1. Be fi led in the court in which the foster care plan for the child was reviewed and approved. Upon the order of such court, however, the petition may be filed in the court of the county or city in which the board or child welfare agency having legal custody or having placed the child has its principal office or where the child resides; 2. State, if such is reasonably obtainable, the current address of the childs parents and, if the child was in the custody of a person or persons standing in loco parentis at the time the board or child welfare agency obtained legal custody or the board placed the child, of such person or persons; 3. Describe the placement or placements provided for the child while in foster care and the services or programs offered to the child and his parents and, if applicable, the persons previ ously standing in loco parentis; 4. Describe the nature and frequency of the contacts between the child and his parents and, if applicable, the persons previously standing in loco parentis; 5. Set forth in detail the manner in which the foster care plan previously filed with the court was or was not complied with and the extent to which the goals thereof have been met; and 6. Set forth the disposition sought and the grounds therefor; however, in the case of a child who has attained age 16 and for whom the plan is independent living, the foster care plan sha ll be included and shall address the services needed to assist the child to transition from foster care to independent living. C. Upon receip t of the petition filed by the board, child welfare agency, or any interested party as provided in subsection B of this section, the court shall schedule a hearing to be held within 30 days if a hearing was not previously scheduled. The court shall provi de notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition to the following, each of whom shall be a party entitled to participate in the proceeding: 1. The c hild, if he is 12 years of age or older; 2. The attorney-at-law representing the child as guardian ad litem; 3. The childs parents and, if the child was in the custody of a person standing in loco parentis at the time the department obtained custody, such person or persons. No such notificat ion shall be required, however, if the judge certifies on the record that the identity of the parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable. An affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficie nt evidence of this fact, provided there is no other evidence before the court which would refute such an affidavit. If the parent or guardian of the child did not appear at the dispositional hearing and was not noticed to return for the foster care revi ew hearing in accordance with subsection F of § 16.1-281, the parent or guardian shall be summoned to appear at the foster care review hearing in accordance with § 16.1-263. The review hearing shall be held pursuant to this section although a paren t or guardian fails to appear and is not represented by counsel, provided personal or substituted service was made on the parent or guardian, or the court determines that such person cannot be found, after reasonable effort, or in the case of a person wh o is without the Commonwealth, the person cannot be found or his post office address cannot be ascertained after reasonable effort; 4. The foster parent or foster parents or other care providers of the child; 5. The petitioning board or child welfare agency; and 6. Such other persons as the court, in its discretion, may direct. The local board of social services or other child welfare agency shall identify for the court such other persons as have a legitimate interest in the hearing, including, but not limited to, preadoptive parents for a child in foster care. D. In cases in which a child is placed by the local board of social services or a licensed child-placing agency in a qualified residential treatment program as defined in § 16.1-228, the provisions of subsection E of § 16.1-281 shall apply to any hearing held pu rsuant to this section. E. At the conc lusion of the hearing, the court shall, upon the proof adduced in accordance with the best interests of the child and subject to the provisions of subsection F, enter any appropriate order of disposition consistent with the dispositional alternatives ava ilable to the court at the time of the original hearing. The court order shall state whether reasonable efforts, if applicable, have been made to reunite the child with his parents, guardian or other person standing in loco parentis to the child. Any ord er entered at the conclusion of this hearing that has the effect of achieving a permanent goal for the child by terminating residual parental rights pursuant to § 16.1-277.01, 16.1-277.02, 16.1-278.3, or 16.1-283; by placing the child in permanent fos ter care pursuant to clause (iv) of subsection A of § 16.1-282.1; or, if the child has attained the age of 16 years and the plan for the child is independent living, directing the board or agency to provide the necessary services to transition from fo ster care, pursuant to clause (v) of subsection A of § 16.1-282.1 shall state whether reasonable efforts have been made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the foster care plan and to complete the steps necessary to finalize the p ermanent placement of the child. F. Any order t ransferring custody of the child to a relative other than the childs prior family shall be entered only upon a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the relative is one who, after an investigation as directed by the court, (i) is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing an d has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect; and the order shall so state. The courts order transferring custody to a relative should further provide for, as appropriate, any terms and conditions which would promote the childs i nterest and welfare; ongoing provision of social services to the child and the childs custodian; and court review of the childs placement. G. The court s hall possess continuing jurisdiction over cases reviewed under this section for so long as a child remains in a foster care placement or, when a child is returned to his prior family subject to conditions imposed by the court, for so long as such conditi ons are effective. After the hearing required pursuant to subsection C, the court shall schedule a permanency planning hearing on the case to be held five months thereafter in accordance with § 16.1-282.1 or within 30 days upon the petition of any par ty entitled to notice in proceedings under this section when the judge determines there is good cause shown for such a hearing. However, in the case of a child who is the subject of an order that has the effect of achieving a permanent goal for the child by terminating residual parental rights pursuant to § 16.1-277.01, 16.1-277.02, 16.1-278.3, or 16.1-283; by placing the child in permanent foster care pursuant to clause (iv) of subsection A of § 16.1-282.1; or by directing the board or agency to provide the child with services to achieve independent living status, if the child has attained the age of 16 years, pursuant to clause (v) of subsection A of § 16.1-282.1, a permanency planning hearing within five months shall not be required and the court shall schedule a foster care review hearing to be held within 12 months of the entry of such order in accordance with the provisions of § 16.1-282.2.

The residua l parental rights of a parent or parents may be terminated by the court as hereinafter provided in a separate proceeding if the petition specifically requests such relief. No petition seeking termination of residual parental rights shall be accepted by t he court prior to the filing of a foster care plan, pursuant to § 16.1-281, which documents termination of residual parental rights as being in the best interests of the child. The court may hear and adjudicate a petition for termination of parental r ights in the same proceeding in which the court has approved a foster care plan which documents that termination is in the best interests of the child. The court may terminate the residual parental rights of one parent without affecting the rights of the other parent. The local board of social services or a licensed child-placing agency need not have identified an available and eligible family to adopt a child for whom termination of parental rights is being sought prior to the entry of an order termina ting parental rights.Any order terminating residual parental rights shall be accompanied by an order continuing or granting custody to a local board of social services or to a licensed child-placing agency or transferring custody to a person with a legit imate interest. However, in such cases the court shall give a consideration to granting custody to a person with a legitimate interest, and if custody is not granted to a person with a legitimate interest, the judge shall communicate to the parties the b asis for such decision either orally or in writing. An order continuing or granting custody to a local board of social services or to a licensed child-placing agency shall indicate whether that board or agency shall have the authority to place the child for adoption and consent thereto.The summons shall be served upon the parent or parents and the other parties specified in § 16.1-263. Written notice of the hearing shall also be provided to the foster parents of the child, a relative providing care f or the child, and any preadoptive parents for the child informing them that they may appear as witnesses at the hearing to give testimony and otherwise participate in the proceeding. The persons entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard need not be made parties to the proceedings. The summons or notice of hearing shall clearly state the consequences of a termination of residual parental rights. Service shall be made pursuant to § 16.1-264. A1. Any order transferring custody of the child to a person with a legitimate interest pursuant to subsection A shall be entered only upon a finding, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, that such person is one who, after an investigation as directed by the cou rt, (i) is found by the court to be willing and qualified to receive and care for the child; (ii) is willing to have a positive, continuous relationship with the child; (iii) is committed to providing a permanent, suitable home for the child; and (iv) is willing and has the ability to protect the child from abuse and neglect; and the order shall so state. The courts order transferring custody to a person with a legitimate interest should further provide, as appropriate, for any terms and conditions that would promote the childs interest and welfare. B. The residua l parental rights of a parent or parents of a child found by the court to be neglected or abused and placed in foster care as a result of (i) court commitment; (ii) an entrustment agreement entered into by the parent or parents; or (iii) other voluntary relinquishment by the parent or parents may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that: 1. The n eglect or abuse suffered by such child presented a serious and substantial threat to his life, health or development; and 2. It is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the childs safe return to his pa rent or parents within a reasonable period of time. In making this determination, the court shall take into consideration the efforts made to rehabilitate the parent or parents by any public or private social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitati ve agencies prior to the childs initial placement in foster care.Proof of any of the following shall constitute prima facie evidence of the conditions set forth in subdivision B 2: a. The parent or parents have a mental or emotional illness or intellectual disability of such severity that there is no reasonable expectation that such parent will be able to undertake responsibility for the care needed by the child in accordance with his age and stage of development; b. The parent or parents have habitually abused or are addicted to intoxicating liquors, narcotics or other dangerous drugs to the extent that proper parental ability has been seriou sly impaired and the parent, without good cause, has not responded to or followed through with recommended and available treatment which could have improved the capacity for adequate parental functioning; or c. The parent or parents, without good cause, have not responded to or followed through with appropriate, available and reasonable rehabilitative efforts on the part of social, medic al, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies designed to reduce, eliminate or prevent the neglect or abuse of the child. C. The residua l parental rights of a parent or parents of a child placed in foster care as a result of court commitment, an entrustment agreement entered into by the parent or parents or other voluntary relinquishment by the parent or parents may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that: 1. The p arent or parents have, without good cause, failed to maintain continuing contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child for a period of six months after the childs placement in foster care notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to communicate with the parent or parents and to strengthen the parent-child relationship. Proof that the parent or parents have failed without good cause to comm unicate on a continuing and planned basis with the child for a period of six months shall constitute prima facie evidence of this condition; or 2. The parent or parents, without good cause, have been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 12 months from the date the child was placed in foster care to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the childs foster care placement, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to such end. Pro of that the parent or parents, without good cause, have failed or been unable to make substantial progress towards elimination of the conditions which led to or required continuation of the childs foster care placement in accordance with their obliga tions under and within the time limits or goals set forth in a foster care plan filed with the court or any other plan jointly designed and agreed to by the parent or parents and a public or private social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agency shall constitute prima facie evidence of this condition. The court shall take into consideration the prior efforts of such agencies to rehabilitate the parent or parents prior to the placement of the child in foster care. D. The residua l parental rights of a parent or parents of a child found by the court to be neglected or abused upon the ground of abandonment may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that: 1. The c hild was abandoned under such circumstances that either the identity or the whereabouts of the parent or parents cannot be determined; and 2. The childs parent or parents, guardian, or relatives have not come forward to identify such child and claim a relationship to the child within three months following the issuance o f an order by the court placing the child in foster care; and 3. Diligent efforts have been made to locate the childs parent or parents, guardian, or relatives without avail. E. The residua l parental rights of a parent or parents of a child who is in the custody of a local board or licensed child-placing agency may be terminated by the court if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of t he child and that (i) the residual parental rights of the parent regarding a sibling of the child have previously been involuntarily terminated; (ii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a substantially simila r law of any other state, the United States or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes murder or voluntary manslaughter, or a felony attempt, conspiracy or solicitation to commit any such offense, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent, a child with whom the parent resided at the time such offense occurred or the other parent of the child; (iii) the parent has been convicted of an offense under the laws of the Commonwealth or a substantially similar law of any other state, the United S tates or any foreign jurisdiction that constitutes felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury or felony bodily wounding resulting in serious bodily injury or felony sexual assault, if the victim of the offense was a child of the parent or a child with whom the parent resided at the time of such offense; or (iv) the parent has subjected any child to aggravated circumstances.As used in this section:Aggravated circumstance s means tortur...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-284"><akn:num>§ 16.1-284</akn:num><akn:heading>When adult sentenced for juvenile offense</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A.

CASE NOTES Editors note. Some of the cases cited below were decided under former § 16.1-177.1. A juvenile is not immune from incarceration in jail. Rather, alternative and less harsh measures are preferred for the juvenile offender, but when the best interests of the child demand such confinement, that is available as an alternate discipline. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 10309 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 44 0 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1024 (1979). The jail sentence is merely an additional remedial alternative applied, if at all, to in corrigibles who have committed an offense which would be a felony or misdemeanor if they were adult. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 10309 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1024 (1979). When jail sentence may not be imposed.  Because the power of the court under this section to impose a jail sentence is limited in application to offenses committed by a juvenile which would have been ei ther misdemeanors or felonies had they been committed by an adult, a juvenile who has been accorded juvenile delinquent status for any other reason may not be sentenced to jail. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 10309 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1024 (1979). Finding of incorrigibility is procedural.  The statutory requirement of a finding of incorrigibility is a procedural prerequisite to the exercise of the courts general remedial powers which are granted elsewhere in the statute, and not a prerequisite to the jurisdiction of the court. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 10309 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1024 (1979). Effect of failure to record such finding formally.  Since the failure of a circuit court to formally record a finding of incorrigibility is a State procedural error in sentencing and not a prerequisite to the juris diction of the court, such failure is not a ground for federal habeas corpus relief. Hailey v. Dorsey, 580 F.2d 112, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 10309 (4th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 937, 99 S. Ct. 1282, 59 L. Ed. 2d 495, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1024 (1979). The finding of incorrigibility must be supported by evidence obtained by an investigatio n. Norwood v. City of Richmond, 203 Va. 886, 128 S.E.2d 425, 1962 Va. LEXIS 231 (1962). Trial courts discretion.  Trial court properly sentenced defendant to an indeterminate commitment as a serious juvenile offender because the terms child, juvenile, and  minor were interchangeable, the term may provided the trial court with discretion to commit a delinquent child to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) and, while defendant was over 18 by the time of trial, he nevertheless was subj ect to commitment to the DJJ because he was under the age of 18 at the time of the offense. Travezano v. Commonwealth, 2014 Va. App. LEXIS 336 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 7, 2014). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Good conduct credit.  Prisoner charged as a juvenile but sentenced under § 16.1-284 is eligible for the good conduct credit established in § 53.1-116 if the offense for which he is being sentenced would be classified as a misdemeanor if committed by an adult. However, if the offense for which he is being sentenced would be classified as a felony if committed by an adult, the good conduct credit established in § 53.1-116 does not apply. If the prisoner is sentenced for violating a court order or the terms of probation or parole, the nature of the underlying conviction (felony or misdemeanor) governs eligibility for good conduct credit. See opinion of Attorney General to The H onorable Robert L. Bushnell, Judge, Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, City of Martinsville and Counties of Henry and Patrick, 14-016, 2014 Va. AG LEXIS 21 (7/10/14). § 16.1-284.1. Placement in secure local facility. Text A. If a juveni le 14 years of age or older is found to have committed an offense which if committed by an adult would be punishable by confinement in a state or local correctional facility as defined in § 53.1-1, and the court determines (i) that the juvenile has no t previously been and is not currently adjudicated delinquent of a violent juvenile felony or found guilty of a violent juvenile felony, (ii) that the juvenile has not been released from the custody of the Department within the previous 18 months, (iii) that the interests of the juvenile and the community require that the juvenile be placed under legal restraint or discipline, and (iv) that other placements authorized by this title will not serve the best interests of the juvenile, then the court may or der the juvenile confined in a detention home or other secure facility for juveniles for a period not to exceed six months from the date the order is entered, for a single offense or multiple offenses. However, if the single offense or multiple offenses, which if committed by an adult would be punishable as a felony or a Class 1 misdemeanor, caused the death of any person, then the court may order the juvenile confined in a detention home or other secure facility for juveniles for a period not to exceed 12 months from the date the order is entered.The period of confinement ordered may exceed 30 calendar days if the juvenile has had an assessment completed by the secure facility to which he is ordered concerning the appropriateness of the placement. B. If the peri od of confinement in a detention home or other secure facility for juveniles is to exceed 30 calendar days, and the juvenile is eligible for commitment pursuant to subdivision A 14 of § 16.1-278.8, then the court shall order the juvenile committed to the Department, but suspend such commitment.

However, the thirty-six month limitation shall not apply in cases of commitment for an act of murder or manslaughter. The Department shall have the authority to discharge any juvenile or person from its custody, including releasing a juvenile or person to parole supervision, in accordance with policies and procedures esta blished by the State Board and with other provisions of law. Parole supervision programs shall be operated through the court services units established pursuant to § 16.1-233.

CASE NOTES Immunity of officials who determined length of confinement.  Department officials who determined the length of juveniles indeterminate confinement under former § 16.1-180 were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity and could not be sued for personal injuries suffered by victim assaulted by juvenile after his release. Harlow v. Clatterbuck, 230 Va. 490, 339 S.E.2d 181, 1986 Va. LEXIS 151 (1986). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ICE detainer is merely a request.  It does not create for a law enforcement agency either an obligation or legal authority to maintain custody of a prisoner who is otherwise eligible for immediate release from local or state custody. For that reason, an adult inmate or a juvenile inmate with a fixed release date should be released from custody on that date notwithstanding the agencys receipt of an ICE detainer. If a juvenile is being held purs uant to an indeterminate commitment, the Department of Juvenile Justice may exercise its discretion to hold the juvenile until ICE officials assume custody, provided the Department does not hold the juvenile longer than thirty-six continuous months or pa st his twenty-first birthday. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Ken Stolle, Sheriff, City of Virginia Beach, No. 14-067, 2015 Va. AG LEXIS 1 (1/5/15). Attorney General declined to change opinion in 2015 opinion No. 14-067, 2015 Va. AG LEXIS 1 (1/5/15), stating that issuance of an I-247A Immigration Detainer, whe ther or not accompanied by an I-200 Warrant for Arrest of Alien, does not obligate or authorize local law-enforcement to detain or arrest individuals for civil violations of immigration laws, unless the local law-enforcement agency has entered into a § 287(g) agreement with federal authorities authorizing and directing such action. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Scott Surovell, Member of the Virginia Senate, 18-050, 2019 Va. AG LEXIS 10 (4/12/19). § 16.1-285.1. Commitment of serious offenders. Text A. In the case of a juvenile fourteen years of age or older who has been found guilty of an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult, and either (i) the juvenile is on parole for an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult, (ii) the juv enile was committed to the state for an offense which would be a felony if committed by an adult within the immediately preceding twelve months, (iii) the felony offense is punishable by a term of confinement of greater than twenty years if the felony wa s committed by an adult, or (iv) the juvenile has been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense which if committed by an adult would be a felony punishable by a term of confinement of twenty years or more, and the circuit court, or the juvenile o r family court, as the case may be, finds that commitment under this section is necessary to meet the rehabilitative needs of the juvenile and would serve the best interests of the community, then the court may order the juvenile committed to the Departm ent of Juvenile Justice for placement in a juvenile correctional center for the period of time prescribed pursuant to this section.Alternatively, in order to determine if a juvenile, transferred from a juvenile and domestic relations district court to a circuit court pursuant to § 16.1-269.1, appropriately qualifies for commitment pursuant to this section, notwithstanding the inapplicability of the qualification criteria set forth in clauses (i) through (iv), the circuit court may consider the commit ment criteria set forth in subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 of subsection B as well as other components of the juveniles life history and, if upon such consideration in the opinion of the court the needs of the juvenile and the interests of the community wou ld clearly best be served by commitment hereunder, may so commit the juvenile. B. Prior to co mmitting any juvenile pursuant to this section, the court shall consider: 1. The j uveniles age; 2. The seriousness and number of the present offenses, including (i) whether the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, premeditated, or willful manner; (ii) whether the offense was against persons or property, with greater weight being given to offenses against persons, especially if death or injury resulted; (iii) whether the offense involved the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon by brandishing, displaying, threateni ng with or otherwise employing such weapon; and (iv) the nature of the juveniles participation in the alleged offense; 3. The record and previous history of the juvenile in this or any other jurisdiction, including (i) the number and nature of previous contacts with courts, (ii) the number and nature of p rior periods of probation, (iii) the number and nature of prior commitments to juvenile correctional centers, (iv) the number and nature of previous residential and community-based treatments, (v) whether previous adjudications and commitments were for d elinquent acts that involved the infliction of serious bodily injury, and (vi) whether the offense is part of a repetitive pattern of similar adjudicated offenses; and 4. The Departments estimated length of stay.Such commitment order must be supported by a determination that the interests of the juvenile and community require that the juvenile be pl aced under legal restraint or discipline and that the juvenile is not a proper person to receive treatment or rehabilitation through other juvenile programs or facilities. C. In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall specify a period of commitment not to exceed seven years or the juveniles twenty-first birthday, whichever shall occur first. The court may also order a period of determinate or indeterminate paro le supervision to follow the commitment but the total period of commitment and parole supervision shall not exceed seven years or the juveniles twenty-first birthday, whichever occurs first. D. Upon receip t of a juvenile committed under the provisions of this section, the Department shall evaluate the juvenile for the purpose of considering placement of the juvenile in an appropriate juvenile correctional center for the time prescribed by the committing c ourt. Such a placement decision shall be made based on the availability of treatment programs at the facility; the level of security at the facility; the offense for which the juvenile has been committed; and the welfare, age and gender of the juvenile. E. The court w hich commits the juvenile to the Department under this section shall have continuing jurisdiction over the juvenile throughout his commitment. The continuing jurisdiction of the court shall not prevent the Department from removing the juvenile from a juv enile correctional center without prior court approval for the sole purposes of routine or emergency medical treatment, routine educational services, or family emergencies. F. Any juvenil e committed under the provisions of this section shall not be released at a time earlier than that specified by the court in its dispositional order except as provided for in § 16.1-285.2. The Department may petition the committing court, notwithstand ing the terms of any plea agreement or commitment order, for a hearing as provided for in § 16.1-285.2 for an earlier release of the juvenile when good cause exists for an earlier rel...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_16.1-286"><akn:num>§ 16.1-286</akn:num><akn:heading>Cost of maintenance; approval of placement; semiannual review</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text A. When the co urt determines that the behavior of a child within its jurisdiction is such that it cannot be dealt with in the childs own locality or with the resources of his locality, the judge shall refer the child to the localitys family assessment and plan ning team for assessment and a recommendation for services. Based on this recommendation, the court may take custody and place the child, pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 5 of § 16.1-278.4 or subdivision A 13 b of § 16.1-278.8, in a privat e or locally operated public facility, or nonresidential program with funding in accordance with the Childrens Services Act (§ 2.2-5200 et seq.). No child shall be placed outside the Commonwealth by a court without first complying with the appropr iate provisions of Chapter 11 (§ 63.2-1100 et seq.) of Title 63.2 or with regulations of the State Board of Social Services relating to resident children placed out of the Commonwealth.The Board shall establish a per diem allowance to cover the cost o f such placements. This allowance may be drawn from funds allocated through the state pool of funds to the community policy and management team of the locality where the child resides as such residence is determined by the court. B. The court s ervice unit of the locality which made the placement shall be responsible for monitoring and supervising all children placed pursuant to this section. The court shall receive and review, at least semiannually, recommendations concerning the continued car e of each child in such placements. History History.

CASE NOTES A commitment review is not a reexamination of the underlying order of delinquency or com mitment but it permits the trial court to evaluate the utility of continuing commitment in the light of post-commitment developments and circumstances. Richardson v. Commonwealth, 28 Va. App. 389, 504 S.E.2d 884, 1998 Va. App. LEXIS 517 (1998). Sixty-day limitation.  Trial court properly concluded that it did not have the authority to review the juveniles commitment order where it had entered an order committing the juveni le to the state juvenile justice department, it had continued that commitment order at a second hearing, and at the third hearing it was pointed out to the trial court that the trial court could not again review the commitment order because more than 60 days had passed since entry of the initial commitment order, which contravened the express language of § 16.1-289 regarding review of commitment orders. Washington v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 278 (Va. Ct. App. July 24, 2007). Defendants §§ 16.1-289 and 16.1-285.2 challenges were not jurisdictional as they pertained to specific proceedings that were part of particular, individ ual cases before the court, and governed the trial courts authority to exercise its subject matter jurisdiction, not the subject of cases that could be heard and ruled upon by trial courts; subject matter jurisdiction was conferred by statute accordi ng to the subject of the case rather than according to a particular proceeding that might be one part of the case. Edmonds v. Commonwealth, 2013 Va. App. LEXIS 71 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2013). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Jurisdiction of circuit court.  Although a juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to hold a commitment review hearing more than sixty days after the original commitment hearing, Va. Sup. Ct. R. 3A:1 9 was applicable because the court convicted the juvenile of assault and battery of a family or household member, a misdemeanor. The case was properly before the circuit court, which had to hear the matter de novo, because the juvenile properly advised t he juvenile court of the juveniles intention to appeal the order and the court noted the intention to appeal and filed it in the clerks office. Commonwealth v. Giles, 87 Va. Cir. 320, 2013 Va. Cir. LEXIS 135 (Roanoke Dec. 10, 2013). § 16.1-289.1. Motions to reconsider orders for participation in continuing programs. Text When a person is ordered to participate in therapy, counseling or similar continuing programs, a motion may be filed with the court to reconsider the order, whether int erlocutory or final, or the terms and conditions of participation at any time after the order is entered.

A juvenile or person who violates an order of the juvenile court entered into pursuant to §§ 16.1-278.2 through 16.1-278.10 or § 16.1-284, who violates the conditions of his probation granted pursuant to § 16.1-278.5 or 16.1-278.8, or who violates the c onditions of his parole granted pursuant to § 16.1-285, 16.1-285.1 or 16.1-293, may be proceeded against for a revocation or modification of such order or parole status. A proceeding to revoke or modify probation, protective supervision or parole shal l be commenced by the filing of a petition. Except as otherwise provided, such petitions shall be screened, reviewed and prepared in the same manner and shall contain the same information as provided in §§ 16.1-260 and 16.1-262. The petition shall recite the date that the juvenile or person was placed on probation, under protective supervision or on parole and shall state the time and manner in which notice of the terms of probation, protective supervision or parole were given. B.

However, notwithstanding the contempt power of the court as provided in § 16.1-292, the court shall be limited in the actions it may take to those that the court may have taken at the time of the courts original disposition pursuant to §§ 16.1-278.2 through 16.1-278.10, except as hereinafter provided. C. In the even t that a child in need of supervision is found to have willfully and materially violated an order of the court or the terms of his probation granted pursuant to § 16.1-278.5, in addition to or in lieu of the dispositions specified in that section, the court may enter any of the following orders of disposition: 1.

Meaning of original proceedings.  The original proceedings referred to in the former last sentence of subsection A, which prior to its deletion by the General Assembly in 2001 provided tha t proceedings to revoke or modify probation, protective supervision or parole should be governed by the procedures, safeguards, rights and duties applicable to the original proceedings, were not the original adjudicatory proceedings in the prosecution, b ut the original dispositional proceedings. Commonwealth v. Pannell, 263 Va. 497, 561 S.E.2d 724, 2002 Va. LEXIS 53 (2002). The General Assemblys elimination of the sentence at issue as part of the 2001 amendments to § 16.1-291 does not require a finding that the General Assembl ys action was undertaken to alter the meaning of the phrase original proceedings. Commonwealth v. Pannell, 263 Va. 497, 561 S.E.2d 724, 2002 Va. LEXIS 53 (2002). Commitment to Department of Juvenile Justice.  Trial court did not err in finding, upon determining that the juvenile violated the juveniles probation, that the juvenile should be committed to the Departme nt of Juvenile Justice for an indeterminate period; although the juvenile argued that the original disposition and current offense for such a disposition had to be a felony or Class 1 misdemeanor and the juveniles case merely involved a probation violation, the underlying offense on which the juvenile received probation was a felony robbery, and, thus, commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice was permissible because it could have been made in originally deciding the juvenile s punishment even though the juveniles proceeding was indeed a probation revocation proceeding. Kerns v. Commonwealth, 2007 Va. App. LEXIS 175 (Va. Ct. App. May 1, 2007). Trial court had authority pursuant to §§ 16.1-278.8 and 16.1-291 to impose a suspended Department of Juvenile Justice commitment upon defendant juvenile s violation of the conditions of his probation because defendants underlying offense, larceny of animals, was a form of grand larceny, and it remained a felony each time defendant came before the trial court on a probation violation; the term, or iginal disposition in subsection B of § 16.1-291 plainly refers to the dispositional proceeding for the larceny of animals offense held under subsection A of § 16.1-278.8, in which the original conditions of probation were imposed.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing in this chapter shall deprive the court of its power to punish summarily for contempt for such acts as set forth in § 18.2-456, or to punish for contempt after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the contempt except that confinement in the case of a juvenile shall be in a secure facility for juveniles rather than in jail and shall not exceed a period of seven days for each offense. However, if the person violating the order was a juvenile at the time of the original act and is 18 years of age or older when the court enters a disposition for violation of the order, the judge may order confinement in jail. If a juvenile is found to have violated a court order as a status offender , any order of disposition of such violation confining the juvenile in a secure facility for juveniles shall (a) identify the valid court order that has been violated; (b) specify the factual basis for determining that there is reasonable cause to believ e that the juvenile has violated such order; (c) state the findings of fact that support a determination that there is no appropriate less restrictive alternative available to placing the juvenile in such a facility, with due consideration to the best in terest of the juvenile; (d) specify the length of time of such confinement, not to exceed seven days; and (e) include a plan for the juveniles release from such facility. Such order of confinement shall not be renewed or extended. B. Upon convic tion of any party for contempt of court in failing or refusing to comply with an order of a juvenile court for spousal support or child support under § 16.1-278.15, the court may commit and sentence such party to confinement in a jail, workhouse, city farm, or work squad as provided in §§ 20-61 and 20-62, for a fixed or indeterminate period or until the further order of the court. In no event, however, shall such sentence be imposed for a period of more than 12 months. The sum or sums as provid ed for in § 20-63 shall be paid as therein set forth, to be used for the support and maintenance of the spouse or the child or children for whose benefit such order or decree provided. C. Notwithstan ding the contempt power of the court, the court shall be limited in the actions it may take with respect to a child violating the terms and conditions of an order to those which the court could have taken at the time of the courts original dispositio n pursuant to §§ 16.1-278.2 through 16.1-278.10, except as hereinafter provided.

D. In the even t a child in need of services is found to have willfully and materially violated for a second or subsequent time the order of the court pursuant to § 16.1-278.4, the dispositional alternatives specified in subdivision A 9 of § 16.1-278.8 shall be a vailable to the court. E. In the even t that a child in need of supervision is found to have willfully and materially violated an order of the court pursuant to § 16.1-278.5, the court may enter any of the following orders of disposition: 1. Suspe nd the childs motor vehicle drivers license; 2. Order any such child 14 years of age or older to be (i) placed in a foster home, group home, or other nonsecure residential facility or, (ii) if the court finds that such placement is not likely to meet the childs needs, that all other treatment options in the community have been exhausted, and that secure placement is necessary in order to meet the childs service needs, detained in a secure facility for a period of time not t o exceed seven consecutive days for violation of any order of the court arising out of the same petition. The court shall state in its order for detention the basis for all findings required by this section.

From any fi nal order or judgment of the juvenile court affecting the rights or interests of any person coming within its jurisdiction, an appeal may be taken to the circuit court within 10 days from the entry of a final judgment, order or conviction and shall be he ard de novo. However, in a case arising under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (§ 20-88.32 et seq.), a party may take an appeal pursuant to this section within 30 days from entry of a final order or judgment. Protective orders issued pursuant to § 16.1-279.1 in cases of family abuse and orders entered pursuant to § 16.1-278.2 are final orders from which an appeal may be taken. B. Upon receip t of notice of such appeal the juvenile court shall forthwith transmit to the attorney for the Commonwealth a report incorporating the results of any investigation conducted pursuant to § 16.1-273, which shall be confidential in nature and made availa ble only to the court and the attorney for the defendant (i) after the guilt or innocence of the accused has been determined or (ii) after the court has made its findings on the issues subject to appeal. After final determination of the case, the report and all copies thereof shall be forthwith returned to such juvenile court. C. Where an ap peal is taken by a child on a finding that he or she is delinquent and on a disposition pursuant to § 16.1-278.8, trial by jury on the issue of guilt or innocence of the alleged delinquent act may be had on motion of the child, the attorney for the Co mmonwealth or the circuit court judge. If the alleged delinquent act is one which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony, the child shall be entitled to a jury of 12 persons. In all other cases, the jury shall consist of seven persons. If t he jury in such a trial finds the child guilty, disposition shall be by the judge pursuant to the provisions of § 16.1-278.8 after taking into consideration the report of any investigation made pursuant to § 16.1-237 or 16.1-273. C1. In any hea ring held upon an appeal taken by a child on a finding that he is delinquent and on a disposition pursuant to § 16.1-278.8, the provisions of § 16.1-302 shall apply mutatis mutandis, except in the case of trial by jury which shall be open. If proce edings in the circuit court are closed pursuant to this subsection, any records or portions thereof relating to such closed proceedings shall remain confidential. C2. Where an a ppeal is taken by a juvenile on a finding that he is delinquent and on a disposition pursuant to § 16.1-278.8 and the juvenile is in a secure facility pending the appeal, the circuit court, when practicable, shall hold a hearing on the merits of the c ase within 45 days of the filing of the appeal. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal from the juvenile court, the circuit court shall provide a copy of the order and a copy of the notice of appeal to the attorney for the Commonwealth within seven days af ter receipt of notice of an appeal. The time limitations shall be tolled during any period in which the juvenile has escaped from custody. A juvenile held continuously in secure detention shall be released from confinement if there is no hearing on the m erits of his case within 45 days of the filing of the appeal. The circuit court may extend the time limitations for a reasonable period of time based upon good cause shown, provided the basis for such extension is recorded in writing and filed among the papers of the proceedings. D. When an app eal is taken in a case involving termination of parental rights brought under § 16.1-283, the circuit court shall hold a hearing on the merits of the case within 90 days of the perfecting of the appeal. An appeal of the case to the Court of Appeals sh all take precedence on the docket of the Court. E. Where an ap peal is taken by an adult on a finding of guilty of an offense within the jurisdiction of the juvenile and domestic relations district court, the appeal shall be dealt with in all respects as is an appeal from a general district court pursuant to § § 16.1-132 through 16.1-137; however, where an appeal is taken by any person on a charge of nonsupport, the procedure shall be as is provided for appeals in prosecutions under Chapter 5 (§ 20-61 et seq.) of Title 20. F. In all othe r cases on appeal, proceedings in the circuit court shall be heard without a jury; however, hearing of an issue by an advisory jury may be allowed, in the discretion of the judge, upon the motion of any party. An appeal from an order of protection issued pursuant to § 16.1-279.1 shall be given precedence on the docket of the court over other civil appeals taken to the circuit court from the district courts and shall be assigned a case number within two business days of receipt of such appeal.If a par ty files an appeal of a district court order of protection entered pursuant to § 16.1-279.1, such notice of appeal shall be on a form prescribed by the Office of the Executive Secretary. The district court clerk shall contact the appellate court to de termine whether the hearing on the appeal shall be set by the appellate court on (i) a date scheduled by the district court clerk with the court, (ii) on the next docket call date, or (iii) a date set for district court appeals. Once the hearing date is set and the appeal documents have been transmitted, the appellate court shall have the parties served with notice of the appeal stating the date and time of the hearing in accordance with subdivision 1 of § 8.01-296. No such hearing on the appeal shal l be heard in the appellate court unless the appellee has been so served with such notice or notice has been waived by the non-moving party. G. Costs, taxe s and fees on appealed cases shall be assessed only in those cases in which a trial fee could have been assessed in the juvenile and domestic relations court and shall be collected in the circuit court, except that the appeal to circuit court of any case in which a fee either was or could have been assessed pursuant to § 16.1-69.48:5 shall also be in accordance with § 16.1-296.2. H. No appeal b ond shall be required of a party appealing from an order of a juvenile and domestic relations district court except for that portion of any order or judgment establishing a support arrearage or suspending payment of support during pendency of an appeal. In cases involving support, no appeal shall be allowed until the party applying for the same or someone for him gives bond, in an amount and with sufficient surety approved by the judge or by his clerk if there is one, to abide by such judgment as may be rendered on appeal if the appeal is perfected or, if not perfected, then to satisfy the judgment of the court in which it was rendered. Upon appeal from a conviction for failure to support or from a finding of civil or criminal contempt involving a fail ure to support, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may require the party applying for the appeal or someone for him to give bond, with or without surety, to insure his appearance and may also require bond in an amount and with sufficient surety to secure the payment of prospective support accruing during the pendency of the appeal. An appeal will not be perfected unless such appeal bond as may be required is filed within 30 days from the entry of the final judgment or order. However, no appeal bond shall be required of the Commonwealth or when an appeal is proper to protect the estate of a decedent, an infant, a convict or an insane person, or the interest of a county, city or town.If bond is furnished by or on behalf of any party again st whom judgment has been rendered for money, the bond shall be conditioned for the performance and satisfaction of such judgment or order as may be entered against the party on appeal, and for the payment of all damages which may be awarded against him in the appellate court. If the appeal is by a party against whom there is no recovery, the bond shall be conditioned for the payment of any damages as may be awarded against him on the appeal. The provisions of § 16.1-109 shall apply to bonds required pursuant to this subsection.This subsection shall not apply to release on bail pursuant to other subsections of this section or § 16.1-298. I. In all case s on appeal, the circuit court in the disposition of such cases shall have all the powers and authority granted by the chapter to the juvenile and domestic relations district court. Unless otherwise specifically provided by this Code, the circuit court j udge shall have the authority to appoint counsel for the parties and compensate such counsel in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 (§ 16.1-266 et seq.) of this chapter. J.

CASE NOTES Filing requirement gives juvenile court information concerning disposition of appeal.  Statutory filing requirement of § 16.1-297 permits the juvenile court to have information not only as to the disposition of the appeal, but also to have import ant information necessary to guide its actions should the juvenile be the subject of other proceedings within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. Austin v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 33, 590 S.E.2d 68, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 676 (2003), aff'd, 268 Va. 43 9, 604 S.E.2d 430, 2004 Va. LEXIS 149 (2004). Circuit court retains jurisdiction in the absence of a remand.  This section directs the circuit court to file a copy of its final judgment with the juvenile court in a delinquency appeal case. However, the language of the sta tute providing the circuit court with discretion to remand, demonstrates that the failure to do so does not result in the loss of jurisdiction by the circuit court. Austin v. Commonwealth, 42 Va. App. 33, 590 S.E.2d 68, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 676 (2003), af f'd, 268 Va. 439, 604 S.E.2d 430, 2004 Va. LEXIS 149 (2004). Trial courts final judgment.  Trial court did not render a final judgment in defendants marijuana possession case because it did not sentence defendant, and, thus, no final judgment existe d for the appellate court to review and the trial court prematurely transferred the case to the juvenile court after finding defendant guilty. Brown v. Commonwealth, 2003 Va. App. LEXIS 141 (Va. Ct. App. Mar. 18, 2003). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Court lacked authority to transfer.  Circuit Court for the City of Norfolk could not transfer a case to the Norfolk Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court or the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake after finding that the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction since: (1) § 16.1-297 allowed the circuit court to remand a case to the district court upon the rendition of final judgment upon an appeal, but the parties mo tions to amend child and spousal support were not before the circuit court on appeal and the the circuit courts order was not a final judgment; (2) § 20-79(c) did not apply as the circuit court was not making an order regarding support; and (3) § 20-88.49 had been construed as a venue statute.

Except as p rovided herein, a petition for or the pendency of an appeal or writ of error shall not suspend any judgment, order or decree of the juvenile court nor operate to discharge any child concerned or involved in the case from the custody of the court or other person, institution or agency to which the child has been committed unless so ordered by the judge of the juvenile court, the judge of a circuit court or directed in a writ of supersedeas by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court or a judge or justic e thereof. B. The judgmen t, order or decree of the juvenile court shall be suspended upon a petition for or the pendency of an appeal or writ of error: 1. In ca ses of delinquency in which the final order of the juvenile court is pursuant to subdivision A 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, or 15 of § 16.1-278.8. 2. In cases involving a child and any local ordinance. 3. In cases involving any person over the age of 18 years.Such suspension as is provided for in this subsection shall not apply to (i) an order for support of a spouse, parent or child or to a preliminary protective order issued pursuant to § 16.1-253, (ii) an order disposing of a motion to reconsider relating to participation in continuing programs pursuant to § 16.1-289.1, (iii) a protective order in cases of family abuse issued pursuant to § 16.1-279.1, including a protective order required by § 16.1-253.2, or a protective order entered in conjunction with a disposition pursuant to § 16.1-278.2, 16.1-278.4, 16.1-278.5, 16.1-278.6, 16.1-278.8, or 16.1-278.14, (iv) a protective order issued pursuant to § 19.2-152.10, including a protective order required by § 18.2-60.4, or (v) an order pertaining to the custody, visitation, or placement of a minor child, unless so ordered by the judge of a circuit court or directed in a writ of supersedeas by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court. C. In cases wh ere the order of the juvenile court is suspended pursuant to subsection B hereof or by order of the juvenile court or the circuit court, bail may be required as provided for in § 16.1-135. D. If an appea l to the circuit court is withdrawn in accordance with § 16.1-106.1, the judgment, order, or decree rendered by the juvenile court shall have the same legal effect as if no appeal had been noted, except as to the disposition of any bond in circuit cou rt or as modified by the circuit court pursuant to subsection F of § 16.1-106.1. If an appeal is withdrawn, any court-appointed counsel or court-appointed guardian ad litem shall, absent further order of the court, be relieved of any further obligatio n respecting the matter for which they were appointed. E. Except as t o matters pending on the docket of a circuit court as of July 1, 2008, all orders that were entered by a juvenile and domestic relations district court prior to July 1, 2008, and appealed to a circuit court, where the appeal was withdrawn, shall have the same effect as if no appeal had been noted.

Acts 1993, c. 929, cl. 3, as amended by Acts 1994, c. 564, cl. 1, and Acts 1996, c. 616, cl. 3, provides that the amendment to this section by Acts 1993, c. 929, cl. 1, shall become effective June 1, 1998, only if state funds are provided by the General Assembly sufficient to provide adequate resources, including all local costs, for the court to carry out the purposes of this act and to fulfill its mission t o serve children and families of the Commonwealth. The funding was not provided. The 1998 amendment, in subsection B, in subdivision 3, in the second paragraph, in clause (iii), inserted the language beginning or a protective order and ending § 16.1-278.8. The 2008 amendments. The 2008 amendment by c. 706, in subdivision B 3, deleted or at the end of clause (iii), inserted or at the end of clause (iv) and inserted clause (v) and made minor related changes; and added subsections D and E. The 2013 amendments. The 2013 amendments by cc. 73 and 97 are identical, and in subsection B, substituted 18 for eighteen near the end of subdivision B 3, and in the c oncluding paragraph, inserted including a protective order required by § 16.1-253.2 and or 16.1-278.14 in clause (iii) and including a protective order required by § 18.2-60.4 in clause (iv). CASE NOTES Construction.  Subsection D of § 16.1-298 does not speak to, or have any bearing on, the circuit courts powers to enforce its own orders regarding conduct that occurred b efore the circuit court. Torchiani v. Senske, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (Va. Ct. App. June 2, 2020). This section, enacted to provide continuity and stability in cases of children who are the subjects of litigation, provides in part that a petition for, or the pendency of, an appeal shall not suspend the juvenile courts order or affect the custody of a child unless so ordered by a judge of the juvenile court, a circuit court or th e appellate court. Walker v. Department of Pub. Welfare, 223 Va. 557, 290 S.E.2d 887, 1982 Va. LEXIS 238 (1982). Limited jurisdiction of district court after filing for divorce where spousal support in issue.  When a suit for divorce has been filed and spousal support is at issue, the district court is divested of jurisdiction to enter any further decrees or orders rela ting to support except to enforce its orders entered prior to an order of the circuit court. Martin v. Bales, 7 Va. App. 141, 371 S.E.2d 823, 5 Va. Law Rep. 208, 1988 Va. App. LEXIS 90 (1988). District court orders remain in effect where nonsuit is sought in circuit court.  By seeking a nonsuit in the circuit court, the mother has placed the proceeding back to where it was prior to the appeal to the circuit court. It is as if no appe al to the circuit court was taken. Hence, the custody order of the district court remains in effect, and that court retains jurisdiction to enforce its orders. Hasty v. Hasty, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 431 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 1993). No suspension of juvenile court order.  This section provides that an appeal shall not suspend any order of the juvenile court unless ordered by the judge of the juvenile court or circuit court, or dire cted by an appellate court. Hasty v. Hasty, 1993 Va. App. LEXIS 431 (Va. Ct. App. Sept. 14, 1993). Prior court orders remained in place.  Although the mother appealed the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District (JDR) Court orders, the statute provided that the JDR court orders remained in place pen ding the appeal, and thus the department was not required to offer additional services to mother after the JDR court transferred custody of the children. Cooke v. City of Newport News Dep't of Human Servs., 2019 Va. App. LEXIS 29 (Va. Ct. App. Feb. 5, 20 19). Dismissal proper.  Circuit court properly dismissed a fathers complaint to amend custody and visitation because, while the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the father s refiled appeals, the parties circumstances changed during the pendency of the nonsuit, the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the fathers refiled appeals and did the only thing it could do. Barrett v. Minor, 2015 Va. App. LEXIS 165 (Va. Ct. App. May 12, 2015). Withdrawn appeals final.  Circuit court erred in holding that the juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR) could not amend an order while the appeal of a related case was pendi ng because the order was different from those on appeal; the withdrawn appeals of JDR court orders became final upon their withdrawal and binding on the parties, and a fathers complaint was barred by the withdrawn appeals because of their res judicat a effect when their withdrawal made them final and binding. Minor v. Barrett, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 263 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 11, 2016). When a father withdrew his appeals the orders became final and were binding on the parties; accordingly, while the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the fathers refiled appeals, the parties circumstances changed during the pendency of the nonsuit because the withdrawn orders became final and binding on the parties, thereby superseding an order that the refiled nonsuits were seeking to modify. Min or v. Barrett, 2016 Va. App. LEXIS 263 (Va. Ct. App. Oct. 11, 2016). Appeal did not render order for fe es void.  Statute stated that any court judgments on child support were in full effect upon appellants withdrawal of his appeal to the circuit court; the statute did no t render the circuit court orders regarding legal fees incurred by the non-appealing party void ab initio and thus unenforceable. The legal fees appellee incurred responding to the appeal did not disappear when appellant withdrew that appeal, and thus ap pellee was entitled to seek enforcement of those orders and be compensated for those costs. Torchiani v. Senske, 2020 Va. App. LEXIS 161 (Va. Ct. App. June 2, 2020). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Support orders not suspended on appe al.  Section 16.1-298, which governs appeals from juvenile court, makes appeals in cases involving child support fundamentally different from appeals from general dist rict court in civil cases. While an appeal from general district court in a civil case means that the order and judgment of the lower court are annulled, § 16.1-298 B provides that juvenile court orders for support of a spouse, parent, or child are no t suspended on appeal. Commonwealth v. Neal, 58 Va. Cir. 205, 2002 Va. Cir. LEXIS 142 (Richmond Feb. 13, 2002). Portions of suppor t arrearage orders appealable.  Portions of orders establishing a support arrearage are appealable under subsection H of § 16.1-298. Commonwealth v. Neal, 58 Va.

Whenever fingerprints are taken, they shall be maintained separately from adult records and a copy shall be filed with the juvenile court on forms provided by the Central Crimina l Records Exchange. B.

C. If a petiti on or warrant is not filed against a juvenile whose fingerprints or photographs have been taken in connection with an alleged violation of law, the fingerprint card, all copies of the fingerprints and all photographs shall be destroyed 60 days after fing erprints were taken. If a juvenile charged with a delinquent act other than a violent juvenile felony or a crime ancillary thereto is found not guilty, or in any other case resulting in a disposition for which fingerprints are not required to be forwarde d to the Central Criminal Records Exchange, the court shall order that the fingerprint card, all copies of the fingerprints and all photographs be destroyed within six months of the date of disposition of the case.

CASE NOTES Impeachment with evidence of prior juvenile adjudications.  A prosecutor may not impeach the defendant with evidence of prior juvenile adjudications, and the attempt to so cross-examine defendant was not harmless error. La vinder v. Commonwealth, 395 S.E.2d 211, 7 Va. Law Rep. 118, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 136 (Va. Ct. App. 1990). Admissibility of juvenile records in sexually violent predator proceedings.  Circuit court erred when it excluded juvenile records in a sexually violent predator proceeding under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA), § 37.2-900 et seq., because the 1996 amendment to § 16.1-306, providing retention of juvenile records for certain offenses, came into effect before the inmates 29th birthday, the date on which the right to record destruction would otherwise have vested. Thus, t he inmate did not have a due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to have his juvenile records destroyed and considered inadmissible in the SVPA proceedings.

CASE NOTES Policy of section.  Statutes of this character originated in a policy not to permit the same uses to be made of records of juvenile courts as are frequently made of criminal records of courts of general jurisdiction, for the reason that juvenile proceedings are corrective in nature rather than penal. The child is looked upon not as a bad man, who should be punished, but as an erring child who needs help. Kiracofe v. Commonwealth, 19 8 Va. 833, 97 S.E.2d 14, 1957 Va. LEXIS 146 (1957). Predicate conviction for 18 U.S.C.S. § 922(g)(1).  Dismissal of indictments for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment in violation of 18 U. S.C.S. § 922(g)(1) was affirmed, where the predicate convictions were juvenile adjudications in Virginia state court; a juvenile adjudication was not a conviction under Virginia law, so such an adjudication could not serve as the underlying conviction . United States v. Walters, 359 F.3d 340, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 3021 (4th Cir. 2004). Conviction for purpose s of 18 U.S.C.S. § 922(g)(1).  The clearest general statement of Virginia law on whether an adjudication of juvenile delinquency qualifies as a conviction for purposes of 18 U.S.C.S. § 922(g)(1) is § 16.1-308. United States v. Walters, 359 F.3d 340, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 3021 (4th Cir. 2004). Impeachment with evidence of prior juvenile adjudications.  A prosecutor may not impeach the defendant with evidence of prior juvenile adjudications, and the attempt to so cross-examine defendant was not harmless error. La vinder v. Commonwealth, 395 S.E.2d 211, 7 Va. Law Rep. 118, 1990 Va. App. LEXIS 136 (Va. Ct. App. 1990). Interaction with § 18.2-308.2.  Regarding defendants unlawful possession of a firearm, any ambiguity over juvenile protections between this section and § 18.2-308.2, which applies to adul t felons and juveniles of a certain age convicted of acts that would be felonies for adults, must be resolved in favor of section 18.2-308.2, which is the more specific statute and prevails over the general statute concerning collateral disabilities for convicted juveniles. Griffin v. Commonwealth, 33 Va. App. 413, 533 S.E.2d 653, 2000 Va. App. LEXIS 649 (2000). Juvenile conviction under Virginia law was not a criminal conviction for purposes of defining prohibited person under 18 U.S.C.S. § 922 and U.S. Senten cing Guidelines Manual § 2K2.1(a)(6); the fact that defendant was considered a prohibited person under § 18.2-308.2 A was irrelevant for purposes of a federal firearms conviction. United States v. Bugg, 248 F. Supp. 2d 507, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3215 (E.D. Va. 2003). Questioning witness as to adjudication as delinquent not permitted.  In view of the provisions of the juvenile statutes no error was committed in refusing to allow defendants counsel to ask a witness for the prosecution whether he had ever been adjudged a juvenile delinquent in a proceeding in a juvenile court involving a felonious offense or larceny, the purpose of the question being to affect the credibility of the witness. Questions which refer to the disposition of the chi ld in a juvenile court are not permitted. Kiracofe v. Commonwealth, 198 Va. 833, 97 S.E.2d 14, 1957 Va. LEXIS 146 (1957). But, see McCain v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 81, 360 S.E.2d 854, 4 Va. Law Rep. 659, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 220 (1987). Cross examination as to juvenile record where witness found guilty by juvenile court.  Once it was established that defendant had the right to cross-examine co-defendant by referring to his juvenile record, the right included an effective cross exam ination and not one limited so as to convey to the jury that within the purview of the juvenile court law was something other than a finding of guilty. The trial court erred in limiting the cross-examination of co-defendant, the Commonwealths chief witness, to questions which did not include not innocent or guilty because the phrase within the purview of the juvenile court law did not effectively convey to the jury that co-defendant had, in fact, been found guilty  by the juvenile court. McCain v. Commonwealth, 5 Va. App. 81, 360 S.E.2d 854, 4 Va. Law Rep. 659, 1987 Va. App. LEXIS 220 (1987). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Disqualification from employment.  Although an individual who was adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile for an enumerated offense is not automatically disqualified from service as a law-enforcement officer pursuant to § 15.2-1705, state and local law-enforcement agencies are authorized to consider certain aspects of juvenile adjudications as a basis for denying employment.

CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Construction as to school boards.  When the statutes are read in light of the supervisory power provided by the constitutional provision, they do not act to limit the school boards authority or duties, and instead they reiterated the school boards authority to investigate and discipline its juvenile students; it appeared that the school board would be an institution with a legitimate interest in the video of school bus misconduct, and that its access to the video should not be barred by the statute.

Notwithstan ding any other provision of this article, where consideration of public interest requires, the judge shall make available to the public the name and address of a juvenile and the nature of the offense for which a juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent (i) for an act which would be a Class 1, 2, or 3 felony, forcible rape, robbery or burglary or a related offense as set out in Article 2 (§ 18.2-89 et seq.) of Chapter 5 of Title 18.2 if committed by an adult or (ii) in any case where a juvenile is se ntenced as an adult in circuit court. B. 1. a. At any time prior to disposition, if a juvenile charged with a delinquent act whi ch would constitute a felony if committed by an adult, or held in custody by a law-enforcement officer, or held in a secure facility pursuant to such charge becomes a fugitive from justice, the attorney for the Commonwealth or, upon notice to the Commonw ealths attorney, the Department of Juvenile Justice or a locally operated court services unit, may, with notice to the juveniles attorney of record, petition the court having jurisdiction of the offense to authorize public release of the juvenile s name, age, physical description and photograph, the charge for which he is sought or for which he was adjudicated and any other information which may expedite his apprehension. Upon a showing that the juvenile is a fugitive and for good cause, the court shall order release of this information to the public. If a juvenile charged with a delinquent act that would constitute a felony if committed by an adult, or held in custody by a law-enforcement officer, or held in a secure facility pursuant to su ch charge becomes a fugitive from justice at a time when the court is not in session, the Commonwealths attorney, the Department of Juvenile Justice, or a locally operated court services unit may, with notice to the juveniles attorney of record, authorize the public release of the juveniles name, age, physical description and photograph, the charge for which he is sought, and any other information which may expedite his apprehension. b.

It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to (i) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status of fenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (ii) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including t he victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (iii) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting the ir return; (iv) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (v) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (vi) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (vii) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or ju venile justice agency that has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (viii) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (ix) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (x) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by a uthorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (xi) monitor compliance with rules go verning interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (xii) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (x iii) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where conc urrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business.

Article 14.1. Serious or Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program. -360§ 16.1-330.1. Serious or Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program; definition; disclosure of information; penalty. -360§ 16.1-330.2. Immunity. § 16.1-330.1. Serious or Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program; definition; disclosure of information; penalty. Text A. For purpose s of this article, a serious or habitual juvenile offender is a minor who has been (i) adjudicated delinquent or convicted of murder or attempted murder, armed robbery, any felony sexual assault or malicious wounding, or a felony violation of a gang-rela ted crime pursuant to Article 2.1 (§ 18.2-46.1 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 18.2, or (ii) convicted at least three times for offenses which would be felonies or Class 1 misdemeanors if committed by an adult. Qualifying convictions or adjudications s hall include only those for offenses occurring after July 1, 1993. However, any Serious or Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP) in existence on July 1, 1993, shall be deemed to have been established pursuant to this article and, notwit hstanding the limitations of this subsection, may continue to supervise persons who were being supervised on July 1, 1993. Juvenile offenders under SHOCAP supervision at the time of their eighteenth birthday who have been committed to state care pursuant to subdivision A 14 of § 16.1-278.8 or § 16.1-285.1 may continue to be supervised by SHOCAP until their twenty-first birthday. B. The Serious or Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP) is a multidisciplinary interagency case management and information sharing system which enables the juvenile and criminal justice system, schools, and social service agencies to make more inform ed decisions regarding juveniles who repeatedly commit serious criminal and delinquent acts. Each SHOCAP shall supervise serious or habitual juvenile offenders in the community as well as those under probation or parole supervision and enhance current co nduct control, supervision and treatment efforts to provide a more coordinated public safety approach to serious juvenile crime, increase the opportunity for success with juvenile offenders and assist in the development of early intervention strategies. C. Any county or city in the Commonwealth may by action of its governing body establish a SHOCAP committee. The committee shall consist of representatives from local law enforcement, schools, attorneys for the Commonwealth, juvenile court services, juvenile detention centers or group homes, mental and medical health agencies, state and local children and family service agencies, and the Department of Juvenile Justice. Any county or city which establishes a SHOCAP committee shall, within 45 days of such action, notify the Department of Criminal Justice Services. The Department shall issue statewide SHOCAP guidelines and provide technical assistance to local jurisdictions on implementation of SHOCAP. D. Each SHOCAP committee shall share among its members and with other SHOCAP committees otherwise confidential information on identified serious or habitual juvenile offenders. Every person, including members of the SHOCAP committee, who is to receive confidential inf ormation pursuant to this article shall maintain the confidentiality of that information.All records and reports concerning serious or habitual juvenile offenders made available to members of a SHOCAP committee and all records and reports identifying an individual offender which are generated by the committee from such reports shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed, except as specifically authorized by this article or other applicable law. Disclosure of the information may be made to other sta ff from member agencies as authorized by the SHOCAP committee for the furtherance of case management, community supervision, conduct control and locating of the offender for the application and coordination of appropriate services. Staff from the member agencies who receive such information will be governed by the confidentiality provisions of this article. The staff from the member agencies who will qualify to have access to the SHOCAP information shall be limited to those individuals who provide direc t services to the offender or who provide community conduct control and supervision to the offender.The provisions of this article authorizing information sharing between and among SHOCAP committees shall take precedence over the provisions of (i) Articl e 12 (§ 16.1-299 et seq.) of Chapter 11 of this title governing dissemination of court and law-enforcement records concerning juveniles, (ii) Article 5 (§ 22.1-287 et seq.) of Chapter 14 of Title 22.1 governing access to pupil records, (iii) Title 37.2 and any regulations enacted pursuant thereto governing access to juvenile mental health records, and (iv) Title 63.2 and any regulations enacted pursuant thereto governing access to records concerning treatments or services provided to a juvenile. E. It shall be unlawful for any staff person from a member agency to disclose or to knowingly permit, assist or encourage the unauthorized release of any identifying information contained in any reports or records received or generated by a SHOCAP committee. A violati on of this subsection shall be punishable as a Class 3 misdemeanor. History History. 1993, cc. 465, 927; 1996, c. 293; 1999, c. 508; 2004, c. 418. Annotations Cross references.

The individuals to be married are mature enough to make such a decision to marry; 3. The marriage will not endanger the safety of the minor. In making this finding, the court shall consider (i) the age difference between the parties intending to be married; (ii) whethe r either individual to be married has a criminal record containing any conviction of an act of violence, as defined in § 19.2-297.1, or any conviction of a barrier crime, as defined in § 19.2-392.02; and (iii) any history of violence between the pa rties to be married; and 4.

However, such a minor shall not be eligible for mandatory outpatient treatment.In conducting an evaluation of a minor who has been properly detained, if the evaluator finds, irrespective of the fact that the minor has been detained, that the minor meets the criteria for involuntary commi tment in this section, the evaluator shall recommend that the minor meets the criteria for involuntary commitment.If the parent or parents with whom the minor resides are not willing to approve the proposed commitment, the court shall order inpatient tre atment only if it finds, in addition to the criteria specified in this section, that such treatment is necessary to protect the minors life, health, safety, or normal development. If a special justice believes that issuance of a removal order or prot ective order may be in the childs best interest, the special justice shall report the matter to the local department of social services for the county or city where the minor resides.Upon finding that the best interests of the minor so require, the c ourt may enter an order directing either or both of the minors parents to comply with reasonable conditions relating to the minors treatment.If the minor is committed to inpatient treatment, such placement shall be in a mental health facility for inpatient treatment designated by the community services board which serves the political subdivision in which the minor was evaluated pursuant to § 16.1-342. If the community services board does not provide a placement recommendation at the hearing, the minor shall be placed in a mental health facility designated by the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.When a minor has been involuntarily committed pursuant to this section, the judge shall determine, after consideration o f information provided by the minors treating mental health professional and any involved community services board staff regarding the minors dangerousness, whether transportation shall be provided by the sheriff or may be provided by an alternat ive transportation provider, including a parent, family member, or friend of the minor, a representative of the community services board, a representative of the facility at which the minor was detained pursuant to a temporary detention order, or other a lternative transportation provider with personnel trained to provide transportation in a safe manner. If the judge determines that transportation may be provided by an alternative transportation provider, the judge may consult with the proposed alternati ve transportation provider either in person or via two-way electronic video and audio or telephone communication system to determine whether the proposed alternative transportation provider is available to provide transportation, willing to provide trans portation, and able to provide transportation in a safe manner. If the judge finds that the proposed alternative transportation provider is available to provide transportation, willing to provide transportation, and able to provide transportation in a sa fe manner, the judge may order transportation by the proposed alternative transportation provider. In all other cases, the judge shall order transportation by the sheriff of the jurisdiction where the minor is a resident unless the sheriffs office of that jurisdiction is located more than 100 road miles from the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings took place. In cases where the sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the minor is a resident is more than 100 road miles from the nearest boundary of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings took place, it shall be the responsibility of the sheriff of the latter jurisdiction to transport the minor.If the judge determines that the minor requires transportation by the sheriff, the sheriff, as specified in this section shall transport the minor to the proper facility. In no event shall transport commence later than six hours after notification to the sheriff or alternative transportation provider of the judges order.If an alter native transportation provider providing transportation of a minor becomes unable to continue providing transportation of the minor at any time after taking custody of the minor, the primary law-enforcement agency for the jurisdiction in which the altern ative transportation provider is located at the time he becomes unable to continue providing transportation shall take custody of the minor and shall transport the minor to the proper facility. In such cases, if the alternative transportation provider or iginally authorized to provide transportation is a person other than the minors parent, the alternative transportation provider shall notify the minors parent (a) that the primary law-enforcement agency for the jurisdiction in which he is located has taken custody of the minor and is transporting the minor to the facility of temporary detention and (b) of the name of the law-enforcement officer providing transportation of the minor.No person who provides alternative transportation pursuant to th is section shall be liable to the person being transported for any civil damages for ordinary negligence in acts or omissions that result from providing such alternative transportation.

If, at any time after the attorney for the juvenile has been retained or appointed pursuant to a delinquency proceeding and before the end of trial, the court finds, sua sponte or upon hearing evidence or representations of counsel for the juvenile or the attorney for the Commonwealth, that there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile lacks substantial capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist his attorney in his own defense, the court shall order that a competency evaluation be perfo rmed by at least one psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, licensed professional counselor, licensed clinical social worker, or licensed marriage and family therapist, who is qualified by training and experience in the forensic evaluation of juveniles.The Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services shall approve the training and qualifications for individuals authorized to conduct juvenile competency evaluations and provide restoration services to juveniles pursuant to this article. The Commissioner shall also provide all juvenile courts with a list of guidelines for the court to use in the determination of qualifying individuals as experts in matters relating to juvenile competency and restoration. B. The evaluat ion shall be performed on an outpatient basis at a community services board or behavioral health authority, juvenile detention home, or juvenile justice facility unless the court specifically finds that (i) the results of the outpatient competency evalua tion indicate that hospitalization of the juvenile for evaluation of competency is necessary or (ii) the juvenile is currently hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital. If one of these findings is made, the court, under authority of this subsection, may or der the juvenile sent to a hospital designated by the Commissioner of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services as appropriate for the evaluation of juveniles against whom a delinquency petition has been filed. C. The court s hall require the attorney for the Commonwealth to provide to the evaluators appointed under subsection A any information relevant to the evaluation, including, but not limited to (i) a copy of the warrant or petition; (ii) the names and addresses of the attorney for the Commonwealth, the attorney for the juvenile, and the judge ordering the evaluation; and (iii) information about the alleged offense. The court shall require the attorney for the juvenile to provide to the evaluator only the psychiatric r ecords and other information that is deemed relevant to the evaluation of competency. The moving party shall provide the evaluator a summary of the reasons for the evaluation request. All information required by this subsection shall be provided to the e valuator within 96 hours of the issuance of the court order requiring the evaluation and when applicable, shall be submitted prior to admission to the facility providing the inpatient evaluation. If the 96-hour period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or ot her legal holiday, the 96 hours shall be extended to the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

If the appointed evaluator or the director of the community services board, behavioral health authority, hospital, or private evaluator is unable to conduct the evaluation, he shall inform the court on the acknowledgement form. D. If the juve nile is hospitalized under the provisions of subsection B, the juvenile shall be hospitalized for such time as the director of the hospital deems necessary to perform an adequate evaluation of the juveniles competency, but not to exceed 10 days from the date of admission to the hospital. All evaluations shall be completed and the report filed with the court within 14 days of receipt by the evaluator of all information required under subsection C. E. Upon comple tion of the evaluation, the evaluator shall promptly and in no event exceeding 14 days after receipt of all required information submit the report in writing to the court and the attorneys of record concerning (i) the juveniles capacity to understand the proceedings against him; (ii) his ability to assist his attorney; and (iii) his need for services in the event he is found incompetent, including a description of the suggested necessary services and least restrictive setting to assist the juvenile in restoration to competency. No statements of the juvenile relating to the alleged offense shall be included in the report. F. After recei ving the report described in subsection E, the court shall promptly determine whether the juvenile is competent to stand trial for adjudication or disposition. A hearing on the juveniles competency is not required unless one is requested by the attor ney for the Commonwealth or the attorney for the juvenile or when required under § 16.1-357 B. If a hearing is held, the party alleging that the juvenile is incompetent shall bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the juvenile s incompetency. The juvenile shall have the right to notice of the hearing and the right to personally participate in and introduce evidence at the hearing.If the juvenile is otherwise able to understand the charges against him and assist in his defe nse, a finding of incompetency shall not be made based solely on any or all of the following: (i) the juveniles age or developmental factors, (ii) the juveniles claim to be unable to remember the time period surrounding the alleged offense, or (i ii) the fact that the juvenile is under the influence of medication.
