Portsmouth Gas Co ., 132 Va. 480, 112 S.E. 792, 1922 Va. LEXIS 42 (1922). Nature of municipal power.  The power of a municipal corporation to control and regulate the use of its streets is an inherent and continuing one, subject only to the limitation that it must act in good faith, and the regulation be reasonable, and not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously. Of this power it cannot divest itself by contract or otherwise, and although it may have granted to a street railway company the right to lay a double trac k in its streets, this right may be recalled with impunity, whenever the public interest requires it. This is in accord with this section. Newport News &amp; Old Point Ry. &amp; Elec. Co. v. Hampton Roads Ry. &amp; Elec. Co., 102 Va. 795, 47 S.E. 839, 1904 Va.

Consent may be presumed.  No particular mode of manifesting the municipal consent to the use of the streets of the municipality by a public utility is in general prescribed, and in the abs ence of a prescribed form, such consent may be either express or implied. Consent may be presumed where the streets of the municipality have been used for a long period of years under such circumstances as amount to a claim of right. Commonwealth ex rel. City of Portsmouth v. Portsmouth Gas Co., 132 Va. 480, 112 S.E. 792, 1922 Va. LEXIS 42 (1922). And there is a presumption of co ntinuance.  A franchise once granted to use the streets, with no limit as to time, and no right of revocation reserved, is usually construed as perpetual, after acceptance an d use, so long as a grantee observes the conditions under which the grant is made. Commonwealth ex rel. City of Portsmouth v. Portsmouth Gas Co., 132 Va. 480, 112 S.E. 792, 1922 Va. LEXIS 42 (1922). Construction of the grant.  Public grants of the right to use and occupy the streets of the municipality are to be strictly construed. This principle of construction does not deny a fair and reasonable interpretation to such grants, or justify the withholding of that which it satisfactorily appears the grant was intended to convey. And in construing such grants the courts have been careful to extend a reasonable and just protection to publi c utility corporations whose investments have necessarily been based upon calculations of future growth and development. Commonwealth ex rel. City of Portsmouth v. Portsmouth Gas Co., 132 Va. 480, 112 S.E. 792, 1922 Va. LEXIS 42 (1922). Section is not applicable to jit ney buses.  A jitney bus association, engaged in carrying passengers along the streets of a city in auto cars, does not make use of the streets in a way similar to the use ma de of the streets by the various enterprises designated in this section, hence, it does not come within its purview.

Text A. The governi ng body of Albemarle County, Chesterfield County, Henrico County, Prince William County, or York County, may adopt an ordinance requiring any person, firm or corporation to obtain a permit from the county engineer or such other officer as may be designat ed in such ordinance before placing any pole or subsurface structures under, along or in any county road or street in such county which is not included within the primary state highway system or secondary system of state highways, or any lines or wires t hat cross any such road or street, whether or not such road or street be actually opened, and may provide in such ordinance reasonable charges for the issuance of such a permit and penalties for violations of the terms of such ordinance to be imposed by the court, judge or justice trying the case. B. In the even t the county engineer or such other officer as may be designated fails or refuses to issue any such permit requested within thirty days after application therefor, or attaches to such permit conditions to which such person, firm or corporation is unwilli ng to consent, then such person, firm or corporation may proceed to make such crossing pursuant and subject to the provisions of §§ 56-23 to 56-32, as if the application had been made to the board of supervisors or other governing body of the count y.

Every public service corporation whose road, railroad, canal, or works passes through the lands of any person in this Commonwealth shall provide and maintain proper and suitable wagonways across such road, railroad, canal, or other works, from on e part of such land to the other, and shall keep such wagonways in good repair. Such wagonways shall be constructed and maintained on the request of the landowner, in writing, by certified mail, made to the registered agent for the corporation owning suc h road, railroad, canal, or other works at that point, and shall designate the points at which the wagonways are desired. If the company fails or refuses for ninety days after such request to construct and maintain wagonways of a convenient and proper ch aracter at the places designated, then the owner may apply to the circuit court of the county or city wherein such land is located for the appointment of three disinterested persons whose lands do not abut on such road, railroad, canal, or other works, w ho shall constitute a board of commissioners whose duty it shall be to go upon the land and determine whether the requested wagonways should be constructed and maintained. Any delay in construction or maintenance caused by inclement weather, war, strikes, acts of God, national emergencies, or failure of any local, state, or federal govern ment agencies to grant permits shall extend the aforesaid period. The decision of such board shall be in writing and, if favorable to the landowner, shall set forth the points at which the wagonways should be constructed and maintained, giving also a des cription of what should be done by the company to make and maintain a suitable and convenient wagonway. The decision of the board of commissioners shall be returned to, and filed in, the clerks office of such court, and when called up at the next or any succeeding term of such court, it shall be confirmed, unless good cause is shown against it by the company. Either party shall have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court from the judgment of the court. If the company fails, within a reasonable tim e fixed by the court at the time of the confirmation of a report favorable to the landowner, to make and maintain the wagonways therein referred to, it shall pay the landowner fifty dollars for each day of such failure, which may be recovered on motion b y the landowner against the company, in the circuit court of the county or city wherein such land is located having jurisdiction to try the same. The commissioners shall each receive for their services the sum of fifty dollars per day, to be taxed as a p art of the costs of the proceeding. Once the right to such wagonway has been established, should the railroad change the grade of any portion of the tracks across which such wagonway passes, it shall be t he duty of the railroad to make whatever reasonable modifications of the wagonway are necessary within the railroad right-of-way to permit the passage of the aforesaid machinery and vehicles.

CASE NOTES Purpose.  It is apparent that the purpose of this statute is to afford relief to a landowner through whose land a railroad is constructed and maintained so that the landown er may have access from his land on one side of the railroad to his land on the other side. Southern Ry. v. Darnell, 221 Va. 1026, 277 S.E.2d 175, 1981 Va. LEXIS 245 (1981). This section must be reasonabl y construed.  This section must receive a reasonable construction, so as to make the remedy commensurate with the right of the landowner and the mischief intended to be redress ed. Regard must be had to the convenience of both parties, and the cost to be incurred by the party required to construct the crossing. The landowner has not the arbitrary right to demand an underground crossing. Lanford v. Virginia Air Line Ry., 113 Va. 68, 73 S.E. 566, 1912 Va. LEXIS 10 (1912); Pennsylvania R.R. v. Black, 175 Va. 256, 8 S.E.2d 291, 1940 Va. LEXIS 169 (1940). This statute is remedial and must be given a reasonable construction to effectuate its purpose. Southern Ry. v. Darnell, 221 Va. 1026, 277 S.E.2d 175, 1981 Va. LE XIS 245 (1981). Construction of word or as used in this section.  See South E. Pub. Serv. Corp. v. Commonwealth ex rel. SCC, 165 Va. 116, 181 S.E. 448, 1935 Va. LEXIS 279 (1935). This section applies as well to railroads in process of construction as to those in actual operation. The statute is remedial, and should receive a reasonable construction so as to effect the ends for which it was enacted. Adams v. Tidewater Ry., 107 Va. 798, 60 S.E. 129, 1908 Va. LEXIS 142 (1908). It does not impose upon a railway company the duty to provide a crossing, but to provide proper and suitable wagonways across the railroad right-of-way, and the words wagonways across appear significant, especially when this section is read along with § 56-17, which latter section deals with the crossing of one ra ilroad by another, and uses the word crossing only. Lanford v. Virginia Air Line Ry., 113 Va. 68, 73 S.E. 566, 1912 Va. LEXIS 10 (1912). Proper and suitable ways const rued.  This section requires the construction of proper and suitable wagonways from one part of the owners land to the other. It does not require construction of a w ay to a public road, and plainly does not contemplate that kind of crossing. Its purpose is to lessen the difficulties of the owner in the convenient and profitable use of his land when the railroad divides one part of it from the other. The normal farmi ng operation involves the sale or the use of the products of the farm, such as grain, hay or livestock. It may also include the sale or other use of trees grown on the land and lumber therefrom. Ways proper and suitable required by the section ar e ways proper and suitable for the reasonable use of the land and the use or sale of its products. Hurt v. Southern Ry., 207 Va. 60, 147 S.E.2d 777, 1966 Va. LEXIS 187 (1966). Change in ch ief purpose of wagonway may be irrelevant.  If a railroad passes through land and still continues to pass through, then the landowner is entitled to rely on this section even if the chief purpose in using t he wagonway has changed; therefore, so long as the railroad right-of-way continues to pass through the property of the landowner, and the landowner continues to use the wagonway to get from one part of his property to the other, other uses are ir relevant. Southern Ry. v. Darnell, 221 Va. 1026, 277 S.E.2d 175, 1981 Va. LEXIS 245 (1981). No relief where right-of-way passes by rather than through land.  Where the undisputed evidence was that the plaintiffs owned land on one side only of the railroads right-of-way, the right-of-way did not pass through their l and but ran by it, and this section therefore afforded them no relief. Southern Ry. v. Anderson, 203 Va. 991, 128 S.E.2d 429, 1962 Va. LEXIS 249 (1962). It is apparent that the purpose of this section is to afford relief only to a landowner through whose land a railroad is constructed and maintained so that the la ndowner may have access from his land on one side of the railroad to his land on the other side; thus, when a railroad right-of-way passes by but not through the land that adjoins it on only one side, the owner of such land does not come within the purvi ew of this statute. Southern Ry. v. Boy, 221 Va. 1022, 277 S.E.2d 172, 1981 Va. LEXIS 244 (1981). The trial court is the final arbiter of the propriety of directing a crossing to be erected by a railroad whose line of road passes through the lands of another. Therefore, unless the judgment is contrary to law, it should be affirmed. Pennsylvania R.R. v. Black, 175 Va. 256, 8 S.E.2d 291, 1940 Va. LEXIS 169 (1940). The rights of both parties are pro tected.  A landowner, who has received without contest the damages allowed for constructing a railroad fill across his land, cannot, after the fill has been constructed, c ompel the railroad company to take out the fill and reconstruct its roadbed so as to provide him an underground wagonway from one part of his farm to another, especially when it appears that the cost of such reconstruction would amount to three times the assessed value of the entire farm, including buildings, while the injury and inconvenience to the landowner would be comparatively insignificant. Lanford v. Virginia Air Line Ry., 113 Va. 68, 73 S.E. 566, 1912 Va. LEXIS 10 (1912). The rights and remedies provided by this section are personal to the landowner, and if t he public wish to acquire other or greater rights their remedy is under different statutes and by an essentially different procedure. If then a person other than the owner, or some one in privity with him, for his own convenience, elects to use such cros sing and mishap befalls him, the company, in the absence of some further intervention on its part that proximately contributes to the accident, cannot be held liable therefor. Washington-Virginia Ry. v. Fisher, 121 Va. 229, 92 S.E. 809, 1917 Va. LEXIS 27 (1917). A landowner may not bring himself piecemeal within the intendment of this section by fir st acquiring land on one side of a railroad right-of-way and then subsequently acquiring land on the other side.

Commission to consider environmental, economic and improvements in service reliability factors in approving construction of electrical utility facilit ies; approval required for construction of certain electrical transmission lines; notice and hearings. Text A. Whenever th e Commission is required to approve the construction of any electrical utility facility, it shall give consideration to the effect of that facility on the environment and establish such conditions as may be desirable or necessary to minimize adverse envi ronmental impact. In order to avoid duplication of governmental activities, any valid permit or approval required for an electric generating plant and associated facilities issued or granted by a federal, state or local governmental entity charged by law with responsibility for issuing permits or approvals regulating environmental impact and mitigation of adverse environmental impact or for other specific public interest issues such as building codes, transportation plans, and public safety, whether suc h permit or approval is granted prior to or after the Commissions decision, shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section with respect to all matters that (i) are governed by the permit or approval or (ii) are within the authority of, a nd were considered by, the governmental entity in issuing such permit or approval, and the Commission shall impose no additional conditions with respect to such matters. Nothing in this section shall affect the ability of the Commission to keep the recor d of a case open. Nothing in this section shall affect any right to appeal such permits or approvals in accordance with applicable law. In the case of a proposed facility located in a region that was designated as of July 1, 2001, as serious nonattainmen t for the one-hour ozone standard as set forth in the federal Clean Air Act, the Commission shall not issue a decision approving such proposed facility that is conditioned upon issuance of any environmental permit or approval. In every proceeding under t his subsection, the Commission shall receive and give consideration to all reports that relate to the proposed facility by state agencies concerned with environmental protection; and if requested by any county or municipality in which the facility is pro posed to be built, to local comprehensive plans that have been adopted pursuant to Article 3 (§ 15.2-2223 et seq.) of Chapter 22 of Title 15.2. Additionally, the Commission (a) shall consider the effect of the proposed facility on economic development within the Commonwealth, including but not limited to furtherance of the economic and job creation objectives of the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy set forth in § 45.2-1706.1, and (b) shall consider any improvements in service reliability that may result from the construction of such facility. B. Subject to the provisions of subsection J, no electrical transmission line of 138 kilovolts or more shall be constructed unless the State Corporation Commission shall, after at least 30 days advance notice by (i) publication in a newspaper or newspapers of gene ral circulation in the counties and municipalities through which the line is proposed to be built, (ii) written notice to the governing body of each such county and municipality, and (iii) causing to be sent a copy of the notice by first class mail to al l owners of property within the route of the proposed line, as indicated on the map or sketch of the route filed with the Commission, which requirement shall be satisfied by mailing the notice to such persons at such addresses as are indicated in the lan d books maintained by the commissioner of revenue, director of finance or treasurer of the county or municipality, approve such line. Such notices shall include a written description of the proposed route the line is to follow, as well as a map or sketch of the route including a digital geographic information system (GIS) map provided by the public utility showing the location of the proposed route. The Commission shall make GIS maps provided under this subsection available to the public on the Commissi ons website. Such notices shall be in addition to the advance notice to the chief administrative officer of the county or municipality required pursuant to § 15.2-2202.As a condition to approval the Commission shall determine that the line is need ed and that the corridor or route chosen for the line will avoid or reasonably minimize adverse impact to the greatest extent reasonably practicable on the scenic assets, historic resources recorded with the Department of Historic Resources, and environm ent of the area concerned. To assist the Commission in this determination, as part of the application for Commission approval of the line, the applicant shall summarize its efforts to avoid or reasonably minimize adverse impact to the greatest extent rea sonably practicable on the scenic assets, historic resources recorded with the Department of Historic Resources, and environment of the area concerned. In making the determinations about need, corridor or route, and method of installation, the Commission shall verify the applicants load flow modeling, contingency analyses, and reliability needs presented to justify the new line and its proposed method of installation. If the local comprehensive plan of an affected county or municipality designates c orridors or routes for electric transmission lines and the line is proposed to be constructed outside such corridors or routes, in any hearing the county or municipality may provide adequate evidence that the existing planned corridors or routes designat ed in the plan can adequately serve the needs of the company. Additionally, the Commission shall consider, upon the request of the governing body of any county or municipality in which the line is proposed to be constructed, (a) the costs and economic be nefits likely to result from requiring the underground placement of the line and (b) any potential impediments to timely construction of the line. C. If, prior t o such approval, any interested party shall request a public hearing, the Commission shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after such request, hold such hearing or hearings at such place as may be designated by the Commission. In any hearing the publi c service company shall provide adequate evidence that existing rights-of-way cannot adequately serve the needs of the company.If, prior to such approval, written requests therefor are received from the governing body of any county or municipality throug h which the line is proposed to be built or from 20 or more interested parties, the Commission shall hold at least one hearing in the area that would be affected by construction of the line, for the purpose of receiving public comment on the proposal. If any hearing is to be held in the area affected, the Commission shall direct that a copy of the transcripts of any previous hearings held in the case be made available for public inspection at a convenient location in the area for a reasonable time befor e such local hearing. D. As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning:Environment or environmental shall be deemed to include in meaning historic, as well as a consideration of the probable eff ects of the line on the health and safety of the persons in the area concerned.Interested parties shall include the governing bodies of any counties or municipalities through which the line is proposed to be built, and persons residing or owning property in each such county or municipality. Public utility means a public utility as defined in § 56-265.1.Qualifying facilities means a cogeneration or small power production facility which meets the criteria of 18 C.F.R. Part 292. Reasonably accommodate requests to wheel or transmit power means: 1. That the applicant will make available to new electric generation facilities constructed after January 9, 1991, qualifying facilities and other nonutilities, a minimum of one-fourth of the total megawatts of the additional transmission capacity created by the proposed line, for the purpose of wheeling to public utility purchasers the power generated by such qualifying facilities and other nonutility facilities which are awarded a power purchase contract by a public utility purchaser in compliance with applic able state law or regulations governing bidding or capacity acquisition programs for the purchase of electric capacity from nonutility sources, provided that the obligation of the applicant will extend only to those requests for wheeling service made wit hin the 12 months following certification by the State Corporation Commission of the transmission line and with effective dates for commencement of such service within the 12 months following completion of the transmission line; and 2. That the wheeling service offered by the applicant, pursuant to subdivision D 1, will reasonably further the purposes of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (P. L. 95- 617), as demonstrated by submitting to the Commission, with its application for approval of the line, the cost methodologies, terms, conditions, and dispatch and interconnection requirements the applicant intends, subject to any applicable requirements o f the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to include in its agreements for such wheeling service. E. In the even t that, at any time after the giving of the notice required in subsection B, it appears to the Commission that consideration of a route or routes significantly different from the route described in the notice is desirable, the Commission shall cause noti ce of the new route or routes to be published and mailed in accordance with subsection B. The Commission shall thereafter comply with the provisions of this section with respect to the new route or routes to the full extent necessary to give affect...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_56-47"><akn:num>§ 56-47</akn:num><akn:heading>56-47, 56-48</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Repealed by Acts 1956, c. 438.</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_56-49"><akn:num>§ 56-49</akn:num><akn:heading>Powers</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text In addition to the powers conferred by Title 13.1, each public service corporation of this Commonwealth organized to conduct a public service business other than a rail road shall have the power: 1.

History History. 1979, c. 238; 1980, c. 703. § 56-90.2. Fair market valuations of water and sewer utility asset acquisitions. Text The Commission shall establish rules governing petitions by an acquiring public utility that has elected to seek use of the fair market value of a municipal or other go vernmental selling utilitys water or sewer assets to determine the initial rate base for the purpose of post-acquisition rate recovery. Such rules shall identify information to be filed in addition to all other filing requirements in the Utility Tran sfers Act (§ 56-88 et seq.). Such rules shall: 1. Estab lish the process for determining the acquired water or sewer utility rate base, taking into consideration the use of the lesser of (i) the agreed-upon purchase price established during a voluntary arms-length transaction by the selling and acquiring utilities and (ii) the fair market value established using the average of the valuations provided by three qualified and impartial utility valuation experts. 2. Provide for the acquiring utility to submit complete and unredacted copies of two qualified, independent, and impartial utility valuation experts appraisals of the system assets to be acquired in compliance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practices. The appraisals shall be treated confidentially. Such appraisals shall be completed and submitted in accordance with the following: a. One appraisal shall be sponsored by the public utility acquiring the utility system assets, and one appraisal shall be sponsored by the government entity selling the utility system assets. b. The qualifications of such utility valuation experts, specifically as they relate to water or wastewater utility systems, shall be clearly identified in the application. c. The appraisals shall clearly identify whether they are based on a cost, market, income, or other methodology. d. The appraisals shall quantify only the fair market value associated with assets that are to be currently used and useful in utility service. To the extent assets are acquired beyo nd those to be currently used and useful in utility service, a narrative shall be provided of the acquiring utilitys intended purpose of such assets. e. Commission staff and other intervenors may seek discovery to confirm the reasonableness of such appraisals and may provide testimony and recommendations regarding such. f. When combined with a third appraisal sponsored by the Commission staff, the average of the three appraisals shall be deemed the fair market value for the purposes of this proceedi ng. The applicant may seek discovery to confirm the reasonableness of such appraisal and may provide testimony and recommendations regarding such. 3. Provide for the submission of a complete and unredacted copy of an assessment performed by a professional engineer licensed in Virginia, jointly retained by the acquiring and selling u tilities, regarding tangible assets of the utility system to be acquired. Such assessment shall be used by the utility valuation experts as a basis for their valuations in determining fair market value and shall be treated confidentially. Such assessment s shall be completed and submitted in accordance with the following: a. The qualifications of such licensed engineer, specifically as they relate to water or wastewater utility systems, shall be clearly identified in the application. b. Commission staff and other intervenors may seek discovery to confirm the reasonableness of the assessment and may provide testimony and recommendations regarding such. c. To the extent assets are to be acquired beyond those to be currently used and useful in utility service, such assessment shall separately quantify only the assets that are to be c urrently used and useful in utility service. 4. Provide that to the extent the proposed purchase price is different from that provided in the appraisals, the application shall identify such proposed purchase price. 5. Provide for the acquiring utility to submit the proposed journal entries resulting from the proposed acquisition, including tax entries, including account numbers recognized by the Nat ional Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. 6. Provide for the acquiring utility to submit an analysis identifying the qualitative and quantitative benefits and estimated customer rate impacts for the next five years as a result of the proposed acquisition for each of (i) the customers of the desired system and (ii) the legacy customers of the acquiring utility. Such analysis should clearly identify all assumptions relied upon. 7. Provide that if depreciation rates for the acquired system are not based on a depreciation study: a. The acquiring utility may apply a three percent composite depreciation rate to the fair market value of the utility system assets acquired. b. A depreciation study on the acquired system shall be performed within five years of acquisition and provided for review by Commission staff. Upon acceptance of the depreciation ra tes by Commission staff for booking purposes, such rates shall be utilized for the system effective as of the date of the study. c. However, if the acquired system is of a size that would qualify under the Small Water or Sewer Public Utility Act (§ 56-265.13:1 et seq.), such assets may be exempted from the requirement of performing a depreciation study. 8. Establish the ability to evaluate and include reasonable transaction costs and fees of the utility valuation experts in the fair market value determination in addition to reasonable tr ansaction and closing costs when establishing the rate base. 9. Provide that the rate base value of the acquired system assets shall be the fees and costs of the utility valuation experts authorized by the acquiring and selling utilities in additio n to reasonable transaction and closing costs, plus the lesser of (i) the purchase price negotiated between the acquiring utility and selling utility as the result of a voluntary arms-length transaction and (ii) the fair market value for subsequent r ate-making purposes in the acquiring utilitys next base rate case. Nothing in the established rules shall be construed to relieve the petitioners from the duty to demonstrate adequate service to the public at just and reasonable rates that will not be impaired or jeopardized by granting the prayer of the petition as provided in § 56-90. Such rules shall be developed in coordination and consultation with industry experts and stakeholders an...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_56-91"><akn:num>§ 56-91</akn:num><akn:heading>Violations of chapter</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Any company violating any provision of § 56-89 shall upon conviction be fined not more than $1,000.

Construction.  This section was taken almost verbatim from § 2074 of the Code of 1897 of Iowa. The construction placed upon this statute by the Iowa court before its adoption and incorporation became a part of the law of Virginia. C &amp; O Ry. v. Osborne, 154 Va. 477, 153 S.E. 865, 1930 Va. LEXIS 231 (1930). Compliance with former §§ 56-316 through 56-319 removed motor carriers from the prohibition of this section. Peninsula Transit Corp. v. Jacoby, 181 Va. 697, 26 S.E.2d 97, 1943 Va. LEXIS 218 (1943); Sydnor &amp; Hundley, Inc. v. Wilson Trucking Corp., 213 Va. 704, 194 S.E.2d 733, 1973 Va. LEXIS 212 (1973). Under this section contracts exempting common carriers from their common-law liability are invalid, either with respect to the amount or degree of their liability as insurers. C &amp; O Ry. v. Pew, 109 Va. 288, 64 S.E. 35, 1909 Va. LEXIS 33 (1909). Liability determined by common law.  Under the terms of this section, the amount and degree of liability of a carrier is to be determined not by what it would be under a contract for exemption from o r limitation of amount of liability valid and enforceable at common law, but by what it would be at common law. C &amp; O Ry. v. Osborne, 154 Va. 477, 153 S.E. 865, 1930 Va. LEXIS 231 (1930). No relief from liability to one to whom duty as common carrier owed.  This section prohibits any attempt, either direct or indirect, through the use of an exemption provision of an indemnification provision, by a transportation comp any to relieve itself from liability to one to whom it owes a duty as a common carrier. Southern States Coop. v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 219 Va. 191, 247 S.E.2d 461, 1978 Va. LEXIS 178 (1978). Basis of limitation immaterial.  A limitation by rule, regulation, notice, contract or receipt of the amount of recovery which may be had for the loss of a shipment or damage thereto, whether it is attempted to make the limitation by a declared or agreed value of the property or by some other means, constitutes such an exemption from liability as is declared ineffective by this section. C &amp; O Ry. v. Osborne, 154 Va. 477, 153 S.E. 865, 1930 Va. L EXIS 231 (1930). Even if the contract of carriage attempted to limit the liability of the defendant to the sum of fifty dollars, in consideration of the rate of charge for the tra nsportation of the property, the rule is now firmly settled that under this statute, as to intrastate shipments, such attempted limitation of liability is void where the injury or loss is occasioned by the negligence or misconduct of the carrier. Adams E xpress Co. v. Allen, 125 Va. 530, 100 S.E. 473, 1919 Va. LEXIS 43 (1919). Reasonable classification permitted.  This section, prohibiting a carrier from limiting its liability for negligence, does not mean that for rate-making purposes property may not be reasonably classif ied according to value, or that a general class, such as horses, may not be reasonably subdivided into subclasses according to grade or value, or that such classes or subclasses may not be made subject to rates graduated according to the value of the pro perty falling therein. This is a different matter from limiting the liability of the carrier in case of loss or damage to a stipulated, declared or agreed value. Rates lawfully established on the basis of the value or grade of the property shipped are va lid and enforceable. C &amp; O Ry. v. Osborne, 154 Va. 477, 153 S.E. 865, 1930 Va. LEXIS 231 (1930). Agreement not within section.  A spurtrack agreement purporting to relieve the railroad of all liability for property damages caused by it in relation to the operation of locomotives ei ther on the spur or on the main track is not a contract made by it as a common carrier, is not within this section and is a valid agreement. Aetna Ins. Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 79 F.2d 463, 1935 U.S. App. LEXIS 4149 (4th Cir. 1935), cert. denied, 297 U.S. 704, 56 S. Ct. 442, 80 L. Ed. 992, 1936 U.S. LEXIS 599 (1936). This section applies only to intrastate passes, exempting a carrier from liability, and interstate passes where Congress has not legislated upon the subject. Williamson v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 136 Va. 626, 118 S.E. 255, 1923 Va. LEXIS 109, cert. denied, 263 U.S. 710, 44 S. Ct. 37, 68 L. Ed. 518, 1923 U.S. LEXIS 2919 (1923). A nine-month notice requirement included in a form bill of lading filed with tariff schedules was not such a limitation upon liability as that forbidden by this section. Sydnor &amp; Hundley, Inc. v. Wilson Trucking Corp., 213 Va. 704, 194 S.E.2d 733, 1973 Va. LEXIS 212 (1973). Railroad not acting as common carrier may exempt self by contract.  Where an agreement between a telephone company and a railroad contained an exculpatory provision whereby the railroad was not liable for damage caused by its negl igence, and the railroad essentially contracted in a private capacity and owed no essential duties as a common carrier to the telephone company, the Supreme Court adopted the majority rule that a railway company not acting as a common carrier may exempt itself by contract, from liability for negligence. C &amp; O Ry. v. Clifton Forge-Waynesboro Tel. Co., 216 Va. 858, 224 S.E.2d 317, 1976 Va. LEXIS 216 (1976). But company is liable for subsequent injury when duty as common carrier owed.  Under the plain language of this section, although a transportation company may occupy a private status at the time it attempts to relieve itself from liability, the attempt is ineffectual with respect to subsequent injury to one to whom it owes a duty as a common carrier. Southern States Coop. v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 219 Va. 191, 247 S.E.2d 461, 1978 Va. LEXIS 178 (1978). An agreement entered into by a transportation company in its private capacity is not determinative of its liability for subsequent injury to one to whom the compa ny then owes a duty as a common carrier and the decision in Chesapeake &amp; O. Ry. v. Clifton Forge-Waynesboro Tel. Co., 216 Va. 858, 224 S.E.2d 317 (1976), is not authority to the contrary. Southern States Coop. v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 219 Va. 191, 247 S.E.2d 461, 1978 Va.

It shall be the duty of every public utility to furnish reasonably adequate service and facilities at reasonable and just rates to any person, firm or corporation along its lines desiring same. Notwithstanding any other provision of law: 1. A tel ephone company shall not have the duty to extend or expand its facilities to furnish service and facilities when the person, firm or corporation has service available from one or more alternative providers of wireline or terrestrial wireless communicatio ns services at prevailing market rates; and 2. A telephone company may meet its duty to furnish reasonably adequate service and facilities through the use of any and all available wireline and terrestrial wireless technologies; how ever, a telephone company, when restoring service to an existing wireline customer, shall offer the option to furnish service using wireline facilities.For purposes of subdivisions 1 and 2, the Commission shall have the authority upon request of an indiv idual, corporation, or other entity, or a telephone company, to determine whether the wireline or terrestrial wireless communications service available to the party requesting service is a reasonably adequate alternative to local exchange telephone servi ce.The use by a telephone company of wireline and terrestrial wireless technologies shall not be construed to grant any additional jurisdiction or authority to the Commission over such technologies.For purposes of subdivision 1, prevailing market rat es means rates similar to those generally available to consumers in competitive areas for the same services. B. It shall be the duty of every public utility to charge uniformly therefor all persons, corporations or municipal corporations using such service under like conditions. However, no provision of law shall be deemed to preclude voluntary rate or rate design tests or e xperiments, or other experiments involving the use of special rates, where such experiments have been approved by order of the Commission after notice and hearing and a finding that such experiments are necessary in order to acquire information which is or may be in furtherance of the public interest. The Commissions final order regarding any petition filed by an investor-owned electric utility for approval of a voluntary rate or rate design test or experiment shall be entered the earlier of not mor e than six months after the filing of the petition or not more than three months after the date of any evidentiary hearing concerning such petition. The charge for such service shall be at the lowest rate applicable for such service in accordance with sc hedules filed with the Commission pursuant to § 56-236. But, subject to the provisions of § 56-232.1, nothing contained herein or in § 56-481.1 shall apply to (i) schedules of rates for any telecommunications service provided to the public by vi rtue of any contract with, (ii) for any service provided under or relating to a contract for telecommunications services with, or (iii) contracts for service rendered by any telephone company to, the state government or any agency thereof, or by any othe r public utility to any municipal corporation or to the state or federal government. The provisions hereof shall not apply to or in any way affect any proceeding pending in the State Corporation Commission on or before July 1, 1950, and shall not confer on the Commission any jurisdiction not now vested in it with respect to any such proceeding. C. The Commiss ion may conclude that competition can effectively ensure reasonably adequate retail services in competitive exchanges and may carry out its duty to ensure that a public utility is furnishing reasonably adequate retail service in its competitive exchanges by monitoring individual customer complaints and requiring appropriate responses to such complaints.

Acts 2011, c. 408, cl. 2, provides: That public utilities in the Commonwealth shall (i) evaluate options to develop and offer off-peak charging rates or other incentives to encourage owners of an electric vehicle to charge or recharge its battery during nonpeak times, when practical, and (ii) file copies of such evaluations with the State Corporation Commission. The State Corporation Commission shall make cop ies of the evaluations available to the public. Acts 2011, c. 408, cl. 3, provides: That the State Corporation Commission (the Commission) shall, notwithstanding § 56-234 of the Code of Virginia, be auth orized to approve, after notice to all affected parties and opportunity for hearing, pilot programs conducted by public utilities, including programs offering special rates, contracts, or incentives to individual customers or classes of customers to dete rmine the feasibility, and the implications for the public interest, of allowing public electric utilities to offer time-differentiated rates to users of electric motor vehicles to encourage charging of vehicles during nonpeak periods. Elements of the pi lot programs may include voluntary load control options, rate structures with financial incentives, rebates, or other incentives that offset the cost of purchasing or installing electric vehicle charging equipment for users who elect nonpeak rate structu res. Before approving such pilot programs, including special rates, contracts, and incentives, the Commission shall ensure that such action meets the provisions of subsection B of § 56-235.2 of the Code of Virginia and that such actions are necessary in order to acquire information which is or may be in furtherance of the public interest. An electric utility that participates in such an approved pilot program shall be entitled to recover annually the costs of its participation in any such pilot progr am conducted by the utility on or after January 1, 2011. Acts 2018, c. 296, cl. 20, provides: That the provisions of this act shall apply to any applications pending with the State Corporation Commission regarding n ew underground facilities or offshore wind facilities on or after January 1, 2018. Acts 2018, c. 296, cl. 24, provides: That this act shall be known as the Grid Transformation and Security Act. Acts 2020, c. 1289, as amended by Acts 2021, Sp.

Commission has no authority to give retroactive effect to rates.  This section contains nothing which either expressly or impliedly gives the State Corporation Commission authority to give retroactive effect to rates which may b e substituted by it for the existing rates of any public utility.

Constitutionality.  The procedural scheme adopted by the SCCs Rate Case Rules, as it was applied to plaintiffs application for rate relief, did not amount to an unconstitutio nal denial of plaintiffs right to a day in court, as plaintiff had at all times had an appropriate forum in which to present its grievance, an appropriate procedural vehicle in which to convey it, and an appropriate remedy with which to redress it.

Jurisdiction of Commission limited by this section.  The jurisdiction of the State Corporation Commission to fix rates to be charged by public utilities, notwithstanding prior existing contracts between the utilitie s and consumers, can only be exercised for the reasons indicated in the statute and in the method prescribed thereby. Commonwealth ex rel. Page Milling Co. v. Shenandoah River Light &amp; Power Corp., 135 Va. 47, 115 S.E. 695, 1923 Va. LEXIS 2 (1923). Commissi on exercises legislative function.  In performing the duty of fixing reasonable and just rates for a public service corporation providing heat, light and power service, the State Corporation Commiss ion exercises a legislative function delegated to it by the legislature of Virginia by this section, by virtue of Va. Const., Art. IX, § 2. The power delegated by the legislature has the same attributes as the power directly delegated by the Constitut ion to the Commission for the regulation of transportation and transmission companies under former § 156 of the Constitution. Board of Supvrs. v. VEPCO, 196 Va. 1102, 87 S.E.2d 139, 1955 Va. LEXIS 182 (1955); City of Norfolk v. VEPCO, 197 Va. 505, 90 S.E.2d 140, 1955 Va. LEXIS 249 (1955). The power to fix rates which shall be just and reasonable is a purely legislative function and, in such matters, the State Corporation Commission is the legislati ve branch of the government. Howell v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., 215 Va. 549, 211 S.E.2d 265, 1975 Va. LEXIS 188 (1975). And in fixing rate of return, the Commission functions as an expert tribunal. Howell v. C &amp; P Tel. Co., 215 Va. 549, 211 S.E.2d 265, 1975 Va. LEXIS 188 (1975). The Corporation Commission functions as an expert tribunal and its order, upon review, is presumed to be just, reasonable and correct. Central Tel. Co. v. SCC, 21 9 Va. 863, 252 S.E.2d 575, 1979 Va. LEXIS 183 (1979). State acti on exemption from antitrust laws.  See Washington Gas Light Co. v. VEPCO, 438 F.2d 248, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 11856 (4th Cir. 1971); Region Properties, Inc. v. APCO, 368 F. Supp. 630, 1973 U.S. Dist . LEXIS 10736 (W.D. Va. 1973). Section does not prevail over exemptive provision of § 56-234.  This section does not prevail over and render inoperative the provision of § 56-234 which purports to exempt from regulation the rates charged by electric comp anies for service furnished to municipal corporations or to the state or federal government. Commonwealth v. VEPCO, 214 Va. 457, 201 S.E.2d 771, 1974 Va. LEXIS 161 (1974). This section and § 56-234 not in apparent conflict.  This section and § 56-234, insofar as applicable to electric companies, are parts of a comprehensive legislative plan for the regulation of the rates charged b y those companies; when these sections are held up side by side and viewed in context with the entire chapter, there is no apparent conflict between the two. Commonwealth v. VEPCO, 214 Va. 457, 201 S.E.2d 771, 1974 Va. LEXIS 161 (1974). Section 56-234 appears to exempt from regulation the rates charged by electric companies for service rendered governmental entities and this section appears to au thorize correction of unreasonable and unjust rates, if found to exist, in those other areas where the powers of the Commission are operative. Commonwealth v. VEPCO, 214 Va. 457, 201 S.E.2d 771, 1974 Va. LEXIS 161 (1974). Thus, Commission cannot regulate rates for electric service to governmental entities.  The State Corporation Commission does not have the power nor the duty to regulate the rates charged by electric companies for service furnished to governmental en tities for purposes such as lighting streets and public buildings. Commonwealth v. VEPCO, 214 Va. 457, 201 S.E.2d 771, 1974 Va. LEXIS 161 (1974). When no investigation necessary to invoke section.  Where the State Corporation Commission considered pipeline companys application to revise its tariffs and discovered therein a request for a reduction in reve nues based on the companys having received, in the test year, revenues in excess of its cost of providing service and a fair return on rate base, the Commission had before it an admission of unjust and unreasonable rates. No further investigation was necessary to permit the Commission to invoke this section. Commonwealth Gas Pipeline Corp. v. Anheuser-Busch Co., 233 Va. 396, 355 S.E.2d 605, 3 Va. Law Rep. 2518, 1987 Va. LEXIS 206 (1987). Citys remedy w hen rates unreasonable.  The city in which the electric light company was operating was in no wise hurt by the procedure of the Commission, as it might at any time go before the Commissio n and make complaint that the rates were unjust and unreasonable, and, if such complaint is well founded, it would be the duty of the Commission to fix just and reasonable rates. This procedure gives the city ample opportunity to be heard as to the justn ess and reasonableness of the rates charged. City of Clifton Forge v. Virginia-Western Power Co., 129 Va. 377, 106 S.E. 400, 1921 Va. LEXIS 102 (1921). Effect of prior franchise.  The jurisdiction of the Commission to supervise the rates of public utilities imposed by municipalities was not defeated because the company was operating under a franchise ordinance adopted and accepted before the enactment of this section. Town of Victoria v. Victoria Ice, Light &amp; Power Co., 134 Va. 134, 114 S.E. 92, 1922 Va. LEXIS 150 (1922); Commonwealth ex rel. Page Milling Co. v. Shenandoah River Light &amp; Po wer Corp., 135 Va. 47, 115 S.E. 695, 1923 Va. LEXIS 2 (1923). Contract rate not abro gated lightly.  The relator had a contract with the defendant by which defendant was to furnish it with power at a certain rate for a fixed time. By a new schedule of rates defen dant increased the rate charged relator, which became effective because not suspended by the State Corporation Commission. In the instant case, without evidence or investigation, the Commission adjudged the contract rate to be illegal and the new increas ed rate to be legal. It was held error, as a rate established by contract cannot be abrogated by the mere filing of a different rate, which the Commission failed to suspend. Commonwealth ex rel. Page Milling Co. v. Shenandoah River Light &amp; Power Corp., 1 35 Va. 47, 115 S.E. 695, 1923 Va. LEXIS 2 (1923). Retroactive operation of statutes.  When the general rule is that statutes operate prospectively, and not retroactively, it would be illogical to say that the fixing of the new rate by the State Cor poration Commission pursuant to this section gives the statutes a retroactive effect, as it was not claimed that the rates for service performed before the statutes became effective could in any way be affected thereby. Clearly statutes operate prospecti vely, and only upon such rates as are thereafter lawfully prescribed pursuant thereto. Commonwealth ex rel. Page Milling Co. v. Shenandoah River Light &amp; Power Corp., 135 Va. 47, 115 S.E. 695, 1923 Va. LEXIS 2 (1923). This section controls the Commission when it is sought to change rates which have been lawfully established by contracts. It provides for such change upon investigation by the Commission.

John Stewart Walker, Inc., 214 Va. 524, 201 S.E.2d 758, 1974 Va. LEXIS 171 (1974). While the State Corporation Commission is empowered to exercise broad legislative powers in regulating rates it does not necessarily have an attendant power to ad judicate a common-law contract claim which affects rates. APCO v. John Stewart Walker, Inc., 214 Va. 524, 201 S.E.2d 758, 1974 Va. LEXIS 171 (1974). State action exemption from antitrust laws.  See Washington Gas Light Co. v.

Rates to be charged churches. Text No electric utility, subject to regulation by the Commission, shall charge a church for its services by any method other than actual kilowatt hour consumption; nor shal l any such electric utility charge a church for its electrical service at a rate in excess of the applicable residential rate for the area in which it is located. As used in this section, church shall be limited to the synagogue or church buildin g in which the sanctuary or principal place of worship is located and to all educational buildings which are physically attached by enclosed corridors or hallways to the building in which the sanctuary or principal place of worship is located. Notwithstanding the requirements of the first sentence of this section, the Commission may, after a hearing upon application by an electric utility, set a rate for chur ches in excess of the applicable residential rate if the utility proves that the cost of service for churches exceeds the cost of service for those other customers under the residential rate. In setting such a rate, the Commission shall consider the spec ial use characteristics of churches, such as the amount of electricity utilized during off-peak power periods for the utility. The provisions of this section shall not apply to churches which are served by an electric utility having a time of usage rate approved by the Commission and which have elected to be on such time of usage rate.

CASE NOTES The power of the Commission is not limited to the mere change of a particular rate that the public must pay for the service rendered by a public utility, but it has the power to change, under certain conditions, any part of a filed schedule, rate, rule or regulation that in any manner affects the rates charged or to be charged. City of Norf olk v. VEPCO, 197 Va. 505, 90 S.E.2d 140, 1955 Va. LEXIS 249 (1955). Under § 56-236 every public utility is required to keep on file with the Commission and open to public inspection all schedules of its rates and charges and as a part of such schedules, copies of all rules and regulations that in any manner affect the rates charged or to be charged. When this requirement of § 56-236 is read in connection with § 56-235 and this section, it is manifest that the C ommission has the power, upon investigation and due notice to the public, to change, fix and order substituted for any filed schedule, rate, rule or regulation found to be unjust, unreasonable, insufficient or unjustly discriminatory, etc., any o ther schedules, rates, rules or regulations that in any manner affect the rates charged or to be charged, provided they are found to be just and reasonable. This power of the Commission is in no wise limited or restricted by reason of add itional powers granted it in other sections. City of Norfolk v. VEPCO, 197 Va. 505, 90 S.E.2d 140, 1955 Va. LEXIS 249 (1955). Retroactive rate increases prohibi ted.  Neither the State Corporation Commission nor the Supreme Court has power to impose retroactive rate increases and, thus, deprive ratepayers of their right to requ ire public hearings, and their right to full and fair participation in such hearings. VEPCO v. SCC, 226 Va. 541, 312 S.E.2d 25, 1984 Va. LEXIS 293 (1984). Under this section the Commission has power to set a shorter time than 30 days for notice of the hearing. City of Norfolk v. VEPCO, 197 Va. 505, 90 S.E.2d 140, 1955 Va. LEXIS 249 (1955). Notice is not required each time there is a change in ratepayers bills.  When § 56-236 and this section are read together it is clear that notice is not required on each occasion that there is a change in the ratepayers bills, b ut that notice is required for every change in the filed schedules which are the underlying bases for the computation of those bills. This requirement gives the ratepayer ample opportunity to be heard as to the just and reasonable character of the rates charged or to be charged. City of Norfolk v. VEPCO, 197 Va. 505, 90 S.E.2d 140, 1955 Va. LEXIS 249 (1955). This section did not require notice of each increase in gas rates under an escalator clause, filed by a public utility as part of its rates and schedules for sale of gas, by application of which charges made to consumers would be increased or decreased as the basic rate paid for gas by the utility to its supplier was adjusted. City of Norfolk v. VEPCO, 197 Va. 505, 90 S.E.2d 140, 1955 Va. LEXIS 249 (1955). Waiver of defect in notice.  If in fact there were any defect in the notice of a hearing under this section, the city waived such defect by its appearance and participation in the proceedings . City of Norfolk v. VEPCO, 197 Va. 505, 90 S.E.2d 140, 1955 Va. LEXIS 249 (1955). Where no motion for summary judgment had been served on a utility company, and the compa ny was unaware that summary action was under consideration, it was a violation of due process for the State Corporation Commission to proceed sua sponte, reach its decision in camera, and in the process afford the utility company, an interested perso n entitled to full and fair participation, no opportunity to be heard. VEPCO v. SCC, 226 Va. 541, 312 S.E.2d 25, 1984 Va. LEXIS 293 (1984). § 56-237.1. Notification of intent to seek rate change in schedules required to be filed under § 56-236. Text A. Every publi c utility, other than a public utility providing water or sewer service, that indicates upon existing required schedules, or upon new schedules required to be filed in lieu thereof, changes in rates, tolls, charges, rules and regulations, shall cause to have published, once a week for four successive weeks, in one or more newspapers in circulation in its franchise area and approved by the Commission, a notice of its intention to change its rates, tolls, charges, rules and regulations. Every public utili ty providing water or sewer service that indicates upon existing required schedules, or upon new schedules required to be filed in lieu thereof, changes in rates, tolls, charges, rules and regulations, shall cause to have published at least once in one o r more newspapers in circulation in its franchise area and approved by the Commission, a notice of its intention to change its rates, tolls, charges, rules and regulations. The last such publication shall appear no less than 30 days prior to the time any changed rates, tolls, charges, rules and regulations shall take effect. This notice shall be in such form and contain such information as prescribed by the Commission. B. Every publi c utility that indicates upon existing required schedules, or upon new schedules required to be filed in lieu thereof, changes in rates, tolls, charges, rules, and regulations shall mail to each of its customers who receive periodic statements of charges by mail or send electronically to each of its customers who receive periodic statements of charges electronically, along with its periodic invoice, bill, or other statement advising the customer of its charges, a notice of its intention to change its ra tes, tolls, charges, rules, and regulations. This notice shall be mailed or sent electronically no less than 30 days prior to the time any such changed rate, toll, charge, rule, and regulation shall take effect. This notice shall be in such form and cont ain such information as prescribed by the Commission. C. Except for public utilities providing water or sewer service, the Commission may dispense with either or both of the requirements contained in subsections A and B if either or both such requirements are not necessary to provide adequate notice to all of the public utilities customers. The Commission may prescribe additional requirements for notification to a public utilitys customers of its intention to change its rates, tolls, charges, rules, and regulations.

Commission to require public utilities to follow certain procedures. Text A. The Commiss ion shall require that public utilities adhere to the following procedures for services not found to be competitive: 1. Every public utility shall provide its residential customers one full billing period to pay for one months local or basic services, before initiating any proceeding against a residential customer for nonpayment of local service. 2. Pay the residential customer a fair rate of interest as determined by the Commission on money deposited and return the deposit with the interest after not more than one year of satisfa ctory credit has been established. 3. Every public utility shall establish customer complaint procedures that will ensure prompt and effective handling of all customer inquiries, service requests, and complaints. Such proc edure shall be approved by the Commission before its implementation and it shall be distributed to its residential customers. The utility shall disclose to the customer that the Commission is the responsible regulatory agency and that the customer may co ntact the Commission on regulatory matters and provide the customer with the contact information for the Commission. 4. No electric or gas utility shall terminate a customers service without 10 days notice by mail to the customer. 5. No public utility shall terminate the residential service of a customer for such customers nonpayment of basic nonresidential services as defined by its terms and conditions on fil e with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. 6. A public utility providing water service shall not terminate service for nonpayment until it first sends the customer written notice by mail 10 days in advance of making the terminatio n but, in no event, shall it terminate the customers service until 20 days after the customers bill has become due. Any such notice shall also include contact information for the customers use in contacting the public utility regarding the no tice. 7. Any electric utility formed under or subject to Chapter 9.1 (§ 56-231.15 et seq.) may install and operate, upon a customers request and pursuant to an appropriate tariff for any type or classification of service, a prepaid metering equipment and system that is configured to terminate electric service immediately and automatically when the customer has incurred charges for electric service equal to the customers prepayments for such service. Subdivisions 1, 2, 4, and 5 shall not apply to services provided pursuant to electric service provided on a prepaid basis by a prepaid metering equipment and system pursuant to this subsection. Such tariffs shall be filed with the Commi ssion for its review and determination that the tariff is not contrary to the public interest. 8. No electric utility shall terminate the residential service of a customer for such customers nonpayment for metered services when the electric utility believes that the customer is receiving or has received electric utility services for which the customer was not properly billed as the result of tampering with the electric utilitys meter in a manner that prevented the meter from accurately recording usage, until the electric u tility has complied with the procedure set forth in subsection C. However, the requirement that the electric utility comply with the procedure set forth in subsection C before terminating service shall not apply if (i) the condition of a customers wi ring, equipment, or appliances is either unsafe or unsuitable for receiving the electric utility service; (ii) the customers use of the electric utility service or equipment interferes with or may be detrimental to the electric utilitys facilitie s or to the provision of electric utility service by the electric utility to any other customer; (iii) a tamper-evident meter seal securing the meter is broken, damaged, or missing; (iv) electric service is furnished over a line that is not owned or leas ed by the electric utility and the line is either not in a safe and suitable condition or is inadequate to receive electric utility service; (v) emergency repairs or alterations are needed; (vi) there are unavoidable shortages or interruptions in a suppl y of utility service; (vii) the electric utility is acting upon orders from an authority having jurisdiction; or (viii) the actions taken are to preserve life or property, or to avoid or abate utility or fire hazard. B. Any and all Commission rules and regulations concerning the denial of telephone service for nonpayment of such service shall not apply to services found to be competitive. C. If an elect ric utility believes that a customer is receiving or has received electric utility services for which the customer was not properly billed as the result of tampering with the electric utilitys meter in a manner that prevented the meter from accuratel y recording usage, the electric utility shall (i) retrieve the meter from the customers premises, which may be done without providing prior notice to the customer; (ii) immediately replace it with a new meter; and (iii) determine whether the meter ha s been tampered with. Within 60 days after any such determination of meter tampering has been made, the electric utility shall provide evidence of such tampering to the customer. If, after determining the meter has been tampered with, the electric utilit y seeks payment for electric utility services not properly billed, the electric utility shall provide the customer with an invoice with a reasonable and final estimate of the amount owed by the customer as a result of the meters failure to accurately record the customers usage. The invoice shall explain the electric utilitys calculation of the estimated amount owed as a result of any suspected failure. The electric utility shall provide the customer one full billing period to pay the amount billed in such invoice before initiating any proceeding against the customer for nonpayment. During such billing period, the customer may submit an informal complaint to the Commission disputing the amount sought by th...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_56-248"><akn:num>§ 56-248</akn:num><akn:heading>Commission to prescribe standard units of products or service</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The Commission shall ascertain and prescribe for each kind of public utility suitable standard commercial units of products or service.

All such contracts shall specify with reasonable particularity and definiteness the location of such easement of right-of-way; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to contracts between any such cor poration and any political subdivision of this Commonwealth, but any such corporation shall provide the location of its facilities on land owned by such a political subdivision upon request of such political subdivision. B. The locatio n of any easement of right-of-way of any public service corporation shall be as specified in the instrument by which such easement was conveyed to such public service corporation; provided that, with respect to all such easements granted after December 3 1, 1968, if such location is not specified by metes and bounds or by reference to a center line or survey line showing courses and distances from some ascertainable point of beginning, the location of such easement shall be determined by reference to the facilities constructed thereon, and the center line of those facilities shall be the center line of the easement.

T he Commission shall conduct a hearing on such application and shall direct the corporation owning the right-of-way to allow joint use if the Commission finds that such joint use is reasonable and that the present or future public utility service of such corporation will not be adversely affected by such joint use. In making such determination, the Commission may establish the terms and conditions for such joint use, including, without limitation, a requirement of compensation by the utility making the r equest to the utility owning the right-of-way, if the Commission finds such a requirement to be appropriate. D. In any case involving an application for a certificate pursuant to § 56-265.2, the governing body of each locality in which a gas pipeline or electrical transmission line would be located shall have the right to request the Commission to consider directing a joi nt use of right-of-way within that locality pursuant to the standards in subsection C of this section, provided that the governing body shall file its request no later than the date for public comment on the application established by the Commission.

The renewable generator shall request joint use of the right-of-way from the public service corporation that owns the easement of right-of-way and shall offer to enter into an agreement that will specify the terms and conditions, including rental, under which such jo int use will occur. The compensation to be paid to the public service corporation for such joint use shall be as negotiated between the public service corporation and the renewable generator. If any public service corporation owning an easement of right- of-way shall deny a request for the joint use of that right-of-way, the renewable generator shall have the right, exercisable within 30 days after the denial, to apply to the Commission for an order requiring such joint use. The Commission shall conduct a hearing on such application and shall direct the public service corporation owning the easement of right-of-way to allow joint use if the Commission finds that such joint use is reasonable and that the present or future public utility service of such c orporation will not be adversely affected by such joint use.

History History. 1976, c. 405. § 56-264.2. Governing board of multistate entities operating certain sewage treatment facilities; arbitration of issues; condemnation of facilities. Text A. As used in this section, multistate entity means any corporation, company, political subdivision, association, or other legal entity, without regard to whether such entity is a public utility or public service company, that engages in the provision of sewer age service to persons residing in the Commonwealth and to persons residing in an adjacent state and that operates a sewage treatment facility with a capacity of not less than five million gallons per day that is located in the Commonwealth, the construc tion or expansion of which treatment facility was financed primarily through the Virginia Revolving Loan Fund or a successor loan fund program administered by the Virginia Resources Authority or Department of Environmental Quality. B. Notwithstan ding any contrary provision of law, all powers of a multistate entity shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and all business and affairs of the multistate entity shall be managed under the direction of, a governing board, which may be titled a board of directors, board of trustees, or similar appellation. The governing board shall be comprised of (i) two members residing in the Commonwealth for each locality of the Commonwealth wherein the multistate entity provides sewage treatment services and (ii) a number of members residing in the adjacent state that is equal to the number of members residing in the Commonwealth. The governing body of each locality of the Commonwealth wherein the multistate entity provides sewerage services shall appoin t two individuals to the board, which individuals need not be residents of such locality. The terms of members of the board residing in the Commonwealth shall expire one year following their appointment; however, despite the expiration of such a member s term, the member shall continue to serve until his successor is elected and qualifies. Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, charter, or other organic document of the multistate entity requires a greater number for the transaction of partic ular business, a quorum of the governing board shall consist of a majority of the number of members prescribed by this subsection. If a quorum is present when a vote of the governing board is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of members present i s the act of the governing board unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, charter, or other organic document of the multistate entity requires the vote of a greater number of members. Except as provided in this section, the provisions of the article s of incorporation, bylaws, charter, or other organic document of a multistate entity in effect prior to July 1, 2006, shall continue to apply with respect to the method of appointing the board members residing in the adjacent state and the duration of t heir terms, and to other matters relating to the governing board of such multistate entity, except that no amendment to the articles of incorporation, bylaws, charter, or other organic document of the multistate entity that contravenes any provision of t his section shall be effective. C. Upon the fi ling of a petition by not fewer than one-half of the members of the governing board of a multistate entity requesting the Commission to arbitrate an issue pertaining to the management of the business and affairs of the multistate entity that requires the affirmative vote of the members, upon which issue the governing board is deadlocked, the Commission shall commence a proceeding to arbitrate the issue. The multistate entity and the nonpetitioning members of the governing board shall be parties to the p roceeding. With the petition for arbitration, the petitioners shall provide all relevant documentation concerning the issue on which it is alleged that the board is deadlocked and the positions of the petitioners and the other members of the governing bo ard with respect to the issue. The Commission shall conduct the arbitration proceeding in accordance with its Rules of Practice and Procedure (5 VAC 5-20-10 et seq.). The Commissions consideration shall be limited to the issue in the petition. The Co mmission shall proceed promptly with the hearing and determination of the issue in controversy. The final order of the Commission shall be final and binding on the multistate entity and the governing board, unless notice of appeal to the Supreme Court is filed in the office of the Clerk of the Commission within 30 days after entry of the order appealed from, in the manner provided in the rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia. If the Commission incurs additional costs in conducting such an arbitration p roceeding that cannot be recovered through the maximum levy authorized pursuant to § 58.1-2660, the unrecoverable portion of the costs of the arbitration proceedings shall be assessed against the multistate entity. D. If the arti cles of incorporation, bylaws, charter, or other organic document of a multistate entity in existence on July 1, 2006, does not comply with the requirements of subsection B by January 1, 2008, then the locality in the Commonwealth wherein the sewage trea tment facility is located shall be authorized to acquire, by exercise of the power of eminent domain if the governing body of the locality deems it appropriate, the sewage treatment facility operated by the multistate entity, without regard to whether su ch entity is the owner of the sewage treatment facility, and any related pipelines, easements, and other property related to the provision of sewerage services that is located within the locality, for the purpose of providing sewerage services to persons residing within the Commonwealth and the Bluestone Watershed.

B. Any rate ap plication or proposal submitted to the Commission that would allocate the revenue requirement of a water or sewerage company with fewer than 10,000 customer accounts, inclusive of their subsidiaries, among more than one class of customers shall be suppor ted by a class cost-of-service study that is designed to allocate revenues on the basis of cost causation and to assign credit for contributions in aid of construction, not previously addressed in a utility acquisition transaction or the most recent appr oved rate case application, to the customer class that made the contribut...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_56-265"><akn:num>§ 56-265</akn:num><akn:heading>Certain sections not to limit Commissions powers</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Nothing in § 56-261 or §§ 56-262 through 56-264 shall be construed so as to limit or curtail the existing powers of the Commission to require of all public ser vice corporations in all cases the rendition of adequate service to the public at reasonable rates nor the existing right of municipalities or individuals to apply to the Commission for the enforcement of such duties, the purpose of such sections being t o extend and not to limit the powers of the Commission.

Title of chapter. § 56-265.1. Definitions. Text In this chapter, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (a) Company means a corporation, a limited liability company, an individual, a partnership, an associat ion, a joint-stock company, a business trust, a cooperative, or an organized group of persons, whether incorporated or not; or any receiver, trustee or other liquidating agent of any of the foregoing in his capacity as such; but not a municipal corporati on or a county, unless such municipal corporation or county has obtained a certificate pursuant to § 56-265.4:4. (b) Public utility means any company that owns or operates facilities within the Commonwealth of Virgin ia for the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy for sale, for the production, storage, transmission, or distribution, otherwise than in enclosed portable containers, of natural gas, or, if produced, stored, transmitted, or distrib uted by a natural gas utility as defined in § 56-265.4:6, supplemental or substitute forms of gas sources as defined in § 56-248.1, or geothermal resources for sale for heat, light or power, or for the furnishing of telephone service, sewerage faci lities or water. A public utility may own a facility for the storage of electric energy for sale that includes one or more pumped hydroelectricity generation and storage facilities located in the coalfield region of Virginia as described in § 15.2-6002. However, the term public utility does not include any of the following: (1) Except as otherwise provided in § 56-265.3:1, any company furnishing sewerage facilities, geothermal resources or water to less than 50 customers. Any company furnishing water or sewer services to 10 or more customers and excluded by this subdivision from the definition of public utility for purposes of this chapter nevertheless shall not abandon the water or sewer services unless and until approval is granted by the Commission or all the customers receiving such services agree to accept own ership of the company. (2) Any company generating and distributing electric energy exclusively for its own consumption. (3) Any company (A) which furnishes electric service together with heating and cooling services, generated at a central plant installed on the premises to be served, to the tenants o f a building or buildings located on a single tract of land undivided by any publicly maintained highway, street or road at the time of installation of the central plant, and (B) which does not charge separately or by meter for electric energy used by an y tenant except as part of a rental charge. Any company excluded by this subdivision from the definition of public utility for the purposes of this chapter nevertheless shall, within 30 days following the issuance of a building permit, notify the State Corporation Commission in writing of the ownership, capacity and location of such central plant, and it shall be subject, with regard to the quality of electric service furnished, to the provisions of Chapters 10 (§ 56-232 et seq.) and 17 (§ 56-509 et seq.) and regulations thereunder and be deemed a public utility for such purposes, if such company furnishes such service to 100 or more lessees. (4) Any company, or affiliate thereof, making a first or direct sale, or ancillary transmission or delivery service, of natural gas to fewer than 35 commercial or industrial customer s, which are not themselves public utilities as defined in this chapter, or to certain public schools as indicated in this subdivision, for use solely by such purchasing customers at facilities which are not located in a territory for which a cer tificate to provide gas service has been issued by the Commission under this chapter and which, at the time of the Commissions receipt of the notice provided under § 56-265.4:5, are not located within any area, territory, or jurisdiction served by a municipal corporation that provided gas distribution service as of January 1, 1992, provided that such company shall comply with the provisions of § 56-265.4:5. Direct sales or ancillary transmission or delivery services of natural gas to public sc hools in the following localities may be made without regard to the number of schools involved and shall not count against the fewer than 35 requirement in this subdivision: the Counties of Dickenson, Wise, Russell, and Buchanan, and the City of Norton. (5) Any company which is not a public service corporation and which provides compressed natural gas service at retail for the public. (6) Any company selling landfill gas from a solid waste management facility permitted by the Department of Environmental Quality to a public utility certificated by the Commission to provide gas distribution service to the public in the area in which the solid waste management facility is located. If such company submits to the public utility a written offer for sale of such gas and the public utility does not agree within 60 days t o purchase such gas on mutually satisfactory terms, then the company may sell such gas to (i) any facility owned and operated by the Commonwealth which is located within three miles of the solid waste management facility or (ii) any purchaser after such landfill gas has been liquefied. The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the City of Lynchburg or Fairfax County. (7) Any authority created pursuant to the Virginia Water and Waste Authorities Act (§ 15.2-5100 et seq.) making a sale or ancillary transmission or delivery service of landfill ga s to a commercial or industrial customer from a solid waste management facility permitted by the Department of Environmental Quality and operated by that same authority, if such an authority limits off-premises sale, transmission or delivery service of l andfill gas to no more than one purchaser. The authority may contract with other persons for the construction and operation of facilities necessary or convenient to the sale, transmission or delivery of landfill gas, and no such person shall be deemed a public utility solely by reason of its construction or operation of such facilities. If the purchaser of the landfill gas is located within the certificated service territory of a natural gas public utility, the public utility may file for Commission app roval a proposed tariff to reflect any anticipated or known changes in service to the purchaser as a result of the use of landfill gas. No such tariff shall impose on the purchaser of the landfill gas terms less favorable than similarly situated customer s with alternative fuel capabilities; provided, however, that such tariff may impose such requirements as are reasonably calculated to recover the cost of such service and to protect and ensure the safety and integrity of the public utilitys faciliti es.

For related discussion, see 15 M.J. Railroads, §§ 39, 41-43; 17 M.J. Streets and H ighways, § 89. CASE NOTES Section establ ishes standards to guide Commission.  The General Assembly in enacting this section and § 56-24 has established the standards which should guide the State Corporation Commission in determining whet her a railroad should be permitted to cross a highway at grade or should be required at its expense to construct an underpass so that the highway will pass under the railroad tracks. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Board of Supvrs., 197 Va. 130, 87 S.E.2d 799, 1955 Va. LEXIS 204 (1955) (upholding an order of the Commission requiring a railroad to construct an underpass). When overhead or underground crossing not required.  The change of the policy of the State from grade to overhead or underground crossings, both as to highways and railroads, is an eminently wise one, and should be given full effect wherever, in the language of the statute, it is reasonably practicable and does not involve an unreasonable expense, all the circumstances of the case considered. But to require the establishment of an overhead or underg round crossing where it is not reasonably practicable and would involve an unreasonable expense, all the circumstances of the case considered, would be as much against the policy of the State as to permit a grade crossing where those difficulties are not shown to exist.

Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 36, 97 S.E. 343, 1918 Va. LEXIS 75 (1918). What constitutes a new construction.  Double-tracking single track railway, and erecting an embankment ten feet high across a public highway, with the substitution of an underpass for an original grad e crossing, is a new construction of railways within the meaning of this section. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth, 124 Va. 36, 97 S.E. 343, 1918 Va. LEXIS 75 (1918). What constitutes county ro ad or highway.  A street which has never been accepted or established is not a county road or highway within the contemplation of this section.

Virginia Air Line Ry., 113 Va. 68, 73 S.E. 566, 1912 Va. LEXIS 10 (1912). Conclusiveness of finding of Com mission.  An objection that if the Commission has power to compel the separation of grades, it is within its power to require the expenditure of millions of dollars by the railroads of this State, is untenable. If the safety of travel and the rights of the public demand such expenditure, it should be made, and it will not be presumed that the State Corporation Commission will act from prejudice, or render an unjust or unfair decision against the railroad companies, but, on the contrary, will follow the mandate of the Constitution, that the action of the Commission appealed from shall be regarded as prima facie just, reasonable and correct. Southern Ry. v.

In case of a separation of grade by structure at a new, or an existin g, grade crossing, the project, except in special cases and under special circumstances to be mutually agreed upon by the Commissioner of Highways, the public road authority, and the railroad company or companies involved, shall be deemed to start at poi nts on each side of the tracks of the railroad or railroads where the grade, under the proposed plans and specifications, leaves the ground line to go over or under, as the case may be, the tracks of the railroad or railroads. In the event the Commissioner of Highways, the public road authority, and the railroad company or companies involved are unable to agree on (i) the necessity for the co nstruction of such underpass or overpass structure or for the widening, strengthening, remodeling, relocating or replacing of any existing overpass or underpass structure, (ii) the plans and specifications for and method or manner of construction thereof , or (iii) the portion of the work, if any, to be done and the share of the cost of such project, if any, to be borne by each of the railroad company or companies involved, the Commissioner of Highways or the public road authority shall petition the Stat e Corporation Commission setting forth the plans and specifications for and the method and manner of construction of such project and the facts which in his opinion justify the elimination of the crossing, the erection of a new separation of grade struct ure or the widening, strengthening, remodeling, relocating or replacing of an existing structure and the maintenance responsibility. Copies of the petition and the plans and specifications shall forthwith be served by the State Corporation Commission on the railroad company or companies involved. Within twenty days after service on it of such petition and plans and specifications, the railroad company or companies shall file an answer with the State Corporation Commission setting out its objections to t he proposed project and the Commission shall hear and determine the matter as other matters are heard and determined by that body. The Commission shall consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case and shall determine (a) whether public n ecessity and convenience justifies or requires the construction of such new separation of grade structure or whether an existing structure is so dangerous to or insufficient to take care of traffic on the highway as to require the widening, strengthening , remodeling, relocating or replacing proposed, (b) whether the plans and specifications or method and manner of construction are proper and appropriate, and (c) what portion of the work, if any, to be done and what share of the cost of such project, if any, to be borne by each of the railroad company or companies involved (excluding the cost of right-of-way) is fair and reasonable, having regard to the benefits, if any, accruing to such railroad or railroads from the elimination of such grade crossing or the widening, strengthening, remodeling, relocating or replacing any existing overpass or underpass structure, and either dismiss the proceeding as against the railroad company or companies involved or enter an order deciding and disposing of all of t he matters hereinbefore submitted to its jurisdiction. Grade crossings shall be closed when replaced by a new public highway. However, the Commonwealth Transportation Board or the public road authority may authorize the con tinued use of the crossing for a period of two years following the construction of the new highway to familiarize the public with the new route.

For article, Railroad Law, see 43 U. Rich. L. Rev. 337 (2008). CASE NOTES Hearing on n ecessity for eliminating grade crossing.  Former state statute (Acts 1930, c. 62) which attempted to authorize an administrative officer to require railway companies to eliminate existing grade crossings and substitute overhead crossings whenever in his opinion this was necessary for the public safety and convenience, and which provided no notice to or hearing of a company on the existence of such necessity and no means of reviewing the officers deci sion of it, violated the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Railroads share of contribution not limited to benefits accruing to it.  If the General Assembly had intended to limit a railroad companys share of the contribution to the benefits accruing to it from the elimination of a crossing it would have said so by clear words of limitation, such as not exceeding or not more than or not in excess of such benefits; that since such restrictive language is not written in the statute it may not be added under the guise o f interpretation. Southern Ry. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Fugate, 206 Va. 831, 147 S.E.2d 72, 1966 Va. LEXIS 158 (1966). Consideration of railroads benefits in determining its fair share of cost.  The phrase having regard to the benefits, if any, accruing to such railroad does not mean that its share of the cost should be limited to such benefits. I t is a direction that the Commission should consider such benefits, if any, among the facts and circumstances in determining the railroads fair and reasonable share of the cost. Southern Ry. v.

CASE NOTES The county authorities had no power to relieve the railroad of this duty owed to the public and required by this section either expressly or impliedly by constructing the approaches to the crossing of a less width than is required by the statute, if it has done so. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Faris, 156 Va. 205, 157 S.E. 819, 1931 Va. LEXIS 18 8 (1931). A street which has never been accepted or established is not a county road or highway (now public road) within this section. Washington-Virginia Ry. v. Fisher, 121 Va. 229, 92 S.E. 809, 1917 Va. LEXIS 27 (1917). This section applies to grade crossings constructed before the enactment of the statute as well as to crossings thereafter constructed. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Faris, 156 Va. 205, 157 S.E. 819, 1931 Va. LEXIS 188 (1931). Full width of road construed.  The words full width of the county road, (now public road) are to be given a reasonable construction in the light of the purpose for which the statute was enacted. The words mean the full width of the generally traveled way, which in the case of an improved road means the width of that portion of the roadbed which by its construction is designed and intended to be ordinarily used by persons traveling the road. So construed road does not include the ditches or slopes of the shoulders of the road, which, though maintained in such condition that they may be occasionally used by travelers, are not by construction designed or intended for general use. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Faris, 156 Va. 205, 157 S.E. 819, 1931 Va. LEXIS 188 (1931). Duty of railroad where w idth of road increased.  Under its continuing duty under this section, the duty of the railway company is not fully performed even when it has constructed a crossing to the full width of the then right-of-way of the road. If the county thereafter acquires a wider right-of-way and, to meet the needs of the traveling public, constructs a road wider than the old right-of-way, the railroad must increase the width of the lane of travel across its right-of-way to conform to the widened roadway.

Text Railroads shall cooperate with the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Department of Rail and Public Transportation in furnishing information and technical as sistance to enable the Commonwealth to develop plans and project priorities for the elimination of hazardous conditions at any crossing of a public highway which crosses at grade including, but not limited to, grade crossing elimination, reconstruction o f existing grade crossings, and grade crossing improvements. The Commonwealth shall provide each locality a listing of grade crossing safety needs for its consideration. Information collected and analyses undertaken by the designated state agencies are s ubject to 23 U.S.C. § 409. A railroad shall not unilaterally select or determine the type of grade crossing warning system to be installed at any crossing of a public highway and railroad at grade. The railroad shall only install or upgrade a grade cr ossing warning system at any crossing of a public highway and railroad at grade pursuant to an agreement with the Virginia Department of Transportation or representative of the appropriate public road authority authorized to enter into such agreements. A railroad is not required but is permitted to upgrade, at its own expense, components of any public highway at grade warning system when such upgrade is incidental to a railroad improvement project relating to track, structures or train control systems. When required by the Commissioner of Highways or representative of the appropriate public road authority, every railroad company shall cause a grade crossing warning de vice including flashing lights approved by the Department of Transportation at such heights as to be easily seen by travelers, and not obstructing travel, to be placed, and maintained at each public highway at or near each place where it is crossed by th e railroad at the same level. Such warning device shall be automatically activated by the approaching train so as to be clearly discernible to travelers approaching the railroad crossing from each direction at a distance of two-hundred feet. Such warning devices shall be erected at the initiative of the appropriate public road authority only when required by ordinance or resolution adopted by the Commissioner or the appropriate public road authority thereof stating that such political subdivision will p ay the full initial installation cost of such warning devices and that maintenance costs will be fixed as provided in § 56-406.2. A certified copy of such ordinance or resolution shall be delivered to such railroad company, and such railroad company s hall forthwith install such warning devices at the full initial cost of such public road authority. The cost of such installation and maintenance of such warning devices may be shared by agreement between such railroad company and the Commissioner of Hig hways or the appropriate public road authority, when initiating such installation. The railroad shall be responsible for the continuing maintenance of the warning devices. In the event that such Commissioner or representative of the appropriate public road authority and the railroad company or companies involved are unable to agree on (i) the necessity for such grade crossing warning device, or (ii) the plans and specifications for and the method and manner of construction or operation thereof, or (iii) the share of the cost of construction, if any, to be borne by the railroad company or companies involved, then the Commissioner of Highways or representative of the appropriate public road authority, as the case may be, shall petition the State Corporation Commission setting forth the grade crossing warning devices desired and the plans and specifications for and the method and manner of construction and operation of the devices desired and the facts which, in the opinion of the petitioner, justify the requiring of the same. Copies of the petition and plans and specifications shall be f orthwith served by the State Corporation Commission on the railroad company or companies involved. Within twenty days after service on it of such petition and plans and specifications, each such railroad company shall file an answer with the State Corpor ation Commission setting out its objections to the proposed project, and the Commission shall hear and determine the matter as other matters are heard and determined by that body. The Commission shall consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case and shall determine (a) whether public necessity justifies or requires the proposed warning devices, (b) whether the plans and specifications or the method and manner of construction and operation be proper and appropriate, and (c) what share of the cost of the project, if any, to be borne by any railroad company involved is fair and reasonable, having regard to the benefits, if any, accruing to such railroad company from providing such grade crossing warning devices, and either dismiss the pro ceeding as against such railroad company or enter an order deciding and disposing of all of the matters hereinbefore submitted to its jurisdiction.

Chandler v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 882 F. Supp. 533, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4344 (E.D. Va. 1995). Former § 56-405.3 and this section articulate concurrent obligations, but in so doing, the language does not eradicate the long-standing, independent, common-l aw duty imposed on railroads. Instead, the sections focus is on granting to certain governmental bodies authority to initiate a procedure for making railroad crossings safer in the public interest and for allocating costs between the railroad and government when the changes are required by the government. Chandler v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 882 F. Supp. 533, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4344 (E.D. Va. 1995). § 56-406.2. Proceeding for fixing cost of maintaining such warning devices at public grade crossings. Text Whenever any automatically operated gate, signal or other automatic crossing warning device has been or may hereafter be installed at any highway, road or street grade crossing by any railroad company, the Commissioner of Highways or the public road authority may agree with the railroad company involved as to the division of the cost of the future maintenance of any such device or devices. The basis for the division of costs shall be determined by the Department of Rail and Public Transportation utilizing the calculated average maintenance cost of all previous warning device maintenance performed and documented by all railroads operating in Virginia. In the event that the Commissioner or the public road authority and the railroad company involved are unable to agree upon the share of the cost of maintenance of any such device or devices to be borne by the railroad company, if any, then such railroad company may file a petition with the State Corporation Commission setting forth the crossing protection provided at such crossing, the terms of the contract and/or the conditions of the order of said Commission or the public road authority under which it was constructed and installed and the estimated future annual cost of maintaining the same. Copies of such petition shall forthwith be served by the State Corporation Commission upon the Commissioner of Highways or the public road authority who shall, within twenty days after service of such petition, file an answer thereto setting out reasons for declining to participate in the future cost of maintaining such warning device or devices as requested by the railroad company, and the Commission shall thereupon hear and de termine the matter as other matters are heard and determined by that body. The Commission shall consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case and shall determine what share of the cost of the future maintenance of such warning device or d evices, if any, shall be borne by the railroad company and/or the Commonwealth Transportation Board or the public road authority, having regard to the benefits, if any, accruing to such railroad company from the continued maintenance of such protection o f said public highway, road or street grade crossing, and either dismiss the proceeding or enter an order deciding and disposing of the matters therein submitted to its jurisdiction.

Craighead, 193 Va. 300, 68 S.E.2d 647, 1952 Va. LEXIS 137 (1952). And to protect human life. Norfolk S. Ry. v. Lassiter, 193 Va. 360, 68 S.E.2d 641, 1952 V a. LEXIS 144 (1952). This section and § 56-416 are closely interrelated and must be read and construed together and effect given to all of their provisions. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. White, 158 Va. 243, 163 S.E. 530, 1931 Va. LEXIS 294 (1931). This section and § 56-416 are closely related and must be read and construed together. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Gilliam, 211 Va. 542, 178 S.E.2d 499, 1971 Va. LEXIS 211 (1971). This section is mandatory. When there is a failure to obey the statute and an accident h appens as the proximate cause of such disobedience, the company cannot escape the imputation of negligence, although it substituted another warning signal for that prescribed by the statute, even though such signal was equally as effective as the statuto ry warning. Shiveley's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 125 Va. 384, 99 S.E. 650, 1919 Va. LEXIS 31 (1919); Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Simmons, 127 Va. 419, 103 S.E. 609, 1920 Va. LEXIS 61 (1920) (see also Simons Admr v. Southern Ry., 96 Va. 152, 31 S.E. 7 (1 898)). But giving of signals is not mandatory when crossing is not a public crossing.  Where the railroad constructed the crossing and the road leading to the highway beyond, and the road was not maintained by the county or the State and had in no w ay been accepted or recognized by either as a public road, it was held that the road leading to the crossing was not a public road and the crossing was not a public crossing, and consequently the giving of the statutory signals was not mandatory. Virgini an Ry. v. Rodgers, 170 Va. 581, 197 S.E. 476, 1938 Va. LEXIS 212 (1938) (decided prior to 2003 amendment). And this section has no application to incorporated cities and towns.

Where a railroad crossing is within the corporate limits of a town, the railroad company is not required to give the crossing signals required by this section. At lantic Coast Line R.R. v.

The warnings required by this section are not applicable to public grade crossings within the corporate limits of cities and towns. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Gilliam, 2 11 Va. 542, 178 S.E.2d 499, 1971 Va. LEXIS 211 (1971) (decided prior to 2003 amendment). In a negligence action, defendants engineer was exempt from the duty in this section to blow a whistle, because the accident occurred inside the corporate lim its of a city. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Wright, 217 Va. 515, 229 S.E.2d 890, 1976 Va. LEXIS 314 (1976) (decided prior to 2003 amendment). Warning obligation within ci ties and towns.  Absent a local ordinance, the railroad is obligated to give reasonable and timely warning of its approach to a crossing located within the corporate limits of cit ies and towns. Chandler v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 875 F. Supp. 1172, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1693 (E.D. Va. 1995). But this section permits a city or town to enact an ordinance regulating warnings to be given by trains approaching public grade crossings within their corporate limits. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Gilliam, 211 Va. 542, 178 S.E.2d 499, 1971 Va. LEXIS 211 (1971). And noncompliance with such an ordinance will invoke the comparative negligence provision of § 56-416, provided such noncompliance is a proximate cause of a collision. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Gilliam, 211 Va. 542, 178 S.E.2d 499, 1971 Va. LEXIS 211 (1971). This section throws a safeguard around persons using highways.  By the enactment of this section and § 56-416 it is manifest that what the legislature meant to do was to provide for the safety of those using the highways an d ways of the State thus to require reasonable things of railroads, the compliance with which would likewise inure to their benefit. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. White, 158 Va. 243, 163 S.E. 530, 1931 Va. LEXIS 294 (1931). What constitutes highway crossing.  An alley which crossed a railroad, though owned by a furniture company, was in constant use by numbers of persons employed by that company, and others, who crosse d the tracks there every day. There was evidence tending to show that the defendant company had recognized it as a highway crossing by the erection there of a whistle post. The crossing was clearly such a crossing as to fall within the letter and spirit of this section. Southern Ry. v. Abee's Adm'r, 124 Va. 379, 98 S.E. 31, 1919 Va. LEXIS 132 (1919). Section not applicable to accidents on track not at a crossing.  When this section and § 56-416 are read together, it is clear that the intention of these sections was to cover every case coming within their influence and to limit the consequences of failure to give the signals to crossing accidents. Therefore, these sections have no application to an accident on the track not at a crossing, although the party injured was near enough to the crossing to have been warned by t he signals if they had been given. C &amp; O Ry. v. Bullington's Adm'r, 135 Va. 307, 116 S.E. 237, 1923 Va. LEXIS 16 (1923) (see Norfolk S. Ry. v. Lassiter, 193 Va. 360, 68 S.E.2d 641 (1952)). But it is not limited to travelers intending to cross the railroad tracks.  This section requiring crossing signals to be sounded is not limited in its application to travelers along the highway intending to cross the railroad tracks at t he crossing, but applies to a traveler who is killed or injured at the crossing while traveling along the railroad tracks. Shiveley's Adm'r v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 125 Va. 384, 99 S.E. 650, 1919 Va. LEXIS 31 (1919). Section is applicable only to locomotives.  In an action for injuries received by the driver of two mules, who was struck at a crossing by a gasoline motor car operated by the railroad, he claimed that the case was governed by the crossing statutes. But these statutes only apply when the locomotive is used on a railway line operated by steam and the locomotive has a steam whistle. Franklin &amp; P. Ry. v. Shoemaker, 156 Va. 619, 159 S.E. 100, 1931 Va. LEXIS 21 7 (1931); Norfolk S. Ry. v. Lassiter, 193 Va. 360, 68 S.E.2d 641, 1952 Va. LEXIS 144 (1952). But it applies to locomotives regardless of motive power.  The 1950 amendment to this section does, of course, make sure that this section applies to locomotive engines regardless of motive power, but the act is only affi rmative and declaratory of a coverage already existing. Norfolk S. Ry. v. Lassiter, 193 Va. 360, 68 S.E.2d 641, 1952 Va. LEXIS 144 (1952). The language employed in this section as amended, coupled with the stated object of the revisors in recommending it, affords reasonable basis for the theory that the revisors assumed, as trial courts have held and as the Supreme Court has assumed on at least two occasions, that this section before amendment applied to each loco...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_56-415"><akn:num>§ 56-415</akn:num><akn:heading>Penalty for violation of § 56-414</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text Every officer or employee of any railway company, whose duty it shall be to carry out any of the provisions of § 56-414 and shall fail to do so, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten dollars for each offense.

CASE NOTES This section and § 56-414 are closely related and must be read and construed together. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Gilliam, 211 Va. 542, 178 S.E.2d 499, 1971 Va. LEXIS 211 (1971). This section substituted the doctrine of comparative negligence for that of contributory negligence. It is still necessary for the plaintiff to prove that the defendants negligence caused his injury, that but for it the injury would not have occurred, but having shown this he is not precluded from recovery by the fact that he himself w as negligent. Gregory v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 142 Va. 750, 128 S.E. 272, 1925 Va. LEXIS 377 (1925); Etheridge v. Norfolk S.R.R., 143 Va. 789, 129 S.E. 680, 1925 Va. LEXIS 304 (1925). Having shown that the defendants negligence caused plaintiffs injuries, and that but for it the injuries would not have occurred, the plaintiff is not pre cluded from recovery by the fact that he was himself negligent. Skinner v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 206 Va. 649, 145 S.E.2d 170, 1965 Va. LEXIS 246 (1965). This section abolishes the doctrine of contributory negligence as a complete bar to recovery and introduces in a modified form the doctrine of comparative neglige nce. C &amp; O Ry. v. Pulliam, 185 Va. 908, 41 S.E.2d 54, 1947 Va. LEXIS 228 (1947). This section removes contributory negligence as a complete bar to recovery and constitutes it a matter to be considered in mitigation of damages only when there i s failure to give the signals required by law, as, for example, the signals specifically required by § 56-414 to be given outside of incorporated cities and towns. C &amp; O Ry. v. Kinzer, 206 Va. 175, 142 S.E.2d 514, 1965 Va. LEXIS 184 (1965). It is the duty of a railroad to give the statutory crossing signals and its failure to do so is negligence which entitles the plaintiff to recover if such neglige nce caused the injury complained of. Gregory v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 142 Va. 750, 128 S.E. 272, 1925 Va. LEXIS 377 (1925). The negligence of plaintiff is not a bar to the action if the evidence is sufficient to prove that the crossing signals required by § 56-414 were not given. So uthern Ry. v. Barden, 200 Va. 98, 104 S.E.2d 13, 1958 Va. LEXIS 163 (1958). Although it may be conceded that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, in that he did not exercise all of the care required under the circumstances , yet this would not bar his recovery because contributory negligence, however gross or flagrant, is no bar to recovery where this section is applicable and there is evidence from which a jury may infer that the failure to give the signals proximately co ntributed to it in any degree or in any way. Virginian Ry. v. Craighead, 193 Va. 300, 68 S.E.2d 647, 1952 Va. LEXIS 137 (1952). Under the provisions of this section the contributory negligence of a traveler in approaching a railroad crossing does not bar recovery for an injury to or death of such traveler where there is evidence from which it may be fairly inferred that the failure to give the required crossing signals proximately contributed in any degree or in any way to causing such injury or death. Such contributory negligence of the traveler may and must be considered in mitigation of damages. C &amp; O Ry. v. Hanes, 196 Va. 806, 86 S.E.2d 122, 1955 Va. LEXIS 150 (1955). Availability of recovery.  Under Virginia law, contributory negligence will bar recovery in crossing accidents unless a crossing is public within the meaning of this section. Weaver v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 863 F. Supp. 291, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13199 (W.D. Va. 1994). If this section applies, and a train fails to abide by its duty to provide a signal of approach, comparative negligence is the rule. Weaver v. National R.R. Passe nger Corp., 863 F. Supp. 291, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13199 (W.D. Va. 1994). Applicabilit y of comparative negligence provision.  The comparative negligence provision contained in this section is operable only if the warnings required by § 56-414 are not given, and if the failure to give those warnings is a proximate cause of a collision. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Gilliam, 211 Va. 542, 178 S.E.2d 499, 1971 Va. LEXIS 211 (1971). Where the warnings set forth in § 56-414 were not required and the evidence failed to disclose an ordinance enacted pursuant to § 56-414 requiring approachi ng trains to give warnings at public crossings in the town of Glasgow, the comparative negligence provision of this section was not applicable. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Gilliam, 211 Va. 542, 178 S.E.2d 499, 1971 Va. LEXIS 211 (1971). Doctrine of comparativ e negligence is limited.  Even if it could be held that a violation of this section, as to warnings at crossings, would entitle any person injured by its violation, whether on a crossing o r not, to hold the railroad company liable therefor, it seems certain that the doctrine of comparative negligence introduced by this section can only be applied in cases of a collision on the crossing between a train or engine and a traveler on the highw ay. C &amp; O Ry. v. Bullington's Adm'r, 135 Va. 307, 116 S.E. 237, 1923 Va. LEXIS 16 (1923). If the crossing signals are given, this section does not apply, and under common-law pri nciples the contributory negligence of a traveler bars recovery. C &amp; O Ry. v. Hanes, 196 Va. 806, 86 S.E.2d 122, 1955 Va. LEXIS 150 (1955). Warning obligation within ci ties and towns.  Absent a local ordinance, the railroad is obligated to give reasonable and timely warning of its approach to a crossing located within the corporate limits of cit ies and towns. Chandler v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., 875 F. Supp. 1172, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1693 (E.D. Va. 1995). Sect ion refers to every engine, whatever the motive power.  When this section removed the bar of contributory negligence when the crossing signals were not given by any railroad engine or train, it referred to ever y railroad engine whether operated by steam, electricity, or other motive power, as expressly provided by § 56-1. Norfolk S. Ry. v. Lassiter, 193 Va. 360, 68 S.E.2d 641, 1952 Va. LEXIS 144 (1952). This section has not abrogated or modified the rule of law requiring a causal connection between the failure to give the signals and the injury. It has not changed the rules of evidence, or the nature or amount of evidence, required to establish such causal connection, and has not established, or given rise to, any new presumption of causal connection between the failure to give the signals and the injury. Virginian Ry. v. Haley, 156 Va. 350, 157 S.E. 776, 1931 Va. LEXIS 197 (1931); Johnson v. Richmond, F. &amp; P.R.R., 160 Va. 766, 169 S.E. 603, 1933 Va. LEXIS 256 (1933). This section has been consistently construed to mean that there must be a causal connection between the failure to give the statutory signals and the injury. In n o case has a recovery been allowed where the undisputed evidence showed that the plaintiffs negligence was the sole proximate cause of the collision. If the plaintiff sees that the train is approaching, the blowing of the whistle and the ringing of t he bell can give him no further information. C &amp; O Ry. v. Barlow, 155 Va. 863, 156 S.E. 397, 1931 Va. LEXIS 273 (1931); Southern Ry. v. Giles, 169 Va. 218, 192 S.E. 772, 1937 Va. LEXIS 169 (1937). This section did not change the law of negligence. It is still true that the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to prove that the operators of the train failed to give the statutory signals, and that such failure caused the injury. Gregory v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., 142 Va. 750, 128 S.E. 272, 1925 Va. LEXIS 377 (1925); Etheridge v. Norfolk S.R.R., 143 Va. 789, 129 S.E. 680, 1925 Va. LEXIS 304 (1925). Proof of failure of a railway company to give the prescribed signals at a crossing and proof of injury, with nothing more, is not enough to entitle a plaintiff to recover. Causal connection between the failure and the injury is an essential element of plaintiffs case, and the evidence must not leave the question of such connection in the realm of speculation or conjecture, but must afford a basis for legitima te inference in order to constitute a jury question. Danville &amp; W. Ry. v. Chattin, 192 Va. 216, 64 S.E.2d 748, 1951 Va. LEXIS 170 (1951). The establishment of a causal connection between the failure to give the signals and the injury is as essential an element, and as much a part of the plaintiff s case as the establishment of the fact that the defendant failed to give the statutory signals, or that he was injured. All three elements must be established by the ev...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_56-417"><akn:num>§ 56-417</akn:num><akn:heading>Repealed by Acts 1996, cc</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>114 and 157. § 56-417.1.

For related discussion, see 8B M.J. Fires, §§ 4, 13; 17 M.J. Streets and Highways, § 100. CASE NOTES This section is constitutional. C &amp; O Ry. v. May, 120 Va. 790, 92 S.E. 801, 1917 Va. LEXI S 160 (1917). Strictly construed.  This legislation is so radical a change of the common law that it is properly described as revolutionary. To such a statute the language used in Thompson v. Thomp son, 218 U.S. 611, 31 S. Ct. 111, 54 L. Ed. 1180 (1910), is fairly applicable: Conceding it to be within the power of the legislature to make this alteration in the law, if it saw fit to do so, nevertheless such radical and far-reaching changes shoul d only be wrought by language so clear and plain as to be unmistakable evidence of the legislative intention. Sisk v. White Oak Lumber Co., 14 F.2d 552, 1926 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1371 (D. Va. 1926). Private railroads not included.  The expression railroad company does not evidence a legislative intention to include those who own or operate private railroads as an incident to some oth er business. Sisk v. White Oak Lumber Co., 14 F.2d 552, 1926 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1371 (D. Va. 1926). A railroad is liable under this section for a fire originating in any of the following ways: (a) from coals, or cinders, dropped from an engine and thrown by the wheels on trash and dry vegetable matter on the right-of-way of the railroad company, from which the fire burned over the ground and communicated and set fire to plaintiff s property; (b) from sparks thrown from an engine on trash and vegetable matter on the right-of-way of defendant railroad, from which the fire burned over the ground and communicated and set fire to plaintiffs property; (c) from sparks thrown fro m an engine, beyond defendant railroads right-of-way onto plaintiffs property. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Spates, 122 Va. 69, 94 S.E. 195, 1917 Va. LEXIS 85 (1917). This section eliminates the issue of negligence as an essential ingredient. Such ingredi ent consists only of the existence of the fact of the setting out of the fire by the railroad company by sparks or coals (cinders) dropped or thrown from some one or more of its engines, and that, under such act, is the ultimate fact in issue. All eviden ce, whether circumstantial or direct, which tends to prove that issue, is admissible. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Spates, 122 Va. 69, 94 S.E. 195, 1917 Va. LEXIS 85 (1917); Virginian Ry. v. London, 148 Va. 699, 139 S.E. 328, 1927 Va. LEXIS 270 (1927); Southern R y. v. American Peanut Corp., 158 Va. 359, 164 S.E. 261, 1932 Va. LEXIS 259 (1932); Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Richmond Cedar Works, 160 Va. 790, 170 S.E. 5, 1933 Va. LEXIS 258 (1933); Southern Ry. v. Barker, 173 Va. 313, 4 S.E.2d 395, 1939 Va. LEXIS 197 (1939); C &amp; O Ry. v. Seay, 195 Va. 566, 79 S.E.2d 631, 1954 Va. LEXIS 136 (1954). Under this section the negligence of the railroad company is not an essential ingredient and the plaintiff need only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the fire was caused by sparks or coals emitted or thrown by the defendants engine. That fact the plaintiff may prove by direct or circumstantial evidence. Peck Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., 200 Va. 698, 107 S.E.2d 421, 1959 Va. LEXIS 1 58 (1959). Under this section it is not necessary in an action for damages by fire against a railroad for the plaintiff to allege that the fire was negligently set out by th e defendant, and such allegation in a declaration may be regarded as surplusage. C &amp; O Ry. v. Ware, 122 Va. 246, 95 S.E. 183, 1918 Va. LEXIS 91 (1918). The section did not change the rule that the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove that defendant railroad was responsible for the fire. Virginian Ry. v. London, 148 Va. 699, 139 S.E. 328, 1927 Va. LEXIS 270 (1927); C &amp; O Ry. v. Seay, 195 Va. 566, 79 S.E.2d 631, 1954 Va. LEXIS 136 (1954). Plaintiff is required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the fire was set out by the defendant. This, of course, can be done by circumstantial evide nce. Southern Ry. v. American Peanut Corp., 158 Va. 359, 164 S.E. 261, 1932 Va. LEXIS 259 (1932). Admissibility of evidence that defendants engines had started other fires in locality.  In an action against a railroad for damages by fire, it is not error to admit evidence for the plaintiff that other engines of the railroad company at other times in the past had thrown out sparks and cinders and in some cases had set out fires at and near the locality of the building of the plaintiff, for damages for the burning of which the action was brought. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Spates, 122 Va. 69, 94 S.E. 195 , 1917 Va. LEXIS 85 (1917). It is not necessary for an employee of the railroad company to have seen sparks fall from the engine and a fire started thereby before he is qualified to testify as to the origin of other fires. Southern Ry. v. Barker, 173 Va. 313, 4 S.E.2d 395, 1939 Va. LEXIS 197 (1939). Sufficiency of evidence.  Notwithstanding that there was no direct evidence before the jury that a train had in fact passed the point of origin of the fire at or about the time of the fire in question, where such fact was established by circumstantial evidence, the jury may infer from the fact of the passage of the train at that time, in connection with other facts, that the fire was set out by the train as it passed the point of origin o f the fire. C &amp; O Ry. v. Ware, 122 Va. 246, 95 S.E. 183, 1918 Va. LEXIS 91 (1918). A railroad company is not liable in a case where the evidence shows no more than the occurrence of a fire shortly after a train has passed. Southern Ry. v. Americ an Peanut Corp., 158 Va. 359, 164 S.E. 261, 1932 Va. LEXIS 259 (1932). In an action for damages occasioned by a fire alleged to have been caused by a train of defendant railroad, the evidence, although circumstantial, was held to sup port a verdict for plaintiff. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. v. Richmond Cedar Works, 160 Va. 790, 170 S.E. 5, 1933 Va. LEXIS 258 (1933). Plaintiffs evidence showed the weather was dry, there were combustible materials on the right-of-way, and the fires were discovered as soon as defendants train, drawn by a diesel engine, passed. The railroad showed, however, that diesel engines emit sparks only under certain conditions not existing at the time in question. On this evidence, the jurys verdict for defendant was warranted.

Such fence shall be adequate to enclose livestock. The owners of adjoining lands may connect their fences with such fences at such places as they may deem proper. In erecting such fences the company shall, at the termini of those portions of the roadbed which it is required to fence, and on each side of all public and private crossings, construct across its roadbed and keep in good repair cattle guards reasonably sufficient to turn all kinds of livestock, with which its fences shall be connected. Such cattle guards at private crossings may be dispensed with if the company erects sufficient gates and maintains them in good order. Such fences shall be constructed on the request of the landowner, in writing, by certified mail, to the registered agent of such railroad. If the company refuses or fai ls, for 180 days after such request, to construct or maintain the fences at the place designated, the owner, having given ten days notice in writing to such registered agent, may apply to the circuit court of the county or city in which any such poin t is located for the appointment of three disinterested freeholders, whose duty it shall be to go on the land and determine whether the proposed fence shall be constructed. Their decision shall be in writing, and shall be forthwith returned to and filed in the office of the clerk of such court. If such decision is that the fence ought to be constructed, the company shall, within sixty days thereafter, construct the same. Upon its failure so to do, it shall pay to the landowner fifty dollars for every da y of such failure. Any style of fence approved by the State Corporation Commission shall, if properly constructed and maintained, be deemed a sufficient fence within the meaning of this chapter. Any delay in construction or maintenance caused by inclemen t weather, war, strikes, acts of God, national emergencies or failure of any local, state, or federal governmental agencies to grant permits shall extend the aforesaid period. Any such company may erect gates or bars instead of the cattle guards required by this section, if, in the judgment of the company, the hazard to trains at such crossin gs requires gates or bars as a safeguard to life and property on the trains. If such fence, cattle guard or gate is destroyed or damaged due to the negligence of the landowner, the landowner shall be solely responsible for restoring or repairing such fen ce, cattle guard or gate. The circuit court of the county or city wherein any such fence or cattle guard, or any portion thereof, is to be erected or built pursuant to this section shall have ju risdiction through its power to grant equitable relief to compel the erection of any such fence, or building of any such cattle guards along or adjoining lands or lots actually enclosed.

A railroad company is liable under this section to the owner of stock killed or injured on its track by one of its trains, although the owner possessed no land either at the point where the stock was killed or injured, or at the point where the stock came upon the track. It is likewise liable if the stock strayed upon the track from the pub lic highway. Sanger v. C &amp; O Ry., 102 Va. 86, 45 S.E. 750, 1903 Va. LEXIS 106 (1903). Assessment for fencing.  Where, in proceedings to condemn lands for railroad purposes, commissioners assess the damages and designate a named sum as having been allowed for fencing on eit her side of the roadbed, the company has not the option of fencing the roadbed or suffering the penalty. The assessment of damages allowing for the cost of fencing, is proper and binding. Norfolk &amp; W.R.R. v. Stephens, 85 Va. 302, 7 S.E. 251, 1888 Va. LEX IS 37 (1888).

B. Upon reques t by a telecommunications service provider or cable television system to a public utility, both the public utility and the telecommunications service provider or cable television system shall negotiate in good faith to arrive at a mutually agreeable cont ract for attachments to the public utilitys poles by the telecommunications service provider or cable television system. C. After enter ing into a contract for attachments to its poles by any telecommunications service provider or cable television system, a public utility shall permit, upon reasonable terms and conditions and the payment of reasonable annual charges and the cost of any r equired rearrangement, the attachment of any wire, cable, facility or apparatus to its poles or pedestals, or the placement of any wire, cable, facility or apparatus in conduit or duct space owned or controlled by it, by such telecommunications service p rovider or cable television system that is authorized by law, to construct and maintain the attachment, provided that the attachment does not interfere, obstruct or delay the service and operation of the public utility or create a safety hazard. D. Notwithstan ding the provisions of subsection C, a public utility providing electric utility service may deny access by a telecommunications service provider or cable television system to any pole, duct, conduit, right-of-way, or similar facility owned or controlled , in whole or in part, by such public utility, provided such denial is made on a nondiscriminatory basis on grounds of insufficient capacity or reasons of safety, reliability, or generally applicable engineering principles. E. This sectio n shall not apply to any pole attachments regulated pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 224. F. The Commiss ion is authorized to determine just and reasonable rates, and terms and conditions of service, excluding safety and debt collection, for attachments to electric cooperative poles by telecommunications service providers or cable television systems if, fol lowing good faith negotiations to do so, the parties cannot reach agreement thereon; however, the Commission shall not determine rates or terms and conditions for any existing agreement until it expires or is terminated pursuant to its own terms. The ter ms of an expired or terminated agreement shall continue to govern while good faith negotiations or Commission review pursuant to this section are pending. Such determinations shall be made in accordance with the following: 1. Just and reasonable pole attachment rates and terms and conditions of service to be determined by the Commission shall include, without limitation, rearrangement and make-ready costs, pole replacement costs, and all other costs directly related to pole attach ments and maintenance, replacement, and inspection of poles or pole attachments, and right of way maintenance essential to pole attachments, provided however, that cost recovery for rearrangement, make-ready and pole replacement shall be addressed in ter ms and conditions, and shall not be included in annual rental rates; 2. In determining pole attachment rates, the Commission shall consider (i) any effect of such rates on the deployment or utilization, or both, of broadband and other telecommunications se rvices, (ii) the interests of electric cooperatives members, and (iii) the overall public interest; 3. The Commission may develop and utilize alternative forms of dispute resolution for purposes of addressing disputes (i) arising under this subsection and (ii) falling within the scope o f the Commissions authority established hereunder; 4. The Commission is authorized to assess reasonable application fees to recover appropriate Commission costs of proceedings arising under this subsection; and 5. The Commission is authorized to develop, if necessary, rules and regulations, including a definition of good faith negotiations, to implement this section.

As used in this article:Access lines are defined to include residence and business telephone lines and other switched (packet or circuit) lines connecting the customer premises to the public switched telephone network for the transmission of outgoing voice-grade telecommunications services. Centrex, PBX, or other multistation telecommunications services will i ncur a Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee on every line or trunk (Network Access Registrar or PBX trunk) that allows simultaneous unrestricted outward dialing to the public switched network. ISDN Primary Rate Interface services will be charged five Public Righ ts-of-Way Use Fees for every ISDN Primary Rate Interface network facility established by the customer. Other channelized services in which each voice-grade channel is controlled by the telecommunications service provider shall be charged one fee for each line that allows simultaneous unrestricted outward dialing to the public switched telephone network. Access lines do not include local, state, and federal government lines; access lines used to provide service to users as part of the Virginia Universal Service Plan; interstate and intrastate dedicated WATS lines; special access lines; off-premises extensions; official lines internally provided and used by providers of telecommunications service for administrative, testing, intercept, and verification p urposes; and commercial mobile radio service.Cable operator and cable system have the same meanings as contained in subsection A of § 15.2-2108.1:1. Centrex means a business telephone service offered by a local exchange company from a local central office; a normal single line teleph one service with added custom calling features including but not limited to intercom, call forwarding, and call transfer.ISDN Primary Rate Interface means digital communications service containing 24 bearer channels, each of which is a full 64,000 bits-per-second.Locality  has the same meaning as contained in § 15.2-102.Network Access Register means a central office register associated with Centrex service that is required in order to complete a call involving access to the public switched telephone network outside the confines of that Centrex company. Network Access Register may be incoming, outgoing, or two-way.New installation of telecommunications facilities or new installation includes the construction of new pole lines and new conduit systems, and the burying of new cables in existing public rights-of-way. New installation does not include adding new cables to existing pole lines and conduit systems. PBX means public branch exchange and is telephone switching equipment owned by the customer and located on the customers premises. PBX trunk means a connection of the customers PBX switch to the central office. Provider of local telecommunications service means a public service corporation or locality holding a certificate issued by th e State Corporation Commission to provide local exchange telephone service and any other person who provides local telephone services to the public for a fee, other than a CMRS provider as that term is defined in § 56-484.12. Provider of telecommunications service means a public service corporation or locality holding a certificate issued by t he State Corporation Commission to provide local exchange or interexchange telephone service to the public for a fee and any other person who provides local or long distance telephone services to the public for a fee, other than a CMRS provider as that t erm is defined in § 56-484.12.Public highway means, for purposes of computing the Public Right s-of-Way Use Fee, the centerline mileage of highways and streets which are part of the primary state highway system as defined in § 33.2-100, the secondary state highway system as defined in §§ 33.2-100 and 33.2-324, the highways of those cities and certain towns defined in § 33.2-119 and the highways and streets maintained and operated by counties which have withdrawn or elect to withdraw from the secondary system of state highways under the provisions of § 11 of Chapter 415 of the Acts of Assembly of 1932 and which have not elected to return.Subscriber means a person who receives v ideo programming, as defined in 47 U.S.C. § 522(20), distributed by a cable operator, as defined in subsection A of § 15.2-2108.1:1, and does not further distribute it. B. 1. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, there is hereby established a Public Ri ghts-of-Way Use Fee to replace any and all fees of general application (except for zoning, subdivision, site plan and comprehensive plan fees of general application) otherwise chargeable to a provider of telecommunications service by the Commonwealth Tra nsportation Board or a locality in connection with a permit for such occupation and use granted in accordance with § 56-458 or § 56-462. Cities and towns whose public streets and roads are not maintained by the Virginia Department of Transportation , and any county that has withdrawn or elects to withdraw from the secondary system of state highways under the provisions of § 11 of Chapter 415 of the Acts of Assembly of 1932, may impose the Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee on the ultimate end-users of local telecommunications service only by local ordinance. Localities, their authorities or commissions, and the Commonwealth Transportation Board may allow providers of telecommunications services and cable operators to use their electric poles or elect ric conduits in exchange for payment of a fee. 2. The Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee established by this section is hereby imposed on all cable operators that use the public rights-of-way. C.

In no year shall the amount of the fee be less than $0.50 per access line pe r month. D. The annual rate of the Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee shall be calculated by multiplying the number of public highway miles in the Commonwealth by a highway mileage rate (as defined in subsection E of this section), and by adding the number of feet of new installatio ns in the Commonwealth (multiplied by $1 per foot), and dividing this sum by the total number of access lines in the Commonwealth. The monthly rate shall be this annual rate divided by 12. E. The annual multiplier per mile is $425 per mile beginning July 1, 2001 and thereafter. F. The data us ed for the calculation in subsection D shall be based on the following information and schedule: (i) all providers of telecommunications services shall remit to VDOT by December 1 of each year data indicating the number of feet of new installations made during the one-year period ending September 30 of that year, which shall be auditable by affected localities, and the number of access lines as of September 30 of that year, which shall be auditable by affected localities; and (ii) the public highway mil eage from the most recently published VDOT report. By the following January 15, VDOT shall calculate the Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee to be used in the fiscal year beginning the next ensuing July 1 and report it to all affected localities and providers o f local telecommunications services. G. A provider of local telecommunications service shall collect the Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee on a per access line basis and the cable operator shall collect the Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee on a per subscriber basis by adding the fee to each ultimate end users monthly bill for local telecommunications service or cable service. A company providing both local telecommunications service and cable service to the same ultimate end user may collect only one Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee from that ultimate end user b ased on (i) the local telecommunications service if the locality in which the ultimate end user resides has imposed a Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee on local telecommunications service or (ii) cable service if the locality in which the subscriber resides h as not imposed a Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee on local telecommunications service. The Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee shall, when billed, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the monthly charge for local telecommunications service and cable service. Until the ultimate end user pays the Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee to the local telecommunications service provider or cable operator, the Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee shall constitute a debt of the consumer to the locality, VDOT, or the Departm ent of Taxation, as may be applicable. If any ultimate end user or subscriber refuses to pay the Public Rights-of-Way Use Fee, the local telecommunications service provider or cable operator shall notify the locality, VDOT, or the Department of Taxation, as appropriate. All fees collected in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be held in trust by the local telecommunications service provider and the cable operator until remitted to the locality, VDOT, or the Department of T axation, as applicable.

CASE NOTES Order pr oviding for billing of local taxes to customers.  An order of the State Corporation Commission amending telephone companys general schedule of rates so as to provide that when a political subdivision taxed th e company at a flat rate or one based on receipts or on poles, wires or conduits, such taxes should be billed pro rata to the customers of the company in the subdivision if their aggregate amount exceeded one half of one percent of the aggregate bills of the customers, was not arbitrary and without evidence to support it, but was a reasonable provision to prevent localities from levying taxes which otherwise would be passed on largely to the companys customers outside the political subdivision levyi ng the tax, thus upsetting the Commissions statewide system of ratemaking. Such order, however, was unreasonable in providing for billing of all taxes to consumers if the amount exceeded the stated percentage of all customers bills and was modifi ed to provide for such billing only of the excess of the tax over the stated percentage.

Text If under Chapter 10.1 (§ 56-265.1 et seq.) a certificate of public convenience and necessity is issued to a telephone company to provide interexchange service, the C ommission may, if it determines that such service will be provided on a competitive basis, approve rates, charges, and regulations as it may deem appropriate for the telephone company furnishing the competitive service, provided such rates, charges, and regulations are nondiscriminatory and in the public interest. In making such determination, the Commission may consider (i) the number of companies providing the service; (ii) the geographic availability of the service from other companies; (iii) the qua lity of service available from other companies; and (iv) any other factors the Commission considers relevant to the public interest. The Commission is authorized to promulgate any rules necessary to implement this provision; provided that any such rules so promulgated shall be uniformly applicable to all telephone companies that are subject to the provisions of this section.

For related discussion, see 15 M.J. Public Service and State Corporation Commissions, § 24. CASE NOTES Competitive rate s, not competition, are required.  The Commission considered and rejected the dominant carrier characterization of AT&amp;T adopted in other jurisdictions, noting that there is no Virginia stat utory authorization of such classification, and proceeded under the authority of this section. The Commission made the determination that the services of AT &amp; T of Va. will be provided on a competitive basis as required by this section before granting th e petition to set rates competitively. There was no requirement in the statute that equal access had to be afforded appellants before the Commission could make the crucial determination. The Code requires not a determination that competition exists but a determination that rates will be set competitively. GTE Sprint Communications Corp. v. AT &amp; T Communications of Va., Inc., 230 Va. 295, 337 S.E.2d 702, 1985 Va. LEXIS 281 (1985). Threat of competition could be considered as another factor under the fourth criterion o f this statute. Moreover, the crucial determination to be made by the Commission is whether rates will be competitively set. GTE Sprint Communications Corp. v. AT &amp; T Communications of Va., Inc., 230 Va. 295, 337 S.E.2d 702, 1985 Va. LEXIS 281 (1985). Commission decision is entitled to strong presumption of correctness and will not be set aside as unfair or unjust unless there appears to have been a clear abuse of legislative discretion. The Commission applied to the evidence the criteria suggested by this section and mandated by its Rule 9. There was ample evidence to support the commis sions decision. GTE Sprint Communications Corp. v. AT &amp; T Communications of Va., Inc., 230 Va. 295, 337 S.E.2d 702, 1985 Va. LEXIS 281 (1985). Granting or denial of motion for continuance is within discretion of Commission. The Com mission could reasonably decide that all six applications for competitive rate-setting should be heard at or about the same time because the same parties could be expected to be interested. The nature of the criteria to be reviewed logically compelled th at the six potential competitors be heard in a single proceeding or in related proceedings. MCI and GTE Sprint were pressing for expedited treatment of their applications and the Commission decided that expedited treatment of all the applications was jus tified. All interested parties were given the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. There has been no showing that the expedited hearing resulted in omission of material evidence from the record. The record shows that MCI and GT E Sprint were not prejudiced by the expedited hearing and that the Commission did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance and conducting the hearing as scheduled. GTE Sprint Communications Corp. v. AT &amp; T Communications of Va., I nc., 230 Va. 295, 337 S.E.2d 702, 1985 Va. LEXIS 281 (1985). § 56-481.2. Rates, charges and regulations for local exchange telephone services provided by new entrants. Text If, under subsection B of § 56-265.4:4, a certificate of public convenience and necessity is issued to a new entrant to provide local exchange telephone service, the Commission shall at the same time adopt a form of regulation for the new entrants local exchange services and, upon application pursuant to § 56-235.5, for the incumbent local exchange telephone company, that does not regulate the earnings of eit her. In approving the form of regulation of the new entrants local exchange services, the Commission shall do so in a manner that is equitable to the new entrant and the incumbent local exchange telephone company and in the public interest. In determ ining the appropriate form of regulation for the new entrant, the Commission shall: (i) consider whether the form of regulation reasonably protects the affordability of basic local exchange telephone service, as such service is defined by the Commission, and reasonably assures the continuation of quality local exchange telephone service; and (ii) find that such action will not unreasonably prejudice or disadvantage any class of telephone company customers or telephone service providers, including the ne w entrant and incumbent local exchange telephone company, and is in the public interest. In approving the appropriate form of regulation for the new entrant, the Commission may take such action as it deems appropriate in the public interest, with due con sideration being given to the competitiveness of the services, including deregulation and detariffing the services. Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive the Commission of its power to modify the form of regulation, after notice and an op portunity for hearing, if it finds that competition or the potential for competition no longer effectively regulates the price of a service. Except as provided for in this section and in subsection B of § 56-265.4:4, no other provision of law relating to the regulation of rates, charges, and regulation of local exchange telephone services shall apply to the provision of such services by new entrants.

B. Exchange shall mean a geographical area established for the administration of communication services and consisting of one or more central offices together with associated faci lities used in providing telephone exchange service. Exchanges are identified in the tariffs of the telephone companies as filed with the Commission. C. Local service area shall mean the entire area composed of an exchange or exchanges within which are located the telephones which a customer may call at the rates and charges sp ecified for local exchange service in the tariffs of the telephone companies as filed with the Commission. History History. 1976, c. 265. § 56-484.2. Extension or reduction upon poll of certain subscribers. Text A. Upon petiti on of five percent but in no case less than twenty-five of the subscribers in an established telephone exchange for an extension or reduction of their local service area to include or exclude a contiguous local exchange or exchanges, or upon resolution o f the governing body of a county for a countywide local service area, the Commission shall estimate the approximate change in the monthly rate for service which will result from such extension or reduction. In the case of a governing body resolution for countywide calling, the Commission, prior to estimating the approximate rate change, shall determine which exchanges within the county have a community of interest calling percentage that is fifty percent or greater in at least one direction to at least one other exchange within the county. The Commission shall then undertake to estimate the approximate change in the monthly rate for service that will result from such expanded local calling area for each such exchange. The Commission shall order the aff ected company or companies to poll those subscribers whose monthly rate for service would change if the proposed changes were adopted. However, polls shall not be required in the exchange or exchanges to which the petitioners desire an extension of local service if (i) any resulting rate increases in any twelve-month period do not, in the aggregate, exceed five percent of the existing monthly one-party residential flat rate service for the affected exchange to which the petitioners desire an extension o f local service or (ii) any resulting rate increases in any twelve-month period, in the aggregate, exceed five percent solely due to rate regrouping. No more than one petition for a poll from the same group of subscribers or resolution from the governing body of a county shall be considered by the Commission during any three-year period. For purposes of determining the exchanges that will be polled pursuant to this subsection, community of interest calling percentage means the percentage of cus tomers in an exchange that make one or more calls per month to another exchange within the county. B. If a poll i s required pursuant to subsection A and a majority of the subscribers are in favor of the proposed change, or if the Commission determines that a majority of subscribers voting are in favor of the proposed change, the Commission shall order the extension or reduction of their local service area. For the purposes of this section, the number of subscribers in an established telephone exchange shall be deemed to be the number of subscribers in an exchange as of January 1 of the calendar year when the petit ion is submitted to the Commission. Telephone subscribers shall be given thirty-five days from the day ballots are placed in the U.S. mail to return their survey form. Upon completion of the poll, results shall be duly certified to the Commission. C. If a poll i s not required pursuant to subsection A, the Commission shall require notice to customers in exchanges in which polls are not required and shall convene a hearing on the proposed extension or reduction of the local calling area if the lesser of five perc ent or 150 of the customers within such exchanges request a hearing. The Commission may convene a hearing under this subsection on its own motion without regard to the number of customers who request a hearing. D. Where the g overning body of a county passes a resolution for a countywide local service area under subsection A and the poll for such service is defeated, the governing body shall reimburse the affected company or companies for the costs of the poll. E. The Commiss ion shall give the highest priority to petitions or resolutions presented under subsection A that involve exchanges in rural areas.

B. The Commiss ion shall have the power to regulate the operator under this title as a public service corporation. The Commission shall also have the power, and be charged with the duties of reviewing and approving or denying the application, of supervising and control ling the operator in the performance of its duties under this chapter and title, and of correcting any abuse in the performance of the operators public duties. C. Pursuant to § 56-36, the Commission shall require annually from the operator a verified report describing the nature of its contractual and other relationships with individuals or entities contracting with the operator for the provision of significant financial, construction, or maintenance services. The Commission shall review the report and such other materials as it shall deem necessary for the purpose of determining improper or excessive costs, and shall exclude from the operators costs any amounts whic h it finds are improper or excessive. Included in such review shall be consideration of contractual relationships between the operator and individuals or entities that are closely associated or affiliated with the operator to assure that the terms of suc h contractual relationships are no less favorable or unfavorable to the operator than what it could obtain in an arms-length transaction. D. The Commiss ion also shall have the duty and authority to approve or revise the toll rates charged by the operator. Initial rates shall be approved if they appear reasonable to the user in relation to the benefit obtained, not likely to materially discourage use of the roadway, and provide the operator no more than a reasonable return as determined by the Commission. Thereafter, the Commission, upon application, complaint or its own initiative, and after investigation, may order substituted for any toll being charg ed by the operator, a toll which is set at a level which is reasonable to the user in relation to the benefit obtained and which will not materially discourage use of the roadway by the public and which will provide the operator no more than a reasonable return as determined by the Commission. Any proposed toll rates that fail to meet these criteria as determined by the Commission are contrary to the public interest, and the Commission shall not approve such toll rates.Any application to increase toll r ates shall include a forward-looking analysis that demonstrates that the proposed toll rates will be reasonable to the user in relation to the benefit obtained, not likely to materially discourage use of the roadway, and provide the operator no more than a reasonable return. Such forward-looking analysis shall include reasonable projections of anticipated traffic levels, including the impact of social and economic conditions anticipated during the time period that the proposed toll rates would be in eff ect. The Department shall review and provide comments upon the analysis to the Commission. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission shall not approve more than one year of toll rate increases proposed by the operator. E. If a change in the ownership of the facility or change in control of an operator occurs, whether or not accompanied by the issuance of securities as defined in subsection A of § 56-57 and § 56-65.1, the Commission, in any subsequent proceeding to set the leve l of a toll charged by the operator, shall ensure that the price paid in connection with the change in ownership or control, and any costs and other factors attributable to or resulting from the change in ownership or control, if they would contribute to an increase in the level of the toll, are excluded from the Commissions determination of the operators reasonable return, in order to ensure that a change in ownership or control does not increase the level of the toll above that level that woul d otherwise have been required under subsection D if the change in ownership or control had not occurred. As used in this subsection, control has the same meaning as provided in § 56-88.1. F. Pursuant to § 56-36, the Commission shall require an operator to provide copies of annual audited financial statements for the operator, together with a statement of the operators ownership. The operator shall file such statement within four months from the end of the operators fiscal year. G. The proceed s and funding provided to the operator from any future bond indenture or similar credit agreement must be used for the purpose of refinancing existing debt, acquiring, designing, permitting, building, constructing, improving, equipping, modifying, mainta ining, reconstructing, restoring, rehabilitating, or renewing the roadway property, and for the purpose of paying reasonable arms-length fees, development costs, and expenses incurred by the operator or a related individual or entity in executing suc h financial transaction, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission. H. The Commiss ion may charge a reasonable annual fee to cover the costs of supervision and controlling the operator in the performance of its duties under this chapter and pursuant to this section. I. Any agreeme nt between the operator and the Department made pursuant to this chapter shall not be construed to alter the duties, obligations, or powers of the Commission set forth in this chapter. J. Prior to re financing existing debt, an operator shall petition the Commission for approval to refinance such debt. The Commission may approve such petition only if the operator demonstrates (i) that it has the financial capability to pay off the debt incurred in th e refinancing over the term of the bond, loan, or similar instrument; (ii) that the term of the bond, loan, or similar instrument does not extend beyond the expiration of the operators current certificate of authority; (iii) that such refinancing wil l not increase toll rates; and (iv) that such refinancing is in the public interest.

CASE NOTES Construction.  Assuming without deciding that subsection D of § 56-542 controlled, the State Corporation Commission did not err in construing and applying the statute where t he Commission was fully aware of its broad discretionary authority to approve or revise the toll rates for a privately owned toll road, and it was self-evident that the Commission would ultimately decide to retain the existing toll rates given its findin gs that those rates met the subsection D criteria while the proposed lower rates did not.

The Commonwealth shall not obligate its full faith and credit on any financing of the operator. Assumption of operation of the project shall not obligate the Commonwealth to pay any obligation of the o perator whether secured or otherwise, from sources other than toll revenue. Subject to applicable permit requirements, the operator shall have the authority to cross any canal or navigable watercourse so long as the crossing does not unreasonably interf ere with navigation and use of the waterway.

The powers granted to the operator in this subsection shall not be deemed to limit the authority of the Commission to regulate the operator under this title. B. The operato r shall have the following duties: 1. It sh all file and maintain at all times with the Commission an accurate schedule of rates charged to the public for use of all or any portion of the roadway and it shall also file and maintain a statement that such rates will apply uniformly to all users with in any such reasonable classification as the operator may elect to implement. These rates shall be neither applied nor collected in a discriminatory fashion, and free vehicular passage shall be permitted to those persons referred to in subsection A of § 33.2-613. 2. It shall construct and maintain the roadway for anticipated use according to appropriate standards of the Department for public highways operated and maintained by the Department, and enlarge or expand the road when unsatisfied demand for use of the roadway makes it economically feasible to do so. The operator shall agree with the Department for inspection of construction work by the Department at appropriate times during any construc tion or enlargement. In addition, it shall cooperate fully with the Department in establishing any interconnection with the roadway that the Department may make. 3. It shall contract with the Commonwealth for enforcement of the traffic and public safety laws by state authorities, and may similarly contract with appropriate local authorities for th ose portions of the roadway within the local jurisdiction.

Retail comp etition for the purchase and sale of electric energy shall be subject to the following provisions: 1. Each incumbent electric utility owning, operating, controlling, or having an entitlement to transmission capacity shall join or establish a regional transmission entity, which entity may be an independent system operator, to which such utility shall transfer the management and control of its transmission system, subject to the provisions of § 56-579. 2. The generation of electric energy shall be subject to regulation as specified in this chapter. 3. Subject to the provisions of subdivisions 4 and 5, only individual retail customers of electric energy within the Commonwealth, regardless of customer class, whose demand during the mo st recent calendar year exceeded five megawatts but did not exceed one percent of the customers incumbent electric utilitys peak load during the most recent calendar year unless such customer had noncoincident peak demand in excess of 90 megawatt s in calendar year 2006 or any year thereafter, shall be permitted to purchase electric energy from any supplier of electric energy licensed to sell retail electric energy within the Commonwealth, except for any incumbent electric utility other than the incumbent electric utility serving the exclusive service territory in which such a customer is located, subject to the following conditions: a. If such customer does not purchase electric energy from licensed suppliers, such customer shall purchase electric energy from its incumbent electric utility. b. Except as provided in subdivision 4, the demands of individual retail customers may not be aggregated or combined for the purpose of meeting the demand limitations of this provisi on, any other provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding. For the purposes of this section, each noncontiguous site will nevertheless constitute an individual retail customer even though one or more such sites may be under common ownership of a single person. c. If such customer does purchase electric energy from licensed suppliers after the expiration or termination of capped rates, it shall not thereafter be entitled to purchase electri c energy from the incumbent electric utility without giving five years advance written notice of such intention to such utility, except where such customer demonstrates to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, through clear and co nvincing evidence that its supplier has failed to perform, or has anticipatorily breached its duty to perform, or otherwise is about to fail to perform, through no fault of the customer, and that such customer is unable to obtain service at reasonable ra tes from an alternative supplier. If, as a result of such proceeding, the Commission finds it in the public interest to grant an exemption from the five-year notice requirement, such customer may thereafter purchase electric energy at the costs of such u tility, as determined by the Commission pursuant to subdivision 3 d hereof, for the remainder of the five-year notice period, after which point the customer may purchase electric energy from the utility under rates, terms and conditions determined pursua nt to § 56-585.1. However, such customer shall be allowed to individually purchase electric energy from the utility under rates, terms, and conditions determined pursuant to § 56-585.1 if, upon application by such customer, the Commission finds tha t neither such customers incumbent electric utility nor retail customers of such utility that do not choose to obtain electric energy from alternate suppliers will be adversely affected in a manner contrary to the public interest by granting such pet ition. In making such determination, the Commission shall take into consideration, without limitation, the impact and effect of any and all other previously approved petitions of like type with respect to such incumbent electric utility. Any customer tha t returns to purchase electric energy from its incumbent electric utility, before or after expiration of the five-year notice period, shall be subject to minimum stay periods equal to those prescribed by the Commission pursuant to subdivision C 1. d. The costs of serving a customer that has received an exemption from the five-year notice requirement under subdivision 3 c hereof shall be the market-based costs of the utility, i ncluding (i) the actual expenses of procuring such electric energy from the market, (ii) additional administrative and transaction costs associated with procuring such energy, including, but not limited to, costs of transmission, transmission line losses , and ancillary services, and (iii) a reasonable margin as determined pursuant to the provisions of subdivision A 2 of § 56-585.1. The methodology established by the Commission for determining such costs shall ensure that neither utilities nor other r etail customers are adversely affected in a manner contrary to the public interest. 4. Two or more individual nonresidential retail customers of electric energy within the Commonwealth, whose individual demand during the most recent calendar year did not exceed five mega watts, may petition the Commission for permission to aggregate or combine their demands, for the purpose of meeting the demand limitations of subdivision 3, so as to become qualified to purchase electric energy from any supplier of electric energy licens ed to sell retail electric energy within the Commonwealth under the conditions specified in subdivision 3. The Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, approve such petition if it finds that: a. Neither such customers incumbent electric utility nor retail customers of such utility that do not choose to obtain electric energy from alternate suppliers will be adversely affected in a manner contrary to the public interest by granting such petit ion. In making such determination, the Commission shall take into consideration, without limitation, the impact and effect of any and all other previously approved petitions of like type with respect to such incumbent electric utility; and b. Approval of such petition is consistent with the public interest.If such petition is approved, all customers whose load has been aggregated or combined shall thereafter be subject in all respects to the provisions of subdivision 3 and shall be treated as a single, individual customer for the purposes of said subdivision. In addition, the Commission shall impose reasonable periodic monitoring and reporting obligations on such cust omers to demonstrate that they continue, as a group, to meet the demand limitations of subdivision 3. If the Commission finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such group of customers no longer meets the above demand limitations, the Commis sion may revoke its previous approval of the petition, or take such other actions as may be consistent with the public interest. 5. Individual retail customers of electric energy within the Commonwealth, regardless of customer class, shall be permitted: a. To purchase electric energy provided 100 percent from renewable energy from any supplier of electric energy licensed to sell retail electric energy within the Commonwealth, other than any incumbent electric utility that is not the incumbent electric util ity serving the exclusive service territory in which such a customer is located, if the incumbent electric utility serving the exclusive service territory does not offer an approved tariff for electric energy provided 100 percent from renewable energy; a nd b. To continue purchasing renewable energy pursuant to the terms of a power purchase agreement in effect on the date there is filed with the Commission a tariff for the incumbent ele ctric utility that serves the exclusive service territory in which the customer is located to offer electric energy provided 100 percent from renewable energy, for the duration of such agreement. 6. To the extent that an incumbent electric utility has elected as of February 1, 2019, the Fixed Resource Requirement alternative as a Load Serving Entity in the PJM Region and continues to make such election and is therefore required to obtain capacity for all load and expected load growth in its service area, any customer of a utility subject to that requirement that purchases energy pursuant to subdivision 3 or 4 from a supplier lice nsed to sell retail electric energy within the Commonwealth shall continue to pay its incumbent electric utility for the non-fuel generation capacity and transmission related costs incurred by the incumbent electric utility in order to meet the customer s capacity obligations, pursuant to the incumbent electric utilitys standard tariff that has been approved by and is on file with the Commission. In the case of such customer, the advance written notice period established in subdivisions 3 c and d shall be three years. This subdivision shall not apply to the customers of licensed suppliers that (i) had an agreement with a licensed supplier entered into before February 1, 2019, or (ii) had aggregation petitions pending before the Commission prior to January 1, 2019, unless and until any customer referenced in clause (i) or (ii) has returned to purchase electric energy from its incumbent electric utility, pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 3 or 4, and is receiving electric energy from such incumbent electric utility. 7. A tariff for one or more classes of residential customers filed with the Commission for approval by a cooperative on or after July 1, 2010, shall be deemed to offer a tariff for electr ic energy provided 100 percent from renewable energy if it provides undifferentiated electric energy and the cooperative retires a quantity of renewable energy certificates equal to 100 percent of the electric energy provided pursuant to such tariff.

All distrib utors shall have the obligation to connect any retail customer, including those using distributed generation, located within its service territory to those facilities of the distributor that are used for delivery of retail electric energy, subject to Com mission rules and regulations and approved tariff provisions relating to connection of service. B. Except as o therwise provided in this chapter, every distributor shall provide distribution service within its service territory on a basis which is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory to suppliers of electric energy, including distributed generation, as the Commission may determine. The distribution services provided to each supplier of electric energy shall be comparable in quality to those provided by the distribution utility to itself or to any affiliate. C. The Commiss ion shall establish interconnection standards to ensure transmission and distribution safety and reliability, which standards shall not be inconsistent with nationally recognized standards acceptable to the Commission. In adopting standards pursuant to t his subsection, the Commission shall seek to prevent barriers to new technology and shall not make compliance unduly burdensome and expensive. The Commission shall determine questions about the ability of specific equipment to meet interconnection standa rds. D. The Commiss ion shall consider developing expedited permitting processes for small generation facilities of fifty megawatts or less. The Commission shall also consider developing a standardized permitting process and interconnection arrangements for those power syst ems less than 500 kilowatts which have demonstrated approval from a nationally recognized testing laboratory acceptable to the Commission. E. Upon the se paration and deregulation of the generation function and services of incumbent electric utilities, the Commission shall retain jurisdiction over utilities electric transmission function and services, to the extent not preempted by federal law. Nothin g in this section shall impair the Commissions authority under §§ 56-46.1, 56-46.2, and 56-265.2 with respect to the construction of electric transmission facilities.

Generally promote the public interest, and are consistent with (i) ensuring that consumers needs for economic and reliable transmission are met and (ii) meeting the transmissi on needs of electric generation suppliers both within and without this Commonwealth, including those that do not own, operate, control or have an entitlement to transmission capacity. B. The Commiss ion shall also adopt rules and regulations, with appropriate public input, establishing elements of regional transmission entity structures essential to the public interest, which elements shall be applied by the Commission in determining whether to auth orize transfer of ownership or control from an incumbent electric utility to a regional transmission entity. C. The Commiss ion shall, to the fullest extent permitted under federal law, participate in any and all proceedings concerning regional transmission entities furnishing transmission services within the Commonwealth, before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Such participation may include such intervention as is permitted state utility regulators under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules and procedures. D. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to abrogate or modify: 1.

Subject to the provisions of § 56-585.1, the Commission shall continue to regulate pursuant to this title the distribution of retail electric energy to retail customers in the Commonwealth and, to the extent not prohibited by federal law, the transmission of ele ctric energy in the Commonwealth. B. The Commiss ion shall continue to regulate, to the extent not prohibited by federal law, the reliability, quality and maintenance by transmitters and distributors of their transmission and retail distribution systems. C. The Commiss ion shall develop codes of conduct governing the conduct of incumbent electric utilities and affiliates thereof when any such affiliates provide, or control any entity that provides, generation, distribution, or transmission services, to the extent neces sary to prevent impairment of competition. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent an incumbent electric utility from offering metering options to its customers. D. The Commiss ion shall permit the construction and operation of electrical generating facilities in Virginia upon a finding that such generating facility and associated facilities (i) will have no material adverse effect upon reliability of electric service provided by any regulated public utility, (ii) are required by the public convenience and necessity, if a petition for such permit is filed after July 1, 2007, and if they are to be constructed and operated by any regulated utility whose rates are regulated pursu ant to § 56-585.1, and (iii) are not otherwise contrary to the public interest. In review of a petition for a certificate to construct and operate a generating facility described in this subsection, the Commission shall give consideration to the effec t of the facility and associated facilities on the environment and establish such conditions as may be desirable or necessary to minimize adverse environmental impact as provided in § 56-46.1, unless exempt as a small renewable energy project for whic h the Department of Environmental Quality has issued a permit by rule pursuant to Article 5 (§ 10.1-1197.5 et seq.) of Chapter 11.1 of Title 10.1. In order to avoid duplication of governmental activities, any valid permit or approval required for an e lectric generating plant and associated facilities issued or granted by a federal, state or local governmental entity charged by law with responsibility for issuing permits or approvals regulating environmental impact and mitigation of adverse environmen tal impact or for other specific public interest issues such as building codes, transportation plans, and public safety, whether such permit or approval is prior to or after the Commissions decision, shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of thi s section with respect to all matters that (i) are governed by the permit or approval or (ii) are within the authority of, and were considered by, the governmental entity in issuing such permit or approval, and the Commission shall impose no additional c onditions with respect to such matters. Nothing in this section shall affect the ability of the Commission to keep the record of a case open. Nothing in this section shall affect any right to appeal such permits or approvals in accordance with applicable law. In the case of a proposed facility located in a region that was designated as of July 1, 2001, as serious nonattainment for the one-hour ozone standard as set forth in the federal Clean Air Act, the Commission shall not issue a decision approving s uch proposed facility that is conditioned upon issuance of any environmental permit or approval. The Commission shall complete any proceeding under this section, or under any provision of the Utility Facilities Act (§ 56-265.1 et seq.), involving an a pplication for a certificate, permit, or approval required for the construction or operation by a public utility of a small renewable energy project as defined in § 10.1-1197.5, within nine months following the utilitys submission of a complete ap plication therefore. Small renewable energy projects as defined in § 10.1-1197.5 are in the public interest and in determining whether to approve such project, the Commission shall liberally construe the provisions of this title. E. Nothing in this section shall impair the distribution service territorial rights of incumbent electric utilities, and incumbent electric utilities shall continue to provide distribution services within their exclusive service territories as established by the Commi ssion. Subject to the provisions of § 56-585.1, the Commission shall continue to exercise its existing authority over the provision of electric distribution services to retail customers in the Commonwealth including, but not limited to, the authority contained in Chapters 10 (§ 56-232 et seq.) and 10.1 (§ 56-265.1 et seq.) of this title. F. Nothing in this chapter shall impair the exclusive territorial rights of an electric utility owned or operated by a municipality as of July 1, 1999, or by an authority created by a governmental unit exempt from the referendum requirement of § 15.2-5403. Nor shal l any provision of this chapter apply to any such electric utility unless (i) that municipality or that authority created by a governmental unit exempt from the referendum requirement of § 15.2-5403 elects to have this chapter apply to that utility or (ii) that utility, directly or indirectly, sells, offers to sell or seeks to sell electric energy to any retail customer eligible to purchase electric energy from any supplier in accordance with § 56-577 if that retail customer is outside the geograp hic area that was served by such municipality as of July 1, 1999, except (a) any area within the municipality that was served by an incumbent public utility as of that date but was thereafter served by an electric utility owned or operated by a municipal ity or by an authority created by a governmental unit exempt from the referendum requirement of § 15.2-5403 pursuant to the terms of a franchise agreement between the municipality and the incumbent public utility, or (b) where the geographic area serv ed by an electric utility owned or operated by a municipality is changed pursuant to mutual agreement between the municipality and the affected incumbent public utility in accordance with § 56-265.4:1. If an electric utility owned or operated by a mun icipality as of July 1, 1999, or by an authority created by a governmental unit exempt from the referendum requirement of § 15.2-5403 is made subject to the provisions of this chapter pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this subsection, then in such eve nt the provisions of this chapter applicable to incumbent electric utilities shall also apply to any such utility, mutatis mutandis.

The Commiss ion shall establish capped rates, effective January 1, 2001, for each service territory of every incumbent utility as follows: 1. Cappe d rates shall be established for customers purchasing bundled electric transmission, distribution and generation services from an incumbent electric utility. 2. Capped rates for electric generation services, only, shall also be established for the purpose of effecting customer choice for those retail customers authorized under this chapter to purchase generation services from a supplier other than the incumbent utility during this period. 3. The capped rates established under this section shall be the rates in effect for each incumbent utility as of the effective date of this chapter, or rates subsequently placed into effe ct pursuant to a rate application filed by an incumbent electric utility with the Commission prior to January 1, 2001, and subsequently approved by the Commission, and made by an incumbent electric utility that is not currently bound by a rate case settl ement adopted by the Commission that extends in its application beyond January 1, 2002. If such rate application is filed, the rates proposed therein shall go into effect on January 1, 2001, but such rates shall be interim in nature and subject to refund until such time as the Commission has completed its investigation of such application. Any amount of the rates found excessive by the Commission shall be subject to refund with interest, as may be ordered by the Commission. The Commission shall act upon such applications prior to January 1, 2002. Such rate application and the Commissions approval shall give due consideration, on a forward-looking basis, to the justness and reasonableness of rates to be effective for a period of time ending as late as July 1, 2007. The capped rates established under this section, which include rates, tariffs, electric service contracts, and rate programs (including experimental rates, regardless of whether they otherwise would expire), shall be such rates, tariffs, contracts, and programs of each incumbent electric utility, provided that experimental rates and rate programs may be closed to new customers upon application to the Commission. Such capped rates shall also include rates for new services where, subseque nt to January 1, 2001, rate applications for any such rates are filed by incumbent electric utilities with the Commission and are thereafter approved by the Commission. In establishing such rates for new services, the Commission may use any rate method t hat promotes the public interest and that is fairly compensatory to any utilities requesting such rates. B. The Commiss ion may adjust such capped rates in connection with the following: (i) utilities recovery of fuel and purchased power costs pursuant to § 56-249.6, and, if applicable, in accordance with the terms of any Commission order approving the divestiture of generation assets pursuant to § 56-590, (ii) any changes in the taxation by the Commonwealth of incumbent electric utility revenues, (iii) any financial distress of the utility beyond its control, (iv) with respect to cooperatives that were not mem bers of a power supply cooperative on January 1, 1999, and as long as they do not become members, their cost of purchased wholesale power and discounts from capped rates to match the cost of providing distribution services, (v) with respect to cooperativ es that were members of a power supply cooperative on January 1, 1999, their recovery of fuel costs, through the wholesale power cost adjustment clauses of their tariffs pursuant to § 56-231.33, and (vi) with respect to incumbent electric utilities th at were not, as of the effective date of this chapter, bound by a rate case settlement adopted by the Commission that extended in its application beyond January 1, 2002, the Commission shall adjust such utilities capped rates, not more than once in a ny 12-month period, for the timely recovery of their incremental costs for transmission or distribution system reliability and compliance with state or federal environmental laws or regulations to the extent such costs are prudently incurred on and after July 1, 2004. Any adjustments pursuant to § 56-249.6 and clause (i) of this subsection by an incumbent electric utility that transferred all of its generation assets to an affiliate with the approval of the Commission pursuant to § 56-590 prior to January 1, 2002, shall be effective only on and after July 1, 2007. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 56-249.6, the Commission may authorize tariffs that include incentives designed to encourage an incumbent electric utility to reduce its fuel cost s by permitting retention of a portion of cost savings resulting from fuel cost reductions or by other methods determined by the Commission to be fair and reasonable to the utility and its customers. C. A utility m ay petition the Commission to terminate the capped rates to all customers any time after January 1, 2004, and such capped rates may be terminated upon the Commission finding of an effectively competitive market for generation services within the service territory of that utility. If its capped rates, as established and adjusted from time to time pursuant to subsections A and B, are continued after January 1, 2004, an incumbent electric utility that is not, as of the effective date of this chapter, bound by a rate case settlement adopted by the Commission that extends in its application beyond January 1, 2002, may petition the Commission, during the period January 1, 2004, through June 30, 2007, for approval of a one-time change in its rates, and if the capped rates are continued after July 1, 2007, such incumbent electric utility may at any time after July 1, 2007, petition the Commission for approval of a one-time change in its rates. Any change in rates pursuant to this subsection by an incumbent el ectric utility that divested its generation assets with approval of the Commission pursuant to § 56-590 prior to January 1, 2002, shall be in accordance with the terms of any Commission order approving such divestiture. Any petition for changes to cap ped rates filed pursuant to this subsection shall be governed by the provisions of Chapter 10 (§ 56-232 et seq.) of this title. D. Until the e xpiration or termination of capped rates as provided in this section, the incumbent electric utility, consistent with the functional separation plan implemented under § 56-590, shall make electric service available at capped rates established under th is section to any customer in the incumbent electric utilitys service territory, including any customer that, until the expiration or termination of capped rates, requests such service after a period of utilizing service from another supplier. E. During the period when capped rates are in effect for an incumbent electric utility, such utility may file with the Commission a plan describing the method used by such utility to assure full funding of its nuclear decommissioning obligation and specifying the amou nt of the revenues collected under either the capped rates, as provided in this section, or the wires charges, as provided in former § 56-583, that are dedicated to funding such nuclear decommissioning obligation under the plan. The Commission shall a pprove the plan upon a finding that the plan is not contrary to the public interest. F. The capped rates established pursuant to this section shall expire on December 31, 2008, unless sooner terminated by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of subsection C; however, rates after the expiration or termination of capped rates shall equal capped rat es until such rates are changed pursuant to other provisions of this title.

During the first six months of 2009, the Commission shall, after notice and opportunity for hearing, initiate proceedings to review the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of generation, distribution and transmission services of each investor-owned incumb ent electric utility. Such proceedings shall be governed by the provisions of Chapter 10 (§ 56-232 et seq.), except as modified herein. In such proceedings the Commission shall determine fair rates of return on common equity applicable to the generati on and distribution services of the utility. In so doing, the Commission may use any methodology to determine such return it finds consistent with the public interest, but such return shall not be set lower than the average of the returns on common equit y reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the three most recent annual periods for which such data are available by not less than a majority, selected by the Commission as specified in subdivision 2 b, of other investor-owned electric util ities in the peer group of the utility, nor shall the Commission set such return more than 300 basis points higher than such average. The peer group of the utility shall be determined in the manner prescribed in subdivision 2 b. The Commission may increa se or decrease such combined rate of return by up to 100 basis points based on the generating plant performance, customer service, and operating efficiency of a utility, as compared to nationally recognized standards determined by the Commission to be ap propriate for such purposes. In such a proceeding, the Commission shall determine the rates that the utility may charge until such rates are adjusted. If the Commission finds that the utilitys combined rate of return on common equity is more than 50 basis points below the combined rate of return as so determined, it shall be authorized to order increases to the utilitys rates necessary to provide the opportunity to fully recover the costs of providing the utilitys services and to earn not le ss than such combined rate of return. If the Commission finds that the utilitys combined rate of return on common equity is more than 50 basis points above the combined rate of return as so determined, it shall be authorized either (i) to order reduc tions to the utilitys rates it finds appropriate, provided that the Commission may not order such rate reduction unless it finds that the resulting rates will provide the utility with the opportunity to fully recover its costs of providing its servic es and to earn not less than the fair rates of return on common equity applicable to the generation and distribution services; or (ii) to direct that 60 percent of the amount of the utilitys earnings that were more than 50 basis points above the fair combined rate of return for calendar year 2008 be credited to customers bills, in which event such credits shall be amortized over a period of six to 12 months, as determined at the discretion of the Commission, following the effective date of the C ommissions order and be allocated among customer classes such that the relationship between the specific customer class rates of return to the overall target rate of return will have the same relationship as the last approved allocation of revenues u sed to design base rates. Commencing in 2011, the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall conduct reviews of the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of generation, distribution and transmission services by each investor-owne d incumbent electric utility, subject to the following provisions: 1. Rates , terms and conditions for each service shall be reviewed separately on an unbundled basis, and such reviews shall be conducted in a single, combined proceeding. Pursuant to subsection A of § 56-585.1:1, the Commission shall conduct a review for a Pha se I Utility in 2020, utilizing the three successive 12-month test periods beginning January 1, 2017, and ending December 31, 2019. Thereafter, reviews for a Phase I Utility will be on a triennial basis with subsequent proceedings utilizing the three suc cessive 12-month test periods ending December 31 immediately preceding the year in which such review proceeding is conducted. Pursuant to subsection A of § 56-585.1:1, the Commission shall conduct a review for a Phase II Utility in 2021, utilizing the four successive 12-month test periods beginning January 1, 2017, and ending December 31, 2020, with subsequent reviews on a triennial basis utilizing the three successive 12-month test periods ending December 31 immediately preceding the year in which s uch review proceeding is conducted. All such reviews occurring after December 31, 2017, shall be referred to as triennial reviews. For purposes of this section, a Phase I Utility is an investor-owned incumbent electric utility that was, as of July 1, 199 9, not bound by a rate case settlement adopted by the Commission that extended in its application beyond January 1, 2002, and a Phase II Utility is an investor-owned incumbent electric utility that was bound by such a settlement. 2. Subject to the provisions of subdivision 6, the fair rate of return on common equity applicable separately to the generation and distribution services of such utility, and for the two such services combined, and for any rate adjustment clauses approved under subdivision 5 or 6, shall be determined by the Commission during each such triennial review, as follows: a. The Commission may use any methodology to determine such return it finds consistent with the public interest, but for applications received by the Commission on or after January 1, 2020, such return shall not be set lower than the average of either (i) t he returns on common equity reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the three most recent annual periods for which such data are available by not less than a majority, selected by the Commission as specified in subdivision 2 b, of other in vestor-owned electric utilities in the peer group of the utility subject to such triennial review or (ii) the authorized returns on common equity that are set by the applicable regulatory commissions for the same selected peer group, nor shall the Commis sion set such return more than 150 basis points higher than such average. b. In selecting such majority of peer group investor-owned electric utilities for applications received by the Commission on or after January 1, 2020, the Commission shall first remo ve from such group the two utilities within such group that have the lowest reported or authorized, as applicable, returns of the group, as well as the two utilities within such group that have the highest reported or authorized, as applicable, returns o f the group, and the Commission shall then select a majority of the utilities remaining in such peer group. In its final order regarding such triennial review, the Commission shall identify the utilities in such peer group it selected for the calculation of such limitation. For purposes of this subdivision, an investor-owned electric utility shall be deemed part of such peer group if (i) it...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_56-586"><akn:num>§ 56-586</akn:num><akn:heading>Emergency service provider</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text On and after January 1, 2001, if any supplier fails to fulfill an obligation, resulting in the failure of retail electric energy to be delivered into the control area s erving the suppliers retail customer, the entity fulfilling the control area function, or, if applicable, the regional transmission entity or other entity as designated by the Commission, shall be responsible for charging the defaulting supplier for the full cost of replacement energy, including the cost of energy, the cost incurred by others as a result of the default, and the assessment of penalties as may be approved either by the Commission, to the extent not precluded by federal law, or by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

History History. 1999, c. 411. § 56-586.1. Electric energy emergencies. Text A. As used in this section, electric energy emergency means an unplanned interruption in the generation or tran smission of electricity resulting from a hurricane, ice storm, windstorm, earthquake or similar natural phenomena, or from a criminal act affecting such generation or transmission, act of war or act of terrorism, which interruption is (i) of such severit y that minimum levels of reliable service cannot be maintained using resources practicably obtainable from the market and (ii) so imminently and substantially threatening to the health, safety or welfare of residents of this Commonwealth that immediate a ction of state government is necessary to prevent loss of life, protect the public health or safety, and prevent unnecessary or avoidable damage to property. B. The Governo r is authorized, after finding that an electric energy emergency exists and that appropriate federal and state agencies and appropriate reliability councils cannot adequately address such emergency, to declare an electric energy emergency by filing a wri tten declaration with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The declaration shall state the counties and cities or utility service areas of the Commonwealth in which the declaration is applicable, or its statewide application. A declared electric energy eme rgency shall go into immediate effect upon filing and continue in effect for the period prescribed in the declaration, but not more than thirty days. At the end of the prescribed period, the Governor may issue another declaration extending the emergency. The Governor shall terminate such declaration as soon as the basis for such declaration no longer exists. C. During a de clared electric energy emergency, the Governor is authorized, in compliance with guidelines of the Department of Emergency Services promulgated as provided in subsection G, to require any generator or any municipal electric utility that is capable of gen erating but (i) is not generating or (ii) is not generating at its full potential during such declared electric emergency, to generate, dispatch or sell electricity from a facility that it operates within the Commonwealth, to the Commonwealth for distrib ution within the areas of the Commonwealth designated in the declaration. The quantity of electricity required to be generated, dispatched or sold, and the duration of such requirements, shall be as determined by the Governor to be necessary to alleviate the electric energy emergency hardship. The Commonwealth shall compensate an entity required to generate, dispatch, or sell electricity pursuant to this subsection, and the operator of any transmission facilities over which the electricity is transmitte d, in the manner provided in § 56-522, mutatis mutandis, unless otherwise provided by federal law. The Department of Environmental Quality, the State Air Pollution Control Board, the State Water Control Board, and the Virginia Waste Management Board shall issue any temporary or emergency permit, order, or variance necessary to authorize any permit amendments or other changes needed to meet the requirements imposed under this section and the Governor may petition the President to declare a regional e nergy emergency under 42 U.S.C. § 7410(f) as necessary to suspend enforcement of any provision of the federal Clean Air Act. Any increased operation required during such declared emergency shall not be counted towards the number of hours of operation allowed during the year. No civil charges or penalties shall be imposed for any violation that occurs as a result of actions taken that are necessary for the required generation, dispatch or sale during the declared electric energy emergency. The foregoi ng provisions shall apply to all actions the entity takes in connection with such required generation, dispatch or sale during the period of the declared emergency. D. During a de clared electric energy emergency, the Governor may use the services, equipment, supplies, and facilities of existing departments, offices, and agencies of the Commonwealth, and of the political subdivisions thereof, to the maximum extent practicable and necessary to meet the electric energy emergency. The officers and personnel of all such departments, offices, and agencies shall cooperate with and extend such services and facilities to the Governor upon request. E. During a de clared electric energy emergency, the Governor is authorized to request the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy to invoke section 202(C) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. § 824a (1935). F. The General Assembly is authorized by joint resolution to terminate any declaration of an electric energy emergency. The emergency shall be terminated at the time of filing of the joint resolution with the Secretary of the Commonwealth. G. The Departm ent of Emergency Services, in consultation with the Commission and the Secretary of Commerce and Trade, shall establish guidelines for the implementation of the Governors powers pursuant to subsection C that protect the public health and safety and p revent unnecessary or avoidable damage to property with a minimum of economic disruption to generators, transmitters and distributors of electricity. Such guidelines shall: 1. Defin e various foreseeable levels of electric energy emergencies and specify appropriate measures to be taken for each type of electric energy emergency as necessary to protect the public health or safety or prevent unnecessary or avoidable damage to property ; 2. Prescribe appropriate response measures for each level of electric energy emergency; and 3. Equitably distribute the burdens and benefits resulting from the implementation of this section among other members of the affected class of persons within all geographic regions of th e Commonwealth.

The Commiss ion shall not require any incumbent electric utility to divest itself of any generation, transmission or distribution assets pursuant to any provision of this chapter. B. 1. The Commission shall, however, direct the functional separation of generation, retai l transmission and distribution of all incumbent electric utilities in connection with the provisions of this chapter to be completed by January 1, 2002. 2. By January 1, 2001, each incumbent electric utility shall submit to the Commission a plan for such functional separation which may be accomplished through the creation of affiliates, o r through such other means as may be acceptable to the Commission. 3. Consistent with this chapter, the Commission may impose conditions, as the public interest requires, upon its approval of any incumbent electric utilitys plan for functional separa tion, including requirements that (i) the incumbent electric utilitys generation assets or, at the election of the incumbent electric utility and if approved by the Commission pursuant to subdivision 4 of this subsection, their equivalent are made av ailable for electric service during the capped rate period as provided in § 56-582 and, if applicable, during any period the distributor serves as a default provider as provided for in § 56-585; (ii) the incumbent electric utility receive Commissio n approval for the sale, transfer or other disposition of generation assets during the capped rate period and, if applicable, during any period the distributor serves as a default provider; and (iii) any such generation asset sold, transferred, or otherw ise disposed of by the incumbent electric utility with Commission approval shall not be further sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of during the capped rate period and, if applicable, during any period the distributor serves as default provider, wi thout additional Commission approval. 4. If an incumbent electric utility proposes that the equivalent to its generation assets be made available pursuant to subdivision 3 of this subsection, the Commission shall determine th e adequacy of such proposal and shall approve or reject such proposal based on the public interest. 5. In exercising its authority under the provisions of this section and under § 56-90, the Commission shall have no authority to regulate, on a cost-of-service basis or other basis, th e price at which generation assets or their equivalent are made available for default service purposes. Such restriction on the Commissions authority to regulate, on a cost-of-service basis or other basis, prices for default service shall not affect the ability of a distributor to offer to provide, and of the Commission to approve if appropriate the provision of, such services on a cost plus basis or any other basis. The Commissions authority to regulate the price of default service shall be con sistent with the pricing provisions applicable to a distributor pursuant to § 56-585. In addition, the Commission shall, in exercising its responsibilities under this section and under § 56-90, consider, among other factors, the potential effects o f any such transfer on: (i) rates and reliability of capped rate service under § 56-582, and of default service under § 56-585, and (ii) the development of a competitive market in the Commonwealth for retail generation services. However, the Commis sion may not deny approval of a transfer proposed by an incumbent electric utility, pursuant to subdivisions 2 and 4 of this subsection, due to an inability to determine, at the time of consideration of the transfer, default service prices under § 56- 585. C. The Commiss ion shall, to the extent necessary to promote effective competition in the Commonwealth, promulgate rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this section, which rules and regulations shall include provisions: 1. Prohi biting cost-shifting or cross-subsidies between functionally separate units; 2. Prohibiting functionally separate units from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or self-dealing; 3. Prohibiting affiliated entities from engaging in discriminatory behavior towards nonaffiliated units; and 4. Establishing codes of conduct detailing permissible relations between functionally separate units. D. Neither a c overed entity nor an affiliate thereof may be a party to a covered transaction without the prior approval of the Commission. Any such person proposing to be a party to such transaction shall file an application with the Commission. The Commission shall a pprove or disapprove such transaction within sixty days after the filing of a completed application; however, the sixty-day period may be extended by Commission order for a period not to exceed an additional 120 days. The application shall be deemed appr oved if the Commission fails to act within such initial or extended period. The Commission shall approve such application if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the transaction will comply with the requirements of subsection E, and m ay, as a part of its approval, establish such conditions or limitations on such transaction as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with subsection E. E. A transacti on described in subsection D shall not: 1. Subst antially lessen competition among the actual or prospective providers of noncompetitive electric service or of a service which is, or is likely to become, a competitive electric service; or 2. Jeopardize or impair the safety or reliability of electric service in the Commonwealth, or the provision of any noncompetitive electric service at just and reasonable rates. F. Except as p rovided in subdivision B 5, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to abrogate or modify the Commissions authority under Chapter 3 (§ 56-55 et seq.), 4 (§ 56-76 et seq.) or 5 (§ 56-88 et seq.) of this title. However, any person subject to t he requirements of subsection D that is also subject to the requirements of Chapter 5 of this title may be exempted from compliance with the requirements of Chapter 5 of this title.

The Commiss ion shall establish by regulation a program that affords eligible customer-generators the opportunity to participate in net energy metering, and a program, to begin no later than July 1, 2014, for customers of investor-owned utilities and to begin no lat er than July 1, 2015, and to end July 1, 2019, for customers of electric cooperatives as provided in subsection G, to afford eligible agricultural customer-generators the opportunity to participate in net energy metering. The regulations may include, but need not be limited to, requirements for (i) retail sellers; (ii) owners or operators of distribution or transmission facilities; (iii) providers of default service; (iv) eligible customer-generators; (v) eligible agricultural customer-generators; or (v i) any combination of the foregoing, as the Commission determines will facilitate the provision of net energy metering, provided that the Commission determines that such requirements do not adversely affect the public interest. On and after July 1, 2017, small agricultural generators or eligible agricultural customer-generators may elect to interconnect pursuant to the provisions of this section or as small agricultural generators pursuant to § 56-594.2, but not both. Existing eligible agricultural c ustomer-generators may elect to become small agricultural generators, but may not revert to being eligible agricultural customer-generators after such election. On and after July 1, 2019, interconnection of eligible agricultural customer-generators shall cease for electric cooperatives only, and such facilities shall interconnect solely as small agricultural generators. For electric cooperatives, eligible agricultural customer-generators whose renewable energy generating facilities were interconnected b efore July 1, 2019, may continue to participate in net energy metering pursuant to this section for a period not to exceed 25 years from the date of their renewable energy generating facilitys original interconnection. B. For the pur pose of this section:Eligible agricultural customer-generator means a customer that operates a re newable energy generating facility as part of an agricultural business, which generating facility (i) uses as its sole energy source solar power, wind power, or aerobic or anaerobic digester gas, (ii) does not have an aggregate generation capacity of mor e than 500 kilowatts, (iii) is located on land owned or controlled by the agricultural business, (iv) is connected to the customers wiring on the customers side of its interconnection with the distributor; (v) is interconnected and operated in pa rallel with an electric companys transmission and distribution facilities, and (vi) is used primarily to provide energy to metered accounts of the agricultural business. An eligible agricultural customer-generator may be served by multiple meters ser ving the eligible agricultural customer-generator that are located at the same or adjacent sites, such that the eligible agricultural customer-generator may aggregate in a single account the electricity consumption and generation measured by the meters, provided that the same utility serves all such meters. The aggregated load shall be served under the appropriate tariff.Eligible customer-generator means a customer that owns and operates, or contracts with other persons to own, operate, or both, an electrical generating facility that (i) has a capacity of not more than 25 kilowatts for residential customers and not more than three megawatts for nonresidential customers; (ii) uses as its total source of fuel renewable energy, as defined in § 56-576; (iii) is located on land owned or leased by the customer and is connected to the customers w iring on the customers side of its interconnection with the distributor; (iv) is interconnected and operated in parallel with an electric companys transmission and distribution facilities; and (v) is intended primarily to offset all or part of th e customers own electricity requirements. In addition to the electrical generating facility size limitations in clause (i), the capacity of any generating facility installed under this section between July 1, 2015, and July 1, 2020, shall not exceed the expected annual energy consumption based on the previous 12 months of billing history or an annualized calculation of billing history if 12 months of billing history is not available. In addition to the electrical generating facility size limitation in clause (i), in the certificated service territory of a Phase I Utility, the capacity of any generating facility installed under this section after July 1, 2020, shall not exceed 100 percent of the expected annual energy consumption based on the previo us 12 months of billing history or an annualized calculation of billing history if 12 months of billing history is not available, and in the certificated service territory of a Phase II Utility, the capacity of any generating facility installed under thi s section after July 1, 2020, shall not exceed 150 percent of the expected annual energy consumption based on the previous 12 months of billing history or an annualized calculation of billing history if 12 months of billing history is not available. Net energy metering means measuring the difference, over the net metering period, between (i) electric ity supplied to an eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator from the electric grid and (ii) the electricity generated and fed back to the electric grid by the eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-ge nerator.Net metering period means the 12-month period following the date of final interconnection of the eligible customer-generators or eligible agricultural customer-generators system with an electric service provider, and each 12-month period thereafter.Small ag ricultural generator has the same meaning that is ascribed to that term in § 56-594.2. C. The Commiss ions regulations shall ensure that (i) the metering equipment installed for net metering shall be capable of measuring the flow of electricity in two directions and (ii) any eligible customer-generator seeking to participate in net energy metering sh all notify its supplier and receive approval to interconnect prior to installation of an electrical generating facility. The electric distribution company shall have 30 days from the date of notification for residential facilities, and 60 days from the d ate of notification for nonresidential facilities, to determine whether the interconnection requirements have been met. Such regulations shall allocate fairly the cost of such equipment and any necessary interconnection. An eligible customer-generator s electrical generating system, and each electrical generating system of an eligible agricultural customer-generator, shall meet all applicable safety and performance standards established by the National Electrical Code, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and accredited testing laboratories such as Underwriters Laboratories. Beyond the requirements set forth in this section and to ensure public safety, power quality, and reliability of the suppliers electric distribution sys tem, an eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator whose electrical generating system meets those standards and rules shall bear all reasonable costs of equipment required for the interconnection to the suppliers electric distribution system, including costs, if any, to (a) install additional controls, (b) perform or pay for additional tests, and (c) purchase additional liability insurance. D. The Commiss ion shall establish minimum requirements for contracts to be entered into by the parties to net metering arrangements. Such requirements shall protect the eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator against discrimination by v irtue of its status as an eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator, and permit customers that are served on time-of-use tariffs that have electricity supply demand charges contained within the electricity supply portion of the time-of-use tariffs to participate as an eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator. Notwithstanding the cost allocation provisions of subsection C, eligible customer-generators or eligible agricultural customer-generator s served on demand charge-based time-of-use tariffs shall bear the incremental metering costs required to net meter such customers. E. If electric ity generated by an eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator over the net metering period exceeds the electricity consumed by the eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator, the customer-generat or or eligible agricultural customer-generator shall be compensated for the excess electricity if the entity contracting to receive such electric energy and the eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator enter into a power pu rchase agreement for such excess electricity. Upon the written request of the eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator, the supplier that serves the eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator sh all enter into a power purchase agreement with the requesting eligible customer-generator or eligible agricultural customer-generator that is consistent with the minimum requirements for contracts established by the Commission pursuant to subsection D. T he power purchase agreement shall obligate the supplier to purchase such excess electricity at the rate that is provided for such purchases in a net metering standard contract or tariff approved by the Commission, unless the parties agree to a higher rat e.

Consistent with the objectives pertaining to the energy issues and policy elements stated in § 45.2-1706.1, it is in the public interest to authorize and encourage the adoption of natural gas conservation and ratemaking efficiency plans that promote the wise use of natural gas and natural gas infrastructure through the development of alternative rate designs and other mechanisms that more closely align the interests of natural gas utilities, their customers, and the Commonwealth generally, and improve the effic iency of ratemaking to more closely reflect the dynamic nature of the natural gas market, the economy, and public policy regarding conservation and energy efficiency. Such alternative rate designs and other mechanisms should, where feasible: 1. Provi de utilities with better tools to work with customers to decrease the average customers annual average weather-normalized consumption of energy; 2. Provide reasonable assurance of a utilitys ability to recover costs of serving the public, including its cost-effective investments in conservation and energy efficiency as well as infrastructure needed to provide or maintain reliable service to the public; 3. Reward utilities for meeting or exceeding conservation and energy efficiency goals that may be established pursuant to the Virginia Energy Plan (§ 45.2-1710 et seq.); 4. Provide customers with long-term, meaningful opportunities to more efficiently consume energy, while ensuring that the rate design methodology used to set a utilitys revenue recove ry is not inconsistent with such conservation and energy efficiency goals; 5. Recognize the economic and environmental benefits of efficient use of natural gas, biogas, and lower-carbon gases; and 6. Preserve or enhance the utility bill savings that customers receive when they reduce their energy use. B. Natural gas utilities are authorized pursuant to this chapter to file natural gas conservation and ratemaking efficiency plans that implement alternative natural gas utility rate designs and other mechanisms, in addition to or in conjunction with the cost of servic e methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 and performance-based regulation plans authorized by § 56-235.6, that: 1. Repla ce existing utility rate designs or other mechanisms that promote inefficient use of natural gas with rate designs or other mechanisms that ensure a utilitys recovery of its authorized revenues is independent of the amount of customers natural ga s consumption; 2. Provide incentives for natural gas utilities to promote conservation and energy efficiency by granting recovery of the costs associated with cost-effective conservation and energy effi ciency programs; and 3. Reward utilities that meet or exceed conservation and energy efficiency goals on a weather-normalized, annualized average customer basis through the implementation of cost-effective co nservation and energy efficiency programs. C. This chapte r shall be construed liberally to accomplish these purposes. History History. 2008, c. 639; 2021, Sp. Sess. I, c. 327; 2022, cc. 728, 759. Annotations Editors note.

Notwithstan ding any provision of law to the contrary, each natural gas utility shall have the option to file a conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan as provided in this chapter. Such a plan may include one or more residential, small commercial, or small gener al service classes, but shall not apply to large commercial or large industrial classes of customers. Such plan shall include: (i) a normalization component that removes the effect of weather from the determination of conservation and energy efficiency r esults; (ii) a decoupling mechanism; (iii) one or more cost-effective conservation and energy efficiency programs; (iv) provisions to address the needs of low-income or low-usage residential customers; and (v) provisions to ensure that the rates and serv ice to non-participating classes of customers are not adversely impacted. Such plan may also include provisions for phased or targeted implementation of rate or tariff design changes, if any, or conservation and energy efficiency programs. The Commission may approve such a plan after such notice and opportunity for hearing as the Commission may prescribe, subject to the provisions of this chapter. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a natural gas utility from amending a conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan by amending, altering, supplementing, or deleting one or more conservation or energy efficiency programs. B. The Commiss ion shall approve or deny, within 180 days, a natural gas utilitys initial application for any revenue-neutral conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan that allocates annual per-customer fixed costs on an intra-class basis in reliance upon a reven ue study or class cost of service study supporting the rates in effect at the time the plan is filed. A plan filed pursuant to this subsection shall not require the filing of rate case schedules. The Commission shall approve or deny, within 120 days, a n atural gas utilitys application to amend a previously approved plan. The Commission shall approve such a plan or amendment if it finds that the plans or amendments proposed decoupling mechanism is revenue-neutral and is otherwise consistent w ith this chapter. If the Commission denies such a plan or amendment, it shall set forth with specificity the reasons for such denial and the utility shall have the right to refile, without prejudice, an amended plan or amendment within 60 days, and the C ommission shall thereafter have 60 days to approve or deny the amended plan or amendment. The time period for Commission review provided for in this subsection shall not apply if the conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan is filed in conjunction wit h a rate case using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or a performance-based regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6. C. The Commiss ion shall approve or deny, within 270 days, a natural gas utilitys initial application for any revenue-neutral conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan that allocates per-customer fixed costs on an intra-class basis according to a class cost of se rvice study filed with the plan, when such plan is filed in conjunction with a rate case using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or a performance-based regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6. The Commission shall approve or deny, within 120 days, a natural gas utilitys application to amend a plan previously approved pursuant to this subsection. The Commission shall approve such a plan or amendment if it finds that the plans or amendments proposed decoupling mech anism is revenue-neutral, is consistent with this chapter, and is otherwise in the public interest, including any findings required by § 56-235.2 or 56-235.6. If the Commission denies such a plan or amendment, it shall set forth with specificity the r easons for its denial and the utility shall have the right to refile, without prejudice, an amended plan or amendment within 60 days; the Commission shall thereafter have 60 days to approve or deny the amended plan or amendment. D. The Commiss ion shall allow any natural gas utility that implements a conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan under this chapter to recover, on a timely basis and through its regulated rates charged to its classes of customers participating in the plan, its enti re incremental costs associated with cost-effective conservation and energy efficiency programs that are designed to encourage the reduction of annualized, weather-normalized energy consumption per customer. Ratemaking treatment may include placing appro priate capital expenditures for technology and program costs in the respective utilitys rate base, deferral of such interim incremental costs (which costs would not be subject to an earnings test), or recovering the utilitys technology and progra m costs through another ratemaking methodology approved by the Commission, such as a tracking mechanism. Such conservation and energy efficiency programs may also be jointly conducted or co-sponsored with other utilities, federal, state or local governme nt agencies, nonprofit organizations, trade associations, homebuilders, and other for-profit vendors. Incremental costs recovered pursuant to this subsection shall be in addition to all other costs that the utility is permitted to recover, shall not be c onsidered an offset to other Commission-approved costs of service or revenue requirements, and shall not be included in any computation relative to a performance-based regulation plan revenue sharing mechanism. E. The Commiss ion shall require every natural gas utility operating under a conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan approved pursuant to this chapter to file annual reports showing the year over year weather-normalized use of energy on an average customer basis, b y customer class, as well as the incremental, independently verified net economic benefits created by the utilitys cost-effective conservation and energy-efficiency programs during the previous year. F. The Commiss ion shall grant recovery, on an annual basis, of a performance-based incentive for delivering conservation and energy efficiency benefits, which shall be included in the utilitys respective purchased gas adjustment mechanism. The incentive shall be c alculated as a reasonable share of the verified net economic benefits created by the utilitys cost-effective conservation and energy efficiency programs, and may be recovered over a period of years equal to the payback period or discounted to net pre sent value and recovered in the first year. In structuring this incentive, the Commission shall create a reasonable opportunity for a utility to earn up to a 15 percent share of such independently verified net economic benefits upon meeting target levels of such benefits set forth in a plan approved by the Commission. The level of net economic benefits to be used as the basis for such calculation shall be the sum of customer savings less utility costs recovered through subsection D, measured over the nu mber of years of the payback period, rounded up to the next highest year. The incentives authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to any other revenue requirements or rates established pursuant to § 56-235.2 or 56-235.6 and independent of an y computation of shared revenues under an approved performance-based regulation plan. G. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, nothing in this chapter shall impair the Commissions authority under § 56-234.2, 56-235.2, or 56-235.6; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commission shall not reduce an aut horized return on common equity or other measure of utility profit as a result of the implementation of a natural gas conservation and ratemaking efficiency plan pursuant to this chapter.

Return on the investment. In calculating the return on the investment, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys regulatory capital structure as calculated utilizing the we ighted average cost of capital, including the cost of debt and the cost of equity used in determining the natural gas utilitys base rates in effect during the construction period of the eligible infrastructure replacement project. If the natural gas utilitys cost of capital underlying the base rates in effect at the time its proposed SAVE plan is filed has not been changed by order of the Commission within the preceding five years, the Commission may require the natural gas utility to file an up dated weighted average cost of capital, and the natural gas utility may propose an updated weighted average cost of capital. The natural gas utility may recover the external costs associated with establishing its updated weighted average cost of capital through the SAVE rider. Such external costs shall include legal costs and consultant costs; 2. A revenue conversion factor, including income taxes and an allowance for bad debt expense, shall be applied to the required operating income resulting from the eligible infrastructure replacement costs; 3. Depreciation. In calculating depreciation, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys current depreciation rates; 4. Property taxes; 5.

At the end of each 12-month period the SAVE rider is in effect, the natural gas utility shall reconcile the difference between the recognized eligible infrastructure replacement costs and the amounts recovered under the SAVE rider, and shall submit the reconciliati on and a proposed SAVE rider adjustment to the Commission to recover or refund the difference, as appropriate, through an adjustment to the SAVE rider. The Commission shall approve or deny, within 90 days, a natural gas utilitys proposed SAVE rider a djustment. F. A natural g as utility that has implemented a SAVE rider pursuant to this chapter shall file revised rate schedules to reset the SAVE rider to zero, when new base rates and charges that incorporate eligible infrastructure replacement costs previously reflected in th e currently effective SAVE rider become effective for the natural gas utility, following a Commission order establishing customer rates in a rate case using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2, or a performance-based regulation pla n authorized by § 56-235.6. G. Costs recov ered pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to all other costs that the natural gas utility is permitted to recover, shall not be considered an offset to other Commission-approved costs of service or revenue requirements, and shall not be included in any computation relative to a performance-based regulation plan revenue-sharing mechanism. Further, if the Commission approves (i) an updated weighted average cost of capital for use in calculating the return on investment, (ii) the carrying costs on the over- or under-recovery of the eligible infrastructure replacement costs, (iii) the allowance for funds used during construction, or (iv) any combination thereof, such weighted average cost of capital shall be used only for the purpose of the eligib le infrastructure replacement costs for the SAVE rider and shall not be used for any purpose in any other proceeding.

Retur n on the investment. In calculating the return on investment, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys weighted average cost of capital, including the cost of debt and equity, based on its regulatory capital structure used in determining the natural gas utilitys base rates in effect during the construction period of the eligible infrastructure development project. The investment will be multiplied by the weighted average cost of capital to determine the return on investment; 2. A revenue conversion factor. Such factor, including income taxes and an allowance for bad debt expense, shall be applied to the required operating income resulting from the eligible in frastructure development costs; 3. Operating and maintenance expense. The amount of operating and maintenance expense utilized in the utilitys calculations of justifiable new business plant investment shall be consi stent with the natural gas utilitys standard line extension tariff provisions; 4. Depreciation. In calculating depreciation, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys currently approved depreciation rates applicable to each general plant account; and 5. Property taxes.The foregoing shall be reduced by a base non-gas revenue credit comprised of the non-gas revenue received by the natural gas utility from providing sales or transportati on service, or both, to (i) the customer occupying the qualifying project and (ii) any other customer of the natural gas utility served directly from the subject eligible infrastructure that initiates natural gas service before the Commission issues an o rder establishing or confirming customer rates in a rate case using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or a performance-based regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6 which rates include recovery of costs deferred under this ch apter.Investment means costs incurred to deploy eligible infrastructure including planning, devel opment, and construction costs and, if applicable, an allowance for funds used during construction. In calculating the allowance for funds used during construction, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys regulatory capital structure as det ermined in subdivision 1 of the definition of eligible infrastructure development costs.Natural gas utility means an investor-owned public service company engaged in the business of furnishing natural gas service to the public.Person means natural persons, firms, associations, cooperatives, corporations, limited liability companies, business trusts, partnerships, and limited liability partnerships. Qualifying project means an economic development project requiring natural gas service as to which the natural gas utility has made a good faith determination that the following criteria are satisfied: 1. The location of the proposed project is in an area where adequate natural gas infrastructure is not available; 2. The eligible infrastructure will provide opportunities for increased natural gas usage and economic development benefits in the area to be directly served by the subject eligible infra structure in addition to those provided by the subject project; 3. Either (i) the person proposing to develop the project or the person that will occupy the proposed project shall provide, prior to the initiation of service, a binding commitment, in t he form of a service agreement, precedent agreement, memorandum of understanding, or otherwise, to the natural gas utility regarding capacity needed for a period of at least five years from the date gas is made available, provided that such commitment co vers a level of service no less than 50 percent of the capacity of the facilities proposed to be constructed by the natural gas utility to serve such project or (ii) the natural gas utility receives a financial guaranty from the Commonwealth or an agency or subdivision thereof, the governing body of the locality in which the project is located or an agency or subdivision thereof, or from a developer or any other person other than the proposed occupant of the project, in the amount of at least 50 percent of the estimated investment to be made by the natural gas utility in the proposed project, and otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the natural gas utility. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such financial guaranty may be in t he form of a letter of credit issued by a bank or other lending institution licensed to do business in the Commonwealth. Any financial guaranty provided to the natural gas utility shall be released upon the receipt by the natural gas utility of a binding commitment meeting the requirements of clause (i) from a person proposing to develop the project or a person that will occupy the project; 4. The natural gas utility has reasonably and in good faith negotiated with the developer of the project or the person that will occupy the proposed project in an attempt to reach agreeme nt on a commitment for the entire aid to construction otherwise required to cover the cost of the necessary eligible infrastructure; and 5. The projected non-gas revenues from the proposed project will not be sufficient to cover the cost of service associated with the necessary eligible infrastructure after accounting for any aid to construction contributed by the developer of the project or the person that will occupy the proposed project.A qualifying project may consist of multiple persons proposed to be served through common eligible infrastructure, provided those pers ons each satisfy the requirement of a service commitment for at least five years from the date gas is made available and collectively they satisfy the capacity commitment of at least 50 percent. For purposes of this chapter and notwithstanding the forego ing, a qualifying project shall not include an economic development project applicable to customers to be served under a special rate or contract approved by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of § 56-235.6 or industrial customers to be provide d service pursuant to a negotiated rate permitted by a tariff approved by the Commission.

As used in this section, unless the context requires a different meaning:Eligible natural gas supply infrastructure costs includes the investment in eligible natural gas supply infrastructure projects and the following: 1. Retur n on the investment. In calculating the return on investment, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys then in effect weighted average cost of capital, including the cost of debt and equity, based on its regulatory capital structure used in determining the natural gas utilitys base rates. The investment will be multiplied by the weighted average cost of capital to determine the return on investment; 2. A revenue conversion factor. Such factor, including income taxes, shall be applied to the required operating income resulting from the eligible natural gas supply infrastructure costs; 3. Operating and maintenance expense, which includes the amount of operating and maintenance expense utilized in production wells, processing the gas produced, and gathering, transmission , and distribution lines delivering the gas to a pipeline or distribution system; 4. Depreciation. In calculating depreciation, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys current depreciation rates for investments in distribution infrastructure, as set out b y appropriate asset class. The utility shall propose a basis for recovering for the depreciation or depletion of investments in other asset classes in the natural gas supply investment plan, including investments in natural gas reserves that will deplete based on their useful life or of associated facilities that may be retired upon depletion of natural gas reserves; 5. Property tax, severance tax, and any other taxes or government fees associated with production and transmission of natural gas; and 6. Carrying costs on the over-recovery or under-recovery of the eligible natural gas supply infrastructure costs. In calculating the carrying costs, the Commission shall use the natural g as utilitys regulatory capital structure as determined in subdivision 1 of this definition.Eligible natural gas supply infrastructure projects means capital investments in natural gas reserves and upstream pipelines and facilities that, alone or in combination with other projects or strategies, offer reasonably anticipated benefits to customer s and markets, which benefits mean (i) savings in the delivered cost of gas versus long-term forward market projections available to the natural gas utility at the time of the capital investment or other alternatives, (ii) a reduction in the utilitys overall portfolio price volatility, (iii) reduction in the utilitys overall supply risk, or (iv) any combination of the savings or reductions described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii). Any such customer benefit benchmarks shall be outlined in the na tural gas utilitys filings with the Commission pursuant to this section.Investment means actu al costs incurred on eligible natural gas supply infrastructure projects, including planning, development, and construction costs; actual costs of infrastructure associated therewith; and an allowance for funds used during construction. In calculating th e allowance for funds used during construction, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys actual regulatory capital structure as determined in subdivision 1 of the definition of eligible natural gas supply infrastructure costs. Natural gas reserves and upstream pipelines and facilities means investments in natural gas reserves, produc tion facilities (including equipment required to prepare the natural gas for use), gathering, transmission, and, within the natural gas utilitys certificated service territory, any distribution pipelines necessary to deliver the reserves, and above-g round and below-ground storage used in the delivery of gas to existing natural gas transmission pipelines or distribution systems.Natural gas supply investment plan means a plan filed by a natural gas utility that identifies proposed eligible natural gas supply infrastructure projects and its development of those projects with or without a third p arty. B. A natural g as utility shall have the right to recover eligible natural gas supply infrastructure costs on an ongoing basis through the gas cost component of the utilitys rate structure or other recovery mechanism approved by the Commission, provided that any su ch mechanism shall properly allocate costs. Natural gas utilities using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or a performance-based regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6 shall be eligible to file a plan. The plan shall include a timeline for the investment and completion of the proposed eligible natural gas supply infrastructure projects; provide for an estimated schedule for recovery of the related eligible natural gas supply infrastructure costs through the gas cost compone nt of the utilitys rate structure or other mechanism, including proposed depreciation rates for investments in non-distribution asset classes and how any revenue gains from the use of the pipelines by third parties will be used to offset eligible nat ural gas supply infrastructure costs; and demonstrate that the plan is in the public interest with due consideration to providing a portion of the utilitys delivered supply at prices at or below the long-term projections as available and defined in t he natural gas utilitys filing, or reduction in the utilitys overall supply risk, or reduction in the utilitys overall portfolio price volatility, or a combination thereof. No project may provide an annual volume of natural gas that exceeds 1 2.5 percent of the natural gas utilitys annual firm sales demand, and no combination of projects may provide an annual volume of natural gas that exceeds 25 percent of the natural gas utilitys annual firm sales demand. The natural gas utility s weather-normalized firm sales demand for the calendar year preceding the application shall be deemed to establish the annual firm sales demand for the purposes of calculating the volume and volumetric limits of projects. In no case shall any investment in reserves exceed 20 years. The Commission shall approve such a plan upon a finding that it is in the public interest after notice and an opportunity for hearing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. C. In addition to the items included in the plan as specified in subsection B, the plan may provide the utility with an option to receive the gas or sell the gas at market prices. A utility proposing this option as part of its plan shall propose how any revenue gains from the sale of the gas will be used to reduce the cost of gas to its customers. The Commission shall approve or deny, within 180 days, a natural gas utilitys initial application for a natural gas supply infrastructure plan. A plan filed pursuant to this section shall not require the filing of rate case schedules. The Commission shall approve or deny, within 120 days, a natural gas utilitys application to amend a previously approved plan. If the Commission denies such a plan or amendment, it sh all set forth with specificity the reasons for such denial, and the utility shall have the right to refile, without prejudice, an amended plan or amendment within 60 days, and the Commission shall thereafter have 60 days to approve or deny the amended pl an or amendment. If the plan is filed as part of a general rate case using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or a performance-based regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6, then the Commission shall approve or deny the plan c oncurrent with or as part of the general rate case decision. D. No other re venue requirement or ratemaking issues shall be examined in consideration of the initial plan filed pursuant to the provisions of this section. E. A gas utili ty with an approved natural gas supply infrastructure plan shall annually file a report of the eligible natural gas supply infrastructure investment made, the eligible natural gas supply infrastructure costs incurred and the amount of such costs recovere d, the volume of gas delivered to customers or sold to third parties during the 12-month reporting period, and an analysis of the price of gas delivered to the natural gas utility customers and the market cost of gas during the 12-month period. However, such analysis shall not affect a gas utilitys right to recover all eligible natural gas supply infrastructure costs as set forth in subsection B. The report shall also identify the balance of over-recovery or under-recovery of the eligible natural ga s supply infrastructure costs at the end of the reporting period and the projected investment to be made, the projected infrastructure costs to be incurred, and the projected costs to be recovered during the next 12-month reporting period. F. Costs recov ered pursuant to this section shall be in addition to all other costs that the natural gas utility is permitted to recover and shall not be considered an offset to other Commission-approved costs of service or revenue requirements.

The natural gas utili ty shall demonstrate that the system expansion plan is prudent and reasonable. The Commission may approve such a plan after such notice and opportunity for a hearing as the Commission may prescribe, subject to the provisions of this chapter. B. The Commiss ion shall approve a natural gas utilitys system expansion plan if it finds that the plan (i) includes the components set forth in subsection A, (ii) provides for the recovery of eligible system expansion infrastructure costs in accordance with the pr ovisions of this chapter, and (iii) is prudent and reasonable. In a final order approving a natural gas utilitys system expansion plan, the Commission may require the natural gas utility to file an annual report with the Commission demonstrating whet her the natural gas utilitys recovery of eligible system expansion infrastructure costs pursuant to its system expansion plan complies with the requirements of clause (ii). Upon a finding by the Commission that a natural gas utilitys system expan sion plan does not comply with the requirements of clause (ii), the Commission may direct, by order, the natural gas utility to exclude from deferral any unrecovered costs in excess of costs that may be recovered by a system expansion rider. C. The Commiss ion shall act on a natural gas utilitys initial application for a system expansion plan within 180 days. Within that time period, the Commission shall approve, deny, or modify the plan as required by the public interest. A plan filed pursuant to this section shall not require the filing of rate schedules typically filed in conjunction with a rate case using the cost-of-service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or a performance-based rate regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6.

As used in this section: Biogas has the same meaning as set forth in § 56-248.1. Biogas facilities means biogas reserves; production facilities, including equipment re quired to prepare the biogas for use; gathering of, transmission of, and, within the natural gas utilitys certificated service territory, any distribution pipelines necessary to deliver the reserves; and aboveground and underground storage used in th e delivery of gas to existing natural gas transmission pipelines or distribution systems. Biogas supply investment plan or plan means a plan filed by a natural gas utility that identifies proposed eligible biogas supply infrastructure projects and its development of those projects with or without a third party. Eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs includes the investment in eligible biogas supply infrastructure projects and the following: 1. Return on the investment. In calculating the return on the investment, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys regulatory capital structure in effect during the construction period of the eligible biogas supply infrastructure project. The r egulatory capital structure shall be calculated utilizing the weighted average cost of capital, including the cost of debt and the cost of equity, plus an additional 100 basis points added to the cost of equity. If the natural gas utilitys cost of ca pital underlying the base rates in effect at the time its proposed eligible biogas supply infrastructure project is filed has not been changed by order of the Commission within the preceding five years, the Commission may require the natural gas utility to file an updated weighted average cost of capital, and the natural gas utility may propose an updated weighted average cost of capital. The natural gas utility may recover the external costs associated with establishing its updated weighted average cos t of capital through a biogas supply rider. Such external costs shall include legal costs and consultant costs; 2. A revenue conversion factor. Such factor, including income taxes, shall be applied to the required operating income resulting from the eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs; 3. Operating and maintenance expenses. These expenses include the amount of operating and maintenance expenses utilized in biogas collection; processing the gas produced; and gatheri ng, transmission, and distribution lines delivering the gas to a pipeline or distribution system; 4. Depreciation. In calculating depreciation, the Commission shall use the natural gas utilitys current depreciation rates for investments in distribution infrastructure, as set out by the appropriate asset class. The natural gas utility shall propose a basis for recovering for the depreciation or depletion of investments in other asset classes in the biogas supply investment plan, including investments in biogas reserves that w ill deplete based on their useful life or of associated facilities that may be retired upon depletion of biogas reserves; 5. Property tax and any other taxes or government fees associated with production and transmission of biogas; and 6. Carrying costs on the over-recovery or under-recovery of the eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs. In calculating the carrying costs, the Commission shall use the natural g as utilitys regulatory capital structure as determined in subdivision 1. Eligible biogas supply infrastructure projects or projects means capital investments in biogas facilities that, alone or in combination with other projects or strategies, offer reasonably anticipated benefits to customers and markets, which benefits mean (i) a reduction in methane or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from the biogas facility, (ii) an additional source of supply for the natural gas utility, and (iii) a benefi cial use for the biogas, and which benefits do not result in the gas delivered to customers failing to meet the natural gas utilitys pipeline quality standards. Investment means actual costs incurred on eligible biogas supply infrastructure projec ts, including planning, development, and construction costs; actual costs of infrastructure associated therewith; and an allowance for funds used during construction. In calculating the allowance for funds used during construction, the Commission shall u se the natural gas utilitys actual regulatory capital structure as determined in subdivision 1 of the definition of eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs. Natural gas utility means an investor-owned public service company engaged in the busi ness of furnishing natural gas service to the public. B. A natural g as utility shall have the right to recover eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs on an ongoing basis through the gas cost component of the natural gas utilitys rate structure or other recovery mechanism approved by the Commission, provided that any such mechanism shall properly allocate costs. Natural gas utilities using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or a performance-based regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6 shall be eligible to file a plan. The plan shall include a timeline for the investment and completion of the proposed eligible biogas supply infrastructure projects; provide for an estimated schedule for recovery of the related eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs through the gas cost component of the natural gas utilitys rate structure or other mechanism, including proposed depreciation rates for investments in non-distribution asset classes and how any revenue gains from the use of the pipelines by third parties will be used to offset eli gible biogas supply infrastructure costs; and demonstrate that the plan is in the public interest with due consideration to the reduction in methane or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and the addition of a supply source for the natural gas utility or a combination thereof. No project shall provide an annual volume of biogas that exceeds three percent of the natural gas utilitys annual firm sales demand, and no combination of projects shall provide an annual volume of biogas that exceeds 15 perce nt of the natural gas utilitys annual firm sales demand. The natural gas utilitys weather-normalized firm sales demand for the calendar year preceding the application shall be deemed to establish the annual firm sales demand for the purposes of c alculating the volume and volumetric limits of projects. The Commission shall approve such a plan upon a finding that it (i) is in the public interest, (ii) will result in a decrease of methane or carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and (iii) will resul t in rates that are just and reasonable, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. C. In addition to the items included in the plan as specified in subsection B, the plan may provide the natural gas utility with an option to receive the biogas or sell the biogas at market prices. A natural gas utility proposing this option as part of its plan shall propose how any revenue gains from the sale of the biogas will be used to reduce the cost of gas to its customers. The Commission shall approve or deny, within 180 days, a natural gas utilitys initial application for a biogas supply investment plan. A plan filed pursuant to this section shall not require the filing of rate case schedules. The Commission shall approve or deny, within 120 days, a natural gas utilitys application to amend a previously approved plan. If the Commission denies such a plan or amendment, it shall set forth with specificity the reasons for such denial, and the natural gas utility shall have the right to refile, without prejudice, an amended plan or amendment within 60 days, and the Commission shall thereafter have 60 da ys to approve or deny the amended plan or amendment. If the plan is filed as part of a general rate case using the cost of service methodology set forth in § 56-235.2 or a performance-based regulation plan authorized by § 56-235.6, then the Commiss ion shall approve or deny the plan concurrent with or as part of the general rate case decision. D. No other re venue requirement or ratemaking issues shall be examined in consideration of a plan filed pursuant to the provisions of this section. E. A natural g as utility with an approved biogas supply investment plan shall annually file a report of the eligible biogas supply infrastructure investment made, the eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs incurred and the amount of such costs recovered, the volu me of biogas delivered to customers or sold to third parties during the 12-month reporting period, and an analysis of the price of biogas delivered to the natural gas utility customers and the market cost of gas during the 12-month period. However, such analysis shall not affect a natural gas utilitys right to recover all eligible biogas supply infrastructure costs as set forth in subsection B. The report shall also identify the balance of over-recovery or under-recovery of the eligible biogas suppl y infrastructure costs at the end of the reporting period and the projected investment to be made, the projected infrastructure costs to be incurred, and the projected costs to be recovered during the next 12-month reporting period. F. Costs recov ered pursuant to this section shall be in addition to all other costs that the natural gas utility is permitted to recover and shall not be considered an offset to other Commission-approved costs of service or revenue requirements.
