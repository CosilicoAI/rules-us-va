The party s tates find that: 1. Minin g and the contributions thereof to the economy and well-being of every state are of basic significance. 2. The effects of mining on the availability of land, water, and other resources for other uses present special problems that properly can be approached only with due consideration for th e rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public. 3. Measures for the reduction of the adverse effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be costly and the devising of means to deal with them are of both public and private concern. 4. Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single stan dard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources, but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on land, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated. 5. The states are in a position and have the responsibility to assure that mining shall be conducted in accordance with sound conservation principles and with due regard for local conditi ons. B. The purpose s of this compact are to: 1. Advan ce the protection and restoration of land, water, and other resources affected by mining. 2. Assist in the reduction or elimination or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water, and air attributable to mining. 3. Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states that will achieve comparable results in protecting, conservi ng, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated. 4. Assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, an d public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration, or protection of such land and other resources. 5. Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining. ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS As used in this compact: Mining means the breaking of the surface soil in order to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, or other solid matter, any activity or process constituting all or part of a process for the extraction or removal of minerals, ores, and other solid matter from its original location, and the preparation, washin g, cleaning, or other treatment of minerals, ores, or other solid matter so as to make them suitable for commercial, industrial, or construction use but shall not include those aspects of deep mining not having significant effect on the surface and shall not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of onsite farming or construction. State means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth o f Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States. ARTICLE III STATE PROGRAMS Each party state agrees that within a reasonable time it will formulate and establish an effective program for the conservation and use of mined land, by the establishm ent of standards, enactment of laws, or the continuing of the same in force, to accomplish: 1. The p rotection of the public and the protection of adjoining and other landowners from damage to their lands and the structures and other property thereon resulting from the conduct of mining operations or the abandonment or neglect of land and property forme rly used in the conduct of such operations. 2. The conduct of mining and the handling of refuse and other mining wastes in ways that will reduce adverse effects on the economic, residential, recreational, or aesthetic value and uti lity of land and water. 3. The institution and maintenance of suitable programs of adaptation, restoration, and rehabilitation of mined lands. 4. The prevention, abatement, and control of water, air, and soil pollution resulting from mining, present, past, and future. ARTICLE IV POWERS In addition to any other powers conferred upon the Interstate Mining Commission, established by Article V of this compact, the Commission shall have power to: 1. Study mining operations, processes, and techniques for the purpose of gaining knowledge concerning the effects of such operations, processes, and techniques on land, soil, water, air, plant and animal life, recreation, and patterns of community or regional de velopment or change. 2. Study the conservation, adaptation, improvement, and restoration of land and related resources affected by mining. 3. Make recommendations concerning any aspect or aspects of law or practice and governmental administration dealing with matters within the purview of this compact. 4. Gather and disseminate information relating to any of the matters within the purview of this compact. 5. Cooperate with the federal government and any public or private entities having interest in any subject coming within the purview of this compact. 6. Consult, upon the request of a party state and within resources available therefor, with the officials of such state in respect to any problem within the purview of this compact. 7. Study and make recommendations with respect to any practice, process, technique, or course of action that may improve the efficiency of mining or the economic yield from mining operati ons. 8. Study and make recommendations relating to the safeguarding of access to resources that are or may become the subject of mining operations to the end that the needs of the economy for the products of mining may not be adversely affected by unplanned or inappropriate use of land and other resources containing minerals or otherwise connected with actual or potential mining sites. ARTICLE V THE COMMISSION A. There is he reby created an agency of the party states to be known as the Interstate Mining Commission (the Commission). The Commission shall be composed of one commissioner from each party state who shall be the Governor thereof. Pursuant to the laws of his party s tate, each Governor shall have the assistance of any advisory body (including membership from mining industries, conservation interests, and such other public and private interests as may be appropriate) in considering problems relating to mining and in discharging his responsibilities as the commissioner of his state on the Commission. In any instance where a Governor is unable to attend a meeting of the Commission or perform any other function in connection with the business of the Commission, he shal l designate an alternate from among the members of the advisory body required by this subsection who shall represent him and act in his place and stead. The designation of an alternate shall be communicated by the Governor to the Commission in such manne r as its bylaws may provide. B. The commiss ioners shall be entitled to one vote each on the Commission. No action of the Commission making a recommendation pursuant to subdivision 3, 7, or 8 of Article IV or requesting, accepting, or disposing of funds, services, or other property pursuant to thi s subsection, subsection G or H of this article, or Article VII shall be valid unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the Commission is cast in favor thereof. All other action shall be by a majority of those present and voting, provided that action of the Commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners, or their alternates, is present. The Commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transacting of its business. The Commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein. C. The Commiss ion shall have a seal. D. The Commiss ion shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman, and a treasurer. The Commission shall appoint an Executive Director and fix his duties and compensation. Such Executive Director shall serve at the pleasure of the Commission. The Executive Director, the Treasurer, and such other personnel as the Commission shall designate shall be bonded. The amount or amounts of such bond or bonds shall be determined by the Commission. E. Irrespectiv e of the civil service, personnel, or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the Executive Director with the approval of the Commission shall appoint, remove, or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the Commiss ions functions and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel. F. The Commiss ion may establish and maintain independently or in conjunction with a party state, a suitable retirement system for its employees. Employees of the Commission shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect of old age and survivors insuranc e, provided that the Commission takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to the laws of the United States to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The Commission may establish and maintain or participate in such additional programs of employee benefits as it may deem appropriate. G. The Commiss ion may borrow, accept, or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, or corporation. H. The Commiss ion may accept ...</akn:p></akn:content></akn:section><akn:section eId="sec_45.2-300"><akn:num>§ 45.2-300</akn:num><akn:heading>Governor authorized to execute Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas</akn:heading><akn:content><akn:p>Text The Governor is hereby authorized and requested to execute, on behalf of the Commonwealth with any other state legally joining therein, a compact that is in form substa ntially as provided in § 45.2-301.

Article IV. Each state bound hereby agrees that it will, within a reasonable time, enact statutes, or if such statutes have been enacted that it will continue the same in force, pr oviding in effect that oil produced in violation of its valid oil and/or gas conservation statutes or any valid rule, order, or regulation promulgated thereunder shall be denied access to commerce and providing for stringent penalties for the waste of ei ther oil or gas. Article V. It is not the purpose of this compact to authorize the states joining herein to limit the production of oil or gas for the purpose of stabilizing or fixing the price th ereof, or to create or perpetuate monopoly, or to promote regimentation, but is limited to the purpose of conserving oil and gas and preventing the avoidable waste thereof within reasonable limitations. Article VI. Each state joining herein shall appoint one representative to a commission hereby constituted and designated as the Interstate Oil Compact Commission (the Commission), the duty of which shall be to make inquiry and ascertain from time to time such methods, practices, circumstances, and conditions as may be disclosed for bringing about conservation and the prevention of physical waste of oil and gas, and at such interva ls as the Commission deems beneficial, it shall report its findings and recommendations to the several states for adoption or rejection.

Constitutionality.  This section is not special, local, private, and, therefore, arbitrary in its classification and operation. The legislation is general and impartial in its operat ion on all persons and lands similarly situated. Love v. Lynchburg Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 205 Va. 860, 140 S.E.2d 650, 1965 Va.

The fact that a law applies only to certain territorial districts does not render it unconstitutional, provided it applies to all districts and all persons who ar e similarly situated, and to all parts of the State where like conditions exist. Love v. Lynchburg Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 205 Va. 860, 140 S.E.2d 650, 1965 Va. LEXIS 145 (1965). Exceptions to provision that presumption does not apply west of Blue Ridge are unconstitutional.  Those provisions in this section which create exceptions to the general provision that the presumption concerning extinguishing mineral rights does not apply west of the Blue Ridge are unconstitutional, as a circuitous and disingenuous means of designating and providing local legislation.

Employee required to obey re asonable rules.  An employee was under an imperative obligation to obey reasonable rules, but he was required to have an adequate opportunity to understand the purpose and meaning of the rules before he was bound by them. Clinchfield Coal Corp. v. Hawkins, 130 Va. 698, 108 S.E. 704, 1921 Va. LEXIS 185 (1921). Rule imposing upon employees duty of inspection of appliances.  While a corporation owes to its employees the nonassignable duty to examine and inspect the appliances used by them, yet the corporation may by general rules impo se the duty of inspection upon the employees using the appliances to the extent that they are competent to make the inspection and the circumstances allow them an opportunity of doing so. Pocahontas Consol. Collieries Co. v. Hairston, 117 Va. 118, 83 S.E . 1041, 1915 Va. LEXIS 15 (1915). An d requiring miner to use due diligence as to safety of roof.  A rule which says: Dont start to work, especially after a shot, until you are sure your roof is safe, only requires the miner to use due diligence to see that he does not work under an unsafe roof, and due diligence in every case depends upon the attending circumstances. Hence an inexperienced miner, who resumed work after a shot, is not thereby precluded from recovering for injuries by a fall of slat e an hour after a shot, where the condition of the roof was not glaringly dangerous.

While Virginia law requires coal operators to enact substance abuse screening policies that provide for pre-employment drug testing, § 45.1-161.87, the public policy articulated in Virginia law does not go so far as to require termination of every individual in the coal mining industry who tests positi ve for drugs or alcohol.

After a coa l surface mining permit application has been approved, but before such permit is issued, the applicant shall file with the Director, on a form prescribed and furnished by the Director, a bond for performance payable to the Commonwealth and conditioned up on the faithful performance of all the requirements of this chapter and the permit. The bond shall cover that area of land within the permit area upon which the operator plans to initiate and conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations within the initial term of the permit. As each succeeding increment of coal surface mining and reclamation operations is initiated and conducted within the permit area, the permittee shall file with the Director an additional bond to cover such increment in acc ordance with this section. The amount of the bond required for each bonded area shall be determined by the Director and shall (i) depend upon the reclamation requirements of the approved permit and (ii) reflect the probable difficulty of reclamation, giv ing consideration to such factors as topography, geology of the site, hydrology, and revegetation potential. The amount of the bond shall be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan if the work is performed by the Director in the event of forfeiture but in no case shall the bond for the entire area under one permit be less than $10,000. B. Liability u nder a performance bond shall be for the duration of the coal surface mining and reclamation operation and for a period coincident with the operators responsibility for revegetation as required under regulations adopted pursuant to § 45.2-1017. Th e bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in the Commonwealth, except that the operator may elect to deposit cash, negotiable bonds of the United States or the Commonwealth, or negotiable certificates of depo sit of any bank organized for transacting business in the United States. The cash deposit or market value of such securities shall be equal to or greater than the amount of the bond required for the bonded area. C. Cash or sec urities deposited pursuant to subsection B shall be deposited upon the same terms as the terms upon which surety bonds may be deposited. Such securities shall be security for the repayment of such negotiable certificate of deposit. D. The Directo r may accept a letter of credit on certain designated funds issued by a financial institution authorized to do business in the United States. Such letter of credit shall be irrevocable and unconditional, shall be payable to the Department upon demand, an d shall afford the Department protection equivalent to a corporate suretys bond. Such letter of credit shall be provided on a form and in a format established by the Director. Nothing in this section shall relieve the permittee of responsibility unde r the permit or the issuer of liability on the letter of credit. E. The issuer of a letter of credit pursuant to subsection D shall give prompt notice to the permittee and the Department of any notice received or action filed alleging the insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuer, or alleging any violation of a regulatory requirement that could result in the suspension or revocation of the issuers charter or license to do business. In the event the issuer becomes unable to fulfill any of its obligations under the letter of credit for any reason, the issuer shall immediately notif y the permittee and the Department. Upon the incapacity of an issuer by a reason of bankruptcy, insolvency, or the suspension or revocation of its charter or license, the permittee shall be deemed to be without proper performance bond coverage and shall promptly notify the Department. The Department shall then issue a notice to the permittee specifying a reasonable period not exceeding 90 days to replace bond coverage. If an adequate bond is not posted by the end of the period allowed, the permittee sha ll cease coal extraction and coal processing operations and shall immediately begin to conduct reclamation operations in accordance with its reclamation plan. No coal extraction or coal processing operation shall resume until the Department has determine d that an acceptable bond has been posted. If an acceptable bond has not been posted by the end of the period allowed, the Department may suspend the permit until an acceptable bond is posted. F. The Directo r may develop and adopt an alternative system to achieve the objectives and purposes of the bonding program established under this section. G. The amount of the bond or deposit required and the terms of each acceptance of the applicants bond shall be adjusted by the Director from time to time as affected land acreages are increased or decreased or where the cost of future reclamation changes.

If the Dire ctor determines that any condition or practice or any violation by a permittee of any requirement of this chapter, regulation adopted hereunder, or permit condition (i) creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or (ii) is causing o r can reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the Director shall immediately order a cessation of the coal surface mining and reclamation operation or the portion thereof relevant to the condition, practice, or violation. Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the Director determines that the condition, practice, or violation has been abated or until such order is modified, vacated, or terminated by the Director. Whenever the Director finds that the ordered cessation of coal surface mining and reclamation operations, or any portion thereof, is not expected to completely abate the imminent danger to health or safety of the public or the significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the Director shall, in addition to ordering the cessation of the operation, impose affirmative obligations on the operator and require such operator to take whatever steps the Director determines necessary to abate the i mminent danger or the significant environmental harm.

Upon expira tion of the period of time originally set pursuant to subsection B or subsequently extended for good cause shown upon the written finding of the Director, if the Director finds that a violation has not been abated, he shall immediately order a cessation of coal surface mining and reclamation operations or the portion thereof relevant to the violation. Such cessation order shall remain in effect until the Director determines that the violation has been abated or until such order is modified, vacated, or terminated by the Director pursuant to subsection E. The Director shall include in the cessation order the necessary measures to abate the violation in the most expeditious manner possible. D. Whenever th e Director determines that a pattern of violations of the requirements of this chapter, any regulation adopted hereunder, or any permit condition exists or has existed, and if the Director also finds that such violations are (i) caused by the unwarranted failure of the permittee to comply with any such requirements or (ii) willfully caused by the permittee, the Director shall promptly issue an order to the permittee to show cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked and shall provide opportunity for a formal public hearing.

Any permitt ee who violates any permit condition or any other provision of this chapter or the regulations adopted hereunder may be assessed a civil penalty by the Director, except that if such violation leads to the issuance of a cessation order, the civil penalty shall be assessed. Such penalty shall not exceed $5,000 for each violation except that if the violation resulted in a personal injury or fatality to any person, then the civil penalty shall not exceed $70,000 for each violation. Each day of continuing vi olation may be deemed a separate violation for the purposes of assessing penalties. In determining the amount of the penalty, consideration shall be given to the permittees history of previous violations at the particular coal surface mining operatio n; the seriousness of the violation, including any irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the health or safety of the public; whether the permittee was negligent; and the demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to ac hieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. B. A civil pen alty may be assessed by the Director only after the person charged with a violation has been given an opportunity for a public hearing. After such public hearing has been held, the Director shall make findings of fact and issue a written decision as to t he occurrence of the violation and the amount of the penalty that is warranted, incorporating therein, when appropriate, an order requiring that the penalty be paid. When appropriate, the Director shall consolidate such hearing with other proceedings pur suant to the provisions of this chapter. Any hearing under this section shall be a formal adjudicatory hearing in accordance with the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.). If the person charged with such violation fails to avail himself of the opportunity for a public hearing, a civil penalty shall be assessed by the Director after the Director determines that a violation has occurred and the amount of the penalty warranted and issues an order requiring that the penalty be paid. C. Upon the is suance of a notice or order charging that a violation described under subsection A has occurred, the Director shall inform the permittee within 30 days of the proposed amount of the penalty. Such permittee shall, within 30 days of being so informed, pay the proposed penalty in full or, if the permittee contests either the amount of the penalty or the fact of the violation, forward the proposed amount to the Director for placement in an interest-bearing trust account in the state treasury. Failure to for ward the money to the Director within 30 days constitutes a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. If through administrative or judicial review of the proposed penalty it is determined that no violation occurred or that the amount of the penalty will be reduced, the Director shall within 30 days of such determination remit the appropriate amount to the permittee with accrued interest thereon. D. If a permit tee required to pay a civil penalty fails to do so, the Director may transmit a true copy of the final order assessing such penalty to the clerk of the court of any county or city wherein it is ascertained that the permittee owing the penalty has any est ate; and the clerk to whom such copy is sent shall record such final order, as a judgment is required by law to be recorded, and index it in the name of the Commonwealth and the name of the person owing the penalty. Upon such recording and indexing, ther e shall be a lien in favor of the Commonwealth on the property of the permittee within such county or city in the amount of the penalty. The Director may collect civil penalties that are owed in the same manner as provided by law in respect to judgment o f a court of record. All civil penalties shall be paid into a special fund in the state treasury to be used by the Director for enhancing conservation and recreational opportunities in the coal-producing counties of the Commonwealth. The Director shall t ransfer quarterly 50 percent of the fund balance to the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority, created pursuant to Chapter 60 (§ 15.2-6000 et seq.) of Title 15.2, for the purposes of developing infrastructure and improvements at Breaks Int erstate Park and 50 percent of the fund balance to the Heart of Appalachia Tourism Authority for the purpose of developing conservation and recreational opportunities consistent with the provisions of Chapter 55 (§ 15.2-5500 et seq.) of Title 15.2. E. Any person who willfully and knowingly (i) conducts any coal surface mining or coal exploration operation without first obtaining a permit, or after a permit has lapsed, or after suspension or revocation of a permit; (ii) violates a condition of a permit issued pur suant to this chapter; or (iii) disregards or fails or refuses to comply with any regulation adopted or order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, except an order incorporated in a decision under subsection B, shall upon conviction be punis hed by a fine of not more than $10,000, by confinement in jail for not more than 12 months, or both. F. Whenever a corporate permittee violates a condition of a permit or disregards or fails or refuses to comply with any order issued under this chapter, except an order incorporated in a decision issued under subsection B, any director, officer, or agent of such corpo ration who willfully and knowingly authorized, ordered, or carried out such violation, failure, or refusal is subject to the same civil penalties, fines, and confinement in jail to which a person may be subject under subsections A and E. G. Whoever kno wingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification, or knowingly fails to make any required statement, representation, or certification, in any application, objection, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be mainta ined pursuant to this chapter, any regulation adopted hereunder, or any order or decision issued by the Director under this chapter shall upon conviction be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, by confinement in jail for not more than 12 months, or both. H. Any operato r who within the period permitted for the correction of such violation fails to correct a violation for which a notice or order has been issued shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than $750 for each day during which such failure or violation oc curs. Such period for the correction of a violation shall not end until the entry of (i) a final order by the Director, in the case of any review proceedings initiated by the operator wherein the Director orders, after an expedited hearing, the suspensio n of the abatement requirements of the notice or order after determining that the operator is likely to suffer irreparable loss or damage from the application of such requirements or (ii) an order of the court, in the case of any review proceedings initi ated by the operator wherein the court orders the suspension of the abatement requirements.

Plaintiffs request for injunctive relief was not properly before court.  Where plaintiffs asked the court to require the defendant to comply with the terms of the notice of violation, since plaintiffs did not give written notice to the secretary and director before bringing suit, plaintiffs request for injunctive relief based upon the Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act was not properly before the court time and was dismissed; however, plaintiffs were not prec luded from taking further action to perfect their claim under subdivision A1. Ball v. Island Creek Coal Co., 722 F. Supp. 1370, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12133 (W.D. Va. 1989).

The Directo r shall take all reasonable actions to obtain written consent from the owner or owners of record of the land or property to be entered onto to perform an inspection for purposes of reclamation or for conducting studies or exploratory work pertaining to t he need for and feasibility of reclamation, prior to such entry. B. The provisi ons of subsection C shall apply if the Director, pursuant to an approved state program, makes findings of fact that: 1. Land or water resources have been adversely affected by past coal mining practices; 2. The adverse effects are significant enough that, in the public interest, action to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent such effects should be taken; and 3. The owners of the land or water resources where entry will be made to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past coal mining practices (i) are not known o r readily available or (ii) will not give permission for the Director or his agents, employees, or contractors to enter upon such property to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects of past coal mining practices. C. Upon making the findings of fact required by subsection B and giving notice by certified mail to the owners if known or, if not known, by posting notice upon the premises and advertising once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or city in which the land lies, the Director, his agents, employees, or contractors shall have the right to enter upon the property adversely affected by past coal mining practices and any other property to have access to such property to do all things necessary or expedient to restore, reclaim, abate, control, or prevent the adverse effects. Such entry shall be construed as an exercise of the police power for the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare and shall not be construed as an act of condemnation o f property or trespass thereon. The moneys expended for such work and the benefits accruing to any such premises so entered upon shall be chargeable against such land to the extent provided in § 45.2-1036 and shall mitigate or offset any claim in or a ny action brought by any owner of any interest in such premises for any alleged damages by virtue of such entry. Such provision regarding the mitigation or offsetting of a claim or action by an owner is not intended to create new rights of action or elim inate the existing sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth and its agents and employees. D. The Directo r and his agents, employees, or contractors shall have the right to enter upon any property for the purpose of conducting studies or exploratory work to determine the existence of adverse effects of past coal mining practices and to determine the feasibi lity of restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of such adverse effects. Such entry shall be construed as an exercise of the police power for the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare and shall not be construed as a n act of condemnation of property or trespass thereon. E. The Directo r, pursuant to an approved state program, may acquire title in the name of the Commonwealth to any land or interest therein by purchase, donation, or condemnation, if such land or interest is adversely affected by past coal mining practices, after approv al of the Secretary and upon determinations that acquisition of such land is necessary for successful reclamation and that: 1. The a cquired land, after restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices, will serve recreational, historical, conservation, or reclamation purposes or provide open space benefits; and 2. Either (a) permanent facilities, such as a treatment plant or a relocated stream channel, will be constructed on the land for the restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or preve ntion of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices or (b) acquisition of coal refuse disposal sites and all coal refuse thereon will serve the purposes of this article or that public ownership is desirable to meet emergency situations and prevent recurrences of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices. F. The price p aid for land acquired under this section shall reflect the market value of the land as adversely affected by past coal mining practices. G. The Directo r, with the approval of the Secretary, and in accordance with the State Reclamation Plan, may: 1. Trans fer the administrative responsibility for land acquired under this section to any state, regional, or local agency, department, or institution, with or without cost, upon terms that will ensure that the use of the land is consistent with the authorizatio n under which the land was acquired; 2. Sell land acquired under this section that is suitable for industrial, commercial, residential, or recreational development, by public sale under a system of competitive bidding, at no t less than fair market value and under regulations adopted to ensure that such lands are put to proper use consistent with local, state, or federal land use plans, if any, for the area in which the land is located; and 3. Transfer land acquired under this section to the United States to be reclaimed by the Secretary. After such reclamation is completed, any state, regional, or local agency, department, or institution may purchase such land from the Secretary for governmental, educational, recreational, historical, open-space, or other public purpose upon such terms as the Secretary requires. H. Prior to th e disposition of any land acquired under this section, the Director, pursuant to the State Reclamation Plan, when requested and after appropriate public notice, shall hold a public hearing in the county or city or counties or cities where the land is loc ated. The hearing shall be held at a time that shall afford local citizens and governments the maximum opportunity to participate in the decision concerning the use or disposition of the lands after restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or preven tion of the adverse effects of past coal mining practices. I. The Directo r may authorize the use, pending disposition, of land acquired under this section for any lawful purpose that is not inconsistent with the reclamation and post-reclamation uses for which the land was acquired. The Director shall charge any user of the la nd a reasonable use fee that shall go toward the purpose of operating and maintaining improvement of the land, and any excess thereof shall be deposited in the State Reclamation Fund. The Director may waive the fee if the Director finds in writing that a waiver is in the public interest. J.

CASE NOTES Warrantless searches of mines.  Because warrantless inspections of plaintiffs mines by defendant state inspectors were constitutional, since the state had a substantial interest in protectin g worker health and safety and the scope of any inspections did not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment, plaintiff mining company failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 and state law. The inspectors actions were authorized by Virginias Mineral Mine Safety Act, § 45.1-161.292:1 et seq., and Chapters 14.5 (§ 45.1-151.293 et seq.) and 14.6 (§ 45.1-161.304 et seq.) of Title 45.1, and the inspectors were entitled to qualified immunity.

Because subsection B of § 45.1-161.292:54 informed appellant mine operator that inspections to which he was subject were not discretionary acts but were conduc ted pursuant to statute, it satisfied the Burger test requiring a constitutionally adequate substitute fo r a warrant, and the argument that appellee inspectors conduct violated the Fourth Amendment also failed, because the searches under subsection B of § 45.1-161.292:54 were responses to objectively supported multiple complaints and there was no ind ication that they were a pretext for harassment or other improper conduct.

Wheth er the drilling unit or drilling location is above or in close proximity to any mine opening or shaft, entry, travel way, airway, haulageway, drainageway, or passageway, or to any proposed extension thereof, in any operated or abandoned or operating coal mine or in any coal mine already surveyed and platted but not yet being operated; 2.

Whether the proposed well can be drilled safely or the proposed coalbed methane gas well can be stimulated safely, taking into consideration the dangers from creeps, squeezes, or other disturbances due to the extraction of coal; and 4. The extent to which the proposed drilling unit or drilling location or stimulation of the coalbed methane gas well unreasonably interferes with the safe recovery of coal, gas, or oil. C. The followi ng questions with respect to the drilling unit or drilling location of a new well or stimulation of a new coalbed methane gas well shall also be considered: 1. The e xtent to which the proposed drilling unit or drilling location or coalbed methane gas well stimulation will unreasonably interfere with present or future coal mining operations; 2. The feasibility of moving the proposed drilling unit or drilling location to a mined-out area, an area below the coal outcrop, or some other area; 3. The feasibility of a drilling moratorium for not more than two years in order to permit the completion of coal mining operations; 4. The methods proposed for the recovery of coal and gas; 5. The practicality of locating the unit or the well on a uniform pattern with other units or wells; 6. The surface topography and use; and 7.

In order to prevent the waste of gas or oil or the drilling of unnecessary wells or to protect correlative rights, the Board on its own motion or upon application of the gas or oil owner may establish or modify drilling units. Drilling units, to the extent reasonab ly possible, shall be of uniform shape and size for an entire pool. Any gas, oil, or royalty owner may apply to the Board for the establishment of field rules and the creation of drilling units for the field. Unless such motion is made or an application is received at least 30 days prior to the next regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the Board, it shall not be heard by the Board at such meeting and shall be heard at the next meeting of the Board thereafter. B. At any hear ing of the Board regarding the establishment or modification of drilling units, the Board shall make the following determinations: 1. Wheth er the proposed drilling unit is an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of a gas or oil owners right to explore for or produce gas or oil; 2. Whether the proposal would unreasonably interfere with the present or future mining of coal or other minerals; 3. The acreage to be included in the order; 4. The acreage to be embraced within each drilling unit and its shape; 5. The area within which wells may be drilled on each unit; and 6. The allowable production of each well. C. In establis hing or modifying a drilling unit for coalbed methane gas wells, and in order to accommodate the unique characteristics of coalbed methane development, the Board shall require that drilling units conform to the mine development plan, if any. If requested by the coal operator, well spacing shall correspond with mine operations, including the drilling of multiple coalbed methane gas wells on each drilling unit. D. If an order to establish or modify a drilling unit will allow a well to be drilled into or through a coal seam, any coal owner within the area to be covered by the drilling unit may object to the establishment of the drilling unit. Upon a coal owners objection, and without superseding, impairing, abridging, or affecting any contractual rights or obligations existing between coal and gas owners, the Board shall make its determination in accordance with the provisions of §§ 45.2-1611 and 45.2-1612. E. The Board m ay continue a hearing to its next meeting to allow for further investigation and the gathering and taking of additional data and evidence. If at the time of a hearing there is not sufficient evidence for the Board to determine field boundaries, drilling unit size or shape, or allowable production, the Board may enter a temporary order establishing provisional drilling units, field boundaries, and allowable production for the orderly development of the pool pending receipt of the information necessary to determine the ultimate pool boundaries, spacing of wells for the pool, and allowable production. Upon additional findings of fact, the boundaries of a pool, drilling units for the pool, and allowable production may be modified by the Board. F. Unless othe rwise provided for by the Board, after an application for a hearing to establish or modify drilling units or pool boundaries has been filed, no additional well shall be permitted in the pool until the Boards order establishing or modifying the pool o r units has been entered. G. After the B oard issues a field or pool spacing order that creates drilling units or a pattern of drilling units for a pool, if a gas or oil owner applies for a permit or otherwise indicates his desire to drill a well outside of such drilling units or pattern of dri lling units and thereby potentially extend the pool, the Board may, on its own motion or the motion of any interested person, require that the well be located and drilled in compliance with the provisions of the order affecting the pool.

The Board, upon application from any gas or oil owner, shall enter an order pooling all interests in a drilling unit for the development and operation thereof when: 1. Two o r more separately owned tracts are embraced in a drilling unit; 2. There are separately owned interests in all or part of any such drilling unit and those owners having interests have not agreed to pool their interests; or 3.

B. Subject to any contrary provision contained in a gas or oil lease regarding the property, gas or oil operations incident to the drilling of a well on any portion of a unit covered by a pooling order shall be deemed to be the conduct of such operations on each tract in the unit. The portion of production allocated to any tract covered by a pooling order shall be in the same proportion as the acreage of that tract bears to the total acreage of the unit. C.

Require that any nonleasing gas or oil owner be provided with reasonable access to unit records submitted to the Director or Inspector; 7. Establish a procedure for a gas or oil owner who received notice of the hearing but does not decide to become a participating operator to elect to (i) sell or lease his gas or oil owne rship to a participating operator, (ii) enter into a voluntary agreement to share in the operation of the well at a rate of payment mutually agreed to by the gas or oil owner and the gas or oil operator authorized to drill the well, or (iii) share in the operation of the well as a nonparticipating operator on a carried basis after the proceeds allocable to his share equal the following: a. In the case of a leased tract, 300 percent of the share of such costs allocable to his interest; or b. In the case of an unleased tract, 200 percent of the share of such costs allocable to his interest. D. Any gas or oil owner whose identity and location remain unknown at the conclusion of a hearing concerning the establishment of a pooling order for which public notice was given shall be deemed to have elected to lease his interest to the gas or oil operator at a ra te to be established by the Board. The Board shall cause to be established an escrow account into which the unknown lessors share of proceeds shall be paid and held for his benefit. Such escrowed proceeds shall be deemed to be unclaimed property and shall be disposed of pursuant to the provisions of the Virginia Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act (§ 55.1-2500 et seq.). Upon discovery of the identity and location of any unknown owner of an interest that is subject to escrow under the provisions of this subsection and is not subject to conflicting claims of ownership, the designated operator shall, within 30 days, file with the Board a petition for disbursement of funds to be considered at the next available hearing. The petition shall include a detailed accounting of all funds deposited in escrow that are subject to the proposed disbursement. E. Any person who does not make an election under the pooling order shall be deemed to have leased his gas or oil interest to the gas or oil well operator as the pooling order provides. F. If a gas or oil owner is a person under a disability, the applicant for a pooling order may petition the appropriate circuit court to appoint a guardian ad litem pursuant to the provisions of § 8.01-261 for purposes of making the election provided for by this se ction. G. Any royalty or overriding royalty reserved in any lease that is deducted from a nonparticipating operators share of production shall not be subject to charges for operating costs but shall be separately calculated and paid to the royalty owner. H. The Board s hall resolve all disputes arising among gas or oil operators regarding the amount and reasonableness of well operation costs. The Board shall, by regulation, establish allowable types of costs that may be shared in pooled gas or oil operations.

LEXIS 45589 (W.D. Va. Mar. 31, 2012). Royalties.  Coal bed methane gas is not a constituent part of coal at any time but rather is a separate mineral estate, and in light of the 19th century understanding of the meaning of the word coal, there was no ambiguity as to the intentions of the parties to the severance deed; the surface owners had at all times owned all mineral estates within their lands except coal, and they were entitled to all royalties accrued from the production of coal bed methane therefrom and those yet to accrue. Swords Creek Land P'ship v. Belcher, 288 Va. 206, 762 S.E.2d 570, 2014 Va. LEXIS 116 (2014). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Compulsory pooling orders.  The Virginia Gas and Oil Board is authorized to issue compulsory pooling orders to deem that unleased interests are leased when gas owners fail to elect to partic ipate in the operation of the well. Furthermore, such action by the Board is a valid exercise of the Commonwealths police power. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clarence E. Bud Phillips, Member, House of Delegates, 09-023, 2 009 Va. AG LEXIS 27 (6/10/09). Absent an election by the owner, a Virginia Gas and Oil Board order that deems the interest of a gas owner leased to the unit operator does not constitute a takin g pursuant to Article I, § 11. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clarence E. Bud Phillips, Member, House of Delegates, 09-023, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 27 (6/10/09). The Virginia Gas and Oil Act is constitutional, and the Act and the Virginia Gas and Oil Board provide appropriate protection of the due process rights of gas own ers in the context of the compulsory pooling hearings and orders. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Clarence E. Bud Phillips, Member, House of Delegates, 09-023, 2009 Va. AG LEXIS 27 (6/10/09). The Virginia Gas and Oil Board may issue compulsory pooling orders that permit deduction of post-production costs downstream of the wellhead when computing gas ow ners one-eighth royalty interests.

The Board s hall enter an order requiring that the matter of disputed ownership be submitted to arbitration and notify the circuit court in the jurisdiction in which the majority of the subject tract is located (i) upon written request from all claimants to the owne rship of coalbed methane gas related to the subject tract under § 45.2-1622; (ii) upon receipt of an affidavit executed by all such claimants affirming that there is no other known surface owner, gas or oil owner, coal owner, mineral owner, or operato r of a gas storage field certificated by the State Corporation Commission having an interest underlying the subject tract; (iii) after a hearing noticed pursuant to subsection B of § 45.2-1618; and (iv) upon a determination by the Department whether s ufficient funds are available to pay the estimated costs of the arbitration pursuant to subsection F. Within 30 days of receipt of the notice from the Board, the circuit court shall appoint an attorney from the list maintained by the Department pursuant to subsection C or, at the discretion of the court, another attorney meeting the qualifications set forth in subsection C. Prior to his appointment as an arbitrator of a particular dispute, the attorney shall certify to the circuit court that he has not derived more than 10 percent of his income during any of the preceding three years from any (a) claimants asserting ownership or rights in the subject tract or (b) affiliated entities or immediate family members of such claimants. If the attorney cannot provide such certification, he shall notify the circuit court and he will be disqualified from serving as arbitrator for that particular dispute. B. The Departm ent shall send notice to all claimants if it determines that there are insufficient funds to pay the estimated costs of the arbitration pursuant to subsection F. The claimants may, by unanimous agreement, proceed with the arbitration process, notify the Board of such agreement, and bear the costs to the extent of the insufficiency. If the parties do not agree, the arbitration shall be delayed until such funds are available. C. To be quali fied as an arbitrator, a candidate shall (i) be an attorney licensed in the Commonwealth; (ii) have at least 10 years of experience in real estate law, including substantial expertise in mineral title examination; and (iii) disclose to the Board whether he has been engaged within the preceding three years by any person in a matter subject to the jurisdiction of the Board or the Department under this chapter. The Department shall solicit applications from attorneys meeting the qualifications set forth in this subsection and maintain a list of attorneys qualifying as arbitrators for use by the circuit courts. The Department shall update its list at least once annually. To maintain qualification, each attorney whose name appears on the list shall update a nnually his disclosures as set forth in clause (iii). D. The arbitra tor shall determine a time and place for the arbitration hearing and cause written notification of such hearing to be served on each surface owner, gas or oil owner, coal owner, mineral owner, or operator of a gas storage field certificated by the State Corporation Commission having an interest underlying the tract that is the subject of the hearing. Parties shall be served personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, not less than 14 days before the hearing. Appearance at the hearing waiv es such partys right to challenge notice. Any party to the arbitration has the right to representation before the arbitrator pursuant to § 8.01-581.05. In accordance with § 8.01-581.06, the arbitrator may issue subpoenas for the attendance of w itnesses and for the production of books, records, documents, and other evidence; administer oaths; and, upon application by a party to the arbitration, permit the taking of depositions for use as evidence. The arbitrator shall hear and determine the con troversy upon the evidence and consistent with applicable law, notwithstanding the failure of a party to appear at the hearing. E. The arbitra tor shall issue his determination as to the ownership in the coalbed methane gas and entitlement to proceeds held in escrow within six months from the order of the Board requiring the matter be submitted to arbitration, unless a longer period is otherwis e agreed to by all parties. Such determination shall be in writing and sent to the Board and to each party to whom notice is required to be given under subsection D. F. Upon the is suance of the arbitrators determination of ownership and subject to the availability of funds, the fees and expenses of the arbitration, but not including fees or costs of counsel engaged by the respective claimants or any other costs of the claimant s, shall be paid from the accrued interest on general escrow account funds. G. An arbitrat ors determination rendered pursuant to subsection E shall be binding upon the parties, and upon request of any party to the arbitration such determination may be entered as the judgment of the circuit court responsible for appointing the arbitrator u nder subsection A.

For a coalb ed methane gas well that was force-pooled prior to July 1, 2015, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall, on or before January 1, 2016, apply to the Board for the release of the funds in escrow and give written notice of such application to every con flicting claimant identified in the pooling orders, or to the successor of such claimant where the successor is known to the coalbed methane gas well operator or has identified himself to the coalbed methane gas well operator or the Board. Such notice sh all be in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 45.2-1618 and, if any unknown person or unlocatable conflicting claimant is subject to escrow, such notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties where the drilling unit is located once each week for four successive weeks. The application shall include a detailed accounting in accordance with subdivision B 5 of § 45.2-1622. The Board shall order payment of the principal and accrued interest, l ess escrow account fees, held in escrow, along with all future royalties attributable to the drilling unit, to each gas claimant identified in the pooling order unless, within 45 days of the coalbed methane gas well operators notice of its applicatio n, the coal claimant provides the Board and the coalbed methane gas well operator with evidence of a proceeding or agreement. The Board, pursuant to its authority granted by § 45.2-1614, may extend the time for filing the application and delay the pay ment of funds for a gas title conflict, the existence of an unknown gas claimant, the existence of an unlocatable gas claimant, an unresolved gas heirship issue, or any other reason beyond the reasonable control of the coalbed methane gas well operator a nd shall not order payment if the gas claimant fails to provide the Board with information needed under applicable law or regulation to distribute the funds. B. For a coalb ed methane gas well force-pooled on or after July 1, 2015, the Board, in its pooling order, shall direct the coalbed methane gas well operator to pay royalties to the gas claimant unless the coal claimant provides the coalbed methane gas well operator an d the Board with evidence of a proceeding or agreement not later than the time and place of the pooling hearing. The coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide written notice of the hearing to every gas claimant and coal claimant in accordance with § 45.2-1618. However, the Board, pursuant to its authority granted by § 45.2-1614, shall not order the coalbed methane gas well operator to make payment to a gas claimant if there exists any gas title conflict, unknown gas claimant, unlocatable gas claimant, unresolved gas heirship issue, or other reason beyond the reasonable control of the coalbed methane gas well operator or if the gas claimant fails to provide the coalbed methane gas well operator with the information required under applicable law or regulation to pay royalties. If the Board so declines to order payment to be made to a gas claimant, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide each affected gas claimant and the Board with written notice of the reason payment is not requ ired to be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 45.2-1618. If payment is not required to be made due to the gas claimants failure to provide needed information under applicable law or regulation, the notice shall identify the inf ormation that is needed to enable the payment to be made. C. For a coalb ed methane gas well voluntarily pooled at any time, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall pay royalties, including past royalties held, to each gas claimant unless, within 45 days of the coalbed methane gas well operators provision of written n otice to the coal claimant that the operator will be paying royalties to the gas claimants, the coal claimant provides the coalbed methane gas well operator and each gas claimant with evidence of a proceeding or agreement. For any unit voluntarily pooled before July 1, 2015, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide such written notice to each gas claimant and coal claimant on or before January 1, 2016. For any unit voluntarily pooled on or after July 1, 2015, the coalbed methane gas well oper ator shall provide such written notice to each gas claimant and coal claimant not later than 45 days after production commences. However, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall not be required to make payment to a gas claimant if there exists any ga s title conflict, unknown gas claimant, unlocatable gas claimant, unresolved gas heirship issue, or other reason beyond the reasonable control of the coalbed methane gas well operator or if the gas claimant fails to provide the coalbed methane gas well o perator with information to process or pay royalties. If the Board so declines to order payment to be made to a gas claimant, the coalbed methane gas well operator shall provide each affected gas claimant with written notice of the reason payment is not required to be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 45.2-1618. If payment is not required to be made due to a gas claimants failure to provide needed information, the notice shall identify the information that is needed to enable the payment to be made. D. Any pending judicial or arbitration proceeding shall be pursued by the coal claimant with diligence and shall not be voluntarily dismissed or nonsuited without the consent of the gas claimant. No default judgment shall be entered against a gas claimant in such proc eeding. Royalties shall be paid as determined by the final order in the proceeding. A prevailing gas claimant may recover from the nonprevailing coal claimant reasonable costs and attorney fees if such gas claimant substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the coal claimants position is not substantially justified.

Any contrac ting entity may enter into an energy performance-based contract with an energy performance contractor to significantly reduce (i) energy costs to a level established by the public body or (ii) operating costs of a facility through one or more energy cons ervation or operational efficiency measures. For the purposes of this article, energy conservation or operational efficiency measures shall not include roof replacement projects, except as provided in subdivision B 2. B. 1. The energy performance contractor shall be selected through competitive sealed biddi ng or competitive negotiation as set forth in § 2.2-4302.1 or 2.2-4302.2. The evaluation of the request for proposals shall analyze the estimates of all costs of installation, maintenance, repairs, debt service, post-installation project monitoring, a nd reporting. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any contracting entity may purchase energy conservation or operational efficiency measures under an energy performance-based contract entered into by another contracting entity pursuant to this ar ticle even if it did not participate in the request for proposals if the request for proposals specified that the procurement was being conducted on behalf of other contracting entities. 2. A contracting entity may procure a roof replacement as part of a larger energy conservation or operational efficiency measure, including solar, where the replacement is necessary for t he installation of such measure. Such contracting entity may also procure a roof replacement pursuant to § 2.2-4302.1 when the original contract for the energy conservation or operational efficiency measure, including solar, does not include a roof re placement and the contracting entity determines that the replacement of more than 20 percent of the roof is necessary for the installation of such measure. Such roof replacements procured separately from a larger energy conservation or operational effici ency measure, including solar, shall also be publicly noticed on the Department of General Services central electronic procurement website. All roof replacement projects procured separately pursuant to this subdivision shall be designed by a licensed architect or professional engineer. C. Before ente ring into a contract for energy conservation measures, the contracting entity shall require the performance contractor to provide a payment and performance bond relating to the installation of energy conservation measures in an amount the contracting ent ity finds reasonable and necessary to protect its interests. D. Prior to th e design and installation of any energy conservation measures, the contracting entity shall obtain from the energy performance contractor a report disclosing all costs associated with such energy conservation measures and providing an estimate of the amo unt of the energy cost savings. After reviewing the report, the contracting entity may enter into an energy performance-based contract if it finds (i) the amount the entity would spend on the energy conservation measures recommended in the report will no t exceed the amount to be saved in energy and operation costs more than 20 years from the date of installation, based on life-cycle costing calculations, if the recommendations in the report were followed and (ii) the energy performance contractor provid es a written guarantee that the energy and operating cost savings will meet or exceed the costs of the system. The contract may provide for payments over a period not to exceed 20 years. E. The term of any energy performance-based contract shall expire at the end of each fiscal year but may be renewed annually for up to 20 years, subject to the contracting entity making sufficient annual appropriations based upon continued realized cost savings. Such contract shall stipulate that the agreement does not constitute a debt, liability, or obligation of the contracting entity, or a pledge of the faith and credit of the contracting entity. Such contract may also provide capital contributions for the purcha se and installation of energy conservation measures that cannot be totally funded by the energy and operational savings. F. An energy p erformance-based contract shall include the following provisions: 1. A gua rantee by the energy performance contractor that annual energy and operational cost savings will meet or exceed the amortized cost of energy conservation measures. The guaranteed energy savings contract shall include a written guarantee of the qualified provider that either the energy savings or operational cost savings, or both, will meet or exceed within 20 years the costs of the energy and operational savings measures. The qualified provider shall reimburse the contracting entity for any shortfall of guaranteed energy savings projected in the contract. 2. A requirement that the energy performance contractor to whom the contract is awarded provide a 100 percent performance guarantee bond to the contracting entity for the installation and faithful performance of the installed energy savings measures as outlined in the contract document. 3. A requirement that the energy performance contractor provide to the contracting entity an annual reconciliation of the guaranteed energy cost savings. The energy performance contractor shall be liable for any annual savings shortfall that may occur. G. The Departm ent shall make a reasonable effort, as long as workload permits, to: 1. Provi de general advice, upon request, to local governments considering pursuit of an energy performance-based contract pursuant to this article; and 2. Annually compile a list of performance-based contracts entered into by local governments of which the Department becomes aware.

Pursuant to § 30-152, the repeal has been given effect of the recodified title by repealing this section. § 45.2-1706.1. Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy. Text A. The Commonw ealth recognizes that effectively addressing climate change and enhancing resilience will advance the health, welfare, and safety of the residents of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth further recognizes that addressing climate change requires reducing g reenhouse gas emissions across the Commonwealths economy sufficient to reach net-zero emission by 2045 in all sectors, including the electric power, transportation, industrial, agricultural, building, and infrastructure sectors. To achieve these obje ctives, it shall be the policy of the Commonwealth to: 1. Devel op energy resources necessary to produce 30 percent of Virginias electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030 and 100 percent of Virginias electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040; 2. Enable widespread integration of distributed energy resources, including energy storage and rooftop solar, into the grid to achieve decarbonization and to enhance resilience; 3. Support the distributed generation of renewable electricity by: a. Encouraging private sector investments in distributed renewable energy; b. Increasing the security of the electricity grid by supporting distributed renewable energy projects and energy storage with the potential to supply electric energy to critical fac ilities during a widespread power outage; and c. Enhancing the ability of private property owners to generate their own renewable energy for their own personal use from renewable energy sources on their property; 4. Lead by example in state government by supporting the carbon-free energy resources required to fully decarbonize the electric power supply of the Commonwealth, including deploying 30 p ercent renewables by 2030, realizing 100 percent carbon-free electric power by 2040, and achieving net zero emissions by 2045; 5. Maximize energy efficiency programs as defined in § 56-576, to the extent determined to be in the public interest, that are the lowest-cost energy option to reduce greenhouse gas em issions, in order to produce electricity cost savings and to create jobs and economic opportunity from the energy efficiency sector; 6. Support net-zero emission targets by promoting zero-emission vehicles and infrastructure, including electrified transport, decreasing the carbon intensity of the transportation sector, encouraging alternative transportation options, and increasing the efficiency of motor vehicles operating on Virginias roads; 7. Support electric distribution grid transformation projects as defined in § 56-576; 8. Promote building and construction practices that reduce emissions associated with built environment, including energy efficiency targets, new building standards, and transit-oriented a nd other sustainable development practices; and 9. Ensure that energy development projects avoid, minimize, and, if necessary, mitigate damage to the Commonwealths natural and cultural resources. B. The Commonw ealth recognizes the need to promote environmental justice and ensure that it is carried out throughout the Commonwealth, as provided in § 2.2-235, and the need to address and prevent energy inequities in historically economically disadvantaged commun ities, as defined in § 56-576. To achieve these objectives, it shall be the policy of the Commonwealth to: 1. Recog nize the disproportionate and inequitable impacts of climate change on historically economically disadvantaged communities and prioritize solutions and investment in these communities to maximize the benefits of clean energy and minimize the burdens of c limate change; 2. Ensure the fair treatment and meaningful involvement, as those terms are defined in § 2.2-234, of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, faith, disability, or income with respect to the administration of energy laws, regulations, and policies; and 3. Increase access to clean energy and the benefits from clean energy to historically economically disadvantaged communities. C. As Virginia transforms its energy economy, the Commonwealth must continue to prioritize economic competiveness and workforce development in an equitable manner. To achieve this objective, it shall be the policy of the Commonwealth to: 1. Equit ably incorporate requirements for technical, policy, and economic analyses and assessments that recognize the unique attributes of different energy resources and delivery systems to identify pathways to net-zero carbon that maximize Virginias energy reliability and resilience, economic development, and jobs; 2. Require that pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions be determined on the basis of technical, policy, and economic analysis to maximize their effectiveness, optimize Virginia s economic development, support industrial employment, and create quality jobs while minimizing adverse impacts on public health, affected communities, and the environment; 3. Ensure an adequate energy supply and a Virginia-based energy production capacity, while also optimizing intrastate and interstate use of energy supply and delivery to maximize energy a vailability, reliability, and price opportunities to the benefit of all user classes and the Commonwealths economy; 4. Increase wind energy development and grow the Commonwealths role as a wind industry hub for offshore wind generation projects in state and federal waters off the United States coas t; 5. Ensure the availability of reliable energy at costs that are reasonable and in quantities that will support the Commonwealths economy; 6. Ensure reliable energy availability in the event of a disruption occurring to a portion of the Commonwealths energy matrix and to address the needs of businesses during the transit ion to clean energy; 7. Minimize the Commonwealths long-term exposure to volatility and increases in world energy prices by expanding the use of innovative clean energy technology within the Commonwealth; 8. Create training opportunities and green career pathways for local workers and workers in historically economically disadvantaged communities in onshore and offshore wind, solar energy, electrification, energy efficiency, clean transportation, and other emerging clean energy industries; 9. Support the repurposing and development of clean energy resources on previously developed project sites as defined in § 56-576; 10. Ensure that decision making is transparent and includes opportunities for full participation by the public; 11. Explore approaches to maximizing and leveraging the capacity of lands and waters in the Commonwealth to store energy; and 12. Increase the Commonwealths reliance on and production of sustainably produced biofuels made from traditional agricultural crops and other feedstocks, such as winter cover crops, warm season grasses, fast-growing trees, algae, or other suitable feedstocks grown in the Commonwealth, that will (i) create jobs and income, (ii) produce clean-burning fuels that will help to improve air quality, and (iii) provide the new markets for V irginias silvicultural and agricultural products needed to preserve farm employment, conserve farmland and forestland, and increase implementation of silvicultural and agricultural best management practices to protect water quality. D. The element s of the policy set forth in subsections A, B, and C shall be referred to collectively in this title as the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy. E. All agencie s and political subdivisions of the Commonwealth, in taking discretionary action with regard to energy issues, shall recognize the elements of the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy and, where appropriate, shall act in a manner consistent therewith. F. The Commonw ealth Clean Energy Policy is intended to provide guidance to the agencies and political subdivisions of the Commonwealth in taking discretionary action with regard to energy issues and shall not be construed to amend, repeal, or override any contrary pro vision of applicable law. Nothing in this section shall preclude reliable access to electricity and natural gas during the transition to renewable energy. The failure or refusal of any person to recognize the elements of the Commonwealth Clean Energy Pol icy, to act in a manner consistent with the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy, or to take any other action whatsoever shall not create any right, action, or cause of action or provide standing for any person to challenge the action of the Commonwealth or any of its agencies or political subdivisions.

For either a wind energy facility or a solar energy facility, the scoring system shall address the parcels proximity to electric power transmission lines or systems, potential impacts of such a facility to natural and historic resources and to economically disadvantaged or minority communities, and compatibility with the local land use plan. The system devel oped pursuant to this section shall allow the suitability of the parcel for the siting of a wind energy or solar energy facility to be compared to the suitability of other parcels so scored, and shall be based on a scale that allows the suitability of th e parcel for the siting of such a facility to be measured against the hypothetical score of an ideal location for such a facility. E. Upon receip t by the Division of a recommendation from the Department of General Services, a local governing body, or the parcels owner stating that a parcel of real property is a potentially suitable location for a wind energy facility or solar energy facility, the Division shall analyze the suitability of the parcel for the location of such a facility. In conducting its analysis, the Division shall ascribe a numerical score to the parcel using the scoring system developed pursuant to subsection D.

The Divisio n shall complete the Plan. B. Prior to th e completion of the Plan and each update thereof, the Division shall present drafts to, and consult with, the Virginia Coal and Energy Commission established pursuant to Chapter 25 (§ 30-188 et seq.) of Title 30 and the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation established pursuant to Chapter 31 (§ 30-201 et seq.) of Title 30. C. The Plan sh all be updated by the Division and submitted as provided in § 45.2-1713 by October 1, 2014, and every fourth October 1 thereafter. In addition, the Division shall provide interim updates on the Plan by October 1 of the third year of each Governors administration. Updated reports shall specify any progress attained toward each proposed action of the Plan, as well as reassess goals for energy conservation on the basis of progress to date in meeting the goals in the previous Plan and lessons learned from attempts to meet such goals. D. Beginning w ith the Plan update in 2014, the Division shall include a section setting forth energy policy positions relevant to any potential regulations proposed or promulgated by the State Air Pollution Control Board to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units under § 111(d) of the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7411(d). In such section of the Plan, the Division shall address policy options for establishing separate standards of performance pursuant to § 111(d) of the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7411(d), for carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units to promote the Plans overall goal of fuel diversity as follows: 1. The P lan shall address policy options for establishing the standards of performance for existing coal-fired electric generating units, including the following factors: a. The most suitable system of emission reduction that (i) takes into consideration (a) the cost and benefit of achieving such reduction, (b) any non-air quality health and environmental impacts, and (c) the energy requirements of the Commonwealth and (ii) has been adequately demonstrated for coal-fired electric generating units that are subject to the standard of performance; b. Reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide that can be achieved through measures reasonably undertaken at each coal-fired electric generating unit; and c. Increased efficiencies and other measures that can be implemented at each coal-fired electric generating unit to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the unit without converting f rom coal to other fuels, co-firing other fuels with coal, or limiting the utilization of the unit. 2. The Plan shall also address policy options for establishing the standards of performance for existing gas-fired electric generating units, including the following factors: a. The application of the criteria specified in subdivisions 1 a and b to natural gas-fired electric generating units instead of to coal-fired electric generating units; and b. Increased efficiencies and other measures that can be reasonably implemented at the unit to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the unit without switching from natural gas to oth er lower-carbon fuels or limiting the utilization of the unit. 3. The Plan shall examine policy options for state regulatory action to adopt less stringent standards or longer compliance schedules than those provided for in applicable federal rules o r guidelines based on analysis of the following: a. Consumer impacts, including any disproportionate impacts of energy price increases on lower-income populations; b. Unreasonable cost of reducing emissions resulting from plant age, location, or basic process design; c. Physical difficulties with or impossibility of implementing emission reduction measures; d. The absolute cost of applying the performance standard to the unit; e. The expected remaining useful life of the unit; f. The economic impacts of closing the unit, including expected job losses, if the unit is unable to comply with the performance standard; and g. Any other factors specific to the unit that make application of a less stringent standard or longer compliance schedule more reasonable. 4. The Plan shall identify options, to the maximum extent permissible, for any federally required regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generatin g units and regulatory mechanisms that provide flexibility in complying with such standards, including the averaging of emissions, emissions trading, or other alternative implementation measures that are determined to further the interests of the Commonw ealth and its citizens.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Rights to geothermal resources.  Rights to geothermal resources belong to the owner of the surface property unless specifically conveyed. They are not encompassed within mineral or water rights. Thus, a mineral or a water reservation does not reserve a geothermal resource, and a lease of oil, gas or some other mineral is not a lease of geothermal resources. The rights of the owner of a geothermal resource as related to the rights of owners of ot her property interests depend on the particular language of the instruments and all other relevant circumstances, as is the case generally in property law.

OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL A locality c urrently cannot regulate uranium mining.  A locality currently cannot regulate uranium mining in any fashion because uranium mining is not a permitted activity within the Commonwealth. Should the General Assembly act to permit and provide for the regulation of uranium mining, a localitys authority related to uranium mining will depend upon federal and state law in effect at that time, including the enabling legislation for uranium mining enacted by t he General Assembly.

CASE NOTES Federal preemption.  In a case addressing § 45.1-283 in which plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, preempted § 45.1-283 and d efendants moved to dismiss, the Atomic Energy Act did not preempt § 45.1-283, the Virginia statute did not intrude into any Atomic Energy Act field; plaintiffs misread 42 U.S.C.S. § 2021(k). Va. Uranium, Inc. v. McAuliffe, 147 F. Supp. 3d 462, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161197 (W.D. Va. 2015), aff'd, 848 F.3d 590, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 2822 (4th Cir. 2017). State law banning conventional uranium mining was not preempted by federal law since regulating such mining was not an activity to protect against radiation hazar ds, and thus was not in any way regulated by the federal government outside of federal lands. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 848 F.3d 590, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 2822 (4th Cir. 2017), aff'd, 139 S. Ct. 1894, 204 L. Ed. 2d 377, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4177 (2019). Ban on conventional uranium mining was not preempted by the federal regulation of uranium milling and tailings storage since the ban did not mention uranium milli ng or tailings storage and, in view of the ban, there was no purpose in constructing a mill and tailings-management complex in the state and transporting out-of-state uranium ore into the state. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 848 F.3d 590, 2017 U.S. App. L EXIS 2822 (4th Cir. 2017), aff'd, 139 S. Ct. 1894, 204 L. Ed. 2d 377, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4177 (2019). Federal preemption did not apply to the states ban on conventional uranium mining since the federal objectives in regulating the safety of radiation hazards w as not materially affected by the state ban. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Warren, 848 F.3d 590, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 2822 (4th Cir. 2017), aff'd, 139 S. Ct. 1894, 204 L. Ed. 2d 377, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4177 (2019). CIRCUIT COURT OPINIONS Constitutionality.  Application of § 45.1-283 damaged the landowners property within the meaning of Va. Const. art. 1, § 11, as it directly affected their ability to exerci se their ownership and leasehold interest rights in a uranium deposit, and that affection caused a depreciation of the mineral estates value. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. Cir. 421, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Wise County July 30, 2020). Section 45.1-283 affected a regulatory taking of the landowners property as the temporary moratorium precluded their ability to mine their mineral interest. V a. Uranium, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. Cir. 421, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Wise County July 30, 2020). Section 45.1-283 did not affect a total taking of the landowners mineral estate where the mining moratorium did no more than duplicate the result that could h ave been achieved under Virginia nuisance law. Va. Uranium, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. Cir. 421, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Wise County July 30, 2020). Landowners were not entitled to an order declaring § 45.1-283 unconstitutional and enjoining the Commonwealth from complying with the statute because a morator ium on uranium mining, an inherently dangerous activity with potentially dangerous indirect effects, achieved the Commonwealths rightful duty to protect the public from injury and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry. Va. Urani um, Inc. v. Commonwealth, 105 Va. Cir. 421, 2020 Va. Cir. LEXIS 147 (Wise County July 30, 2020). OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Enactment of laws.  The Constitution of Virginia must be amended prior to the enactment of any bill that would require a super majority vote to lift the moratorium on uranium mining. See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Danny W. Marshall, III, Member, House of Delegates, 10-021, 2010 Va. AG LEXIS 14 (3/31/10). A locality c urrently cannot regulate uranium mining.  A locality currently cannot regulate uranium mining in any fashion because uranium mining is not a permitted activity within the Commonwealth. Should the General Assembly act to permit and provide for the regulation of uranium mining, a localitys authority related to uranium mining will depend upon federal and state law in effect at that time, including the enabling legislation for uranium mining enacted by t he General Assembly.
